* No basic QoL features like rally points, move+attack command or even unit stats (there're none, you need to check the wiki)
* None of the default zoom levels present the game in a 1:1 perfect pixel ratio so either deal with the scaling artifacts/uneven pixels or install a mod. They're just sabotaging their own art.
* The AI is almost braindead. Enemy soldiers love to jog around the tiberium, scratching their harvester basically alerts all their units on the map and they can't deal with sandbags.

The early C&C games are obviously one of the grandfathers of the RTS genre. The innovations brought forth by the two games and the excellent AddOns laid the foundation on which modern RTS are built.

....[b]HOWEVER[/b]
The one thing that I really can't deal with (anymore?) is delayed unit action.
When I have a group of units selected and order them to attack a nearby enemy unit, I want any unit that is in range to fire *now*.
Instead, units will walk a few steps further and then start shooting. Some of the selected units will just stop and look around while their mates die.

Also, when I order units to attack a target that is outside their range, I want them to enter the maximum possible range and then attack; not walk right f*cking next to the target and then start doing their job.
This is especially frustrating with grenadiers, who have an area of effect that affects friendly units just like enemy ones.

Imagine you have a squad of 10 grenadiers and order them to attack an incoming squad of enemy rifleman.
Some of your units will properly follow your instructions and throw their grenades when in range.
Some of your units will just not agree with your order and stay where they are.
Some of your units will half-arsed walk a little bit towards the enemy and stop.
[b]Most[/b] of your units will go maximum retard and crawl within groping-range of the enemy and throw their grenades onto themselves.

I've gotten so used to the modern (StarCraft-ish) style of controlling units, where your commands instantly take effect on your units.

36,76398108,english,"Command & Conquer tells a story of two opposing forces in an alternate timeline fighting for control of various territories and a new but scarcely researched mineral – Tiberium. Its campaign offers two completely distinct narratives, which encourages at least one playthrough with each faction. Each mission is supported by video clips that were filmed in Westwood’s very own studios, making the briefings very fun to watch, even 25 years after the game’s initial release.

Campaign missions stay fresh throughout the game due to their variability, giving you different tasks each time. However, when the mission requires you to defeat all enemy forces, it does mean ALL of them. That means that you will sometimes roam the map looking for stragglers or well-hidden enemy buildings in order to extinguish the very last of them, making you waste anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes in the process.

Gameplay has since been established as standard for RTS, various buildings giving you access to stronger units which in turn cost more Tiberium to build. Combat in C&C is challenging not only due to the horrible unit pathing, but also because getting the right unit match-ups in a battle can decide who comes out on top, so it’s always a bit of a jockeying for position, making the whole procedure very engaging.

Not only for its legendary video clips should you have encountered Command & Conquer at least once in your life if you’re a fan of real-time strategy, it is also an eye-opener in regard to classic strategic gameplay – Showing us what didn’t work, and what worked surprisingly well for such a pioneer of the genre.

_

Command & Conquer: Red Alert follows up on the original with slightly enhanced gameplay, keeping the core of the game very much intact. And yes, including the still horrible unit pathing. The two new playable factions (Allies & Soviets) represent a much more classic conflict, fought with units and weapons in large part already established in the previous installment. The best new addition were the Soviet airfields, which provided uses beyond simply restocking ammo for bombers, such as the well-implemented spy plane, which was very useful, but didn’t feel like it broke the game or anything.

An audacious story that takes itself seriously at just the right rate catapulted the narrative for the two new campaigns beyond my expectations set by the first part. The iconic video skits thankfully persisted, and the acting improved quite a bit along the way. Especially worth pointing out is the actor who played Stalin – Gene Dynarski – For his truly spectacular performance.

A very worthy successor to the first C&C, Red Alert sticks to the essence of what made the series so popular in the early days. It almost can’t be said enough that units were still quite deficient in many ways, making the player put an inordinate emphasis on micro-management. But now that we did say it, we should also again praise the game for its daring and quirky story, its ability to keep a campaign fresh throughout, and ultimately, its incredible pioneering in the RTS space.

This is a fantastic remaster. Whilst playing I'd often hit the spacebar to marvel at the differences. The soundtrack is incredible. The cutscenes are quite endearing and feel appropriately dated. The team really knocked it out of the park there.

The actual game itself is very APM-heavy, with a brutal difficulty curve and a tendency to throw missions at you that rely on learning the maps through trial and error. The ability to build up truly impressive swarms might entertain some. The ability to squash infantry with your tanks might entertain others.

Not only it is slow, and I mean, it takes MINUTES to load on a system with SSD, 32GB of ram, and a overclocked I7 processor, they REMOVED functionalities from the original version, and on top of that, you need to use keyboard modifiers to post EVERY. SINGLE. TILE., and half the time you need to scroll through the entire unfilterable list again because for some unknown reason the editor goes back to the top of the list, and, to finish this 'marvelous experience' there is a 2-3 seconds lag delay AFTER EACH TILE, now imagine how pleasant this is on a  256x256 tile map, if you edit half the map that is 'only' a 30 hours delay.

I love playing Skirmish Mode for the original C&C for instance and feel that alone adds a lot or replay value that it didn't have at the time.  You can also build multiple units at a time rather than one at a time.  This is similar to RA2.  I also notice that the AI is also somewhat smarter than the original even on the same relative difficulty level in Skirmish.  Not good or bad, but just different enough.  While the new 3D visuals and cutscenes don't change the gameplay much, they are nice additions.  You also get all the expansion features as well as a ton of bonus material.  All in all, it's still fun to play and I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed any of the originals.

Even so, there are still a few criticisms I have...

1.  No zoom out feature.  As far as I can tell, there is only one fixed zoom view of the battlefield.  I know that this is basically the view you got in the DOS VGA version so technically it is faithful to the original version, but having played the later Windows ports that worked at other resolutions and could change the zoom level based on what you chose, I used to play at 800x600 and grew very comfortable with it.  I wish there was an option to set this in the remaster.  It was one of the perks of updating to the Windows version at the time so I wish it was included in the remaster as well.

2.  Sidebar view options.  While I do like the new tabbed icons and am getting used to it, it would be nice to add an alternate view option.  Maybe a ""classic"" menu mode for those that like the old untabbed style.",1601168317,1601168553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197965124876,133,1,61,0,61,1595125540

51,70349974,english,"It can not be overstated how important Westwood Studios and the original [b]Command & Conquer[/b] games were. They're a massive milestone for gaming and the RTS genre as a whole. When I initially heard that there was a remaster on the horizon, it would be the first time I've truly looked forward to a game release since [b]Red Alert 2[/b], I'm happy to say that it's not a disappointment. The nostalgia is wonderful, launching the game for the first time and hearing Hell March and Act on Instinct again is amazing.

The [b]Command & Conquer Remastered Collection[/b] adds some vital quality of life improvements over the original games, something as simple as unit queuing and separate tabs for units and structures being introduced to these games after 25 years alone makes them so much more fun and less frustrating to play than going back to the originals after all this time, other minor things like Harvesters and Ore Trucks automatically harvesting once being built, being able to zoom in and out (though being able to zoom out just a little further would be nice), bindable hotkeys and mission select screens are also good examples of small but huge improvements. The ability to toggle between remastered and legacy graphics is a really nice touch as well. 

The base games are included along with all of their expansion packs, including missions and extras that were exclusive to more obscure and console versions of the game. There are hundreds of hours of entertainment here for an incredibly low asking price, the addition of bonus content, a new map editor and achievements even sweetens the deal.

One of the real treasures to be found here is the music. Frank Klepacki is back and as prominent a force as ever! The remastered tracks all sound great and the addition of some bonus tracks only sweeten the deal, including some alternate variations of tracks from other C&C games including [b]Tiberian Sun[/b] and [b]Red Alert 2[/b] (Brain Freeze, my all time favourite!). The Jukebox, while clunky, allows you to customise the music that plays too so you can select out your favourites, ranging from the untouched classics, remasters and bonuses [i](I never have to listen to 'C&C Thang' ever again, another point awarded to the remastered collection)[/i].

While the remaster adds several and important quality of life changes, it should always be kept in mind that these games are still a product of their time in many ways, and not always in what can be considered the good way. The AI is the main problem here, it has been stated over the course of development that the AI would be their ""white whale"" and many things would be unchanged to certain extent to maintain the experience that the original games provided. I can appreciate that, but Ore Miners and Harvesters driving 500 Miles into enemy territory for no reason and units disobeying commands from time to time is more frustrating than ever in this day and age when games like [b]Red Alert 2[/b] did it so much better (Tiberian Sun still had a long way to go), the pathfinding has just never felt right in the classic games and, unfortunately, the problem persists here. [b]Tiberian Dawn[/b] has also maintained only being able to construct buildings right next to each other, which I know is there to maintain the feeling of the legacy title, but it would be nice to have the option to be able to space them out like in [b]Red Alert[/b].

All in all, I love this, but bear in mind that remastered or otherwise, they are still products of their time. If you like [b]Command & Conquer[/b], you'll have absolutely no reason to not like this. They have done a fantastic job and have listened to the community throughout the whole development cycle. Show them where the money is and with any luck we will get [b]Tiberian Sun Remastered[/b] next! We would love [b]Red Alert 2[/b] too, of course, but that game still stands on it's own two feet incredibly well to this day.",1591387481,1601164781,True,5,0,0.5625,0,True,False,False,76561198038624313,643,98,5212,0,5212,1600278492

The remastered music is also excellent and the melodic icing on the cake. 
Let’s not pretend this game isn’t struggling, because it struggles so hard. Most of these problems don't have much to do with the remaster, which was handled beautifully, they were just always there.
Path finding is still a frustrating mess and probably the worst enemy in the game, but it always was. Units run into each other, block each other and take the most awkward routes possible, usually back tracking several times. 
Harvesters circle around aimlessly while you're desperately waiting for some crucial funds, even if you're telling them to drop off, and sometimes go right through the enemy base to get themselves destroyed. This problem intensifies greatly if you build any harvesters through the war factory that do not have their own dedicated refineries.
Your units will stand around when enemies are in range and do nothing, sometimes even when being shot at. They will always target the most inappropriate enemy unit unless told otherwise, and if given an order will always move to within range of enemy weapons to shoot, even if they were already in range before. That is, if they don't just completely ignore it, which they do constantly. You'll have a group of units selected, give them a command, and then watch only half of them follow through)  This also results in your own units shooting each other, especially if you give an attack ground command.
The enemy AI simply cheats uncontrollably and pulls some magical unicorn shit like you couldn't believe, resulting in extreme and unnecessary anger.
Besides that, it’s Command & Conquer and it’s a classic. 
Even if it is a mess.

You'll see a lot of stupid negative reviews that honestly don't make much sense such as: ""The AI hasn't changed at all"", ""Not much was changed"", ""Wait until it's cheaper for the price you get it at like $4.99"", or ""Bad Multiplayer!""

Well guess what, who cares? It's an old classic that was remastered because it didn't run on Windows 10 PC's unless you emulated it or modded it.  Additionally, people actually asked for the AI not to change, so if you're going to blame the developers, don't.  Blame the community instead for that one, the AI in the Original Command and Conquer will always be difficult to people who find it difficult (Or aren't used to the Command & Conquer Franchise).  Also why wait for a cheaper price?  $19.99 is VERY reasonable considering you get 2 BASE GAMES, 5 Game Extensions, AND a Jukebox which wasn't a thing before!  That's a VERY FAIR price all things considered.  And additionally, they fixed the multiplayer issues to some extent (Generally speaking the multiplayer wasn't that great when it first came out, but it was fixed quickly!), making it more enjoyable and considering they have an open modding community, it's more than the community could ever ask!

This game, is an epitome of how Remasters should go, not by remastering the game and changing very little just so it'll run on newer systems *COUGH* *Starcraft* *COUGH*, but instead actually making the game better as well as adding new features!  Lastly, all things considered I believe the community can agree that Petroglyph Games is the new Westwood 2.0 considering what happened to Westwood previously.  And in my best opinion as well as many others, EA has probably turned over a new leaf.  They've actually been doing great things recently with Command & Conquer (Other than that mobile game...) as well as the fact they've started extending their games to Steam!  Honestly in my opinion, EA deserves a second chance all things considered with the route they're going through now.

TL;DR: EA deserves a second chance based off of recent events, as well as the Negative part of the community aren't truly understanding of the game and what it entitles to hold as well as barely any ability to properly analyze the game and understand it.  (The negative reviews are most likely newer people who joined the C&C community, I've been playing this on PS3 (For the PS make of Red Alert) and PC for 15 years.

[i] I'm reviewing this game as a neutral Strategy game player who isn't a dedicated C&C fan and instead wanted to try something new from playing games like Factorio, Anno, Rusted Warfare etc. Hence I'm not looking at this game as a remaster against it's original self, and instead as a standalone game competing against aforementioned titles.

[b] Avoid this if you like basebuilding, long-term strategising, macro-management; you will find the Campaign frustratingly repetitive, the skirmish boring and the whole game lacking depth.

Go for it if you like unit arrangements, close-ground strategising, micro-management; you may find enjoyment in the repeated, constant rearranging of your ceaselessly outnumbered forces as you aim to fulfil some asinine objectives. [/b]

It's got nice aesthetics, it's a brilliant remaster no doubt, but a shit game. Constant faff with units to try and stop them dying even when you have 20 infantry units vs 1 grenadier prick, all your infantry are dead unless you incessantly fuck around telling them where to go and what to shoot, which they'll ignore and then all get simultaneously run over by a tank. You bring in a 5 tanks and their 1 heli appears out of nowhere and fucks them all off, then kills any other units as they run back and forth getting perforated by the airborne suffering. The helis sprint straight to your base now that you're a bit fucked, you try to bring in anti-air and the bullshit-heli will miraculously destroy all SAM's and deck all your units anyway. You finally sort this chaos out, and focus on building a decent base, then realise all your units are wiped out because while you were building they were getting shot from 1 tile out of range and they decided to be target practice [b] because they won't do anything unless you specifically and constantly tell them to. [/b] Then you're whole base get's obliterated by the grenadier that decked all your infanteers but he's now brought his pals, you can't make any units to stop the destruction because your unarmed, useless harvester which you depend on for ALL YOUR MONEY has travelled HALF WAY ACROSS THE MAP and is parked braindead on a 1 unit wide bridge, face to face with the enemy humvee shooting the fuck out of it.

Editing to elaborate a little with 2 examples:
1. I sent a V2 rocket launcher truck to attack an enemy turret (for those not familiar with the units, the V2 is like a mobile long-range artillery unit, and a turret is a stationery defensive building). Instead of stopping once the turret was in the V2's range (and out of the turret's range), the V2 kept driving right up to being super close to the turret (and thereby in the turret's range) and getting destroyed by the turret.
2. I sent a submarine back to the sub pen to be repaired, and at the same time sent a submarine that was just built up to the front line. Several minutes later I find them blocking each other about half way between the sub pen the front line, head-to-head, instead of one of them just going around in the vast open water to the side so that they could both proceed.

I played them all through the 90's.

The games still have the same AI and pathing issues they did during the original releases. Maybe it's just me expecting more from the products these corporations are shelling out, but for the amount of money they make these days, would it really be that hard of fixing the issue of a ranged unit running head into an enemy combatant when you've clearly commanded it to attack them? Artillery driving up to point blank to shoot an infantryman because you did't click multiple times in various squares until it finally reacts correctly is not fun.

It's definitely worth the full price, already for this massive amount of singleplayer content.

Pros:
[list]
[*]You get two full games with all addons and bonus missions for both games.

[*]The legendary soundtrack is also remastered, with many new bonus tracks and a great customizable jukebox. Includes also all unchanged original tracks.

[*]Mod support (Steam Workshop). Thats really nice, so many cool mods, look for them.

[*]No Origin client needed

[*]Still in active development, for example with the latest surprise to add a LAN mode in the second major patch. Really nice, thanks to the devs.

[*]The spacebar baby, maybe the most important key :D great idea to integrate it in this simple form. With the spacebar you can switch ingame live at any time between the old original and new 4k graphics

[*]Chooseable classic and modern rts settings in the options

[*]Bonusgallery to unlock with many videos, pictures and a few new bonus songs for the jukebox
[/list]

Cons:
For me personally nothing.

But i can understand those who criticizes the pathfinding AI (pathfinding of death xD) and stackable units. But remember that all of that was already part of the original games, so it's not really a bug or negative thing of this remaster, it's more a original feature. And it doesn't make the games unplayable. Above all you always have the possibility to use mods from the Workshop to change these things.

All in all this remaster is great as it is. I'm glad that it's not a remake and as original as possible, with the whole atmosphere, just new 4k graphics, many gimmicks and bonus things. It should be excatly like this :)

And finally a wish from me: i miss the C&C part ""Sole Survivor"" a little bit. Don't leave it behind. I think it should be part of this remaster in form of a chooseable multiplayer mode. I know its not popular (at least in the past), but its a part of C&Cs history and can be fun though. Give it a new chance in this remaster.

In that sense a famous and wise quote: why is that still running?! :D

Both games are completely remastered, from cutscenes to the game itself. You even have the option to change between original and new graphics at the stroke of a key!

The first game I tried out was Red Alert and it's easily the most fun of the two games, but maybe I am a bit biased as I have never played C&C95. All of the DLC maps are included and there's even a secret set of Ant missions.

I played C&C95 second, and I found the game to be enjoyable but some things were noticable that bothered me. The game seemed to run a lot slower than RA and the campaign missions were more simplified and the maps smaller. Despite all of this, I found it interesting to play through it and compare it to RA.

Overall, highly recommended. Here's hoping for a Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge in the future.",1599997899,1599997899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198257374012,97,28,3097,94,2613,1601423591

Cons:
-Wayfinding is still broken. You don't have to have broken way finding to be true to the game. Laziness on the devs part not to include pathfinding. If it breaks the campaign, fine, leave it out. But at least put pathfinding as an option you can turn on in any other game mode

-Enemy AI get stuck by blocking their exits or harvester

-Map editor has no instructions. Wouldn't be that hard for them to put an instruction manual together

-Even if the modding community fixes the game, mods do not work for online games

-bugs galore

-process of saving a game is horrible. If you need to save multiple times during a mission, there is no option to overwrite a save

-
-If you have an internet outage while playing offline, you will be kicked out of the game

-Restarting an offline skirmish resulted in some annoying changes to the game settings that i had to quit to the menu and re-setup the game again

-If you subscribe to maps on the workshop, it does not show them in the game. You have to look those maps in the game search engine and subscribe to them their to use them

Pros:
-jukebox
-Graphics are the best thing about this
-mods
-online

Yes, this is a ""remaster"" and not a ""remake."" But this is not what I'd view as a good remaster. However you feel about this game, it's still an unpolished, buggy game. Actually, I'd say in some ways, it's worse than the original. This game would get bad reviews if people were not buying it for nostalgia.

Now I know there are die hard fans who prefer it to look exactly the same as the original, just higher resolution, but I'm not one of them (and I loved the game when it came out). I think it was a big mistake not to make the game in 3D, and present it as a 2D game - ie, it would play the same as the original, like a 2D game, but you'd get all the benefits of it being in a 3D engine, like lighting, animation, effects, reflections, detailed building explosions, vehicle damage etc. If this had come out 10 years ago, then I would say fair enough, because 3D graphics probably couldn't have done it justice back then. But in 2020, the 3D graphics can be crystal clear and maintain the look of C&C, while adding more depth to the graphics.

There just isn't enough improvement over the original IMO. Its mostly just sharper... I mean its ok, its better than the original, but that's just it, its 'OK', its not amazing or exciting really.

Some people will argue that its a remaster, not a remake. In that case, if that's what remasters are, then IMO it's borderline a waste of time. Just bring the graphics up to 2020 standards and keep the gameplay the same, that's all I ask, if you can't do that I rather you not bother.

The majority of my time has been spent with the Tiberian Dawn section of the remaster however I have played both games and thoroughly enjoyed my time with both of them.

The campaign missions still hold up extremely well and are quite difficult (you can verify this by the number of people who have full campaign/covert opts/hard mode achievements unlocked). it's also worth noting the inclusion of some console exclusive missions on this remaster which were mind blowingly fun to play for the first time after all these years! 

There is also a lot of neat unlockable bonus content - very funny seeing some goofy green screen antics of the staff.

The online community, while relatively small, is very welcoming and always up for giving feedback and tips through Discord/Twitch/in-game chat. It's fantastic to see people try to re-imagine the online multiplayer aspects of a game that's almost 25 years old. Also worth shouting out both GameReplays and the United Forum for hosting multiple tournaments on the remaster helping breathe healthy competition within the community.

While the online side of things isn't perfect, I believe EA & Petroglyph are trying to use their available resources as best they can by engaging with the community council and soliciting feedback from the community to try make it an ideal gaming experience. The online leaderboard and replay/observation functionality is great to have - not perfect but adding such features to a remaster are much loved quality of life improvements by the community.

- Still has the same limited resource issues as the original.
- Still has the same terrible interface that takes up a full third of the screen (and there is no way to get rid of this).
- Basic path-finding is still awful. Assign your tanks to kill a turret right next to them, and they'll drive completely around the map to get to it.
- Still have to build structures next to one another, so have fun building those sandbags.
- Unit AI is atrocious (seriously, I can't count the number of times my units have just decided to go through an enemy base, despite my trying to position them somewhere completely different), which makes the ""tactics"" in the game non-existent.
- Cutscenes, even completely CG ones, are still super low-res, so the superficiality didn't extend to them.

Don't even bother thinking about things like way-points or formations (even having something as simple as way-points would have made a huge difference in whether my harvester does its job or decides by itself to go on a suicide run).

The heart of the game is still the same as it was when it came out, which was already antiquated then.

With that out of the way there are a few important modern features missing.

Easy to add:
1) Production rally points and the possibility of way-points in move orders are really missing. - EDIT: You can make way-points for your units with Q.
2) You can queue production of units (thank god), but you cannot queue production of buildings. Albeit less important it would still be nice to have (especially when building walls).

Might require more thought:
3) Attack-move is missing. I understand attack-move breaks the game because of certain units that are not balanced with this feature in mind.

They've worked hard to improve the looks and they've stayed entirely faithful to the original. There's no disbuting that this is a perfect remaster.
However, the problem lies in that the mechanics of this very old game. Unit pathing is miserably stupid and it becomes even worse when on missions where you have a limited amount of units on the mission, requiring an amount of micro play ( the control of individual units) that's frankly absurd to casual player. Though that's not all, because even if you do micro well, the unit pathing is gonna screw you over as units fight for space and in which order to move, meaning you will lose them anyway.
Friendly fire makes this even more miserable, as a unit such as the flamethrower is so detrimental and dangerous to your own units that you shouldn't even have them in the game. See when they die, they explode, heavily injuring the other infantry around them in a BIG explosion. But not only that, but their flame attacks will ALSO damage any friendly infantry that's next to them or in front of them.
This extends to many other units with explosive attacks.

On top of all this, during such missions and well any other mission for that matter, the AI makes pinpoint, perfect choices of what to attack. And if you've got infantry in your army, well, they're gonna get fucking run over my tanks. Want them to move out of the way? Hah good luck, the pathing will prevent it. But the AI will perfectly micro every single unit out of the way of YOUR tanks whilst also perfectly focusing your most vulnerable units.

While a wonderful remaster, which has clearly been a passion project with the effort they put into it, the mechanics and technical sides of the game are the same, not incorporating two decades of progress made to RTS games.

As for AI, i'd say they cleaned it up a little bit, and as usual of command and conquer games the higher you set the enemy, the more challenging they are.

22,70462797,english,"I'm enjoying this as a die-hard C&C fanboy but for everyone else you need to know what you are getting into before you buy.

For 20$ you get a very faithful remaster of the original C&C Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert 1. Two classic old RTS games with all of their expansion packs and extra content from the console missions. There are some QOL improvements (E.G being able to queue up units and tabs organizing build types and abilities) but NOTHING that changes the base game’s logic, so pathfinding is still screwy and some balance is still a little odd. Multiplayer is currently facing some issues and they had to push back LAN support due to the ‘rona, but these should be fixed in upcoming patches.

For those of you who are unfamiliar, Command and Conquer is a long-running RTS series developed first by Westwood and then EA Los Angeles and then Victory Games (before they were all shut down by EA) that at it’s peak was just as influential as Warcraft and Age of Empires, in fact Ensemble and Blizzard took heavy inspiration Westwood’s earlier project, Dune 2, so in a sense you are playing the son of the Great Grandaddy of all RTS games. The plots tend to be B-Movie-esque with FMV cutscenes that despite the cheese is surprisingly not cringey at all (Well not until Red Alert 3, or C&C 4: Other M).

As for it’s faithfulness, it is a blessing and a curse. The Curse part is self evident, you still have a lot of jank and bugs from the originals Most notably, Pathfinding and some questionable balance decisions with Tib Dawn. They don't break the game and wasn't a major issue personally but it can make some things frustrating if you aren't willing to work through some of it (or wait for a mod to fix it). Caveat Emptor. 

The blessing part needs a bit of context, as it’s not just nostalgia despite RA1 being my first C&C. RTS campaign missions are often designed like a puzzle where you have an objective and a limited amount of resources to achieve it. Disrupt that balance and you potentially break the design. This has happened before with C&C 3, what was a solid, well balanced campaign was broken by balance patches, making some missions downright infuriating (Croatia anyone?). Still some QOL would have been appreciated (Crush move from RA3, Attack Move, ect). It helps that for an RTS it’s deceptively simple so there really isn't too much to wrap your head around.

So how did they do for the actual “Remaster”?

The Graphics they nailed, first off by giving a MCC style toggle between old and new. The new graphics look excellent, riding a fine line between old school “3D models to 2D sprites” that was in fashion around the time, to adding enough details that enhance the look of a building without fundamentally changing how it looks (as well as remaining faithful to the CG art). Environment art also has been greatly improved. Performance is buttery smooth for me the whole way through with reasonable load times.

Most impressively, they were able to get their hands on most of the Live action footage, which was thought to be lost when EA LA closed down, and were able to upscale it from a grainy 640x480 at about 15 fps to an upscaled 30 FPS. (With some exceptions, but that was due to technical reasons with the source vids they had, if you want the whole story here’s Project Lead Jim Vasella going over it)

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikJLYYTrIxs

The Remastered Soundtrack is solid, some songs fare much better than the originals, and the ones that don’t are still solid compositions worth listening to. The best stuff IMHO is actually the new compositions by Frank Klepecki and the Tiberian Sons which are mostly remakes of classic C&C tracks.

As for extras They recovered a bunch of B-roll footage and you can unlock those, You have an expanded Jukebox so if you never ever ever want to hear “C&C thang” (and quite frankly I dont blame you) you can do that with a custom playlist, and finally Mods, based off of the now Open Source C&C Remastered DLL’s, with included Steam Workshop support.

So I think EA/Petroglyph/Lemon Sky did an excellent job for the scope they were given! I wont fault you if you turn away from the old jank but as a C&C fanboy who hasn’t seen a good game since RA3 back in 2008, this is a very welcome addition to the franchise.

I remember this game from years ago, I always liked it, was a bit concerned of a remaster by E.A. as I am not a fan of E.A. due to their past actions shall we say, won't go into a rant but... just kidding. Thankfully I was presently surprised to see this remaster was a a very good price! and there was no loot boxes or pish like that in it as far as I know anyway. Also, I have had tons of fun playing it! Its as good as I remember, if not better in some ways!

I have not paid much attention to the new features, I know of a sound playlist thing and the graphics update, I don't know of much else but don't care, the game was cheap and great fun. A billion nostalgia points too!

I read it has been deemed a success too, I can see why. Well done E.A. on this one, credit where credit is due.

The game play is fun, I noticed playing against the computer on normal is easy for me, maybe because its one from my past. I noticed something in my news feed that commented the ""sand bag exploit"" is still in because the A.I. is so good.... what and what? I never did the sand bag exploit and never had trouble with the A.I. I did some further reading and realised A.I. actually stands for Artificial Idiocracy in this game. I noticed especially in Red Alert, The computer was just dumb. ""suicidal overconfidence"" really made me laugh. flame thrower troops just marching into my cammo pill boxes over and over again. This adds to the fun!

The bankruptcy exploit as it is called is something I unknowingly did often thinking it was a good tactic. It was a bit of common sense to me to cut of an enemy's cash flow to stop troop production so you can walk in and take the base. The problem is it is too easy to do.

Comparing the original C&C to red alert, I believe the reduced power of engineers was a good thing. only being able to capture critically damaged buildings makes it more difficult as it should be. in C&C being able to capture a tiberium refinery with a harvester in it, getting both and the tiberium with one little engineer was WAY to over powered. in Red alert it is not only harder to capture ore refineries as they need to be damaged, you can't capture the ore truck too now. Also, I do not know is this is new, in a bankrupt base, when you critically damage a building the A.I. tends to sell it, get a little cash, and stop you getting an easy capture. Overall, I believe Red Alert Engineers and capturing mechanics are far more balanced than in the original C&C.

I really love these games, best money I spent in ages. again, Very well done to the developers on this one and I hope it is a sign of things to come from E.A.

And much more stuff, especially multiplayer stuff.

Oh and the soundtrack, including the original tracks, remastered tracks, and unreleased tracks! Play Red Alert tracks in Tiberian Dawn if you wanted. All the Hell March tracks still the best imo.

I don't know of a better way to properly remaster a game like how these two games have been remastered. A proper remaster to the classic RTS games Command & Conquer (Tiberian Dawn) and Red Alert. Highly recommend!

As a 90s kid who grew up with these games in their initial releases, this is how I always saw them; the 4K upscale is just bringing it up to modern standards of how it always looked to me. And to be sure the visuals are one of the highlights of this package - being able to swap new for old graphics with a single button press at any time is one of my personal favorite aspects of a remake, to go from thinking it's pretty much the same as I remember it to seeing exactly how low-fidelity it really was way back when.

The gameplay is more or less as I remembered, although I admit I did have to turn it down to ""Casual"" difficulty to enjoy playing through at the breezy pace I was used to from back when I had the patience for this sort of game. I am a ""turtle"" player, happily building my base and stockpiling my units until I'm ready to rush, so the preponderance of missions in which you only have a limited set of vehicles and infantry to work with (barring the occasional reinforcements, with no real chance of laying down infrastructure) was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to rediscover. But still, I beat these maps years ago, I must be able to beat them again today... Right?

Lastly, in defense of the FMV cutscenes. Later C&C games realized that everyone was making fun of them and leaned into the cheese factor, but these first two games have a genuine earnestness that I really appreciate.

23,74498525,english,"tl;dr
Pros: It's more or less exactly like it was in 1995.
Cons: It's more or less exactly like it was in 1995.

At its core, C&C:R is still a rock solid game, because C&C is the template from which basically all RTS games have sprung from. Sure, there were some older RTS games that came first, but C&C was the first ""big one."" The game is painfully '90s, and if you played Tiberian Dawn or Red Alert as a kid, all that cheesy FMV goodness is still there, as is EVA, whose voice actor was actually tracked down 25 years after her debut to re-record her lines for Tiberian Dawn. Frank Klepacki also remastered the soundtrack and then left the original ""low-fi beats to command and conquer to"" in as well, though the game defaults to the new versions. There's also some new recordings courtesy of The Tiberian Suns, and even some cameos from later games (Blow It Up and Brain Freeze from RA2/Yuri's Revenge caught me off-guard). The expansions and their content are there too, including the console-only missions from C&C64 and the Red Alert Retaliation soundtracks from PSX, if that's your thing (Retaliation was my entry point to the series, so I appreciate it). Even the secret dino and giant ant missions made it in!

However, while there's some solid QOL improvements like unit queueing, skirmish for Tiberian Dawn, and minor balance changes such as the recent patch that nerfed Engineer rushes in TibDawn, the game is definitely showing its age. Many later genre-standard QOL developments such as attack-move commands, waypoints, and rally points are absent, though mods exist for some. Harvester AI is atrocious, and while it is apparently getting addressed, it'll likely never be ""good,"" because if it gets there then it won't feel like C&C/RA anymore - it'll feel like TibSun or RA2. Units will frequently just not do what you tell them to due to primitive pathfinding, requiring multiple clicks for them to attack or move, which can be an instant failure if say, you're trying to get Tanya to shoot a charging attack dog. Defensive AI is also weak, with many instances of enemy tanks rolling right past anything that's not a defensive structure without taking a bullet despite being in range, or, on the flip side, V2 rockets deciding they need to press their bumper up against a turret they easily outrange. Sometimes the jank works in your favor, such as the old sandbag trick making late-game TibDawn missions tolerable, but more often than not it'll make you miss the later C&C of your choice. 

Mission design can border on masochistic in the main campaigns, to the point where you may find yourself digging up decades-old strategy guides just to proceed and saving often as a buffer against bad luck/AI anyway. One good example is the final Allied mission in Red Alert, where you can absolutely fail the mission in the first 5 seconds if you're not already prepared for the ""surprise."" You can see where Westwood started to get a grip on how to design fun-but-fair RTS missions when you hit Red Alert Counterstrike/Aftermath, which, despite being expansions, feel much more manageable, difficulty-wise.

Do I still recommend it? Sure, but with caveats. Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert are cornerstones of the genre, true classics in every sense of the word, and this remaster handles them with the care and respect they deserve. However, the games are still products of their time, and it plainly shows when compared to other RTS games, especially the evergreen Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2. If you go in with this in mind, you'll be able to have a good time. (Protip: hold Alt and click enemy infantry to make your tanks run them over.)

For those of you who grew up with these games, they may not have the sheen you remember, but it's very much still the same game we all sank hundreds of hours into as kids and teenagers way back in the dialup era. If you're like me, it'll also make you hope Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 get the same treatment, and soon.

[i]From the moment I heard EVA's monotone voice again, it all started to flood back. What a great duology of games! Quite simply, this is the most definitive remaster of a classic I have played to date. The attention to detail, the wealth of additional content & the tastefully done modernisation keeps it authentic for the retro gamers (flaws & all) while also making it more accessible for modern gamers. Very impressive accomplishment![/i]


+ No Origin DRM!
+ Remastered graphics, interface & sound effects are spot on. Remastered music thumps out the speakers!
+ Some minor modernisation, such as swapping mouse buttons, are blended well to original design.
+ Enormous amount of content for the asking price. Exceptional value proposition.
+ Masterfully designed maps & missions, offering a serious ol' school challenge.
+ Collectables worth collecting, I actually wanted to check out the Bonus Gallery rewards after each successful mission.
+ Full Mod support is great for the longevity, adds variation & really rounds out the feature set.
+ Onboarding intro sequence on first startup brought a smile ear-to-ear. Well done!
+ Some secret hidden levels to discover :)

- Game mechanics are fairly simplistic by modern standards. Takes some adjusting.
- Love the flaws? Authentic to the original, so the 90's unit pathing/movement can be VERY frustrating!
- Remastered AI/pathing toggle would be a most welcome addition.
- Casual gamers may find the game too hard & unforgiving. No easy 100%ers here!
- It is amazing what was done to bring the FMV quality up to higher resolutions, but unfortunately still shows its age considerably.

I currently have 50+ hours on these and still have room to fill more as i have Soviets campaign on Red Alert to go, for £18, it's a bargain!

The remaster is nicely done, it's not a graphics overhaul, it keeps the same ""art style"" as the original whilst putting the units and buildings into a modern clean resolution, no more small weird pixely units. 
Same for buildings, though i always had a soft spot for Red Alerts old art style anyways. 

The game is tough, really tough. It will takes some practise and you will likely fail some missions possibly a few times, but when you win, you will celebrate that win all the more. The cutscenes are so-so, they have upscaled them but this leaves them looking a bit stretched but the audio is fine, the visual from my knowledge have reason for this but i forget why but it is a legit one. 

There are a few quirks here and there, as others said, pathways finding is a bit awkward, rally points for buildings aren't present and a few other quality of life things are missing but do these ruin the game? Nope, not at all. These i think have been left this way to recreate the ""old"" feel of the game.
Now i wasn't alive (or maybe was a baby?) when this was out back in the day but have been a big C&C fan my whole life, and this feels legit a great game. 

Also considering EA helms the ship, it goes to show when left in the right hands, even they can do a good job. 
I just hope to see RA2 and Tiberium Sun... Generals would be a blessing on the remake side but i wont hold my hopes too high.

71,72522884,english,"I got it for the nostalgia.

This is the first RTS I've played in my life. Introduced to me by one of my best childhood friend. I also recall him providing a software on a (or two) floppy disk(s) which allowed one to create dinosaurs that shot lasers. Sure it breaks the immersion, but I just felt it was fun as a kid, and it's something which I remembered.

Back then I was playing it on a low-end Windows 3.11 PC, and it ran agonisingly slow. I never completed the game as I had limited PC time and I wasn't a pro-gamer (still not). This time perhaps I'll be able complete the game, with the help of online guides if I cannot get through a mission on my own after some time.

Playing it again, I felt that the controls were not familiar as I've gotten used to Warcraft III/DotA-style controls. I also don't think that there's a 'stop' button, or a 'guard' waypoint function (AoE) and a few other stuff, but this is not a criticism, just a musing on much user-interface have developed in later games. This [b]is[/b] arguably the mother of all RTS, and if you think about it, the joy that it brought was not just to people who played CnC, but indirectly all later RTS and even MOBA.

Get it for nostalgia's sake if you want, or if you want to experience the game that ""originally defined and popularized the real-time strategy genre"" (quote from wikipedia).

---

Update after playing 86 hours:

I exclusively played the campaign mode, and at medium difficulty.

The user interface have been greatly improved. It's now possible to queue the building of units (not structures though) and there's also a ""select global offensive units"" shortcut.

Some bugs were fixed which made some Tiberian Dawn missions more difficult. For example, airstrikes no longer only target the top-most unit (according to some people it was coded this way due to CPU limitations in the past) so you cannot use an infantry as a cheap sacrificial piece, but trust me it is entirely possible to complete the GDI, NOD and Allied (non-expansion) campaigns (just started the Soviet campaign) as I could do it and I'm not good at RTS.

80,74272904,english,"Command & Conquer was the first RTS series I got into. I was initiated by way of CNC64 in 2002 or so, of all things. RA2 came next in 2003. I branched out from there, playing both the older titles and the new ones as they came out, while spending an unhealthy amount of time modding RA2 and TS. I still have a soft-spot for RA2 to this day.

So what about the Remaster? It's a blast of nostalgia. Painstakingly recreated graphics, an epic soundtrack, a more polished UI highlight an impressive return to the scene for one of the founders of the RTS genre. That isn't to say it is perfect, but it's pretty dang good.

GAMEPLAY
+ Enhanced sidebar, hotkeys and UI
+ Incredible possibilities with mods
+ Easy to access multiplayer
+ Largely unchanged from the originals
- Largely unchanged from the originals
- Mods require LAN/VPN to be played online
- Dedicated servers only
The Remastered Collection is a throwback to the old days of RTS. There are few changes to unit balance, gameplay mechanics, the AI, or pathfinding. Some modern convenience features have been added, like showing HP bars for damaged units, right-click functionality, hotkeys for production. Additionally, the sidebar was overhauled, with RA2-like categorized production tabs, making it far easier to find what you need. On top of this, _all_ of the singleplayer missions made for both games are available to play. If you're looking for the authentic experience with a bit of a modern touch-up, you're in luck.

This is a blessing and a curse though. The pathfinding is particular is nightmarishly bad, especially for your resource gatherers. Additionally, RA1 and TD's gameplay has not aged well in a multiplayer setting. Owing to the simple nature of the gameplay and a multitude of questionable design decisions, single unit army comps aren't unusual if you're playing seriously. For instance, the Allies in Red Alert can very much get away with building only Light Tanks on a land-locked map. You can find similar examples for the other 3 factions in these games... In short, the balance is terrible, both between and within the factions in both games. That isn't to say you can't enjoy yourself playing a more casual game with friends, though.

There is broad support for modding, with the source code being downloaded with the game. Right now, most of the mods are fairly mundane, but this will eventually change as people figure out what they can do with the engine. You can play mods online by using LAN mode and combining that with a VPN- standard online does not support modding.


GRAPHICS
+ Incredibly faithful reproductions of the original visuals
+ Smooth transition between old and new graphics
- Somewhat cartoony
- Some remap color mismatches? (evident during some missions)

Lemon Sky knocked it out of the park with the visuals for Remastered Collection. Instead of using the source materials and remastering from there (for instance, Medium Tank is shown to be an Abrams in cinematics, so the remastered graphic would be an Abrams), they opted to take the look of the original sprites and upscale them to 4K. And the results are amazing. Even the slightest details on structures and vehicles are blown up and made clear for the player to see, while infantry even retain their goofy animation sequences. This can create a somewhat cartoony appearance- for instance, the proportions of gun barrels to the tanks themselves is preserved, so every tank looks like its rocking a battleship gun, but is largely forgiveable. 

Cinematics were given the AI upscale treatment, removing scanlines and improving overall fidelity- this generally looks better on scenes with people in them as opposed to action shots, however. Oh, and huge props to CNC community member CCHyper for the remastered installation sequences- those set the tone absolutely perfectly.


SOUNDS
+ Full library of songs from both games, with improved audio quality
+ Additional remasters of songs from later titles in the series
+ Enhanced ingame audio
+ Jukebox allows you to configure what music you want to play
- Some SFX choices are weak

Frank Klepacki is back. Need I say more? Each game features their entire library of songs, with hours worth of music. Both high and low fidelity versions of each song are available, along with renditions of several tracks from the CNC series by Frank Klepacki's band, the Tiberian Sons. These are two of the best soundtracks you will find on an RTS, period.

Most of the sound effects aren't actually remastered, but cleaner, high quality audio samples that are similar to the originals. Most of these sounds are pretty good, though there are some exceptions- the cannon and rocket sounds of RA1 aren't that good, IMO...

I wept through the intro video but after the nostalgia shine wears off, the fleas of age have not been kind. Appreciate you keeping it ""real"" but a few more tweaks of the modern age would be good? 
Appreciating the age of the underlying engine might make it difficult but you had some great studios involved here.
If you were afraid of upsetting the purist, why not release the original game beside a proper remaster/total concept modification? I hope that is the plan.

-Clunky controls and unit selection

Because the game itself is the same, except for the graphics. So you will experience all the the classic mechanics with very similar feeling.
And that is also the main downside of this game. You can play this from nostalgia as I did. But I am already spoiled by games that came after this which had actually working pathfinding, somehow capable AI and additional modern functions.
As a former Diamond Starcraft2 player I am completely frustrated when I send my units somewhere and they are randomly moving around map or start moving the other way or running in circles. I don't mind that there is no A-move, which I was not used to untill SC2. But it is almost impossible to micro your units, resulting in unnecessary losses and uneffectivness. Defending units are not shooting approaching enemy until it is really close to them, so again, the same as with micro.
In the end I really appreciate the work done here. The graphics is very pretty, I think from the graphics side this is better way to do it than what they did with Starcraft Remastered. And I also understand why they kept the old mechanics. However I am still not sure if the nostalgia is worth the nerves you will experience.
Still recommend though, just to know how games were before. And also recommend due to the magnificient soundtrack!",1596972525,1596972525,True,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False,76561198074372625,186,23,1077,0,1077,1593016256

But the extended reissue, like few others, manages to preserve the style and atmosphere of the original despite the changes. And at the same time, there are no worse improvements. Additional material (collectables) give you also funny and interesting inside view on the game production.

This makes it a must for all players in the original who want to travel back in time. And for all RTS fans who want to see how the strategy genre was formed, too. Those who don't feel a penchant for nostalgia, on the other hand, should clearly let their fingers out.",1596967864,1596968158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006126462,55,10,751,0,296,1600014301
51,74020954,english,"The graphics is really better, also the sound is quite nice with the remastered music score from Frank Klepacki himself, he is the best musician for any Command and Conquer game title. The 4K AI upscaled videos are in the most parts okay, but no one should here expect wonders, but in some occassions and parts it looks quite good. 


But as long they can not use the original (VHS ?) camcorder tapes and recreate the CGI scenes upscaled it will be only Standard resolution SD TV output and with the compression of the original game video files (you still see compression artefacts and pixel vector block demosaicing issues) you can not really upgrade it into nice 4K videos, but again it is better than the wrongly upscaled VGA 640x480 pixel videos in the original CnC games, which had line interpolation/black lines, I know CnC.net mods had nice interpolation mode, but again that caused bad videos with lag in the lines and desynchronized deinterlacing issues in the video scenes, because the original videos were never meant to be to scaled up above 320 pixel resolution and even todays graphics card can not deinterlace and upscale old school videos properly, so playing CnC even in VGA 640x480 pixel in the story campaign is still as Win 95 instead of the original DOS version a pain in the a**, because the original CnC and CnC Red Alert were never meant to have video sequences with above 320 pixel resolution!

With the remastered game versions of CnC Tiberian Dawn and CnC Red Alert, you can really enjoy more or less the original game video sequences on the story campaings in higher resolution! Also the higher resolution of the units makes quite fun to watch. You get the original CnC feeling like in the childhood and past teenage years, but now in better graphic textures and resolution than ever. The tanks looks nice, the soldiers are now really looking like real toy soldiers with movable parts, instead of the old sluggish pixel look!

That is great! I can only recommend to play it!

So the Remastered Collection is absolutely worth the money also the story of Tiberian Dawn is somehow in the global context of our todays real world really as new and comparable to todays problems.

92,70370801,english,"I'm going to review single player and multiplayer separately as I think multiplayer needs a bit of improvement but overall C&C remastered is very good not perfect.

SINGLE PLAYER:

Cheesy cutscenes, great story line, overall fun and comedy with PROPER old skool RTS gameplay. This is C&C & Red Alert as you remember them but with new improved graphics, awesome remastered sound track and Steam workshop mods and content plus plenty of user made maps. The game plays like the original but feels modern. There are a few path finding issues and the AI needs to be on NOMRAL or HARD for challenge but this is to be expected from an old game. 

You can see that the true fan base, original Westwood Studio and creators of things like OpenRA have influenced this game heavily. This isn't poor like the WC3 remake! 

Gameplay wise there are some fixes and tweaks to improve the game from the late 90s and bring it into 2020 but if you're expecting a new RTS game with modern mechanics this isn't for you. Its still the same C&C underneath. If I could sum this game up it would be ""simple"" but ""hardcore"" RTS game. 

C&C does shows its age and a lot of this game is about creating a playable modern version for nostalgia and true fans. If you loved C&C and Red Alert in the 90s you'll have fun replaying the game. This is a perfectly playable RTS game but for new age RTS fans and those that like Starcraft or Warcraft 3 this is a bit more plain. Buy it and you'll need to accept mechanics wise its old skool. C&C was a tried and tested formula for a long long time the birth of modern strategy in a way so I find the way it looks, feels and plays is great as a fan who grew up playing in the 90s on my 486dx100.

The single player is a pretty good remake which I'll certainly get at least 10-15 hours out of playing.

Caution! Old style RTS game made to work on modern systems and spruced up a bit!

No way pointing or attack move may annoy some as you'll need to control tanks a fair bit to outsmart people.


MULTIPLAYER:

This area of the game is fun and works to an extend but needs a little work and improvement by the devs. 

1v1 ranked queue is great with plenty of balanced maps and challenging opponents once you break into the top 500. I don't think ranked 1v1 needs much changing but I'd love to see a 2v2 queue come in. There are around 3000-5000 active players so a good variation in tactics and skillcap as you climb. Tank spam makes up a general amount of ranked games but once you get matched with equal skill enemy players other tactics and speed really come into play.

Normal games though can be a big problem. ln team mode the lobby system suffers from a weird input lag and delay which means changing colour, team and start location is slow to do and often left to the host to fix. There's no ban button so lobbies can be spammed by people you kick. Sometimes the servers glitch and you try to load into a game and things just hang and crash, this happens once or twice every 2 weeks for a period of 3-4 hours. I'm a bit surprised little things like this were not picked up during gameplay testing. Some of the maps haven't had basic bug fixes applied so can turn into a lag fest if the game turtles as theres too many tight choke points.

If you get matched with anyone in Asia, Australia or South America expect horrible delay/lag. 

Ore and resource issues are a problem some maps have far too much and others none at all. 

There is no lobby option to increase ore growth. 

There is only a small election of OFFICIAL maps that are balanced enough and playable for 6 to 8 player games. 

Having fog of war off as default and making you toggle it on will annoy higher skilled RTS players. I prefer my enemy to have to scout me to know what I'm doing. Sure you can build radar jammers and gap generators but they are mid to late game and most games are heavily focused on unit spam and economy drive.

The smaller sided games work a lot better than big ones!

Again I wish there was a ranked 2v2 queue!

I'm sure the above is minor issues in the grand scheme of things and you need to remember this is an older game and that Steam workshop and mods may sort everything eventually. The community may fix the map problem but the devs should take note... just because it was in the original game that doesn't mean it was working/perfect in the 90s..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUGUST 2020 - 

Multiplayer now has a ore/tiberium regrow option and a modern balance slider. Very nice that the dev team keep updating and listening to the community. They have patched the ranked mode so people can no longer build Shipyards and Subpens out of visual range and win by waiting you out if you've lost your construction yard and vehicle factories.

22,73370784,english,"I loved C&C as a kid and dont get me wrong i still love it, but if you dont share the nostalgia i simply cant recommend this game.
The Gameplay aged really poorly and i dont quite understand why they didnt improve on some very critic parts.
It is undoubtly one of the best remasters ive seen so far but let me get to the bottom of why i am not recommending this for new players:

The Pathfinding is straight out of hell.

Your Harvesters will spend more time cruising through the enemy base than actually harvesting ore, treating enemy defense structures as pylons in an obstacle course on the way.

Imagine your kid playing next to a open window in the tenth floor. you cant really leave it alone without becoming anxious that it might jump the very second you take your eyes off of it.

I know ways to work around that, and honestly for me its not as much of an issue as it is an annoyance.
The problem is... the enemies dont and therefore the typical skirmish match, no matter the difficulty, will end with the Bots becoming utterly useless because all their troops march into my defenses one by one, including their harvesters until they run out of money to do something and even if they still have harvesters they will sometimes get stuck.

Your troops also dont care for your property and will destroy any walls if they are in its way.
Sending armies bigger than 10 Vehicles through a walled off area, even if there is enough space makes your tanks really triggerhappy causing you to clean up the mess.
Oh and the absolutely stoneage wallbuilding doesnt help with that

There is also still no rally points for your buildings making them clump up at your base causing more chokepoints for your troops.

The Building distance is pretty short too making base building a chore via the good ol' Silo trick, but the fact that its necessary is beyond me.
Sure they dont want you to extend too far and build too eloquent bases but its yet another annoyance thats has been around since the original and ive yet to see a game that does a similarly awful approach.

Yeah playing against other players eliminates part of the stupidity but can be frustrating nevertheless, especially if your units act like a fly trying to leave through a window

While there are mods that can help with some of them and im sure if you read this far you had this ""just use mods"" thought once or twice, none of the ones ive tried so far has been causing me any euphoria and quite honestly they shouldnt depend on modders to fix their game for them.

I will keep playing this game, simply because of the nostalgia, i just want to put this out here in the hope that the developers may look at their game again and patch a few things to give it the love it deserves.",1595875406,1596163459,False,135,21,0.700326800346374512,13,True,False,False,76561198002244851,554,6,628,0,618,1595891822

89,73270900,english,"A binary Yes/No recommend is hard for this game. It is a great remaster of the original game. However, the fact that it is such a faithful remaster means that all of the path-finding, AI and difficulty issues that existed in the original are ported across into this updated game... and they want £17.99 for it. I can understand that price tag, given the work and love that has gone into this, but I have to judge it in comparison to what else you could get for £17.99. 

When I have basically completed a mission, but then need to comb every square inch of the map to find the one remaining soldier I missed. When there is one non-unit-producing enemy structure left and I begin to destroy it, only to see the AI attempt to repair it. When I have wiped out the enemy harvesters and yet they keep producing units, at a rate that my identical buildings can't match. All of these things make it very hard to recommend and in fact not actually enjoyable to play. Missions often turn into grinds. Pure nostalgia is the only reason to buy this game in context of the modern game market and its current price.

They did a good job with the looks of the game, got me fooled in the beginning with the space bar and if you are new, probably will fool u too.
Too me this game was worth it for single player, skirmish alone but u can also build maps and play online in both games / expansions
U can also create playlists of the music tracks and they added and remastered those as well.

I'm looking forward to RA 2 / Yuri's revenge, C&C 3 / Kane's Wrath and Generals / Zero Hour, those three will always be the best for me and they need every support they can get so i pre-ordered and was not disappointed and the things that were there are already patched.",1591438409,1595680736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197978103327,47,15,4836,0,98,1595617583

Building a PC now is nothing. Back then you had to install drivers from a floppy drive using dos commands and trying to locate your files -> cd C:/ and run some batch file. No google. Read book. Anyway.

If you never played the original game your lucky I had to click every time I wanted to build another unit. There was no Unit cuing! You have no idea how many times I've heard that godawful sound ""Silos Needed"". 

So for me the game is very special. In it's day it was second to none. 

If you like to play a good RTS from the past I would recommend Red Alert 2. That game is much better than this one. 
They did do a good job improving the graphics, implemented a few nice features like unit cuing. Thank god.

Rarely do you get to actually find a match with some people who are wanting to start off with minimum currency from the get go as it should be and take the time to build your base, invest some time & strategy etc. 

The problem is people forgetting to play the game for what it could be, throwing all out the window to have the boring rinse repeat scenarios of invest everything you have into single troop armies and rush.

The online connectivity is beyond bad, even when you're the host.. an endless amount of latency problems even within the pre-game lobby.

Shouldn't the ""official"" servers instead provide a dedicated server for users to join instead of the problem that exists right now. ??

CnC Original however they seem to have done some strange things with,  like for starters enemy AI seems to function on a much higher level than player AI,  so their troops will execute perfect precision attacks while yours stand there and get slaughtered.  This creates some very obvious issues with the commando/limited troop missions as you will essentially end up saving constantly and having to perform perfectly to simply achieve the goal as any minor slip up will render you instantly defeated.  I am a bit sad that they did this to the AI for the original as it makes the game very much less fun considering the first half of both campaigns are typically these types of missions and it becomes more of a chore than anything to complete them.

Custom maps sharable via Workshop are great and make sure there's always more content to play through, not that the game doesn't already come with a metric ton of missions (OG campaigns + secret missions + expansions AND console missions)

86,72895859,english,"I've been a fan of the Command and Conquer series of games for over 25 years and, I've pleased to announce, this special remastered collection of the original  games captures all the excitement and RTS tension like never before. 

Alright, enough marketing guff. Let's get down to brass tacks. 

Essentially the games are a HD rehash of Command and Conquer: Tiberian Dawn and Command and Conquer: Red Alert.  Growing up, I was always more of a fan of Red Alert, but playing Tiberian Dawn with advanced graphics has finally managed to spark my interest in the original canon story line as well. Nostalgia aside, most experienced RTS gamers know how C&C revolutionised strategy gaming through it's sheer simplicity. Its an easy to learn and difficult to master system of building one's base, mining the resources and training a big enough battalion to annihilate your foe. 

It sounds like kids' stuff, and fans of more nuanced strategy titles may scoff at it's straight-forward nature. Regardless, there are few things more enjoyable than rolling an armour division of eight-strong heavy tanks through an enemy base, obliterating anything that moves! >:D Truly, in C&C, it's the simple things in life you treasure. 

The soundtrack and the story is always a draw. Command and Conquer's original developer, Westwood, was renowned for its terrific soundtracks. So much so that back in the day players could actually purchase the soundtrack on a separate CD along with the games themselves. Not only has this soundtrack been updated and given a whole free load of bad ass, this new version of the game also provides a jukebox mode that allows players to create their very own soundtrack to war. 

Add to this two very involving stories (the global threat of rogue states and scientific abnormalities in Tiberian Dawn, and the time-bending quantum chaos of Red Alert), both with their own cast of unique characters; and the online play, skirmishes and add-on mission packs and you have probably the most complete introduction to the Command and Conquer universe that newcomers and veterans could ask for.  

The only complaint is that there is no option for re-mastering the FMV sequences. While the visages of the omnipotent Col. Shepherd and the menacing Kane are a welcome site for sore monitors, the overall video quality doesn't match the otherwise stellar job of bringing the games into the 2020s. This is particularly troublesome for Red Alert, as many of the FMVs are two pixelated to fully make out. The drama is still as impressive as always, but when players are used to highly rendered 4K video packages, the low res can cause a lapse of player concentration. 

All in all, I refuse to say anything else wrong with Command and Conquer Remastered Collection. As I mentioned before, I grew up with these games and I harbour a love for them which runs deeper than any niggling little grievance I have with appearances. Sure, it's a 4.5/5 star game, when a little bit of re-shooting would have easily made it a 5/5 star game. But then again we can't always have what we want, especially given our current global circumstances.",1595079905,1595079905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198037077800,173,51,1585,0,875,1599859848

44,72774751,english,"[i]Command & Conquer[/i] (later called [i]Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn[/i]) and [i]Command & Conquer: Red Alert[/i] were released in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Both used the same game engine and were based on the developers’ previous title [i]Dune II[/i] (1992) which is the game that created the Real Time Strategy genre. The [i]C&C[/i] franchise competed with the [i]Warcraft[/i] franchise: [i]Warcraft: Orcs & Humans[/i] released in 1994 and the sequel [i]Warcraft II[/i] in 1995. [i]Starcraft[/i] and the first [i]Age of Empires[/i] wouldn’t be released until 1998.

I bring this up because [i]C&C[/i] and Westwood Studios (now Petroglyph) are hugely important in gaming history for developing Real Time Strategy. This remastered collection consists of [i]Tiberian Dawn[/i], [i]Red Alert[/i], and the extra content for those games released either as expansions or on consoles.

[i]Welcome back, commander.[/i]

Cleaned up and slightly modernized, but make no mistake: this remaster holds accurate to the originals, warts and all. See, being the first of a genre means there are later conventions and quality of life improvements that other games introduced that these games do not have.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Remaster looks good, sounds good, feels good. Interface is updated, the movies are improved, and the existing community was consulted. Just a great remaster all around.
+ Multiplayer, if you care.
+ A piece of gaming history, come back to where it all started.
+ The story in [i]Red Alert[/i] is campy, and is fairly serious in [i]Tiberian Dawn[/i]. Nothing too special here, but it’s cool to look back at these mid-90s stories and see what captured the imagination back then.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Campaign is unforgiving. The AI is merciless. I hope you can micro your infantry, because the AI will crush them at any opportunity. The AI cheats with money, and the scenarios you are given are frankly unfair. I used to think I was just a stupid child for being so bad at these games, but it turns out it’s just that hard. I’m all for challenge, but this game takes it to the next level. I hope you are ready to build sandbag walls to put Obelisks into the enemy base, and to wall off the enemy miners with those same sandbags because the AI can’t path through them.
- For all its lack of mercy, the AI is stupid in some other regards. Especially your AI which will fail to return fire when being fired upon, or to escape dangerous situations. Your units are eager to kill your other units, so you must micromanage them to avoid “friendly” fire.
- Your units will miss. Destroying buildings has a random chance of spawning units, which is especially annoying for commando missions which you can lose by being unlucky in this regard. How can I conquer if I can’t even command my units properly? Prepare to save and load a lot.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Look back to where it all began and remember why certain conventions were removed and other basic essentials were added. Honestly, I don’t think these games stand up as excellent RTS games in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twenty, but this collection represents the C&C community. Maybe if we’re all good, EA might see fit to remaster the later (and better) C&C games.

47,72761785,english,"I'm not a huge RTS player, in fact it's been quite awhile that I've sat down and played one for this long.

I last played C&C in the second half of the 90's, and though I remember enjoying it I don't believe I made it as far as I did this time given the challenging nature of the game. 

With the new assets and option to choose modern mechanics, it plays more like a modern RTS than it did before but it lacks a lot of features we've taken for granted post-Starcraft. Most of this can be forgiven as the devs didn't want to deviate from the original gameplay the game is known for, however what I can't for the life of me forgive is the atrocious pathing system that is responsible for 25-30% of my deaths in the game. It's almost a blessing that it is more simplistic than modern games because you will need that energy to micromanage your troops on a level you normally wouldn't have to. 

Just to rant a bit more about the pathing: you can order troops in a straight line but if you turn your back on them for a second, they'll turn into a patch of tiberium and take damage. Scout tanks will deviate off course and brush so close to enemies you were trying to avoid that they'll lose their cloaking ability. The pathing is woefully inadequate and the devs really should have made it more of a priority for the remaster. 

The other thing that struck me about this game is the difficulty. This is not a bad thing, I find modern games far too simple and that they hold my hand so much it sucks the enjoyment out of them. I can't overstate this enough, though, this game is [b]hard[/b]. After 23 hours I'm on one of the last levels of the Nod campaign (normal difficulty) and about half-way through the GDI campaign. 

You really have to have a smart save meta to contend with this difficulty. As a kid, the high difficulty meant I'd get more for my money out of the game but as an adult, it's as if the game won't let you see the end credits unless you're a pro which is a bit overkill in my books. I suppose I could just play it on easy difficulty, however my pride won't allow me to do such a thing. 

Lastly, the special sauce of this remaster is really improved graphics, the restored FMVs, and all the bonus content that comes along with it. There's also the fact that it comes with the Red Alert campaign, which I haven't even broken the seal on it. All in it's quite the bargain.

If you're a fan of the original or down for some nostalgia, there's no reason not to buy this. If you're looking for an RTS that's more modern and more on the accessible side, however, this may not be for you as it has its fair share of old warts.

Then again, it was never meant to. This isn't a new game, it's a 25-year-old game with a new coat of paint. This is a scrap heap Jaguar E-Type restored to concourse condition. You know it's not going to be as good as a modern sports car, but there's a different kind of enjoyment to driving down the highway with the top down in a shiny icon of yesteryear. 

As a remaster project, this is truly one of the very best out there. I loved the original games and found genuine enjoyment here too. But it offers more than just nostalgia, the gameplay is flawed but excellent, and the sheer number of content is staggering. I find it baffling that EA gave us 2 full games with 3 expansions and bonus content at such a reasonable price, and there's no sign of DLC or microtransactions. I have to admit, this is amazing value for money. 

I'm slightly dismayed by the bugs that are present, and I feel they should have updated some of the mechanics of the original games, but ultimately, Command and Conquer Remastered sets the bar against which future remaster projects will be measured. If you need one line to sum up this entire article, here it is. Mission Accomplished.

The downside is that this is a REMASTER and not a REMAKE , so keep in mind that the AI and the gameplay rules are the same from the 90's. Also, the cutscenes were upscaled but not remade so they're still old, but I still have more fun watching these over a million dollar Blizzard cartoon show.

Some missions you will just have to exploit the ai and save every step of the way to win, others you will be simply road blocked and can't win.

Another major balance issue is the ai seems to have no economy and just have infinite money and are able to rebuild defences immediately after they have been destroyed, which means on some covert missions you can't get into the objectives.


Other then that music is still good and the revamped graphics are pretty nice. Gameplay for tiberium wars hasn't aged well thanks to the awful pathing and terrible ranges for the units.

69,72530352,english,"Upon seeing a remaster, you may have a few thoughts. With, 'Why remake an old game instead of a new one' and 'Did it fix the issues the original had' being the two most prominent.

Let's get this out of the way. This is by no means a perfect game. There are still issues from the first game that they kept in due to wanting to stay true to the spirit of the old games. This is very much an early 90s PC strategy game, in fact it is the one that codified the core rules for most RTS games. So some of it will make perfect sense, some of it will be annoying. For the annoying bits, such as pathfinding and lack of rally points, there are mods on the workshop (including cheat mods if you are having that much trouble).

However, if you want to play one of the quintessential RTS of all time, this is probably one of the best ways overall to do it. The classic/HD switch option is very nice. The easy access to mods is wonderful and allows you to fix many issues you may see (as mentioned before). As for the campaign, once you get past the pathfinding and sometimes silly AI (and it's strange abilities), it is still well worth playing. At the moment I have just finished the GDI campaign and started on the Allied Campaign in RA1, and they still hold up if you view it as the treasure it is. 

Red Alert's storyline is sillier then Tib Dawn, so if you want a serious campaign (as much as one about alien crystals and cults can be from the 90s) play CnC 1. If you want a more light hearted (in comparison) romp, play RA 1.

Now, we wait and see if Tiberium Sun and Red Alert 2 will get as good a treatment.",1594512162,1594512162,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198048203279,196,15,832,0,595,1596401997

[*]I cannot say that this game has bad group pathfinding because it'd imply that it has any whatsoever.
[*]Harvesters may move to the upper-left tile of the refinery's foundation instead of unloading their tiberium when manually ordered to do so.
[*]Harvester AI will often stop working.
[*]When it works, harvester AI is prone to taking completely ridiculous decisions (such as taking tiberium from the opponents' field rather than your own's)
[*]Units have unbearable delay between receiving a command and actually following through.
[*]This will be extremely stressful as the game features several ways to have entire groups of infantry just drop dead as you watch them die with no way of saving them, as they will simply not move as ordered.
[*]The delay is also extremely frustating to vehicles, because they get an additional delay whenever they have to turn around.
[*]No rally point in the game whatsoever.
[*]No shift clicking to queue movement.
[*]No attack move.
[*]Cycling quickly through command groups may feel clunky, as if some key presses are not registering. Same with centering on selection.
[*]Some move and attack commands will just not register at all.
[*]Pathfinding quality will drop from 0/10 to -10/10 whenever bridges are involved.
[*]Units will simply stop whenever something mildly messes with the logic behind the command (eg target is destroyed; another unit is blocking the path for a couple of seconds; target moves to fog of war) instead of reinterpreting the command

All of this is fine for the original game's 1995 release. This particular remaster was released in 2020, however, and has to compete with both a freeware version that is essentialy the same and a fan made remake that blows both of them completely out of the water.",1594511699,1594511699,False,50,12,0.569658041000366211,0,True,False,False,76561198036993044,156,1,7969,0,427,1596784947
71,72529668,english,"Definitely worth it for both existing C&C players and newcomers. I had the original Tiberium dawn on my N64, one of the first games i played. The remaster captures the original game perfectly for the look, sound and feel of the game. Personally i don't mind the new graphics, but if you aren't a fan of it, you need only to hit 1 key to toggle between the classic graphics and new ones seamlessly. In terms of singleplayer, the game plays out really well, i haven't found any issues so far. I haven't played much of the online yet, but it looks like a blast.

The Jukebox is a really nice addition. Being able to set up your own playlists with a mix of original, remastered and updated music is great, even allowing you to mix between Tiberium Wars and Red Alert music freely. The new music is great, but a custom playlist would also let you just avoid it if thats what you'd prefer.

The Map editor is a nice new touch. My only gripe with it is it's so faithful to the original, that they missed out on some textures they could have done with. For example, in the base game there is never a time when there is an ocean on the north, with a beach just below it. Because of this, there is no textures for such a thing, which means if you want to make a custom map your beaches + oceans will always have to be on the south side. Not a big issue at all, as it is faithful to the original, but i think adding in a few new tiles just for map makers wouldn't hurt as it doesn't affect the base game at all and just opens up some new options for user generated content.

Lastly, the game is well priced, and it so far has no microtransactions. It's great to see EA pull things around.

74,72527015,english,"A well crafted remaster that lets you replay all the classics and their expansions with modern controls, modern sprites, updated FMV and remastered and additional music. 

The addition of some modern RTS features (like control grouping with proper shift click and shift bandbox adding even in Tiberian Dawn) is very well received and is integrated well. 

The modern sprites are very clearly inspired by the original ones and match the artstyle well, toggling between classic/modern graphics at a key shows just how well of a job they've done. One of my favorite little additions is that the old installer sequences were also updated. They could have completely skipped this but chose to invest time and effort into something only the original players would remember.

Some things to keep in mind, but that should not deter you from playing:

- Tiberian Dawn is a classic but its controls (even modernized) are still very rudimentary and it will take some getting used to clicking on every single unit, and living without shift-queing or attack-moving. 

- Some missions (particular in Tiberian Dawn) are poorly balanced for Hard difficulty, to the point that cheesing is almost required. Note that you can set difficulty on a per-mission basis.

- While the FMVs are significantly higher def, some videos are still very poor quality for even a 1080 display. It is still a much better viewing experience compared to the low res originals, but it's something to keep in mind. I don't fault them for it since apparently the original source videos are long gone, courtesy of this great noclip documentary on the Remastering efforts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MUDQYWk6qY

On the whole though, this is the proper application of the word ""Remastered"". All the things that made the classics unforgettable, but with some modern Quality of Life updates, crisper video and audio, and a bunch of goodies.

Command & Conquer™ Remastered Collection is an improved version of the first two Command & Conquer series. Included are the two parts ""Command & Conquer: The Tiberium Conflict and Command & Conquer Red Alert including all the extensions and all missions that were only available for the console.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay has remained classic and has not changed much, which I find very positive. you brought in minor QoL updates like an improved construction menu so that you don't have to scroll and a construction queue, but you haven't changed the basic feeling in the game.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ detailed and zoomable remaster optics
+ tactile, newly mixed soundtrack
+ Basic concept (building, harvesting, fighting) works well
+ exciting, multi-stage missions
+ unmistakable flair (»installation« at the beginning!)
+ great staging of the main campaigns
+ bundles two games in one remaster
+ unlockable bonus material
+ Achievements

[h1] Kontra [/h1]

- very often KI dropouts
- still edges with ease of use (collection points, etc.)
- often muddy intermediate films (especially in red alert)
- GDI tanks tend to be very strong

[h1] Fazit [/h1]

The Command & Conquer™ Remastered Collection is a very well done remaster version with lots of content. They has minor problems here and there but the price is fully worth it and I can only recommendit. In my view, a remaster has to be done exactly like this.

94,72501854,english,"I played a TON of c&c back in the 90s.  Thousands of PvP matches on the old wchat system, HEAT, KALI, MPLAYER you name it - LOVED this game.

Somehow they converted this game as a complete, not near, not very close, but an absolute 100% conversation of the original, right down to the wonky path finding the misclick glitches, the unselectable helicopters if they disappear vertically off the edge of the screen, the harversters eating habits and patterns, right down to the prime spot to have an engineer enter a building.

After playing a few matches the muscle memory for 25 years ago came back almost instantly, I was doing things I forgot I knew to do.

What surprised me the most was how well this type of game play stands up today and how no one makes games like this anymore, what a formula.  Tight, tense battles, no bail outs (except maybe a hard earned engineer counter-punch), a heavy reliance on tactical execution and less on macro base building and tech tree strategy etc...

I really loved this game in 1994 when I first got it and it all holds today.

This game is probably not for everyone though.  I'm not saying the fidelity or mechanics hold up that well when compared to games in 2020, but this game has a unique flavor, flaws and all that I can't get enough of.  10/10 in 1994 and 10/10 in 2020",1594476349,1594476349,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005980943,55,7,5820,0,2727,1599883712

>It's like the Nothing never was!

This is such a tasteful remaster, very true to original. Has the swap feature for original graphics in the campaign mode. PgDn / PgUp or mousewheel zooms. It's great if you loved the originals and great to get into them if you never played them yet.

The soundtrack is legitimately better than I ever imagined it to be or heard it in my head. Klepacki has completely outdone himself here, and his Tiberian Suns truly know how to rock out!

This could use LAN. There is supposed to be LAN but COVID got in the way. I'm onboard though. It's better than Launch Day. It's improving. I look forward to having that soon.

PS Toggle Repair Mode is set to something else, you can rebind it to 'R' BUT it is broken from launch if you do. EA please fix the 'R' for repair option binding

30,72441400,english,"Where should I begin ?

Back when I was a pup, friend called me and said that he has a new and amazing RTS from the creators of Dune II, he asked if I would come and take a look at it. Remember T2 scene where Sarah Connor holds the fence while getting blasted by H-bomb ? Just swap her with me and fence with big old monitor from the mid-90s and there you have my reaction.. I was blown away.

It's a great trip to the past and a way to withness the very ancestor which defined the RTS genre.

What is great about good, old C&C ?

KANE - this should be enough for you to know, one of the most iconic ingame characters and antagonist portrayed by awesome Joseph Kucan. If you ask around people that experienced C&C back in the day, it's as iconic as Darth Vader or SHODAN (system shock amg)

MUSIC - ah yes, the part that haunted me since the very first time I've heard the ""Act on Instinct"" in the very first mission. Frank Klepacki has created something very dear to people hearts (or ears). It's also something very iconic to C&C, what Frank did is very good and with this version of the game we have remastered tracks which is cool.

MOVIES - a bit cheezy and a bit dated but it's also something that is associated only with C&C. It's probably last franchase that used FMV (now we can even see how it was created which is cool)

SQUISHING INFANTRY - nothing's more satisfying then to crush infantry with your tanks, APCs or harvester - or to get your 5 rocket troopers getting squished by a light tank... I don't think that I've ever saw this happening in any other franchase... Possibly only C&C has this feature.

TIBERIUM - (okay Red Alert has ore but no one cares for ore!) It's an interesting concept to have something alien to harvest, thing is, unlike in Dune or Starcraft it's an alien thing on our planet. It's misterious and deadly.

This is what I love about C&C, other than that:
-It has ability to switch visuals between old and new looks which allows you to experience the game in a real old school way.
-Whole package reminds me of C&C Worldwide Warfare pack which comes with basic C&C and Red Alert games AND expansions for them, said expansions are similarly big to base game itself
-Two campagins per game - for C&C it's GDI and NOD for Red Alert it's Alies and Soviets, C&C has around 16 missions per campagin and it's similar in RA + expansions which at least make it double
-AI in C&C is a bit doo-doo but it's like it was back in the day, in RA it's a whole different story - it's harder and more agressive - actually whole RA it's much harder than C&C. Not much could be done when it comes to C&C because it would require to completly change missions which would kill the game. So experience the 90s, kid.
-It has a lot of options that allow to experience the 90s or just modernize it to your liking, you can create your own playlist from the ingame music
-It has skirmish option though in C&C it's a bit doo-doo, in RA it's good way to relax. It allows you to customize the skirmish when it comes to superweapons, tech level, starting cash and units and has a lot of maps
-Includes the map editor which allows you to go crazy.
-Has a mod support which is fantastic to goof around.

I've said in the past that I wont support EA, like ever but I broke my promise and I fully support this game - it's a must have and must experience to any and all self-respecting RTS fans. It's a very valuable package for suck low price.

The Brotherhood needs YOU!

The game is exactly how I remember it, even down to the glorious sandbag ""feature"" that sorts the sometimes annoying AI out.
Oh the memories, it brings back loads!! Remember many a LAN party playing this!

Have to say I don't think I ever played the expansions [i](nor did I know they existed! - not that I went looking for them as my younger self)[/i] so it's nice to re-play the original campaign(s) and then follow through the expansion levels, mucho enjoyable!

Nice to see the toggle from classic graphics to [i]""4K""[/i], it's a nice real-time feature, but I have to say I just played it the entire time on the 4K setting.

The gameplay is smooth as butter and the inclusion of a game speed slider is nice, the harder levels sometimes need to be taken ""slower"".

First of all, Petroglyph Games is a joke. Every new RTS of theirs got abandoned by them in an instant after they got their cash.

Tiberian Dawn Remaster is just plain boring. There are few units and it's buggy. 
They Could have just skipped Tiberian Dawn and invested their extra time in balancing RA1 or working on the next C&C Remasters.

Red Alert 1 Remaster is better, as it has more units to play with compared to Tiberian Dawn.
Multiplayer is an unbalanced mess. There's no fun or challenge in playing it.

You're better off playing OpenRA or spending your money on AoE 2: DE.

19,72310368,english,"Man this brings back some VERY fond memories! In '95 was 17 and working in QA for my studio. On our breaks (especially on the night-shift), four of us would get together and have a game on LAN. This would be my first proper multiplayer gaming experience. People would be arguing on who's turn it was to have one of the CD's it came on so they could have a session. Hours of ""unit lost"" and ""I gotta present for ya!"" echoing around the office at 12am. Fantastic stuff! lol

Upon loading this for the first time, I'd forgotten so many things over the last 25 years. First of all, the installation process! This was pretty damned impressive at the time as it entertained/distracted the player whilst the game was being installed unlike most games. I don't remember any other game doing that up until that point. The live-action FMV sequences (which everybody believed was the future in the early to mid 90's) also brought a smile to my face. But nothing more brought the nostalgia back than the soundtrack! It's epic! Some of the tracks I used to hum for months and years, have suddenly come back to me 'In the Line of Fire'  being my personal favourite. 

It's easy to see why this game has become legendary. It's very simple to get your head around and a lot of fun especially on multiplayer. They've remastered the graphics but not too much.

25,72298381,english,"I forgot how annoying your units are in this game, they are thick as shit the path finding is horrendous, i could never understand when i was a kid playing this how 1 single man with a machine gun could blow up a tank, that's what tanks were designed for to protect infantry from arms fire i never got how a tank drives right up to an enemy machine gun unit, opens fire and just sits there trading shots for at least 3 minutes only to get blown up or have its health severely diminished.

You can get the tank to drive over the infantry but most of the time they develop a conscience as you tell them to do this so they end up driving around them instead and finally get destroyed by machine gun infantry, cause its possible to destroy a tank by simply wailing on its armor with a machine gun.  Shells are explosive, explosives kill people, its not religious this is actually true i have never understood how infantry can take a battering from a tank and survive, you have to build artillery tanks with anti personnel shells to take out infantry, ""all shells are anti personnel cause they explode and explosions kill people"".

But if that happened then infantry would be useless ""YES against tanks"" that's why you don't send infantry against tanks, have you ever played Zed Steel Soldiers? you never send infantry against tanks in Zed because the shell will one shot your infantry because that is how explosions work.

The music is great though, takes me back but its not enough to overshadow the frustration of playing this game, how the path finding has not been updated or reworked, your units just stand there as your base and most of the time themselves or a fellow brother in arms is being attacked, frustrating missions where you control a handful of units against an entire base and one small fuck up is mission over.  i know the faithful are happy this has been relatively untouched and just polished but i think this needs some more changes to make a classic a little more modern instead of leaving it in its archaic state because like i said it is frustrating as hell to play.",1594215981,1594216128,False,1,3,0.36933407187461853,0,True,False,False,76561197970523864,816,34,1125,0,208,1594454899

In Hard mode, you do less damage, the enemy does more damage, which would be fine.

Except missions where it's you inside a place with limited units.

That makes these missions, where you have limited resources, STUPIDLY FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE sometimes.

I don't know why you felt the need to make hard mode like this. If it was a balancing issue that's fine, but on missions where it's like 'oh yeah you have so many units, and your units do less damage, and their units do more' is frustrating.

I was in 3rd grade when C&C came out, it was the first game I was ever hyped for. I used to talk about this game incessantly to my classmates and teacher, undoubtedly annoying them all. We had issue #20 of PC Gamer magazine, it featured an article about the upcoming C&C, I used to read it repeatedly, I still have some phrases from that article memorized, 25 years later. I took the damned CD case in for Show and Tell in my 3rd grade class once the game was finally released.

This game captured me, enthralled me like few games ever have, I very fondly remember the long hours of grinding my way through the campaign missions, with Frank Klepacki's soundtrack playing all the while. I remember the sound effects, the voice samples, the cutscenes, everything.

C&C was also the first game I ever modded, and I credit that with putting me on the path toward majoring in computer science in college. The legacy games are still something I play and mod to this day, including having played around with both OpenRA and Dawn of the Tiberium Age.

C&C Remastered captures the magic of the original two games with a near perfect blend of faithfulness to the original titles and remastering of the game assets and code. It's amazing to switch between the legacy graphics and the remastered graphics, the new artwork is so much more detailed, but is very clearly based on the originals. The new sound effects and remastered soundtracks are fantastic. And if you would prefer the old sounds, it only takes a few clicks in the options menu to toggle them on.

Also the installers for both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert are amazing homages to the original DOS installers.

C&C Remastered is a must-have for any fan of the original two games. Playing these games, I feel like I've been transported back in time, like I'm playing these games for the first time again in 1995, and yet at the same time, it's amazing to see the C&C Community being revitalized after having spent so much time fending for ourselves.

Unfortunately the game has been basically unplayable. During our games where we like to team together against AI opponents the game suffers from massive frame rate issues rending all game play completely unresponsive. The game plays with less frames than a power point presentation and during this extended period you have zero control over any of your units. This occurrence is not a one off either, it's happened for many hours of playtime on all 3 copies that have been purchased. 

This problem has also persisted after the most recent patch which tried to addressed this issue (It's actually been worse after the latest patch).

The issue is a recurring theme on all 3 of our computers. I have updated all drives, done a complete re-install, tested all the graphical options that are available and my current graphics card is a 2060 super that runs most games very well.

86,72204209,english,"I'm a big fan of the CnC series (since Tiberium Sun) and I'm more on the casual spectrum of RTS player. I played the original briefly in the 90s but never got into it. I had hoped this remaster would change my mind but it seems my issues are with the core game.

TLDR.
Amazing remaster of the original. If you are used to the sequels (Tiberium Sun / Red Alert 2), this game is the clunkier predecessor which I didn't enjoy.

The GOOD!
+ Complete remaster of both Tibberium Dawn / Red Alert 1, better graphics (I can see what is going on in 1080p!)
+ Online Multiplayer including 1 vs 1 instant quickmatch and an active community (at the time of this review)
+ Behind-the-scenes for fans of 90s FMV cutscenes
+ This is the best way to play CnC / RA 1, all expansions included (even the console missions), best of all no DOS box needed

The BAD:
- Lack of variety, Tiberium Sun was able to personalize both NOD and GDI with unique units and strategies. In this game CnC / RA 1, they really play the same with the most used strategy being mass tank rush with micromanaging units. In Red Alert, the nations of each faction only gain a 10% buff to a skill (build speed / fire rate / etc) which doesn't really set them apart.
- AI skirmish, I mostly play this since I'm not good at the multiplayer, the AI is fun and aggressive up until the map's resources run out. After that the AI will sit passively in their base (they won't sell buildings or anything). Really kills the fun of a long match.
- Pathfinding, is pretty rough for a game that demands this level of micro. I would say its not even worth investing in troops since players will just drive the tanks over them.

Conclusion:
This is a great game, with devs that cared what the fans wanted out of a CnC game. If you have fond memories of Tiberium Dawn or Red Alert 1, get this game. If you came to the franchise late, the sequels to both games improve upon every part of these ones.

Seriously, thanks to Jim Vessella, Petroglyph & Lemon Sky for making such a great remaster.
Feature-complete, workshop support, no carved out content, no MTXs, no Origin DRM, even source code available publicly. Polished, smooth and faithful to the originals as far as I can tell.

It's great, don't know what else to say, so here's my soapbox rant on indies neglecting RTS games.

There just haven't been that many retro RTS (or RTS in general?) games for so many years. The few indies that have released something usually can't nail that specific scripted yet dynamic, varied and forward moving campaign where every mission has something slightly different (from basebuilding to sneaking, recon, sabotage, to massive multi-step objectives and scripting that changes the battlefield after events, twists and turns in their missions). 
The few indie RTS' that have come out have mostly been one similar skirmish mission after another with little to spice things up, or just giving up and going full-blown tower defense.
Scripting & linearity aren't dirty words, you can have a large map in a strategy game with emergent gameplay, but also with set objectives and tight scripting, which still allows some hectic chaotic systems to throw a monkeywrench into your plans. 
Tiberian Sun did this rather well with the more post-apocalyptic world with mutants, rampaging multiplying visceroids, out of control growing veins and tiberium, wildfires, drifting poison clouds, meteor showers and ion storms.
Not to mention, once again, missions which had you at one point recon with a commando, sabotage some AA, rescue some troops, use them to destroy a prison, rescue some mutants or scientists, then get access to a base, build up, and charge, or throw in some story stuff about a double cross, and suddenly some troops you thought were on your side turned, you lost a piece, intel/story revealed a new location, a new stronghold on the map, previously inaccessible, etc etc...
Variety, you f**ks!
Not to mention, most indie RTS just lack a forward momentum, a pushing, driving force for the player, just dropping you in a sandbox, like in a skirmish map, saying have fun, and then leaving. 
That might be okay here and there, but I don't think entire games and genres can be carried by skirmish alone, those have usually been historically a side bonus, optional game mode for a reason.

I'm hoping the success of this remaster will see both Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 & expansion(s) also be greenlit for remasters by the same team and with the same freedoms.

But I'm also hoping indies will look at RTS as deserving a retro revival.
Plenty of people are bringing retro FPS games back, with Dusk, Overload, Amid Evil, Ion Fury, Wrath, Project Warlock, Prodeus, then the later ""retros"" like Trepang2, Maximum Action, Elderborn, Ultrakill, and even Doom2016/Eternal in a way is bringing some things back. The list goes on, there are an insane amount retro FPS games coming out.
Why not revisit RTS as well?

Not just more skirmish modes masquerading as a pseudo campaign, but proper, story-driven single player campaigns that don't see linearity, scripting and leading players as a negative, but as powerful ways to create the best kind of evolving dynamic battlefield, an ""intelligently designed"" sandbox, if you will. 
Doesn't have to be anything complicated, classic streamlined approach to systems with engaging rollercoaster rides of varied campaigns. 
And if indies are scared of having to live up to making full blown FMV cutscenes with actors, just take a page from games like Crying Suns or Griftlands, which still manage to create engaging ""cutscenes"" which feel like they drive a story forward in a sort of cinematic fashion.

That's been my side rant.

55,72102492,english,"I've only played Red Alert so far (never really got into TD) but here are my thoughts...

[h1] Pro's [/h1]

- The remastered graphics are noticeable (but not too updated to ruin the classic feel of the game). The ability the smoothly transition between old and new graphics is also nice.
- The soundtrack has been remastered to sound much better and I personally noticed the difference. I also like how unlike a lot of remastered soundtracks they haven't completely redone said tracks (I generally dislike redone soundtracks; although the remake of ""Brain Freeze"" from RA2 is fun )
- Improvements to controls with additional hotkeys and slight improvements to the UI

[h1] Cons [/h1]

- Unit path finding clearly needs working on, although there are some mods out there which try and improve on this.
- Perhaps a little work on balancing would be in order (watching 3 allied tanks struggle to beat a single soviet heavy tank is kinda tilting, although this may only apply when playing on hard?)
- Campaign cut scenes are near enough the same as the originals and those haven't aged well. Perhaps redoing them entirely would of been nicer overall but this isn't a huge issue to be fair. 

I don't have any real interest in playing multiplayer so cannot speak for that.

Again just my thoughts on what I have experienced so far. Overall a solid remaster which will hopefully be tweaked by developers and modders alike. Will be enjoyed by both old fans of the C&C franchise and those who are new to C&C.

Lets hope for remakes for other C&C games in the future. (Red Alert 2 would be the one for me)

Looks like they prettily foxed up the savegames. Keep an eye to name your savegames different in both games. Otherwise they will overwrite each other. For example: Naming the save ""a1"" in red alert will overwrite a save named ""a1"" in Tiberium Conflict without any warning and vice versa.
Yay. Here we go again, EA. :(


Initial review:
That Nostalgia - wonderfull!
As many others I was a bit unsure if this project will be as good as it looked like. EA... you know. Not really the game heroes they used to be in older days.

So what I have seen so far is surprisingly great. 
The optics, the machanics, the sound, ....the sound. I think, I never played the censored german version. The more happy I was, when I read that its uncut now. Beside of the german syncro. I totally understand that they cant uncensor the spoken texts. I am fine with that, as long as the game itself is uncut. But... the german syncro is AWEFULL! It sounds like a bunch of overly happy little teenagers doing their own hobby podcast. By far not like a group of angry warlords. I cant remember the original Voices, so it has nothing to do with the remake but the game in general. 

I love the old VGA games from my youth. The big chunky pixels were kinda cute. But its truely a relief to have more clear graphics and in higher resolution now. The new graphics are not my absolute favourite; somehow there is missing something just a tiny bit more ""professional"" to be perfect. But they are great without any doubt. 

Even the Upgrade-Intros are great. I like this subtle kind of humor since its a brand of the old gaming mentality. 

Only one little pain is left. Now I finally remember why I did not play the first parts too often. The KI is stupid like bread. Most of the units die because of friendly fire fom nearby rocketlaunchers or flamethrowers. If they dont die from that, then it means they were just on cigarette break far far away from their destinated target. Or pretending to be innocent little cows just happily waiting to be butchered. 
I know its always tricky to touch such sensitive spots in a game. And I know that some countries armies in real life prefer brainless tank soldiers. But I wish they would have improved the KI at least as much that they shoot back, when they are under fire. 

But alltogether I guess 17 Euros in sale was fine for that well polished piece of nostalgia. 
Now I am strongly looking forward to Red alert 2 (and of course tiberian sun).
 
But my true wish, that I even wish more for is a remaster of Dune2k, please! EA! Come on! For the fans! For the history! For money! PLEASE!!!!!!!!! <3",1593872903,1593944076,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561197974684590,3245,242,332,0,189,1593954418

75,72063980,english,"TLDR: I'm recommending this game, but giving a warning that C&C did not age well, but Red Alert is still a good game.

I played both these games back then, at release...I've always been a strong RTS fan, starting with Dune2.
Playing C&C brings back so many memories, of all the fun I used to have with this game...but looking at it now, it did not age well. Improving the graphics and sound is cool and all, but doesn't address something that is really lacking and that we take for granted nowadays, good pathfinding and attack-move. If you're trying to move multiple units at the same time through small passages, they will block each other, and be easy pickings for AI; sometimes units just stop moving, because another unit is in the path they wanted to take, and will have to recalcuate the best path; lack of attack-move means you will need to pick targets when moving, other they will ignore enemies. The gun is fun for nostalgia playing the campaign (where some maps have some major design flaws, we just didn't have anything to compare back then), and some might find fun in Multiplayer, but that won't be for me...I'll complete campaign and will put the game to rest.

Red Alert is another story...it's still a good game, everything was a vast improvement over C&C, and we can still see all the things that made it such a gameplay breakthrough. I'll suspect it'll have a far stronger multiplayer presence than C&C, because it's just a vastly superior game, even the campaigns are much better designed.

So, while I do recommend this collection, I'll leave this warning for players who've only ever heard of C&C but never played it, that the game is very limited in what we consider modern RTS, to the point that I didn't even remember just how much...been playing on Hard, and the hardest challenge is fighting with the pathfinding.",1593920333,1593920333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970738558,923,7,1857,0,406,1595444921

The Good:
+ Everything great from the classic DOS and Windows 95 version including the secrets.
+ Improved graphics.
+ Improved soundtrack.
+ Batch unit loading for C&C TD.
+ Unit queue. 
+ Mod support.
+ No micro-transactions or DLCs(at least when I'm writing this review), that's a point for EA.

The Bad:
- AI's still stupid and no option for enabling/disabling the remastered AI.
- Batch unit repairing is still not supported in C&C TD.
- Limited player number for skirmish & multiplayer modes.
- Actor-less video quality is worse than the gameplay graphics.

Overall:
This is an early stage milestone in the RTS game history and is still fun in 2020.

As a dedicated fan of the original C&C: Tiberian Dawn and C&C: Red Alert games, I am extremely pleased and impressed with this excellent new release. Petroglyph and Lemon Sky studios clearly worked very hard and made the kind of dedicated effort to craft a game that's only possible when the entire team of developers share a deep passion and love for the game series they're working on. The new 4K graphics are beyond amazing and the artists left no detail untouched, the graphics and art have truly been brought into the 21st Century and are very pleasing to the eye and even transformative of the player experience. The audio effects, sound design, voice overs, and music are also all remastered brilliantly in high-definition. Frank Klepacki and Kia Huntzinger should be applauded for their amazing efforts in recreating and reinvigorating the music and voice over for EVA. The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant and provides a hardcore drug-like hit of heavy nostalgia every time I listen to the lovingly remastered and re-recorded sounds and music included in this release. Finally, for the modding community this release provides the ultimate gift, a brand new map editor and the unlocked source code of the full game files for both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert and integrated modding through the excellent Steam Workshop, which already has a thriving and brilliant modding community that's only growing. The nicely implemented modern Steam server-powered multiplayer framework is also very much alive and working optimally.

Being a fan of C&C wasn't easy this past decade thanks to EA.

But this remaster... oh boi, it's more than i ever could have dreamed of! 
It's just perfect! Yes, there a few old bugs in the pathfinding and many mechanics are plainly old.
But still, the changes they did - allowing to queue units, possible new controlling mechanics, healthbar system - are just great quality of life improvements! And they added many new features like: the possibility to switch between old and new HD textures while playing, Jukebox with new and remastered songs, steam workshop for maps, working multiplayer with quickmatch, better skirmish mode, ALL bonus missions, more graphic settings, bonus material of production, map editor, mod compatibility, achievements and many more!
And did i mention it's Tiberian Conflict and Red Alert in one game?!
EA completely suprised me with this remaster. They even hired original Westwood developers! Which timeline is this?!?

I was going to write a review earlier on but decided to put in the extra hours to make sure this was the review I was going to write. Honestly what I consider a ""Remake"" is taking what was good about the old and redressing it for the current technology. Pros of importance first. Music ""This is the main ingredient"" without this main factor this would have made my review not neutral only down voting as steam has no ""Meh"" option. I must admit while playing almost one entire mission was played with Mechanical man on repeat :) The music was the best thing. Next graphically was what I was expecting for a remaster so yep. Extra missions were a nice touch. Cons... well all cons are important so no order here. Bugs OMG did any body actually test play this before release?? Latest bug I came across was capture the tech centres which wasn't that hard considering every unit/structure was invulnerable? Thankfully I could still capture/pass mission using multiple engineers. The amount of times lost count.. when I've quietly said ****ing Moron when a unit just stands there gets killed.. or you order them to move and half just stand there... or artillery decide to melee WTF? ""Laughing atm"" :D. But yep honestly you can laugh about these things outside of game but in game different story. Path finding another thing that when you are ""Remastering"" a game you take out all the bit's that suck.. Made me wonder why on Tiberium Dawn they didn't just add wider paths would've at least been the easier solution? But in saying that the core mechanics of the game needed to be worked on as there is ""A LOT"" of issues just giving it a sound track and a lick of paint is not ""Remastered"" In my eyes. Also played a little bit of multiplayer lag was the issue with this even with a decent connection and also the fact that units are so dumb micro manage dumb units with lag... Nope... To wrap it up I would suggest if your new to rts or haven't played the old C&C on Dos this is probably isn't for you. Worth a buy tho under $10.00.

whoever at EA Green lit this and saw it through needs a medal

a company like EA who has received soooo much flak has redeemed a lot of points with this

frank klepacki and the tiberium sons have done an absolutely fantastic job with the soundtrack and yes C&C does have a better soundtrack than Doom!

if EA is clever they will next remaster the 2nd tiberium war and RA2 and if they stick the the same forumla as what they have done with this  (just look at the EA stocks they have skyrocketed with the release of this) they will have a new golden egg

still reading? well done but nostalgia goggles aside yes this game does have issues but most of them are with the original games not what they have recently done (no attack move but the guard function still works) and when i loaded in the first mission and saw the original GFX and then hit space bar my mind was blown the detail and love put into this is incredible

This game is as good and as bad as you remember.  The good parts are great: the level design, unit choices, balance, the factions being noticeably different instead of cheap reskins; even the terrible cutscenes have a nostalgia factor.  The resolution enhancements are nice, and it's pretty stable.

But my god, that unit pathing.  If you tell a unit to go north, expect it to take a long circular path through the south first, or whichever direction is the worst or most annoying choice.  If you want them to run away from an enemy expect them to drive towards them first.  Why?  Fuck you.

21,71627729,english,"Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:

[b]The Good:[/b]

- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key
- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)
- Game ""installation"" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia 
- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place
- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms
- You can queue multiple units while in production now
- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby
- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want
- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!

[b]The Bad:[/b]

- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)
- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles
- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total
- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found

[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]

- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time.

If you love the original, you'll love this.  Personally, I especially loved the remastered sound and music.  But welcome, too, are the opportunities to mod the game through Steam's workshop.  The developers released the source code and specifically made certain design decisions that coincided with current C&C projects being undertaken by indie fans (such as Open RA & Dawn of the Tiberium Era).  This has resulted in made mods already being introduced on the workshop: some mods are as simple as greater zoom functionality (to really see those 4k units), others include simple updates to AI pathing, and still others include larger sets of changes that make the game more balanced & competitive.

I don't remember being so upset at the units doing retarded stuff when I used to play the original. 

Harvesters are worse than the original that I'm 100% sure about, high value mineral fields go partly uncollected because the harvester for some reason does not see the minerals and you have to micro manage the harvester yourself to collect all those spots 1 by 1 or it will just return to the refinery without collecting them.

43,71463306,english,"A very well done remaster. The graphics and sound have been overhauled but the core engine and gameplay are still intact complete with all the bugs and lack of UI & AI improvements that were present in the originals. Thankfully, since they open sourced things you can download mods from the workshop to bring the controls and AI closer to modern standards if you aren't a fan of the following:
- No attack move
- Tanks that slide around like drunken figure skaters and sometime run off in the opposite direction
- Suicidal harvesters that frequently get lost, go for the furthest ore fields and block each other from dropping off
- No minimap pings (I don't think there's a mod for this yet or if it's even possible, I didn't realize how dependent on them I'd become until I realized they weren't there)
- Units not firing back when something shoots at them (Not sure if there's a mod for this yet)
- No structure waypoints

But if you want the real experience you'll try it first without the mods to fully appreciate how far RTS UI and AI have come since these games came out.

The new stuff is all awesome. Being able to make a custom playlist from both the C&C and Red Alert soundtracks as well as a few other C&C games rocks. The mission select is way better than the originals, which didn't let you pick missions or even show you the number and name of them, you had to have a save file at the end of a mission in order to be able to jump to the next one. The bonus features are mostly pretty neat and have some cool behind the scenes footage. You can now play with voice chat through steam, which is really fun.

I only have two minor complaints:
1. While they patched it so you can save over games now, you still have to type in the save name without being able to see a list of the other save files that are there. It's kind of a weird omission since I think even the old DOS versions could do that.
2. If you add a friend to a game through your friends list it will drop them once the game finishes and you'll have to re-add them. I don't know if this is fixed now that Private Lobbies are a thing, but it was mildly annoying when I did my first set of online games before the patch.

1st the path finding, it's horrible. units constantly get clogged, or choose the most difficult rout. Ore trucks decide to gather ore from way off vs close. Then if you have several refineries they'll lock one from being used while they slowing trek back to it. it's just a huge mess. Anytime there's a bridge your units just can't seem to get across it without a few thinking it best to go clear around the map through enemy territory. Subs are also pretty useless. 

2nd I'd say is how your own units hate to attack enemies on their own. they'll just get pounded while not even bothering to fire back.

3rd mamoth tanks. they just suck. they are so slow, and don't seem to be that much tougher. between the things listed above and this, they probably couldn't beat a like number of medium tanks.

The ability to switch between the new and old graphics on the fly seems like a gimmick, but to a nostalgic player, it adds so much to the experience. I regularly flick between the two for that nostalgic hit, especially when I'm in a familiar situation from some random snippet of the decades that I've played this game.

The updated music is also absolutely amazing. I usually wouldn't enjoy a remaster or remix of an old favourite song/album, but in this case, it is just SO well done. Also, both are included and can be mixed via Jukebox settings in the menus.

Other things worth mentioning: The options are comprehensive, UI is fantastic, no performance issues, absolutely loaded with content with the inclusion of the expansions.

My only gripe is that I am sad to say that the original map editor was much better than the one included with this. It's somewhat confusing to begin with, okay when you get the hang of it, but still not very user friendly. They really should include something of a tutorial/guide and improve the UI. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to find out how to place Water... I kept scrolling past it in the selection area. I also loathe that I can't 'paint' with the cursor in the map editor and have to instead individually place basically everything aside from the resources (Ore/Gems/Tiberium).

All in all, it's a must buy. I don't usually buy new titles on release, but this one was a certain exception. I hope EA continues to step in the right direction. Also, as much as I want Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 alongside everyone else...

75,71428418,english,"For what it is, this game is a master, and exactly what I want from a ""remaster"".  Rather than just re-releasing it or crafting a brand new HD remaster, they do both at once.  Active in the game, you can press Spacebar and alternate between the old original graphics and the new Remaster graphics.  At any point you can also go into the options and select whether you want the old original sound effects, voices, and music, or the remastered ones.  You can even set up a music playlist consisting of both sets of tracks (old and remaster).  There's even some bonus clips showing a comparison of the cutscenes, with half the screen the old pixelated style, and the other half the new vaseline-smeared remaster.


The remastered graphics as well actually look like effort was put into detailing them.  Whether this is how they were originally designed before being necessarily compressed for MSDOS I don't know, but it frequently makes it worthwhile to press Spacebar and switch back and forth between graphics to see how units used to look, how they were supposed to look, without ever interrupting gameplay.


Completing every mission gives you behind the scenes bonus content, from unused music tracks, old artwork and photos, to full length videos showing the behind the scenes filming of the cutscenes, unused cutscenes, and rehearsal and unused takes.  It is a glut of content for any C&C fan.  The cutscenes as well have been remastered as best they could be, having originally been filmed and compressed to 140p pixelated mushes.  


This is a masterclass in giving absolutely everything.  Everything from original C&C and Red Alert is included, in both original style and new remastered style, which you can switch back and forth from at any moment in-game instantaneously.  There is almost no reason at all to go back to the original version, because you have it here in its entirety, along with the remaster on top.



For the actual game itself, nostalgia has been very good to it, because it is really really bad.  The unit pathfinding is the absolute worst I've ever seen of any game.  Half of my casualties in battle are due to one or more units idiotically speeding past the spot I order them to move to and getting caught behind enemy lines and immediately destroyed.  Units will not go and engage an enemy unit attacking a unit right next to them.  Units will prioritize arbitrarily re-adjusting their stance or direction rather than opening fire, so weaker units are liable to be instantly destroyed while they're busy wiggling around to find the perfect spot to stop on.


The campaign AI may or may not be competent, because almost every single mission provides them with a nonstop source of some unlimited reinforcement, whether it be free tanks and infantry, or free air strikes from off-map units.  Too many missions are of the sort where you can spend a full hour doing everything right, then end up failing either because of some stupid unit accidentally getting itself killed or accidentally killing a necessary unit.  Other times the game simply won't give you any information as to what you are supposed to do until it is too late and you've failed the mission.


As well, one gameplay feature that is completely gamebreaking is the fact that units that are being attacked while they are moving take a tiny fraction of the damage they would.  This is almost impossible for your own moronic units to exploit, given how much they move around aimlessly, but for the AI, it is flat out cheating.


The AI will see your units coming, and move its unit just at the last moment that an incoming tank round or air strike hits, so that rather than taking the full amount of damage, it will take as little as 10% or less of the damage.  Enemy ore trucks are some of the worst offenders, avoiding the vast majority of incoming damage until they are completely cornered by vehicles, because they will otherwise run over infantry.


A whole lot of missions rely on a gameplay method that is less ""Command"" and more ""Guess"".  You are given a tiny assortment of units and made to send them out into the shroud, then accept the punishment when your unit gets instantly killed by some unseen enemy.  It can make difficult missions even more difficult, and missions with Essential units an absolute pain that no longer resembles a challenge, but just facing off against the RNG for the least awful outcome.


Red Alert definitely fares better, as C&C has some truly atrocious design options that probably were in the base game that render so much of it either unplayable or a 6-7 mission streak where you're waiting for the ""real"" missions to begin, after spending so many missions doing missions with no bases and little to no reinforcements.  GDI Grenadiers as well seem to have an absolutely massive splash damage area, to where they are just as likely to kill their fellow infantry as they are enemy soldiers.",1593200106,1593200117,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198039165368,315,102,5518,0,2840,1596738606

Be warned however, that despite some quality of life changes like improved sidebar, shift+click for queuing 5 units at once (and unit queues overall), the game is old enough to not have things like attack-move, rally points and movement queuing. You really have to do pretty much everything manually and that can frustrate some people, it will however let those with very good control really shine.

Aside from initial loading lags (until I reinstalled the game from HDD to SSD) everything works silky smooth, graphics are remade in 4k resolution, whole soundtrack has been re-recorded and all the possible extras and lost tracks have been added, FMV and CGI videos have been upscaled by neural network (they still look kind of clunky but at least bit smoother), multiplayer works really nicely and has modern matchmaking system (though the rules could probably use some tweaking, like initial units).

I initially thought I'd just play through the campaigns for nostalgia's sake (and I did and they were just as fun and sometimes frustrating as I remembered) but ended up enjoying the multiplayer far more than I expected.

Incredible redone visuals and animations. You can change the between OG sprites and remastered ones on the fly.
Amazing soundtrack
Includes both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert, as well as their expansion packs.
Lot of QoL changes such as key rebinding, unit queuing, and option for more modern controls
Price. Only $20

AI behaviour is essentially unchanged. Path finding can be a pain in the ass. At the same time, tricks used to exploit the AI still work here.

20,71355172,english,"18 hours in right now, have completed the NOD and GDI main campaigns and played a fair bit in skirmish. So far this remaster has been pretty great, but it does come up short in a few areas. Right now my chief complaints are the way workshop items are loaded into the game, the lack of custom map sorting, and the inability to play modded multiplayer.  

When you find a new map you like in the workshop you have to open the game, go into skirmish or the sp custom maps tab, click on the custom maps button, and then search for the map by name. Once you find it you have to download it in game, which takes a bit of time to download and occasionally stalls. Similar issue with mods except for there arent as many clogging up the in game menu. Please just let us download the maps in the workshop and have it auto install. Alternatively being able to sort the maps by number of players in the download menu would greatly help.

No way to sort custom maps once you download them, its just a long list of names with most having no indicator of the number of players it supports. Again, sorting by number of players would greatly help.

You can't play with mods in multiplayer which is a huge letdown. The game sticks to the same mechanics and game logic as the original, which is exactly what we were promised. What this means though is pathfinding sucks, there are no rally points for unit construction, harvesters get stuck all the time, and no attack move. All of these are fixed by mods like CFE patch which really enhances single player and skirmish but leaves multiplayer stuck with all of the vanilla issues.

76,70348628,english,"This is the perfect remaster. This is an updated review after having completed both sides in both C&C and Red Alert. Took me about 45 hours in total. And I have had a blast! It is sooooo gooooood! I had almost forgotten how good these games are.

With the improved graphics and music, it pretty much is everything I ever wanted of an RTS.

The gameplay is simple. There's not much in the way of complicated game mechanics. And that's a huge strong point for these games. Even today. What the game delivers is a bunch of puzzles. The A.I. limitations mean that a lot of what the computer player does, is based on timed triggers. But not as simple as it sounds. There's a lot going on behind the curtains at all times, and the computer doesn't cheat. If you cut off his supplies, he won't be able to produce units and so on.

Ok, so the gameplay is basically about figuring out what triggers are in place. Where the waves of units are coming from and when. It's a lot like tower defense in that regard - with more strategic layers added on top.

So while defeating those waves of enemies you also need to be expanding your base. And you might fail a couple times on each map, when you figure out what the A.I. likes to do on that particular map. And that's fine. Learn to love that. Then try again and plan accordingly. It really is a cool feeling when you've switched tactics and things start to click and the computer player no longer has success with his escapades.

Only thing I have noticed that didn't age well in these games, is the unit path-finding. It's... Bad. But you learn to get around it. You learn that you can't just right-click once at the other end of a bridge and expect all units to drive across in an orderly manner. Nonono, they will start doing some really goofy stuff to get there. Sometimes driving completely around the lake, right into enemy territory. So pay attention! And here's the trick: KEEP RIGHT-CLICKING at the other side of that bridge. Each time you right-click all units will reassess. And the more you click, the more units will realize they can drive past as the space clears up. So yeah, broken path-finding, but not game-breaking.

And that is the ONLY thing I can come up with. Everything else. Eeeeverything else! Is just pure masterpiece!

Would it be too much to ask for in a remastered version to actually put some effort into the gameplay?
It surely wasn't fun to readjust the harvest trucks (ore/tiberium) every 20 seconds because they cant find the field they should harvest 2 inches away from them. Same goes with the insane lack of any AI in own troops, they literally keep standing within range of enemy units and simply won't be bothered to defend themself or anything surrounding them.

This is exactly what makes this wrong.Personally I don't care for remastered music and cinematic scenes no big whoop there.To be honest it won't make a difference, people will play couple of times and then move on, RA, RA2 etc they are playable as they are now with active multiplayer community graphics won't make a big difference.
Sorry this is my personal opinion.Some people will love this remaster and it is good but not everyone will.

*After some more hours of multiplayer (trying to find a map) anything besides 1v1 takes too long to find a host, and you cannot title your map so people just give up after 2 mins.Units wont shoot unless you press ""S"" to stop or if you are luck and the lag is less you can click them to attack.

If you are buying this for multiplayer hold on a little bit more until they patch it.

Still the game had a lot of issues. Multiplayer is unplayable forget those people that say, install it on SSD. I have on on SSD and it does nothing.

15,71256071,english,"[i]Command & Conquer Remastered Collection[/i] is a lot like [i]Age of Empires II Definitive Edition[/i] in that it faithfully upgrades a classic video game for modern systems, and I can't play it for too long without yelling at the screen.  It has the same fundamental problem as [i]AoE II DE[/i] in that the games being remastered are decades old, and show it.

So the old-school graphics are in high-definition, the incredible soundtrack has been enriched and remixed, and there are little quality-of-life improvements like better unit production queuing and the ability to select aircraft mid-flight.  Unfortunately, it's hard to appreciate those enhancements when your soldiers struggle to navigate around a ridge, decide to move to point-blank range before opening fire on their target, or just inexplicably ignore orders and stand in the middle of a field.  And once the nostalgia of replaying the very first [i]C&C[/i] wears off, even a lifelong fan of the franchise will have to admit that the original game had poorly-balanced factions and some just plain un-fun missions that came down to luck, not skill.

The good news, and one reason I'm giving this game a thumbs-up, is that it has Workshop support, and modders are already trying to improve the game's AI, build upon existing quality-of-life features, and even rebalance the factions.

Wait for patches.
------------------------------
Edit:
------------------------------
So, the patch is here, I assume this is first of at least several.

+ the stuttering is somewhat fixed, now it is bearable(see explanation below)
+ crashing of C&C in long skirmish games seems to be gone

- the stuttering (yup, still an issue)
- the patch was 900+ MB in size, the only thing I noticed is a change in a title screen (now you have to press the ESC key to move to main menu). I'm wondering what was ""added"" that took so much space :)

A small explanation about the stuttering issue - it wasn't very bad while doing the campaign, but the skirmishes with AI were totally unplayable. 
I noticed this after I wrote the review - this is why I used ""slight"" as the description. In fact, it was a total disaster as the stuttering prevented repairing, issuing orders, placing buildings etc. Basically the whole user interface was not responsive.
Now it is ""bearable"", but still not fixed.

Reuploaded with graphic impovement, not remastered. Wait for discount.

48,71234949,english,"I've long been a fan of the Command & Conquer franchise, one that was tragically forgotten as the 2000's went on and Westwood studios was increasingly changed by EA. I was convinced this franchise was dead and buried when the announcement came down the pipe that EA and Petroglyph were going to put together this project. 

Command and Conquer is a package of two very similar but still unique RTS games from the mid 1990's. These titles ride the line between what's familiar to our world (gun toting grunts, massive tanks, attack choppers) and what is not (tesla coils bringing forth lightning, black obelisks firing lasers, and time travel.) While through the original framework of these games you can see that it's very 90's in both execution and presentation, it's easy to see how once upon a time there were many RTS fans who considered the C&C franchise every bit as good as Blizzard's strategy titles. 

If you're a fan of old school RTS games or if you've played and enjoyed C&C in the past, this is a must-buy. It's a very nice package with plenty to do and many nostalgia laden roads to cruise down. The behind the scenes content is very interesting and between the copious amount of mods and expansion content that's included, you'll be entertained for some time with this release.

And if that hasn't sold you, I'll leave you with this - any Command & Conquer fan will tell you that this franchise was damn near dead. Even at the time that C&C 3/4 came out, this franchise was part of a bygone era. Games that decreased in quality as the years went on and the devs were continuously fiddled with by EA. Red Alert 3 was nowhere near the level of polish and quality that the first two iterations had. EA could very well have let this franchise sit on the shelf forever and I wouldn't have been surprised. But Jim and the guys were able to get this project approved and worked with the remnants of the C&C community closely to ensure this was a package that customers would enjoy and appreciate. Is it the new gold standard for remasters? No, not quite. But the point is that they did everything right, and we should support them for their efforts. 

Who knows, if this title sells well enough maybe they'll give this treatment to the next generation of C&C games - Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2, considered by many to be the high watermark for C&C.

58,70636337,english,"I wouldn't recommend this game to the average fan of Command and Conquer. I have played the original versions and the same flaws that existed back then are here warts and all. A large part of my motivation for buying was for the other games to receive a remake, in particular Tiberian Sun.

Good: The graphics are very well refreshed and being able to flick between original and new mode is nice. The music remastering with additional music by Tiberian Sons is wonderful and also played a large part in my purchase decision. The game runs particularly well, I have noticed the occasional hitch, but I am running the game on Linux via Proton. The fact that the game ran straight away at launch with proton is wonderful. You can now use a mission select, pretty handy for those times when the game offers you 2-3 different versions of the same campaign missions. 

Okay: FMVs have been reworked slightly, this does mean that overall they tend to look pretty good. However, the remastering has made some items within the FMVs far more blurred, in particular maps and other superimposed images used during the FMVs. 

Bad: The aforementioned warts and all. The original C&C is a particularly hard game that requires unit micromanagement. Some of the campaign missions are down right cruel where you need to fail a few times to learn the layout of the map and how the enemy is going to come at you. In particular the Moebius campaign mission is uncompletable for me at the moment, as you need to protect civilians which continue to run back and forth over tiberium and get themselves killed. Pathfinding is still an absoloute mess, harvesters going as far as away as possible to harvest instead of the nearest patch. Units bottlenecking on a bridge and some of the units deciding to go on a grand expedition around the map instead of waiting for the unit in front of them to cross. General disinterest from tank drivers to drive in a comprehensible route to get to a particular destination or target.

All in all it creates a rather weird package of games. There is a lot to enjoy here, but its hard to binge without getting frustrated at a lot of things.

Got the patch today and noticed that the Hard difficulty waz nerfed on Tiberium Dawn, which iz fine but from difficult it waz really a challenge for me to get the achievement on the 20th from the start of the release, playing the game a lot. Why? Because Command & Conquer Tiberium Dawn az it'z called waz the first and childhood game I played on the Sega Saturn. So I waz familiar with a lot of missionz by nostalgia. I can tell that on some missionz are a little different compared to the 1995 but overall the missionz have the same layout az the 1995 version. I could be wrong az it'z been a very long time since I last played the game on Sega Saturn, so memory iz a bit hazy. So anyway I made it my goal to beat it on hard and it'z an honor to get the achievement before thiz update. I hope I explained thiz well but I know that I didn't.

(Very good remaster of two iconic RTS games)

============

Review:

C&C Remastered Collection is basically a remastered bundle of two games - Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert.

These two are among of the oldest RTS games around - and this is an authentic experience in the sense that the games play exactly the same as the originals, they just look better.

In its core, C&C is a very simple game. You build your base by clicking icons on the build tab, and make your units in a similar fashion. Units have counters (more or less) just like in more modern RTS games, and there is only one resource - credits.

Both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert work exactly the same, and they are easy to learn. So if you play one, you know how to play the other one.

Graphically I think the remaster succeeded well - the new in-game graphics look really nice. Though there is an option to change the graphics to their original looks, if you want to do that.

Unfortunately the cutscenes aren't much better looking than the originals - But they do serve their purpose, and give nice spikes of nostalgia.

The sounds are mostly the same as the originals - some weapon sounds have been changed, but it's clear that they wanted to keep it faithful to the originals. Those screams and ""Affirmatives"" and weapon sounds give older players like me quite a nostalgia rush.

Now the music side is more interesting - you have a lot of options, if you actually want to fine-tune your experience. All the old low-quality songs are available, and remastered versions of them. And even bonus versions from consoles and more recent versions made by the original composer Frank Klepacki and the Tiberian Sons.

I think it's awesome that you can fine-tune it from the Jukebox - now you can skip the songs you don't like and just put all your favorites on the playlist.

============

Alright, so it looks good, sounds good and is faithful to the originals - What about the downsides?

Tiberian Dawn difficulty for one. 

Since the original C&C Tiberian Dawn did not have difficulty settings, playing on Normal is the authentic experience. Normal is pretty much as you'd expect - early levels are easy but later levels are challenging but fair.

Hard mode on the other hand is implemented poorly.

It would be fine if the AI would get more reinforcements or money or such - but they get improved stats on their units. This is bad, because it breaks the game balance/mechanics.

Like you'd expect a medium tank to beat a light tank every time - but on hard mode the light tank actually wins. I think it's just stupid - the game has certain unit counters designed to it, but these do not apply anymore if you play it on hard.

Playing on Casual simply flips this the other way. Meaning your units will be stupidly overpowered and also cheaper to build.

You can just see that the campaigns are balanced around normal, since they were designed that way back in 1995. Some missions can be brutally difficult on Hard, while everything is a breeze on Casual. Do yourself a favor and play it on Normal, as it was intended.

Red Alert, on the other hand already had three difficulty levels originally, and they are far better balanced.

The save system is also kinda bad - you cannot overwrite things. It always makes a new save file, even if you use the same name.

Sometimes the saves get corrupted - like every time you load a certain save file, the game crashes.

Some of these things have been fixed just before posting this review.

============

Despite its few bad sides, this is a remaster done properly - it has all the content of the original games and their expansions, even consoles missions and secret missions are included!

That's pretty awesome, after some disappointing ""remasters"" like Heroes of Might and Magic 3 HD (lacks expansions, half-assedly made) and Warcraft 3 Reforged, again half-assedly made and lacks things the original had.

Overall, I think C&C Remastered Collection is a very good deal - Easily one of the best remasters I have seen, and well priced too.

For me, it is very close to a five-star game - but I have nostalgia for the originals, which you might not have.

I highly recommend this game.. or bundle, how ever you see it - if you like RTS games.

Electronic Arts is finally making some good decisions. Now let's hope they will remaster Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 next.

IN THE NAME OF KANE!!

33,71197953,english,"I'll never forget it.  There I was, having waited patiently for the brand new Pentium to fire up, my buddy by my side.  We started up Command & Conquer and figured we would try a skirmish game against the computer so we could learn the mechanics.  Got it started, and immediately set to debating the finer points of where to place our MCV, what our base-building strategy should be, how we would amass wealth, and the ways we would make defensible even the most remote corners of the...wait...what the...who the hell is THAT and how did he get there, it isn't his turn!!!

Eighty seconds of defeat later, I had learned the meaning of ""Real-Time Strategy.""

I bought this iteration primarily for nostalgic purposes:  I still have the jewel cases for several versions of C&C (although sadly not the original), and I often think about just how much I miss those early days of PC gaming, when things were legitimately new and exciting and occasionally scream-inducing.  Days of ignoring a girlfriend's phone calls to finally finish off the Nod menace.  Nights of ignoring homework and playing Red Alert with roommates.  This brings all of that back.

This is not to say that one cannot enjoy C&C without those memories, in fact the opposite is true.  C&C remains fast-paced, fun, easy to understand, and relatively difficult to master.  I still have a (forgive me) hard time with Hard mode, and often have to tamp the difficulty down to Normal or even Easy if I only have time for a quick game.  I still love the feeling of sending my Nod horde right up the middle of a GDI base and watching the AI nuke itself trying to stop me.  These moments are great moments in gaming.  Give it a try.  You'll see!

41,71195516,english,"I was a big fan of the C&C and RA franchises back in the day, so was pretty excited when this 'remaster' was announced. First thing that you go through when you start either game is a sort of 'upgrading' simulation which supposedly represents the transition from the original graphics to the new remastered format, which felt a little ...awkward? Not sure if that's the right word, but felt a little unnecessary, but hey, each to their own.

The interface and UI is a big improvement over the original, naturally, as are the majority of the in-game graphics, but one bit that stuck out like a sore thumb was the FMV. With the title being 'remastered', I had assumed (possibly naively) that this would also mean they had gone back to the original video source recordings and reproduced the FMV at a more current resolution. Unfortunately not. They've run the original VGA FMV through an upscaler, which just makes it look like a blurry version of the original video footage, or that the actors have been airbrushed to within an inch of their lives. I swear some of it was harder to make out than if they'd just left it in the original VGA format. It's particularly jarring when you complete a mission in lovely HD only to transition to an upscaled 1990s animation of a gunboat.

The remastered music is excellent, and really brought the memories flooding back of many an hour spent playing these games back in the day. A classic soundtrack then and now. The sound effects are a mixed bag however. Some are really crisp and sharp, and really suit the upgraded graphics. Some are ...not? For example, the voice clips for Tanya sound distorted and cropped somehow. Perhaps they were always like that and I never noticed, but for me it seems to really stick out.

The last thing I would mention is the campaign length. I completed the whole of C&C in one evening, and all of RA the next night. Again, I suspect this is just nostalgia playing tricks on me but I was sure it had taken me far longer to complete the games back in the day. Or I was just really crap back then. Or both! Either way, if you're mainly looking at this for the campaign missions, it may not last as long as you think.

I was hoping to be able to give this game a positive review, as I really did enjoy revisiting some of my earlier gaming days, but the hit-and-miss nature of the 'remastering' (in particular the awful FMV) and the shortness of the main campaigns make it hard to recommend unless you're a die-hard fan of the originals and are desperate to recapture your youth.",1592862439,1592862439,False,2,0,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False,76561197972950902,458,3,383,0,383,1592620078

There have been some new attempts but they've failed miserably (Grey Goo and Dawn of War 3 for instance weren't all that good).

Recently there's been a resurgence of old RTS game remasters. StarCraft and Age of Empires 2 both had remastered versions that were done brilliantly and with a passion. WarCraft 3 Reforged on the other hand was somewhat of a fiasco (check metacritics and tons of videos and articles about it if you don't believe me).

I was scared at first when I thought about EA being behind the creation of the C&C Remasters along with Petroglyph. I mean Grey Goo was horrible (I bought it...) and EA just seems to cannibalize lots of companies and fill their products with microtransactions and so forth. They're not a particularly loved company.

I'm happy to report that C&C: Remastered Collection has been done with passion and the end results satisfy ye olde RTS gamer in me.

This is good old Command & Conquer (C&C) and Red Alert (RA) but with all the additional content from the extensions and console versions all bundled together with new high definition graphics, upscaled cinematics, new OST, few QOL (quality of life) improvements, new controls, improved Skirmish mode, Steam Workshop and bonus gallery.

I really think this is a remaster done right as I can feel the love some the former Westwood developers from Petroglyph & Lemon Sky Studios put in the game. The new OST from the legendary Frank Klepacki him-self and The Tiberian Sons band are top notch but the original soundtracks are still there as well. 

When it's easy to blame EA for many things, the way they approached the community and involved us early in the development of the game is an example to follow for other big editors out there, kudos to them. Another good decision they made is that the game doesn't require Origin at all, running via Steam only which I think is worth mentioning for people that care as most, if not all the games they published on Steam recently requires Origin to some extent.

Skirmish mode was already available in the original RA but without the ability to save your game unless you modded the game and no skirmish mode at all for C&C. With this remaster, they corrected that so both games have Skirmish mode with adjustable difficulty and we can now save, which is really neat.

Not much to criticize except two things:
[olist]
[*]The fact that that both games suffer from multiple issues or annoyances that were already present in the original games, like poor pathfinding and some AI limitations. I assume the decision was made to not alter the original experience even though new controls are available so I can't blame them on that aspect but I'm seeing already some community mods in the workshop addressing some of these issues, which is great.
[*][strike]The hard difficulty is basically normal AI except that controlled units do 20% less damage when enemy units deal 20% more damage so you end up having very bizarre situations like a NOD light tank being able to destroy a GDI medium tank in 1v1, which doesn’t make sense and that’s just one example. I personally would have preferred a more aggressive or “smarter” IA instead.
[/strike] > [i]See [u]EDIT June 22, 2020.[/u][/i]
[/olist]

I'm having a blast playing this remastered collection of C&C and RA so this is definitely a must have in my opinion, especially if you were into the original games already or even for new comers that are mindful this is not a remake but a remaster so issues from the originals games are still present and the gameplay may be a bit tricky to handle initially if not used to old RTS games but other than that, this remaster is pure awesomeness!

[u][b]EDIT June 22, 2020[/b][/u]: an update was released earlier today and it seems they addressed my second concern about the over the top hard difficulty for Tiberian Dawn, which is great. Also, they added more than welcome QOL features like Repair Facility units queuing in TD but I can't see improvements to path finding or IA for instance hence my first criticism appears to be still valid to some extent. Hopefully, we will get more QOL and improvements otherwise I will need to continue rely on community mods like CFE patch. Link to the changelog of today’s update:

Yes, I quote something other user wrote, because it's basically what I would write too:

""The fact that that both games suffer from multiple issues or annoyances that were already present in the original games, like poor pathfinding and some AI limitations. I assume the decision was made to not alter the original experience even though new controls are available so I can't blame them on that aspect but I'm seeing already some community mods in the workshop addressing some of these issues, which is great.
The hard difficulty is basically normal AI except that controlled units do 20% less damage when enemy units deal 20% more damage so you end up having very bizarre situations like a NOD light tank being able to destroy a GDI medium tank in 1v1, which doesn’t make sense and that’s just one example. I personally would have preferred a more aggressive or “smarter” IA instead.""

I would say that if you didn't play this in 1995/1996 and are looking at getting into online/skirmish gameplay then you should no doubt stay away. It's slow, boring and without balance or structure. Simply put it sucks.

For me the strength of C&C/RA has always been the campaigns. They still play great and offer a token challenge with that 90's approach of figuring out the best approach and tactic for cripeling the enemy and then executing that with as few casualties as you can.

The core RTS gameplay mechanics are there but they are badly out dated. Both games are still very clunky and awkward, more so in skirmish than in campaign. There are no improvements to anything other than graphics and audio. Pathfinding, AI and the lack of balance is as bad as it was in the originals. This can be somewhat remedied by either using mods from the workshop or editing the rules.ini file to suit your preference.

There are well over 100 missions to play and several iconic people having with original and redone footage. They have included console missions from the first game and you get the hidden levels (with a little secret something or other you need to do to unlock them from both games of which they are both pretty fun (especially the Ant levels). The cutscenes look solid, the graphics are solid, and the soundtrack (and even more so with some new music they have done) is awesome. While playing the campaign, you can setup to play any of the songs you want (I love the originals, but there are some awesome new songs) to hear. You can also toggle between the old and new graphics to see how much they have been enhanced which is crazy to see. One of the things I really always liked about this series is  how they don't take themselves too seriously. With some cheesy dialog and crazy look of the characters, they just had fun making the game. 
Not all is perfect, as has been mentioned here, the path finding stinks. I mean really stinks. There are alot of complaints about it, but this is how it was when the game originally came out too, sooo....
The other thing is when you click your units too attack, your units always have to get right up on what your attacking even though some have long range damage. That means your units suffer friendly splash damage. Gets a little frustrating. Other than that, not much to complain about.

92,71184450,english,"DATE: 6/22/2020,
I've  been an RTS and Westwood fan since Dune: Battle for Arrakis on Sega Genesis and a Command & Conquer fan since day 1. An amazing series that had a bad end with C&C4 but with the remaster the pioneers of Westwood, fans, and even Electronic Arts have made a fantastic move. I still remember the days when EA made awesome games. But onto the Remaster, to say it clearly the remaster is near perfect, almost negatively lol. The visuals are amazing, the updated sprites and textures are fantastic. The cleaned up FMVs are as perfect as they could get with the videos they could find atm. The remastered music and newer redone, and hidden tracks, are fantastic with even allowing the player to have the older quality audio. The sound effects have been redone but they also allow the older sounds(which I prefer). The only issue I have with the music player/jukebox is the lack of a repeat song button. The updates and improvements are glorious, but they really tried to get a near 1:1 remaster which is where my ONLY issues come from besides a few glitches and bugs(that only need quality of life improvements)

My only gripping issues come from the lack of more modern OPTIONAL choices, I would prefer optional modern A.I., modern unit controls, more queuing options with buildings not just units, price rebalancing, difficulty rebalancing, unti rebalancing, more or new units that they didn't have time to add or couldn't at the time, mission rebalancing especially with C&C 1 where the A.I. can rebuild buildings without anything near them, and some other things. I would love to see C&C 1 get some optional new unit sounds for some units and especially original unit sounds for NOD units that differ from GDI, similar to what RA1 started. I would love more control on sounds as well, the ability to use older explosion sounds but the new weapons firing, definitely should be an advanced option. Also the color choices for Multiplayer is extremely lacking, in OpenRA you can use the entire color wheel where in the remaster currently you can choose between like 5 or 7 colors.

I know OpenRA solves many of my minor complaints but the only issue with OpenRA is they don't have the full campaigns done yet.

Besides my minor issues, this remaster is one of, if not the best remasters i've ever played, I cannot recommend it enough to older fans and newer players who never played, or couldn't play it due to age and difficulties with backwards compatibility. Welcome back commanders, get conquering.

It's much bigger than that now with extra features from the creation of the FMV movies that was to be the charming information suite to explain the game lore between often tedious battles. Steam multiplayer is a huge plus, even though a freeware version of Command and Conquer is out there by fans - if you can get the game to run at all.

I will say however that I do not use the updated graphics, and the sounds make certain aspects... seem weaker. The music is pretty great, although some of the songs by the Tiberian Sons are concert versions which seem out of place too. I can't get past how the new updated models are the old hand-crafted but high resolution voxels have a slow animation loop, so walk animations and the vehicles move in a janky slip-and-slide fashion. I just can't use those graphics.

Still, 10/10 recommend this game to show people where most modern real time strategy games were inspired by (other than Warcraft)",1592803214,1592803214,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198022661275,12,4,2300,0,1155,1594790043

I was admittedly mixed in my reaction when I heard that the remaster would happen.  Excited as a large portion of my formative gaming years was spent on Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn, and a remaster looked fun. There were freeware versions of the games over the years, as well as the C&C first decade collection. Open source versions like OpenRA were also available. Worried as EA was spearheading the drive. I was excited to see that old Westwood guys at Petroglpyh were working on it. Worried, that the core mechanics of the game would be changed, in the name of balance. 

My concerns were largely unfounded. 
My excitement worth it. 

This is a very well done remaster.

TibDawn and Red Alert both have excellent refinements to game play ; mainly the sidebar simplified, a pand and scroll feature and zoom levels (speaking of which, download the enhanced zoom mod- you wouldn't believe the detail put into all the structure and unit visuals!). 
The Audio alone is worth the purchase price. One of the greatest RTS soundtracks in history, this collection includes remasters of the originals, and some remixes. 
Multiplayer has some bugs but has been worth it.

Also, the load times are significantly longer than they are in the original. I realize that this remaster has massively higher graphical fidelity but I don't see why loading the relatively simple game state should take so long.

In my opinion a remaster should improve on all aspects of the original games, not only on visuals/audio. To be fair they have made some great changes like supporting right-click movement and other similar ""modern"" game design approaches, but that isn't enough.

So what's the problem? Mainly it's down to usability and poor quality of some gameplay features:
- The path finding is horrible.
- (Some?) units don't auto-attack when enemies are nearby, causing the game to become very micro-intensive with loads of retries. For instance Tanya getting killed by dogs over and over due to miss-clicks. Combine this with bad path finding as well and you will have a great time!
- Occasionally clicking ""attack"" on a structure caused the unit to move towards it instead, leading to death and mission failure.

To some of you this might not seem like a big deal but for me it led to frustration and retries when the units don't do what I tell them to do.

It's pretty much the originals with a lick of paint - which is both good and bad. Yes the story of both games is great, the music is awesome and so on.

But I haven't played either for a good few years now and I remember why - as many have said the pathfinding is so god awful to the extent you'll hear 'unit lost' as a tank has decided to go some random route via the enemy base or something stupid. 
Units will sit there and be destroyed unless in guard mode, which in turn means they'll chase. All the old bugs and exploits are there still, some units are op and mp is just even more of a build and rush than AoE2. Tbh to complete must levels even on hard you just need to mass tanks.

Look - buy it if you know what you're getting into - its not a bad game but RTS' that came not long after (e.g. Total Annihilation, StarCraft) were vastly superior in almost every way - but at the end of the day both are classic ground breaking games.

Oh and it seems to crash a fair bit with high unit counts.

Update - as I've been progressing through the games (baring in mind I've completed both c. 20 years ago) I've noticed a few missions seem bugged.

What stood out to me was that this game caters to the purists who want all the old controls just enhanced graphics, but also to the crowd that wishes for more modern RTS controls. You may switch freely within the game menus.

The graphics look amazing and even the music was redone to great effect. So far this remake has worked flawlessly on my Windows 7 PC.

If you never played this game back when it was current, and are wondering if it's still worth it for you to pick up, I'd say yes. This remaster package contains a ton of content. I'm over 10 hours in and I have barely scratched the surface of the campaign. Even missions previously only playable on the console have been added in. Again, this is an example of a remaster done right, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.

One possible con I do want to bring up however, is there have been some complaints on the hard mode. What you will find is the enemy units will scale up or down in both HP and damage depending on your difficulty setting. Instead of getting outplayed by the AI, it can sometimes feel like they're cheating. Personally, I am still playing through every mission on hard and enjoy the challenge of having to so severely outplay the AI that I still win despite the numbers disadvantage... but I thought I would bring this up just in case.

The original was my favourite campaign, as it focuses more on the idea of simply building up a base and army then crushing the enemy. The Red Alert campaigns attempt to be complex to a fault, almost requiring puzzle-like or trial and error methods to be solved. There are definitely some flaws to the games which come with their age (for example, pathing is bad, and units will stand and die if they're being shot at) but they weren't an issue to me as I played on the Casual difficulty setting.

-Units more distinguishable from the original version.

31,70747496,english,"This game brings back so many memories, but I was expecting a bit more than remade ""cosmetics"". Nothing much changed. It's one of those games that's frustrating and I get mad while playing but after I chill I kinda wanna try again and hope it's gonna be better. It never really is, so I just can't recommend it. Price tag seems a bit high for an old game without much changes made.

Pros:
Really nice graphics and some gameplay improvements, like viewing health bar only when a vehicle in damaged and added building queue which are very nice

Cons:
The AI and pathfinding is still as dumb as you remember, and this is such a bummer for me. Sometimes you have to issues a command 3 times so the vehicle can perform it, other times you send a vehicle to the left side of the map and you see it start moving to the right and after messing around and rotating a bit, then it starts going to where you sent it - just dumb and annoying. Sometimes I order a flametank to pass a bridge and a few seconds later I find it just sitting there trying to torch a tree. What?!

Sometimes, if the terrain is too complex (cliffs and rivers) and you send a vehicle across, it will just stop and stare at a cliff, probably too hard to calculate a trajectory so it just gives up.
The most annoying thing of all has to be when you have a selection of multiple units and you command them to cross a bridge. That's simply painful to watch. All good until the first vehicle reaches the bridge. Then, all the other vehicles detect the bridge as being ""occupied"" or ""impassable"" so they suddenly make a detour through the whole map and split your forces if you're not careful. Dumb!

Then I found a lot of annoying bugs in some missions. For example, there's a GDI mission asking you to protect some civilians. All good until the civilians start walking around (fun times) on tiberium and start dying. After it happens a few times, guess what: mission failed. The most frustrating mission so far. It's clear to me that they rushed this remaster and did not bother to test it properly.

Another weird mission is a Nod mission asking you to destroy some Mammoth tanks which appear to be ""parked"" at the enemy base, so when attacking with the provided artillery, they won't fire back, but once you start attacking them with infantry they suddenly become active, would you please get your stuff straight?

Also, sometimes, on some missions the Gun Boat doesn't fire at all no matter what, but other times it just suddenly becomes active.

I've also witnessed 2 different zones on the map being airstriked at the same time. Wow, really? Not only that but the airstrike seems to have a ""laser targeting system"", since it actually follows a targeted vehicle, it doesn't seem to be a ZONE airstrike like I get to use. Lame and unfair.

Sometimes, a group of attacking enemy troops will simply freeze in place and will show up glitchy, like trying to perform a walking animation but remain in place. You can kill those easily.

The vehicle crushing troops is again performing poorly. Like when I have some troops fighting a tank, even pressing X multiple times I still end up with 5 troops being squashed all at once, while if I try to squash one single troop with a tank, it seems like I'm going over the soldier but I'm still not crushing him - overall it seems way harder to do it compared to how easy it seems for the AI. Maybe I just need more practice.

In the last GDI mission I suddenly see the NOD start building stuff near my base, just like that, out of nowhere. First, a Hand of Nod, then a power plant, then an obelisk just appeared near my base and started shooting my construction yard. What is this sorcery? How is that fair that the enemy can build anywhere on the map? I don't remember if this was an issue from the old game and they just ignored it, or if it's some kind of a new bug.

Another thing I noticed is they kinda messed with the damage. So I was having and APC run around an obelisk and it took 2 shots and the APC still had a bit of HP. Took it back to base and repaired it, and when I came back again it just one-shoted the APC. How does that even work? There's a critical damage now?
Other times I found my Rocket launcher was just killed by a flamethrower, which is actually pretty dumb. So it seems a bit more luck is involved. More than I remember. The Humvee also has moments where it takes half the HP of a trooper and moments when it completely misses. This one kinda makes sense, I guess, but they messed up the Artillery really bad, because it was doing a ton of damage in the old game, but now it misses 50% of the times so barely does any damage. 
I'm remembering a mission where you had a lot of artilleries available and you had to fight a Mammoth tank. Well, in the old game, 4 artilleries would crush that tank in seconds, while on the new remastered version they barely scratch the Mammoth. The tank can probably take out 12 artilleries no problem, it just one shots each of them. That makes the artillery the most useless vehicle in the whole game, thank you very much.

I won't advise buying this if you aren't willing to tolerate the lack of modern real-time strategy features, such as attack-move and all those things; but if you're looking for a nice challenge, this is it, and worth it. 

P.S. I grew up on Command and Conquer (full disclosure: my first game was Red Alert 2), and I love the series. Perhaps I'm too willing to disregard its faults, but, if nothing else, we can hope that this might lead to further remastered games down the road.

44,71089961,english,"For c&c fans and maybe some folks that like old school RTS games.

Has a few hitches here and there, but single player is pretty dope.  It's a little rough as they fixed a few old bugs that were in the game which made several missions much much harder, but they're all beatable and the new challenge is nice; however, there are a few new bugs and unit abuses that you can do and the pathing is a little more retarded than the original.  The mods need to be opened up to multiplayer because you can't use them in multiplayer at all atm.

Since I am talking about online play, the servers could use a little more polish.  Chat messages are delayed and every so often a game just drops everyone out of it which is mildly annoying.

Onto the guts, the 4k is nice.  Some of the videos it would have been nice if they did a personal touch to them like they did the intro as it's kind of obvious they just upscaled them and didn't have someone come through and do some editing. At all. This game doesn't even have a crazy amount of video length in it.
Lastly, there are a few late game missions on the nod side with the wrong intro and ending video.

Overall. If you're looking at this and thinking ""Should I?"", answer is probably should for $20 if you got nothing better to do.

As for those that just want to grab a game they know nothing about, no this isn't a complete overhaul of this game at all, you might like it, but it has quite a few QoL missing such as upgrading interaction with units to modern rts standards, pathing, making the AI slightly less retarded as I have won a few of the side campaigns simply by blocking the harvester with a stealth tank.  They need to beef the AI up in several mission rather just relying on the constant auto inject and attack stuff.  Kind of boring to just steam roll some missions when the mission before was extremely difficult.

This remaster should of fixed some the the massive problems the first 2 games had. The pathfinding on both games is still downright garbage and needs to have a toggle for at least skrimish. The skrimish AI on Red Alert 1 is still trash even on hard (they stop doing just about anything once they run out of ore to mine). I remember all of this being an issue back when I first played it and thats totally fine. Its just now that newer games are a thing (Seriously TS and RA2 are so much more playable now compared to this even with the new graphics) they play SOOO much better than these games and only should be seriously played to get campaign story or a shot of nostalga and thats about it.

I played the original C&C and RA when I was a kid and the remaster brings back that nostalgia and more. C&C formula has aged well, the grand father of RTS genre, C&C gameplay and missions design still stands out as stellar. The remaster is just more than a fresh coat of paint. This is the new benchmark to do remasters. 

[b] Graphics [/b]

Graphics have been upgraded that is worthy of the remaster title. The new models made from scratch by Lemon Sky are top notch all the while respecting and preserving the original design. The map tiles are also done in the same way. The additional details in the roads and other environmental details are admirable. The ability to instantly switch between classic and remaster mode makes this even more apparent and gives us the chance to appreciate the value of the remastered visuals.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

Gameplay is largely untouched including AI and path finding. But, there are lot of quality of life improvement that makes this remaster playable in the modern age. Build queues, right click commands, UI enhancements, Mini map upgrades all work really well to give this classic a chance to stay relevant with modern RTS advancements. Also acts of love like naming all the civilian building and giving civilians names are awesome gestures. 

A special mention should be made about the startup sequence that re-imagines the original installation screen. Its kick of nostalgia and the reality of the remaster mixed together.

13,70378531,english,"They've done an excellent job remastering the grand daddys of real time strategy, the new visuals preserve the original simple and colorful art excellently, one of the rare cases where you really never wanna flip back to the original visuals just because the new ones are better in every way due to them preserving the original art direction perfectly with updated graphics.

The game offers a fair share of QOL improvements but i personally wish it had more, as someone who has been using Open RA for the occasional skrimish match now for years, i was expecting this remaster to feature all of the QOL stuff that OpenRA had to be in this remaster since those same openRA devs helped with this remaster but that's not the case and it was done so on purpose according to the dev teams, the two main things i'm talking about is the lack of an attack more order and rally points, the reasoning being that the original devs feel it would impact too much the pacing and balancing of the original games as they were designed without those, however other things such as being able to set in ques for as many units as you want is in (thank god) , so no need to constantly keep clicking each unit in the building tab as it's building one by one like in the originals, there's also more hot key options, there's several options to make the controls in general feel more like a modern RTS such as being able to allow right click to order units instead of everything being bound to left click like in the original games,fully rebindable keys and fair share of other more modern rts improvements.

All of the amazing C&C music is fully remastered and sounds fantastic, hell if all you just wanna listen to is Hell March, you can with even several different version of it from early demos,different versions for each Red Alert,different remixes or early unfinished tracks all combined together. Just overall it has so many sound tracks packed in from both games and then on top of that a ton of additional bonus tracks either unreleased stuff or different remixes, plus if you want to you can turn on the original un-remastered songs if that's what you'd prefer.

All of the original FMV stuff is here and upscaled via an AI, it looks better but yeah it's still quiet a blurry mess because there's only so much you can do with a video file size of around 300x140.

The Red Alert campaigns are still enjoyable to this date, though have a slight annoying issue of requiring you to kill every single unit on the map sometimes but overall they're lots of fun and fairly well designed. 
However the C&C Tiberian Dawn campaigns on the other hand  have aged worse due to the map and mission design in certain missions being quiet more poorly designed such as the issue of GDI 8 having citizens you gotta protect that wander off to Tiberian fields requiring you to micro your harvesters to make sure they always gather tiberian near them that respawns otherwise you fail the mission if too many die or the fact the difficulty for the NOD campaign shoots up into the sky for mission 8 and 9 and in general as NOD it forces you to always use some tiny fraction of a force to deal with overwhelming odds and constant napalm strikes from GDI that track your movement so you can't dodge it and just have to rely on RNG as you keep reloading saves hoping the strike will go after someone else that's not a vital limited unit you have such as a commando.

The A.I and Path finding is fairly poor-ish still and i wish as i mentioned earlier in the QOL stuff that they took more notes from openRA which improves both of these. Skrimish AI can be fairly dumb and the path finding for your units is as bad as it was back in the day and should've not been preserved in the remaster but instead improved upon. It will wavy on how much you can tolerate problematic path finding, i can handle it thought it can be pretty annoying but i still find myself enjoying the game a lot but i wish it was simply improved and i can see a lot of people easily being put off by the bad path finding because mashing the stop movement keybinding in hopes your long range unit actually stops to engage an enemy outside its range instead of rolling right infront of it is not something attribute to skill I'd say , more so just old bad path finding.

So overall it's a fantastic remaster package that us old C&C fans have been waiting and wanting forever, it preserves and improves all the good stuff but also sadly preserves some of the bad such as the poor Skrimish AI, bad path finding and the lack of some QOL stuff.

However some of these things may be added/improved by the community, the game has full modding support, the code for the game has become fully open source released via githubb and the steam version comes packing with a workshop so the future can only the bright for this and hopefully it shall lead to a C&C 2 Remaster for Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2.

*UPDATE, some new issues*
Did encounter some new issues, during skrimish matches the game might not render explosions with the new remastered visuals, it seems to be utterly random as some matches they render fine and then others not. 

I also have encounter a frame rate issues, if playing on a very large map with 8 AI and picking Allies where you gain the ability to see the whole map makes the fps drop all the way down to 30 , only happens on the largest 8 player maps.

These do damage somewhat the positive review i left for this collection but I'd still recommend it at the end as the problems are not very frequent, hopefully it gets fixed down the line.",1591436310,1592603768,True,2,0,0.53125,0,True,False,False,76561197998133593,562,161,3861,0,256,1600772821

1. Stupid harvesters
2. Stupid pathfinding
3. While the enemy (in single player) can easily devastate 5-10 infantry units of your forces, your vehicles need luck (even with direct order) to hit 1 or 2 enemy infantries - this is very unjust.

~25 years before these issues were the best RTS's issues, there were no better options so we endured it in those times, but now after ~25 years these problems are particularly painful.
The game is great and fantastic to play it again, but when these issues affect the gameplay, sometimes feels unplayable and hard - because we've forgotten how to manage the base building and the micromanagment of several harvesters and a few troop movements at the same time.

the updated grphx are good and fit the tone of the game. and you can use space bar to hot swap beween versions, that is an amazing feature.
the cinematics have been upgraded as best as can but i am glad they decided to keep the low poly cutscenes in between missions. all in all worth getting if not to show ea the true way forward.
keep this up EA and you may yet redeem yourself.

Units and structures, while still somewhat simplistic, are far better detailed thanks to the redone models. No more pixelated blobs that vaguely resemble a tank. Also, game runs at 60 fps. Feels good. 

Only con I've had is that the AI hasn't changed much, if at all, since the original release; your units are often dumb as bricks, so micromanaging them for the best path/engaging enemies is sometimes necessary.

Quick summary- this is a good step in the right direction. Let's reinforce this behavior from EA by supporting them and the developers so hopefully they're continue along this path.

But there are many minor annoyances and the missions are bland and uninteresting. Do not buy if you're just curious about the lore, go watch it on Youtube.

I like what this game represents. Publishers listening to the fans and giving the developers the time and funds to do justice to a widely beloved game from the past.  I saw the developers on Reddit and other communities, working with playtesters and others to work out the kinks and let the game smoothly transition into the modern age. I want this to be a success because I would love to see the 2nd generation of CnC and the Generals era get a remaster as well. One of the reasons I bought the game. To show EA and others that this is what you do to win people over and get them excited for your products. I did not have high expectations after watching Blizzard bungle the War3 Reforged. EA doesn't have the goodwill Blizzard used to have so this could have been bad. But I was relieved to see it was the same company that did the SC1 remaster which was awesome.

But with all the positives, there ARE negatives. I know they did to CnC what they did with SC1 and not change unit pathing/behaviors since they were so integral to the game's difficulty and the fact that someone times when you're leading the genre from the front, sometimes mistakes are made. I absolutely abhor unit behaviors in this remaster. While I can understand pathing issues being part of the legacy of the difficulty, some stuff really should have been cleaned up when this era of the game was modernized. I hate it when I tell a group of 6 hotkeyed Orcas to go bomb something, and one stays on the pad like 'nah' even though he's still selected with the group and the others went off just fine. 

Or having to micro a unit to defend itself. I would've really liked for a unit that's being attacked from outside of it's range to close the range and retaliate, like with Light Scouts vs Artillery or a rifleman vs a rocket infantry. Them standing there till they die is extremely annoying. Also after telling a unit to attack an enemy unit, sometimes they just stop returning fire mid fight and you have to tell them again. Or if it's multiple enemies, the unit will kill one,  then need to be told to engage the others. This is unit behavior that really should have been cleaned up before release.

The thing that can't be helped is the missions. I find them very boring and very tedious. I'm plowing through them a couple at a time before I have to take a break. Some missions are counter-intuitive as well, such as bum rushing an objective and if at least one unit survives the storm, you are victorious. Even though the unit will die in the next second and the objective is still surrounded by hostiles. Or charge past the starting point with all your units into an unexplored map while you're taking fire and set up a base and hope there are resources nearby. It just doesn't make sense. And just about every mission boils down to 'kill every hostile unit on the map'. Boring.

I know EA isn't going to look at the reviews on Steam when they play if they want to do more in the future, they're going to look at revenue. Which is why I supported the Remaster and bought it, even though I don't really much like it and I cannot recommend it to people without a large asterisk next to a recommendation.

I encourage the Remaster and hope it continues to the next in the series but for people hoping that the game was Remastered with the Quality of Life additions we're used to nowadays, don't bother.

28,70979364,english,"[h1]Remastered not remade, but still a classic[/h1]

[b] The Short Version [/b]

This is a remastered game, so if you played the original, you wont find much in the way of new content here, there are a few exceptions however, such as the addition of online multiplayer severs, skirmish maps for both titles, and Steam Workshop support.

The game play is still as engaging as I remember it, and is sure to provide hours of fun for fans of the original, as well as those looking for a classic real time strategy game.


[b] First Impressions [/b]

When you first boot up the game, you will be asked which title you wish to play, be it C&C or C&C Red Alert. When you make your selection you are thrust into an opening cinematic which visualises the enhancing of the audio and video quality, you'll know when I mean when you see it.

The first thing I did was jump into a GDI campaign, which is exactly how I remember it, quirky acting and all, with the obvious graphical improvements. The sound quality is also noticeably better, with tracks from the original left unaltered, as well as completely remastered tracks which sounds fantastic, and are true to the franchise. 

[b] Graphics [/b]

The graphics are obviously far and away better than the original, something I hadn't realised until I played the game myself however, was that you can switch between the classic graphics and the remastered ones on the fly simply by pressing the space bar. This is a nice feature as you can easily forget just how much work has clearly gone into polishing them.

[b] Audio [/b]

The original C&C soundtrack was iconic, and this remaster is no different, the soundtrack is as good as I remember, having a sort of electro-punky vibe. There's an in game jukebox which lets you create custom playlists, and swap between the classic tracks and the remastered variants. 

The Unit sounds have also been noticeably enhanced, there is an option in the options menu to switch between the classic sounds and the remastered variants, however the remastered sounds are both true to the franchise and much more pleasing to the ears. 

[b] Gameplay [/b]

This is the classic C&C you remember, so honestly there's not much to say. 

The Campaign is great, though perhaps a bit easy for many people. You Unlock new units as the missions progress. There's not much variety with mission types though, with the stable being the standard ""build a base and destroy the enemy base"" missions. Where there is variety, the game falls a bit flat, the best example of this would be one of the GDI missions in which you are tasked with getting a resource crate back from the enemy. As soon as you collect the crate the mission ends, you don't have to get it back to a base or anything. This means that you can essentially just select you fastest unit and click on the top right corner of the map, causing your unit to do a mad dash to the crate and completing the mission in about 30 seconds. 

Skirmish mode, is slightly different. There's a good variety of maps, and game modes, such as Capture the Flag, Mobile HQ (which requires you to defend a mobile unity while destroying the enemies, no base building allowed), and the standard base building staple the series is known for. My only slight gripe is the AI, which tends to build duplicates of structures for no good reason, or place defensive buildings in strange places. That being said, it's a fun little sandbox to try out all the units away from the campaign, or just practice for multiplayer.

Multiplayer is of course a lot more challenging, with a good amount of servers available, and, as of writing this review, a decent number of players. With ingame chat to coordinate your attacks, or simply socialise a bit, it's a nice, laid back RTS experience which won't be a huge time sink. 

[b] Workshop Support [/b]

From what I've seen, most of the mods fit into one of __ categories. Cheats, Quality of Life, and add-ons. Cheats range from build speed bonuses to god-mode. Quality of life mods are mostly AI enhancements to fix some of the things I mentioned earlier. The add-ons are a bit sparse at the moment, though I did find a Dino mod which adds dinosaur to each factions roster. 

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]

If you're looking to play a simple fun RTS, then this is a great place to start. With multiple game modes, multiplayer support and a campaign, I highly recommend this game to fans of the series, and indeed of RTS games generally. That being said, if you're looking for a serious and complex RTS, you may want to look elsewhere.",1592485996,1592485996,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198005563377,206,2,491,0,398,1593685140

•Nice graphics, considering the older version. 
•Excellent music. 
•Funny cutscenes.
•Unlike many other people, skirmish was the best part imo. Playing with friends is even better.

[u]The Bad[/u]
•Words cannot describe how terribly clunky this game is. This is one of those instances where going beyond a graphical overhaul was needed. 

•Some of the missions are blatantly unfair, very early in the campaign too. Have fun on mission 3 as the GNU. You get 8 infantry, a humvee, and a couple apcs. They get a horde of infantry, tanks, and a base where they can build more units. On the level I counted ~40-50 enemy infantry, ~2 tanks, and ~5 Nod humvees. I don't know if it was like this in the original game, but in this version this is absolute bullshit.

•You cannot attack move, but the AI can. You will need to be microing like crazy to keep up.

•A single tank can run over an entire army of infantry. Due to the terrible pathfinding and the way units clump up, this issue is exasperated. Don't build infantry you say? Not up to you in the missions where you have no base and only start with units.

----------------------------------------------

21,70931031,english,"I am biased here; the Command and Conquer games were amongst my first PC gaming experiences.

This is a fantastic remaster. It isn't perfect and that in many ways makes it better. The units still have the bad route planning and weird attack patterns as they did the original and the AI can often in missions still do impossible things like reconstruct parts of their base way outside of the build range.  That said, the graphics are smooth, the game runs on very low spec PCs at good FPS, the switching between modern and old graphics is a smooth and brilliant transition. It is the game you remember, with a more modern UI (similar to RA2) and better features.

My only criticism comes in the form of firstly that 16:10 resolutions are not supported and secondly that modern video games have spoiled me to want an autosave feature for single player. Remember, losing a mission after you've spent 20 minutes building your base and not saved means restarting. This is something I haven't really dealt with for 15 years in a single player game and it's definitely a jarring experience now.

Aside from that, if you love RTS, if you love C&C, this is a must buy. Hell, even if you haven't experienced what is probably the birth of the modern RTS genre I'd say it's worth it. Hopefully they'll remaster the later games (RA2 and Tiberian Sun) too.

Oh, while they worked incredibly hard on the cutscene remastering, there is clearly only a finite amount they can do with low resolution video. It's also a shame in a way they didn't make new renderings for the 3D generated cutscene areas, but that's a small complaint.",1592396320,1592396320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197963490178,405,3,1086,38,697,1601509065

The presentation, the remastered graphics and audio, and all the special features really show a surprising level of dedication from an EA team. 
The flaws come from the original game. The game is actually very difficulty by modern standards, which wouldn't be too much of a problem if it wasn't for the issues with commanding your units. Soldiers ignoring orders, tanks that decide to drive right up to the defense turrets you were trying to avoid. You can deal with it and the game is still one hundred percent playable, but it unfortunately leads to a  lot of lost units and deaths that could easily be avoided and ultimately a strategy game where you feel like you don't have full control of your units is a big problem. Still the whole package is designed to appeal to nostalgia, so anyone buying this collection will already know what they're in for.

Many RTS actions were streamlined and made more intuitive in later C&C games, Starcraft, AoE, etc, but here they are extremely annoying and discouraging. Things such as wonky pathfinding, units not auto-attacking when you might expect them to, infantry loading into the carrier vehicles slowly one-by-one, Orca air units not being able to move into un-revealed sections of the map, and mandatory micromanagement that requires you to understand the quirks of the gameplay have led me to give up on many occasions.

The new ""casual"" difficulty turns the game into a non-challenge, which is suitable for those who just want to enjoy the goofy cutscenes and overall aesthetic/gameplay without any fear of losing. There's also a lot of strategy/balance stuff, such as which units to use in a given situation, that are not explained in cutscenes or in-game, requiring an outside guide to learn.

36,70474937,english,"Updated Review: It took them a week and a half to add a patch, not good, not terrible, but the patch itself is awful. Not only did my one issue not get fixed and I still can't search or see my ranking in any way, they also changed the MP game rules which was the reason I was having fun originally in that I was playing the original games and their expansions as they were 2 decades ago. Now MP does not give you starting units which is how I liked it and the Retaliation expansion units have been removed, and there is no choice to opt out of this change for the quick matches of which I feel like I have played 100 and until the last 3 enjoyed it. 

Now its gone from building a base up and picking at each other until someone gets enough troops to get through and win to being immediately rushed by dozens of basic infantry and whoever gets them to the enemy base first to break a power plant wins. Don't tell me that starting units and retaliation units made the game predictable or too short when I have seen the same tactic in 3 matches in row and at best what you get is a race to get a couple of tanks first. I don't want to play like this and its not what I paid for, literally in the sense that I paid for Retaliation units and now I don't get them (NEVER lost a game because of Tesla Tanks or whatever else was so overpowered.) 

And what will change next patch? The point of this was that the game was supposed to have new graphics and audio with minimal other changes, and suddenly when my refund period is well and over and I have had nearly 2 weeks of fun it gets changed? What will get changed next when people decide this still isn't balanced? at what point will it be good enough because frankly it won't ever end, ever change will allow new exploits or BS strategy and I don't want to relearn the game every week or month or whatever while they tweak it, I want to play what I payed for. And the worst part of that is the last guy I played I chatted with before the game ended and he said he saw a good ""meta build"" and it works well (I agree, I wasn't sure what he did to build up so fast). So what exactly is the change doing except getting people to read a new guide on how to play? I knew how to play because I have had access for 24 years, and there were loads of build orders and guides to help new players catch up on what isn't that complicated of a game if you have any RTS knowledge. I don't want to have to look up the best strategy as it changes but since thats what everyone will do and I don't know how long I will have to learn this version of the game before the next promised update they will give us I have no choice but to read what I ""need to do"" or lose, so whats the point? I am not going to keep playing and trying to keep up with constantly ""balancing"" of a game older than students I taught 10 years ago. Keep it, I will try for a refund but don't expect that to work so now I just have another letdown in my steam library I guess. I expect this from EA, not from Petroglyph.



Original Review: This game runs with few issues and they say that is being worked on (some stutters in MP, I have only dealt with it on the first day in 2 matches and 30+ matches later it hasnt happened again). The only issue I have is  not even game play related, its that I cant see my ranking. I see the top 200 players and that is all. Cant search myself but I have nearly 40 1v1 matches in and while I doubt I am doing spectacular I win at least 1 in 3 and would like to see how I rank overall.

43,70362988,english,"This remaster is without a shadow of a doubt should be the industry standard fro ALL remasters in the future. It is truly a work of digital art. Let me tell you something, I have been a PC gamer for over 25 years and I owe it all to Command & Conquer, It was the very first game I ever owned on any computer and I have never had any regrets of any kind. 

The remaster of both Red Dawn and Tiberium Dawn is so very faithful to the originals that I had forgotten I wasn't even playing the original games, The two main campaigns have had some minor improvements to them but are largely been left the same way as they were in the originals with updated cutscenes. But the biggest change is the addition of all the Covert op missions, which for me was one of the most memorable parts of the originals.

The new high-def sprites and textures are downright PERFECT! and I do not use that term lightly, Everything is sharp and colourful in full HD with huge improvements to the overall quality of life of both games just make it all the more enjoyable to play, It's so refreshing to be able to utilize the entire monitor and see so much of the map due to the graphic updates and the radar minimap is actually helpful now and that was something that always bugged me when I played it as a kid. The classic gameplay really hasn't changed all that much and is still as simple as it was back in the 90's and early 2000's, which is something that veteran RTS gamers like me will tell you is not a bad thing.

Did I mention that there are difficulty settings now? No! Well there is now, believe it or not and this is something that the original C&C back in 95 didn't have and most definitely needed. 

But the absolute best part about the remaster was the music, holy shit sonny boy!! the music in this remaster is what makes this game one of the greatest remastered game I have EVER played in the last decade or so and I will not be told otherwise.
   
In conclusion, Command & Conquer Remastered is in my opinion, One of the greatest remasters to ever be created in the last decade. When I first heard that EA was remaking C&C I was so sure that they would botch it up in their typical EA style But the minute that I started playing I was hit by a tidal wave of nostalgia and I honestly felt like that same scrawny kid sitting at his first PC again, and all I could do was smile.",1591409293,1592369585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198008298655,106,4,1312,0,27,1599102500

This remastered version is like a Christmas present to the 11-year-old still in my heart. The remastered graphics are pleasant and crisp, while retaining the original games character perfectly. There are steam achievements, controls are modernized with features common to current RTS games, and, the feature that made me decide to leave this review: the original recordings of the takes from the actors for every cutscene mission. I mean, its just so cool to watch.

If you loved Tiberian Dawn and played it on DOS or Windows 95, you are going to LOVE this game. If you're new to the game then you'll want to know that this is a remastered and modernized version of a very old video game.

The quality of life features introduced here help the game hold up quite well, but the path finding and lack of space for units to move around in some cases can definitely show their age.

The 4k graphics are fantastic, faithful to the original art and silky smooth with a much higher framerate supported than the original. The music is not only as good as it always was, but now it's even better with multiple variations of many of the songs to choose from and create your ultimate C&C playlist.

Then there's the price, which is extremely fair given the amount of work and respect that was put into this. Seriously, even when it's not on sale, it's a steal so if you like what you see, then waste no more time and grab it.

As a remaster, it's hands down a 10/10, one of the best I have personally experienced. The game itself for what shortcomings it suffers with it's age, makes up for with tonnes of charm and personality that you don't get a lot in most RTS games anymore in my opinion. Couple this with the love poured into this product, the mod support and the community involvement and you have got yourself an 8/10 game overall, in fact I will bump it up to an 8.5 because of the fact that there's no Origin requirement.

I hope other games in the series will get a similar treatment such as Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2, but I also hope this means we might get a chance at either getting a new C&C or even just having the HD era games upgraded to support things like 60fps, because graphically they still hold up very well.",1592279463,1592279885,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198012202204,651,75,172,0,167,1596425909

Over all i have played every C&C game and i couldn't wait for this one to be remastered since the other war on older OS an not formatted for widescreen.


The only thing i have found to be a real problem is the HARD mod setting because it really un-balances all the units. It removes strategy an having to match your units for what your enemy has. Instead the enemy can kill you 100% of the time 1v1 Humvee vs light tank? You would expect the tank to win but on HARD-mode it looses. Light tank vs medium it takes around 3 or more to kill one and have a fighting chance.

AI is too good at squishing your units and evading your tanks. It kills yours about 90% of the time and they evade like 80% which makes you block paths with tanks if you even want to use infantry or just SQUISH!!

Campaign and Spec Ops return as well as exclusive console missions. They are a great way to dive into the story. Relive the story of GDI, NOD, Allies, and Soviet forces like they were before. Only this time with better quality graphics. Speaking of graphics they are a huge improvement, you can even switch to the older graphics in single player if you like.

The only consideration and potential deal breaker is that aside from ability to queue unit production it is almost a totally authentic remake. If like me you are a regular RTS player then you will be taken aback at first by how much compromise you had to make in 1995/96. 

If you want modern RTS quality of life features you need to install mods via the Steam Workshop or you need to consider one of the alternatives.  I think if EA hadn't been authentic though they would have been criticised very badly so I can understand why they went this direction.

Openra which is free is a good approximation of Red Alert and Tiberian Sun, but introduces a lot of consideration for modern play such as the ability to build defence structures independently and queue construction yard building construction. It also has compromises in that it is not a perfect replica. If you want nostalgia alone in Skirmish or multiplayer mode, it is just as good as this and in gameplay it's probably better. 

C&C 3 and Kanes Wrath is a great RTS from circa 2008 which was perhaps the first ""remake"" of Tiberian Dawn.

One other thing to note that I really like a lot, unlike playing the original C&C on Origin, I don't encounter any sort of game crashes while playing on Steam either, which prevents me from being taken out of the mood to play because I'd have to reboot the game and pick up where I left off from in a mission, etc.

I played the original on PS1, and was young.  I didn't dislike it back then.  Remember the Army Men games on PS1?   I liked those.

But this remaster is great.  I'm not adept with setting Group controls, nor am I fast at building.  But this game has a strong simplicity that makes matches fun.  On the other hand, it's intricacies play out over time, making it feel very in-depth.  Succeeding at both is an achievement back then, and it's still cool now.

The switch-back to PS1 graphics is awesome.  The music:  10/10 would play on youtube while working.  Fantastic.

Drawbacks?  I wish it the graphics switch worked online (I may be wrong)
I wish there was a party system and private match option.  Online structure is very rudimentary;  I hope for updates on this.
The netcode/connectivity is fine so far.
Please PLEASE allow an option to turn off the money sound!!!

Nothing here is game breaking.  All functional it seems.  Very akin to the past.

What I love most is that someone like me, a non-RTS gamer in general, can pick this up, play it enjoyably and quickly understand the Chess-like strategy in a simple enough manner to where I can create my own strategy.  Other RTS games try so hard to be so much.  So many intricacies.  50,000,000 options that eventually pertain to the original one.  Overloaded numbers at high rates.

Simply put, this is a well made nostalgia ride through and through. Great for anyone who wants to have a (mostly) bug free return to the original C&C Real-Time Strategy system, with some extra polish updates to the User Interface, graphics, and game engine.

Pros
- Updated to run on modern PCs
- Classic interface
- Nostalgic feeling from Installing the game to the last mission
- Behind the scenes extras as mission rewards, beyond progressing the story
- Easy to get into for new to Command and Conquer players, or those who never had a chance to play the originals
- Remastered Visuals and Iconic Soundtrack while still having access to the original assets that you can switch between in game

Cons
- Nostalgic issues with the interface, pathing, general AI difficulty
- The fact you easily switch between the enhance and original graphics by accident (spacebar)
- There are some issues when using the modern style interface option making the whole affair feel a bit clunky

Personal thoughts that can be both Pros and Cons (in other words take these with a grain of salt/sand):
- This remaster points out how extremely simple older RTS games where to the newer version we have out today, in size of maps, scope of abilities, how many different ways there are to solve a mission, complexity of missions, etc. etc.
- There are bugs(?) or issues, most of the ones I have come across are small and easily over looked or ignored and all have to do with the User Interface and the AI in general, that being said the this is a remaster so having the same issues/limitations that were there originally would make some sense.
-The mission intro/outros being only 'brushed up' (I realize that this is likely an understatement of the monumental task it was to make these videos clean enough for 1080 to 4k)  is a bit of a bummer, but I understand it isn't like they can just go out and ask the actors to comeback and re-shoot all of the story scenes at the drop of the hat and sell this game at the $20 USD price point we have at release.

98,70352166,english,"TL;DR

While there are some nice imporvements and extras, this remastered version is lackluster from many aspects. Bugs remained, quality of life improvements were ignored/not implemented and such.

--------------

Ok, so I'm an avid player of the original C&C franchise and I have one of the fondest childhood memories of playing the campaign during the summer break. This remastered is definitely nice on the surface, some elements are absolutely on the spot and one may feel spoiled. Expanded, better quality music jukebox, improved graphics, yet faithful to the original games and such.

So, why the negative review? Because some -for me- crucial elements got ignored, big time. The game is prone to crashing, it's getting ridiculous that one shall not (pre-)purchase games day one, because what you will get is a glitch-fest. Sometimes enabling Steam overlay wreaks havoc with the mouse control. Auto-save is not included and add the crashing, it's a surefire way to have to replay the same, when you accidentially forgot to save.

There are some issues which either remained from the old game, or new ones, not sure about that, since it's been ages I played the original ones. E.g. in C&C if you have more than one harvester for a refinery, those could go crazy by circling around the refinery in an endless loop, while wrecking your economy. The fix is to sell the refinery and the associated harvesters. Definitely not cool.

In Red Alert you can't mass select 5 units and board the water transport vehicle, because those 5 units will start to circle the transport vehicle in an endless loop. Solution? Board the vehicle, one by one, which is extremely redundant, given the late game scope of fighting with dozens of units.

Planes will go crazy / refuse to land in a repair bay, assuming that there are helipads or airfields next to the repair bay. The planes will start circling around in a short radius like crazy.

In some mission you can queue unit building, in some missions you can't. What does it depend on? No fucking idea.


Anyhow, the original game is strong and immersive enough to make it a justifiable purchase, but I can't ignore how annoying these small things are. And those things are dime by the dozen, e.g. the original, live actor FMV videos have improved resolution, but the CGI ones look like shit. Given that those were very short ones, would it be such a chore to re-shoot them? Highly doubt that. In 4k resolution the mouse pointer is so small, that it's a literal pixel hunt (on a 150cm TV) and the list could go on forever.",1591390537,1592163828,False,3,0,0.46841055154800415,0,True,False,False,76561197982556767,640,39,3173,0,109,1592762297

8,70789922,english,"This game has been a long time coming, the remaster of the original Command and Conquer and Red Alert with all their expansions.
Of course the issues one MIGHT have is just how it's basically the originals (Flaws and all) but with a very nice coat of paint; I know I was unpleasantly surprised by my tanks either taking circuitous routes needlessly or just trying to circumvent the travel time and running against a wall instead of going anywhere as an example.

This does not taint my overall experience and the good news is that you do not need an high tier borderline supercomputer to run the games: Just a decent PC or Laptop will do you nicely. The bonuses are also nice for those who care and the Jukebox allows one to simply create their own soundtracks if the default background tracks don't do it for you, which have both the original tracks and the remasters, along with versions done by the Tiberian Suns, the band that Frank Keplacki started and runs. Look up 'Tiberian Suns MAGfest' for a good example/sample of the tracks used in the Remaster.

The Difficulty Settings are actually not the best approaches, Casual is easy babby mode (Enemies make far more mistakes *Good* and are so neutered health and damage-wise *Bad*) while Hard is 'Eat a dick' mode (Smarter foes and Higher Aggression *Good* Your units are weaker while theirs are INSANELY strong *Bad*). THANKFULLY: You can mod this and EVERY OTHER PROBLEM YOU HAVE so it's more to your liking/no longer an issue.


Overall, while this will not be enough to fully Redeem EA (It's more of a step in the RIGHT direction), this is very much worth buying and playing, literally 20 dollars to get both games and all the little goodies they put in there, from 4K Resolution upgrades to modding, to the soundtrack and BTS clips, INCLUDING tracks that never made it into the games proper. If you want yourself a Command and Conquer game, then let me just say the following.

That said, if Electronic Arts had an epiphany and decided to redeem themselves, what would they do? (IMHO)

They would do exactly everything that they did to make this remaster happen.

Preserve the original gameplay, but update the graphics and UI with as light a touch as possible. Check.
Involve the community from the outset, respond to their input, and follow through with a product that meets their expectations.  Check.
Trust the original developers (now Petroglyph) to get the job done AND instruct your suits to LEAVE THEM THE HELL ALONE to facilitate this. Check.
Give the development team a reasonable timeline and budget to release a finished product. (Presumed) Check.
When we DO modernize an element with new quality-of-life features, preserve the ability to turn those features off. Check.
Add a few updates that the original version always needed, without introducing breaking changes to the original game design. Check and check. (online replays are a great example of this)
Resist the temptation to ""enhance"" the gameplay with ""fun"" elements like lootboxes. Check.
Make the game available in a store-agnostic fashion. Check.
Allow your players to just play without keys, online accounts/logins, crap/spyware installations, registration, always-online connections, oppressive or broken DRM (as opposed to reasonable DRM), 50 page EULAs, a dozen or more day one DLC's, or other hassles. Check.
Produce (or in this case, re-produce) a great game at a reasonable price. Check.
Open source the some/all of the codebase for modding. Check.
Include a KICK A** soundtrack remaster from Frank Klepacki, and to sweeten the pot further, the original as well. Check. (this one alone is worth the price)

I'll just throw this out there, this game preserves the original mechanics, ALL of them: UI-wonkiness, pathfinding issues, faction balancing, etc (note: some modern control schemes can be toggled on or off). The software world has learned a lot of things about RTS design in the years since C&C TS and C&C RA released, and those things rewind here. If you are looking for a modern experience, please do your research before purchasing this game, as others have said, if you don't like the originals (DosBox-based copies of the originals are available online to try free of charge), you will NOT like this.

Also, on the downside, I did experience some stuttering when playing 8 player skirmish mode in Red Alert (single player/AI). If there are a lot of units on the screen, it seems to skip screen updates, and becomes somewhat difficult to play. It is my understanding that the devs are aware of and looking at this issue.

This is a perfect remaster, it has all the inaccessible additions from the ps1 version, it improves the graphics interface, it adds a lot of flavors for older players and cool features like changing graphics in real time, the whole thing with soundtracks, etc., custscenes are uncompressed and in super quality.

The AI is a clusterf*ck.
I don't believe a word that they didn't change the AI - they DID, and they made it WORSE.

Situation : GDI Gunboat attacking some Nod Turrets along the shore. (Basically, every GDI mission with a Gunboat.)
Orignial AI : Gunboat attacks the a turret, then switches target when the one it was attacking goes out of range.
Remastered AI : Gunboat attacks the first turret it encounters, and ONLY ever targets and attacks that unless either the turret or the gunboat is dead, or the gunboat was MANUALLY ordered to stop or attack a different target.

Seriously, the entire thing is a f*cking mess.
Move, attack and stop orders being ignored outright, units not even retaliating...
Hell, I've seen an entire group of enemy grenadiers die because they refused to fight back against ONE minigunner.

The only redeeming quality of this crap would be the jukebox. (And the bonus gallery.)

What, the graphics? Oh, they look good...while it works.
The remastered graphics overlay DESYNCS when there's too much going on on screen.

I wish that they would have done a little more effort with the CGI. Seeing the old videos was fun, but some of them were extremely dated. Some of the upscaled videos looked really good, but a lot of the CGI ones looked horrendous .

The AI is terrible. Unit pathing is quite bad, and the comp is just as dumb as I remember. Also the AI cheats horrendously. It can build units instantly, has access to unlimted money, can build wherever it wants to, and can built multiple structures at a time. If you do not rush the computer and take out their con yard and barracks/war factory, then you will be facing an endless stream of enemies.

11,70749629,english,"It is kind of hard for me to express my feelings about it. I grew up with Command & Conquer, even though not the first ones but still. But i decided to give it a fair review before i am going to refund it. There are just some intentional flaws i cannot overburden in 2020 anymore, even if itself speaks remaster and was kind of stated to be this way. Also it dont really need this kind of review anymore since this game is already accepted one dimensional. So this take off is more of a state of how i need to justify my action for my mind.

First of all, this remaster is not bad at all, it is indeed good, but obivously not very good in my opinion. If you wanna seek out these very good remasters in the same genre look for Homeworld. But beware it is a different game. Im not trying to compare these to different games here. I was merely calling the „remaster“ part to be better in this case. It is definitely not the better game or that sort. That is something everyone of us decides on its own.

The score in this game is just pure eargasm. Frank Klepacki did a good job in reworking all that stuff and even adding some new ones. I even joked with my friend that i would buy this for the musik alone. I mean 20 bucks for an Album, why not?

The graphics are ok i guess, something to be expected from a remaster and we already knew what was coming since we already got some glimpse how it will look like from last year, if you followed the development. But a very nice feature was added and that is the instant swapping between the old and the new graphics which is very cool!

What i also like are the freshed out cutscenes. In particular the remade intro scene when you start your game for the first time. I liked it very much and found it a very cool idea to do so.

The combined campaigns of Tiberiun Dawn and Red Alert + all addons have dozens of hours to play. The content is massive and this alone would be already worth to buy.

But the thing that just kept me thinking to refund is just simply the A.I. behaviour/pathfinding alone. It just drove me insane the first half hour i played. But i am also confident that it gets better over time and can be easily ignored/to live with, especially if you are a fan. I honestly cannot recall how it was in the original, probably the same… but i personally just dont want to deal with it anymore.

After listing almost good features it is paradoxic and i also dont really understand it either. They also implied they dont want to differ the remaster’s experience from the original.

Well now I get to feel more like a Command and Conquer fan with this remaster, which is WELL DONE. And I don't know where to start with it's praises, whether I should talk about how they were able to render the graphics of a game from the 90s that is impressive, or about the arsenal of music both master and remastered, the hours of enjoyable online multiplayer which has allowed me to in a way feel trained by the Veterans from those Commander's who fought for the Glory of Kane or Keeping Europe Free from Stalin's tesla tanks, it feels like I can connect with the Veterans and learn something more when it comes to fighting for one of the four factions in the game (as a whole) and just like Star Wars games, every person has their favourite faction to fight for (NOD, GDI, ALLIES or SOVIETS) with each having an advantage and a disadvantage. 

But I would recommend that you pick up this game and get your own experience from this, and hey i hope to see you there Commander.

imagine how amazed i was to see it remastered and available on steam!
although its by EA (which i usually avoid) i though sod it, its for nostalgia's sake! my old school friends can get back to having a winner stays on C&C championship but this time, i don't need to carry my Playstation over to his house and the front room TV.

The Lag is horrific, if you so much as build more than 30 tanks or a 200 infantry and send them at an enemies base, you're in for some seriously poor frame rates.. for instance, i've had to self fix mid games to rectify it every time it takes a nose dive.
You can also tell when the AI is on the Offensive as the whole game stutters, my temporary fix you ask? 
I simply press pause and wait for the game to catch up and actually pause. the longest i have had to wait now is 48 seconds, yes that's right, 48 seconds of the game still playing behind the pause screen.
only for it to catch up, play for a minute or two and it needing me to pause again. 

Now there will be a snotty comment from some cretin who's own uncle would'nt touch, that will comment on 48 seconds being nothing, yeah you're right, its a slight inconvenience but when it happens all the time, it gets old, because in that time, its playing behind the pause screen, you cant fight, direct or defend. 
also happens when you have a map high in crystals, a map with more than 4 AI, a  map with a lot of water.
and there is No way its my set up, so i hit some forums, seems i'm not the only one, people with better rigs than me are even struggling.

There's also a huge issue with stupid AI, that, if they cant see ore on their radar, they don't farm, they sit there, spamming troops and buildings until they go broke, then they just turtle and don't move.
also the unit paths, you click on a enemy building with a V2 or a tank, the drive right up to it and sit on it, either getting nuked by your enemy or dying from splash damage from your own tanks.
I have even encountered AI nuking them selves!??!! I've had to turn super weapons off so i can actually kill them.

in short, i have a rule of staying away from EA but i thought, remastering an old game, they cant screw that up right?
well, EA, you don't let me down do you. 
You have fingered the hypothetical rear end out of the command on conquer franchise and when you ""remaster"" a brilliantly made classic, you still somehow, screw it up royally.. its actually quite sad. i mean i was expecting at some point to have to pay to unlock the refinery or mammoth tanks...

62,70737630,english,"To save myself a lot of typing, I agree with other negative reviews. 

C&C Remastered received a graphical facelift, an updated OST, and a slightly enhanced UI (I do not remember building power drain indicators or unit build times in the originals), but it is sorely lacking in modern features like attack-moving, or shift-clicking to select similar units. 

Pathing in particular is abysmal. It's so bad, I question if Petroglyph and Lemon Sky made things worse. In every multiplayer session, if a unit is given a directive, and its path is blocked, it will travel the entire length of the map to find another path. It never ""refreshes"" a search for that path even when it has been cleared, to go back. This means that tanks and harvesters will casually drive through enemy bases just to clear a bridge or some other narrow terrain. It's silly. 

Units are unresponsive in combat. You just have to A-select everything and hope for the best as you click units individually. The game isn't very responsive to micro. 

C&C Remastered is a mega nostalgia bomb, but yeah, I agree...I'd rather play the remastered version of StarCraft, or better yet, Homeworld.

Attempt 1: Set up base near the civilians and tiberium, as I'm gearing up for an attack I hear people screaming from tiberium poisoning, I assume it's just some dumb nod infantry and think nothing of it, as I approach the enemy base MISSION FAILED. I come to the realization that the civilians ran into the tiberium fields to commit mass suicide.

Attempt 2: I harvest up all the tiberium near the civlians the prevent them from committing suicide, a chopper lands full of enemy flamethrowers, they kill a few civilians but I take them out. I notice a few civilians that walked for miles away from the village into another tiberium field. I watch them die again and MISSION FAILED

Attempt 3: I build a Trump wall all around the village to stop them from running into the tiberium fields, I place anti aircraft guns and rocket launchers to destroy the enemy choppers, I place grenadiers near the flamethrower spawn. Things are going well for a while, a few civilians suicided while I built the wall. I now have a base and start building some tanks to attack the enemy base. As I send in the tanks MISSION FAILED. It turns out the the civilians ran into the friendly grenades, it was a random AA missile however which missed the target, landed near a civilian and ended the mission.

Attempt ???: The entire map is a giant trump wall, the civilians can't go anywhere. There's about 30 rocket launcher soldiers on every chopper spawn which nearly made me bankrupt. I build about 30 medium tanks along with infantry and grenadiers to assault the enemy base. I kill all the turrets but they instantly respawn due to the AI using cheats, the enemy sends in an army of tanks and flamethrowers which wipe out my force, then I have to watch all my hard work disappear as all the buildings I just destroyed instantly rebuild due to cheating AI.

After about half an hour of killing the enemy tiberium harvesters, building the Trump wall all the way to the enemy base and spawning countless soldiers to send to their death I finally destroy the enemy base. I build a trump wall over their base so they can't instantly respawn the turrets again.

1) The movies in Red Alert don't seem to have been improved much. But I imagine there are technical limitations at fault.

2) It would have been nice if the included map editor were a bit more developed, supported, and robust. Thus far, I'm having trouble finding information on how to use it and have been underwhelmed at the lack of functionality.

I enjoyed this remaster - don't get me wrong, but there is a glaring fault that needs to be realised and THAT is why I have not recommended the game - in the hopes that people go looking for what's wrong with it.  That being said - let's go.

The big glaring fault that I have with this game is when playing a skirmish map - there comes a point when there is simply too much on the screen for the engine to handle and the LAG SETS IN!
It becomes completely unplayable and I have lost dozens of skirmishes due to the fact that it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to micro your units.  You select a control group and wait AT LEAST 4 seconds before that command registers.  You click on an enemy unit to attack and again wait AT LEAST 4 seconds for that command to register, and by that time your construction yard has been destroyed.
THIS LAG IS RIDICULOUS

Secondly - How dumb is the AI!?
Donald Trump would do a better job of leading these idiots in battle that the hard AI.
Big Map - Tonnes of money.
The enemy doesn't build any silos and wastes all their income?
Enemy doesn't build aircraft?
Was the AI always this dumb when I was a kid?

45,70406958,english,"I got this because of nostalgic reasons.
I used to love the game.
The thing is I don't remember it being so annoyingly bad!
I have to tell my units multiple times to do something like attack or move.
Sometimes they don't do anything.
Also, sometimes my units will move to where I want them and just sit there, even if there's enemy RIGHT NEXT TO IT and it'll just sit there until ordered to do something.
Other times they'll attack things I don't want them to attack.

I'm not slagging the game off as the updated graphics and controls are a welcome addition.
It's just I don't remember it being so aggravating.
I'd also have thought that seeing that its a remaster if a 20 plus year old game some of the stupid things would have been addressed such as not being able to finish a level until everything is dead including resource collectors that happen to be the other side of the map or 1 lowly enemy rifleman.
Then there's the path finding, HOLY S**T ITS TERRIBLE!
By that I mean you'll tell your units to do something like move somewhere and 1 or 2 OR MORE will ignore the order and not move OR ATTACK!
Even worse is the fact that when you tell a group of your units to attack something they'll run straight towards it, literally in a straight line not firing and just sit in front (or just drive right passed it) of the enemy and get killed.
You have to tell them again & again & AGAIN to attack and sometimes even that won't work
Then you have to rebuild whats been killed, make your way back to where ever your previous units got killed with no tactics at all IN AN RTS just build up your previously killed units and swarm them hoping that you have a big enough force to kill the enemy.

What I'm trying to say is don't buy this game with nostalgia tinted glasses on.

Online is another story, if your simply a casual player like me, id suggest not bothering with the online, as everyone online seems to be a seasoned pro at it and hence you will lose a LOT lol, is frustrating tbh, ive not even come close to winning, i suspect most of these ppl are old school C&C players who know all the tactics and exact build orders etc, so to be honest i really cant be bothered going that deep into it.

Bought it because i played the old games a little and liked them, so as a single player its a 9/10 as an online game it will vary depending how much effort you put into learning everything, if like me you just want the occasional online game, dont bother. 
Obviously if your a seasoned player you will no doubt love it, but for newcomers its a steep learning curve.
I think ill just stick to AI skirmish games rather than the online as less frustrating :)

Great remaster of a great game.

The remastered graphics are much more impressive than the trailers and screenshots make them out to be. When I watched the trailer, I couldn't really see much of a difference. In-game, however, the difference is huge and I was actually really impressed with how detailed the new sprites are and how big the difference is. You can zoom in using the mousewheel and see a great level of detail.

This isn't just a graphical update, there are so many lovely little additions that show how careful and caring the developers have been. They've even remastered original installation programs, with a few fun tweaks to acknowledge the fact that most of us aren't running on 640x480 and SoundBlaster cards anymore...

The bonus music tracks are fantastic, and I love that they've also re-recorded a few fan-favourites from Renegade, Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 as well - it's a lot of fun playing a Tiberian Dawn skirmish while listening to ""Command & Conquer!"" and ""Slave to the System"".

The game plays about exactly the way it did in the original, with a new sidebar and (thank fuck) unit queuing (which you can turn off).  The remastered music is also fantastic, and the included 'jukebox' to set a playlist to just keep on loop instead of having to fuck with it every time I started a new mission.  The graphics are also done in such a way that it doesn't detract from the game experience.  I almost feel like I'm playing the exact same game I did back in the late 90's - except I do a much better job, nowadays.  I haven't enjoyed the multiplayer this much since GameSpyware.  There's also a ton of little extras thrown in, which really makes you feel the polish and love put in to this.

The path-finding even appears to be wholly original.  At least, it still pisses me off the same as it did years ago.

You can use the same custom maps from the original games.  So all those sites with custom maps that have been around for two decades can get all the love, again.

It's not quite perfect, though.
-While understandable, the fact that the RA video could only be upscaled is almost heartbreaking.  It's a hell of a difference, though.
-The workshop/user map integration is a bit flaky.
-The multiplayer (or maybe it's the game itself, idk) will get laggy as all hell, at times.  This is noticeable when there are way too many units on the map, which does happen.  But I have only witnessed this in multiplayer matches on resource-intense maps with Hard AI.

If I really had to list some changes I'd like to see:
-Stabilize (as much as possible) the user map/workshop part.  I'll search for a map, and it'll show up one time, disappear another, and _maybe_ show up later.  Even after I've already downloaded it.
-Stabilize the lag when there is a large amount of units on the map.  I've counted up to a 6 second lag from input to actuation of a command.  Maybe this is just multiplayer, maybe this has something to do with my damn Comcast Internet.  But I know it has to do with the amount of units on the map, as once they start dying, it clears up real quick.
-Harder Skirmish AI.  Yea, I'm a masochist.  Hurt me plenty, baby.

But, damn, it's nice to play a game I have fond memories of with my late cousin.  And now, I get to make some new, fond memories with one of my best friends.  I can feel the labor of love put in to this, and I love them for it.

If you’ll liked the originals, like me, than you’ll have a blast with these, even if it was just for nostalgia reasons. It brings back other memories too of a lóóóng foregone time. Man, I am getting old… :)

The game play is still fun and holds up well in my opinion, although younger people might have problem with it, because it comes with all it's strengths and weaknesses from the old. These are pretty straight forward RTS games, not a lot of unit development here. It is possible to queue building units - thank God – but the AI path finding and awareness of your units already sucked in '95 and it still does today. This means you really have to babysit your units - like we were used too back then. Some people might find that irritating, ‘spoiled’ by modern RTS games with far better AI. It is absolutely possible in these games, that half of your units in a group are slaughtered by the enemy, while the rest of your units of that group are standing idle or doing push ups and don’t attack the close by enemies. Full harvesters like to dance around their base deciding who is allowed to unload first. Your troops running through spice fields (er… No, that was Dune II), i mean Tiberian, and killing themselves. These are just a couple of examples. If you don’t mind the babysitting, your going to have fun with this, because the maps and missions are still fun and can be challenging.

There is multiplayer, but no LAN support yet. There is a map maker. Skirmish support. The games support mods, which is awesome, because that means that there is a way to fix (some of) the AI issues via this route. The audio has been remastered and is top notch! Unit sounds, sound tracks, there is even a jukebox that lets you select your favorite soundtracks. The videos still look okay-ish to good, if you take into account they had to upscale it from a very abominable resolution. All in all it is a very complete package that has been giving a lot of love from the developers. It was a passion project, that is as clear as a bright sunny day!

The graphics, world-building, soundtrack and atmosphere all combine into something that is entirely unique and timeless (the dumb as shit path-finding not withstanding).

I can only hope that they give this treatment to Tib Sun/Firestorm and RA2/Yuri's.  

The game takes patience and a lot of trial-and-error, but with the 200+ songs playing in the background it doesn't get tedious.  Quicksaves seem to be selective in when they work, so always back up your game with a manual save before doing something ballsy or quitting.  There's an in-mission difficulty slider which may help on some of the more challenging missions and I can't wait to try all the alternate paths with the level selector.  I'd imagine that some of these original levels I'll be seeing for the first time ever, which is awesome.

- Path finding. The harvester was dire anyway and sometimes got stuck or do large loops occasionally in the original game but this is every mission and every skirmish there is an issue in the remastered version
- Hard difficulty. This isn't hard its just a grind, all that they have done is increased the hit points / defence - in some cases ruining the counter unit mechanism there should be. If you're able to see off the first 2-3 waves (which isn't difficult anyway) that's the mission covered, the AI will just send the same unit composition at you from the same direction over and over....unless your harvester does something stupid or you attack their harvester don't expect much.
- AI. There are a few issues; until you scout into their base they will cheat. They will be spawning units worth far more than what they're collecting with their harvester. They will be able to repair turrets even without any income seemingly indefinitely For those of you that want a quick win...Attack their harvester from the air....they will not respond....at all.

82,70604221,english,"C&C Remastered is so good that I feel I have to leave my first ever review here.

Short version: it’s perfect.

Slightly longer version:
Good old Command and Conquer, the game that defined the genre. One could say “It’s too old, controls are clunky, and it aged badly in some other way and blah-blah-blah…” Yeah, probably the main audience is people like me, ones who played this in the 90’s and have a huge nostalgia. But to be honest, I was quite surprised of how well and smoothly it plays today, when we have much more advanced RTS-games to compare with. I don’t know if it played like this originally or if it was upgraded a bit, but in fact I think that remastered version is worth trying even for those who don’t know who the hell is this bald guy and why 30-year-old people yell when they see him on the screen.
So now to the upgraded features I love the most.
Graphics are pretty awesome. You know, I played original C&C more than 20 years ago. And in my memories it looked exactly like remastered one does now. When I turned off the new graphics I was like “I can’t believe it! How in the world could I possibly see the soldier in this handful of pixels?” So now it’s upgraded and you even can zoom in and see every detail. Damn good job!
Reworked soundtrack is GREAT! One of the first things I’ve done after I started playing was turning music volume on maximum. Just like when I was a kid, Frank Klepacki makes me crazy. Just awesome! One of the most essential parts of the C&C’s atmosphere.
New UI is very convenient. They added some features from the next C&C games so it’s easier to control your production etc.
Upscaled cinematics are great. Multiplayer features are great. Campaigns are challenging. Everything is just perfect. Totally worth buying and playing!
Thank you Petroglyph! You’ve brought my childhood back!

And now I want to say one more thing. Or rather two. Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2. It’s their turn to be brought back from our memories. Petroglyph, we want more! KANE LIVES!",1591830194,1591985611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007764496,208,1,2125,0,147,1598645957
83,70686192,english,"Petroglyph decided to favor upon this remaster being one of a cosmetic and nostalgic nature, adding in modern-day features where necessary and leaving the game functionally the same during gameplay, save for the obvious remastered graphics.  So faithful have they stayed to the original formula, to the point that no changes were made to the game balancing.  So get ready for the Soviets to dominate the Red Alert multiplayer meta with tank spam all over again.

Hands down the remastered soundtrack is the best part of this package.  Not only did Frank Klepacki add in several new remixed songs, but you can now listen to the soundtrack of both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert in either campaigns.  Oh, and Rain In the Night is absolutely INCREDIBLE now thanks to a kickass electric guitar solo!

Another great addition is the inclusion of Steam Workshop mod support.  Already we're seeing the community add in a bunch of fan-made maps, improvements to the game mechanics, custom missions, and even a goofy cut feature that allows infantry to start boxing each other if they're at point blank range!  Supposedly some fans are trying to improve the pathfinding and overall AI, but I believe it'll be awhile before it's available.

Sadly, in an effort to stay true to the feel of the original games, nothing has been done to the unit AI.  Harvesters are still just as painfully dumb as ever, units have horrible pathfinding, the enemy AI is mostly basic, and the unit balance is exactly the same as it was in the past, for better or worse.  And be careful with the new difficulty slider - all it does is apply a %20 buff for your faction on easy or instead the enemy's on hard, but it REALLY screws up some of the later missions that stick you with a limited group of units and no way to replace them (Nod mission 8B being the absolute worse).  

And while this is somewhat more subjective, the ""behind the scenes"" content is just basically footage of Joseph Kucan and his crew at work, and the dozens or cuts and re-takes that come with filming.  There is the occasional humorously misread line, a few old advertising spots, and a bit of trivia here and there, but that's it.

TL;DR?  If you're a Command and Conquer fan, grab this, you won't regret it.  And here's hoping Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 receive the same loving remaster treatment someday.",1591985066,1591985066,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198033719090,244,36,9712,0,1070,1600523039

When the best game you ever make is a remake of such an old game originally made by a company that you cannibalized in the first place, you should reconsider your values (looking at you EA games).

Graphics-wise the upgrade is just enough to ease you back to what it was like back in the 90's but still the original pixel art is also there for us old timers.
The sounds are more or less the same but the soundtracks have been upgraded to modern standards and it sounds awesome.

The AI is still as bad as it used to be. It cheats, the only thing the difficulty adjustment does is lowering your unit's health and double's the AI's (or doing the same with damage, whatever). Because of this some quests are not exactly doable on the hardest setting.

The skirmish mode is a nice feature but C&C AI is too weak even with hardest settings to be competitive even in a 3 on 1 scenario. Red Alert handles it better because of bigger maps that enable up to 8 players and 7 on 1 things can get rough eventually.

Artillery moving into melee range to attack? Units sat being attacked and not doing anything about it?

For me personally in 2020 I expect these basic bugs/irritations to be fixed. Maybe my view is opposite to everyone else? I don't know.

It's back! The intro to this game genuinely brought a tear to my eye when it was done. The graphical and soundtrack improvements are brilliant (especially the soundtrack, my god!) and the overall feel of C&C is still there.

The gameplay has barely been touched in this remaster which works as a double edged sword. Yes the feeling is on point but the pathfinding could really have been done with being sorted, I doubt any old school fans would of missed that had it been changed. Same goes for the tiberium/ore regeneration, don't expect any long haul games, especially on tib dawn. The UI overhaul brought it up to RA2 standards, and being able to que units is a godsend compared to the original. Also I encountered the global pop limit on tib dawn,. A pop limit? For this game? Seriously?! To be fair most of these problems can be fixed with mods.

I and several players I know am experiencing severe issues with multiplayer in larger games. 2v2 seems to work fine, but any larger and the game suffers. I often lose the ability so select/build/place anything for several minutes when large groups of units begin to mobilise in attack. This should NOT happen in this game as I doubt it's a hardware issue and is most likely due to poor coding. smooth gameplay can be achieved for 4v4 gameplay (E.G. Age of Empires).

This game is the welcome back to the franchise the die hard fans wanted/needed as C&C has been in a sorry state as of late but with this returning to it's roots hopefully this means C&C is back on track and here to stay! MASSIVE hopes for a remaster of Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 in the future as I feel this was where the franchise was at it's best all round.

All in all this is a welcome modernisation of an old classic that largely leaves the original gameplay unchanged to a fault.

Lets do the good first;

Graphics – Holy crap does this 25-year-old game look gorgeous. The theme is kept perfect to how it used to be and each unit is lovingly crafted, that much shows. No longer does a rocket soldier look like a rifleman with a white shoulder! The environments are fantastically well done as well, the special animations for the super weapons are a wonderful recreation of what this game was about.

Sound – 45/10 excellent. I cannot praise the sound design of the original OR the remake enough. Same guy did it I think?

VFX – 4K upscaling of videos! AI is great for this, but these come out a little wonky, but who cares?

The bad;

Pathfinding – Oh my good lord. It’s as bad as I remember. “Artillery, you’re just in range of that flame tower, can you shell… NO! WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AT THE TOWER?!” or “Right, I’ve placed my tanks around this missions structure to… WHY ARE MY OWN TANKS BLOWING THROUGH THE CONCRETE DEFENSES OF MY BASE?!” to… “Right, everyone on the map is dead. I’ll just go ahead and capture the command…” Nice, my own units decide to blow up the Command Centre I needed… Endless problems with the pathfinding.

LAG – Holy crap, I do not know how in 2020, running a 6700K and a 1080ti I am getting stuttering on this game. You load into missions, miss half the damn initial action and wonder what just happened. Oh boy, you’re playing with more than 50 units? You better be prepared for some serious stutter and slowdown. 

Usually, I don’t care for the above complaints… but a REMASTER shouldn’t have either. The engine should have been significantly tweaked, the engine should have been optimised. I shouldn’t have the same issues I had in the 90’s on a game that is redone 25 years later. I’ve requested a refund. I’ll buy it again if the engine gets some goddamn love from EA. But fat lot of chance that will be.

Until they fix the lag and the god-awful pathfinding, I’d stay away from it. Unless you’re a masochist with soviet-tinted glasses.

20,70677522,english,"Okay...I've got to make two reviews here: one for those who played the original, one for those who don't.

For those who do: this game is absolutely amazing. Everything from the low-res sci-fi to the hard missions is back and ready for how it should look today. Much crispier, full screen, zoomable resolution...even on-the-fly swapping between old and new graphics. The audio is better than ever and this runs as smooth as butter on pretty much any PC. Even on linux in my case, though your mileage may vary on that front.

For those that don't: you really need to know what you're getting into. I certainly wouldn't have thumbed this up if this was just any new RTS hitting the market. Because for all the improvements, there are some glaring faults that have become a ""feature"" of the game. Expect weird moments when you order a bunch of soldiers to attack a building and your grenadeers throw their ammo so close to your grunts that they die in the process. Expect your harvesters to get stuck on a bridge when they want to pass each other. Expect your ball of units to take the order of ""get to this point"" pretty liberal (""oh, the unit in front of me is blocking my way. Better take a detour all across the map :P""). Expect to lose units because they couldn't resist following an enemy  unit into the enemy fire lines. Fuck...expect a good deal of savegame scumming because perfect plans can go perfectly wrong in a jiffy.
If you overlook/forgive these obstacles, then there's an absolutely awesome game waiting for you. Many dozens of challenging missions and cutscenes will keep you busy for many, many hours. I can't guarantee that you'll have fun in the process, though...

Gameplay is almost 100% faithful and that includes fighting the controls and path finding.
This is the same vein as the SC remaster.

People who dislike the path finding, well for such games (C&C and SC)  that is what separate the good players from bad.  Cos APM matters a lot. 
Like how excellent Allied players can use light tanks and dodge every single shot and wipe out larger fleets of Soviet heavy tanks while handling the path finding like nothing.

But if you want it as a modern re-make then this will not be what you are looking forward.  
It will only be a 7/10 (great value due to it has everything) if you are expecting this to play like a modern 21st century RTS. There is some modernization (like UI and unit queuing), but don't expect much.

If you want something much more modern, go bug EA to remaster RA2 or Generals, those pretty much pioneered modern day RTS controls.

Having played it again for a few hours now, I can appreciate how much they developed the C&C series over the subsequent decades. 
In terms of graphics, it looks splendid, perfectly playable.
In terms of gameplay, it becomes painful within minutes, and unenjoyable shortly thereafter. 
The AI and pathfinding have clearly not been enhanced or altered since the original and it rapidly turns from the C&C I have become accustomed to, into a micro management sim, trying to manage individual units as they wander all over the map, and into the enemies base seemingly at random.

I wholehearted disagree with the direction the community council took with balancing this game, I wish they had modernised the pathfinding, attack move and balance of a lot of units. For example, if you have a mixture of infantry and rocket soldiers and you attack a tank, the infantry will run up to the tank trigger its crush infantry behaviour and run all of your units over immediately despite your infantry having a longer attack range to avoid that crush behaviour.

I could bore you with more of my gripes and frustrations with the game, but I wont. The best thing to come out of this remaster is the soundtrack, which is glorious, and the HD cinematics but thats it. If you can tolerate the dated gameplay, there is a lot of singleplayer content available, im talking many hours of campaign missions. Multiplayer will fizzle out and die very quickly, so if you're in Australia and that's something that interests you get in quick because 2-3 months from now multiplayer will be dead.


The game is a disappointment, if you want to relive your nostalgia of when you were kid playing CnC sure, buy the remaster.

56,70665472,english,"So ive played the game for many hours now and i will tell you this.  Nothing has changed exept the graphics and music.   Which is nice for single player..

But the The multiplayer is trash.   

Red Alert.  All you do is spam the tank button. might as well tap it as fast as you can to spam 30000 tanks, thats all people do online.  And another issue is the maps the ore respawn rate is TERRIBLE.  Im so tired of sitting in matchs where no one has money and you lose simply because the other side had a little more ore where they spawned..  Red alert is horrible in multiplayer.. might as well call it tank alert

Tiberian Dawn.  Multiplayer is a little more fun, people actually have to build other units then 1 type of tank, and you have to get your tech up pretty far with defenses.. played many games like this.  There is deff more of a strategy to winning.  The main issue is the maps are soooooooooooooooo small.  Ive been on some maps where you cant even put down 2-3 buildings before you run out of room.   I dont understand.. its like they upscaled the buildings and units but didnt change the maps.   The tiberium runs out to fast as well.. I just finished a game where it took 2 hours because all 4 people couldnt build anything due to the slow regrowth of tiberium.   There are only 4 players per match as well vs 8 on red alert.   The nuclear warheads are trash as well, i dropped one on a guys probly 15 tanks attacking me and it took 5-10% of their hp off.. thats it..

I dunno i feel like all they did was make pretty buildings and tanks, and record good music and didnt do anything to multiplayer.   The lobby is lagy as well.

They are good games, and the single player is fun to a point.  Ive played all the cnc games since i was 11 im 33 now..  The best one hands down is Tiberium wars 3.   I know this is just a remaster of a 25 year old game.. but i wish the multiplayer was better..  Its the main thing thats really bugging me and i hope they allow bigger maps on tiberian dawn..  If they can make the maps bigger vs the piles of junk they are and maybe fix the path finding on harvesters.. and fix the regrow rate on tiberian and ore and so forth then I'll be much happier..

I remember playing these when they were new, I remember the RTS genre during what is now called ""the golden age of PC gaming"" (mid 90's to about 2002). Back then, the RTS e-sport scene was still just coming into its own and the idea of creating and balancing a game around e-sport wasn't really a thing. These were the days when (what would be now called) ""casuals"" were pretty much the norm and single player and VERY casual multiplayer were the dominant way to play. When I write this review, it is from the perspective of someone who very much still sees the value in that kind of game. Especially now. 

  The Command and Conquer remasters are going to be divisive. Some are going to see this as a missed opportunity to completely remake both the titles in a more modern format. Others (like myself) will see this as a loyal, heartfelt valentine to the fans who have been with the franchise since the beginning and want something that still FEELS like Command and Conquer and not just a generic RTS with all the usual modern concessions for high-level competitive play and e-sports. It isn't a complex set of games. They are not going to be as friendly towards competitive play but that is part of their charm. They represent a time when these games were still built around a concept, setting, and story. They were not yet turned into a sport. 

  If you liked the originals, these are the originals with a stunning HD visual uplift, a fantastic audio remaster, and some good quality of life feature additions that don't compromise the original vision. These games play well and capture what made the originals so important and so enjoyable.

They've done incredible work in translating the graphics to modern HD standards, yet still feeling totally natural compared to the originals. Flipping between classic and modern graphics shows just how well the transitions were done.

The music, always a standout in C&C games is better than ever here, with Klepacki reprising his role, and bringing full, rich recreations and cleaned up versions of the original songs that stick in your head days, weeks, (and even decades!) after you hear them.

On a gameplay level, they've kept it all virtually identical to the original '95 version, pathfinding warts and all. I think it's the best choice, as 'reinterpreting' technical elements like that, or balance, would upset ardent fans, which is ultimately who this product is really for.

The remastered graphics and soundtrack is great, being able to enjoy the game again since the 90s is nice as well.  However, some things that should have been added in quality of life have not been.  There is argument on attack move and why it wasn't put in.  I'd at least like the option to have it, instead of pigeon holing me into guard,move,halt orders.  

Other glaring issues is that the path finding is just as atrocious as it was in the 90s.  Given its a remaster and some things were added, why wasn't this fixed?  The AI is still as dumb as ever on hard.  Medium and easy are a joke.  If you want to play against people, I guess its fine but people just use spam or rush tactics since that's the only real viable strategy due to the complete lack of resources.  Maps exist with more but it seems the AI is busted on all of them, they don't build anything.

The list goes on.  That being said, the upgraded graphics, sound track, and all the extra missions from the expansions are here and still fun to play.  Mods and custom maps are easy to install.  That being said, it seems like the EA servers are hit or miss with lag.  The game doesn't support steam integration or any private lobbies as of now.  So you end up kicking people until your friends can find your game and join.  

Honestly, I don't know.  I want to like this game but at the same time I don't.  Some basic crap just didn't make it into the game and with EA's track record, I doubt it will.

6,70655531,english,"TL/DR: A lot of game play and 90s nostalgia for £18, but has some issues that could have been polished out and some might find too frustrating to overlook.

When I seen they were doing a remastered c&c/red alert I was looking forward to it, and I feel they have largely delivered what I was anticipating; some nostalgic old-school C&C glory with more up-to-date graphics, sound and interface. In most regards this is what a remaster of a classic game should be. 

There does seem to be some frustrating issues with the units path finding, or obeying instructions in stupid ways (like if you order artillery, with long range of fire, to attack infantry or such, it won't fire from it's maximum range but instead will drive right into the range of fire of the enemy. Units also don't seem to like going into each others movement trajectory, so you might order 8 tanks over a bridge, 5 head towards it and 3 start off in another direction circling around the entire map rather than waiting to cross the bridge. Various annoying little things like that, which granted probably existed in the original but were forgivable at the time, could have been sorted out for release in 2020.

The saving system is also bizarre. there is no quick save, and when you select 'save' from the pause menu, it doesn't open your list of previous saves so as to overwrite previous saved games, it forces you to make a new save every time. Saves can only be deleted one at a time (requiring 3 mouse clicks at different points on the screen for each and every delete).

But the biggest disappointment is the swarm of bugs within the game - some faulty triggers within missions where if you don't do things in a particular order then you can't complete the mission ... such as 1 mission where you have to rescue someone, if you destroy the NOD base first and then find them the rescue helicopter doesn't arrive
And behaviour glitches too when certain infantry if being fired up won't return fire or move, they just lie there and I've also found that NOD riflemen seemingly can't shoot people who are standing on a bridge ....

I am enjoying a variation of the game that offers a difficulty curve over and above the originals.

The Hardest difficulty on Red Alert seems unchanged in comparison to the original, and is nearly exactly as I remember it, and not as demanding a curve as the newly implemented curve to Tiberium Dawn.

As I understand, skirmish and multiplayer still need a lot of work.

Story: 
An alternate future where a spacerock that crashlanded near the Tiber river in Italy brought with it an Alien spreading growth that leeches minerals and nutrients from the ground - conveniently placing these on the surface in the form of Tiberium Crystals. 
Do you know how expensive it is to mine rare minerals through normal means? All that digging and refining and extracting 0.00001% of what you need from the dust in the ground that just happens to have that element?
Well no more. Wait for Tiberium to spread, wait for the crystals to form. Now you just have harvesters pick up the Crystals. Profit! 

Naturally with Tiberium spreading all over the world the balance of power shifts and Rebel (terrorist) groups have a new source of income with which to invest in the stock market, buy weapons, influence leaders, influence the media and ultimately wage war. 
If you've heard of ISIS wanting to gain control over oil fields to fund its war effort, The Brotherhood of NOD in C&C are this times a 1000. 
Tiberium is almost everywhere. 
But exploiting it has a price...

So you have GDI who is basically a unified global NATO that's trying to uphold the status quo and NOD, a religious high tech terrorist group that has its own motives for destabilizing the world and seizing power. 
All the while, Tiberium is slowly creating an ecological disaster - turns out an Alien growth that leeches all the good stuff out of its surroundings might be detrimental to the environment. 

Sounds like an awesome setting right? A mix of politics, economics, warfare... This is Command and Conquer!

Oh and C&C Red Alert is what might have happened had Einstein gone back in time and killed Hitler before his rise to power. No Nazis seems like a great idea, right? Well what about Stalin and his millions of unopposed troops marching on Europe... Also there's time travel, nuclear weapons, towers and tanks and soldiers that shoot electricity, an invulnerability field, radar stealth and much much more sci-fi goodness to discover.


Features: 
The updated graphics look exactly what my memories of this game were. Catering to nostalgia glasses this one. 
Too often you go back to an old game you loved and realise you just can't stand the low resolution and audio quality. 

Petroglyph and EA have delivered something special - a new version of old C&C that's so well remastered that there's no need to install the old version. 

The campaign mission and special missions are varied enough to recommend this to folks who haven't played the original C&C games. Just be prepared for janky pathfinding, lack of attack move and overall babysitting your army more than you might be used to. 

That said, let's appreciate the game - this is a game from a time where you were amazed that you could select ALL your units by conveniently dragging a box around them and THEY ALL moved at once. Wow!
It's a game from a time when fitting FMV cutscenes on a CD was such a novel thing that CD readers were too slow to read the video information off the CD so Westwood had to come up with their own encoder to get around this limitation. 
A game from a time where it took serious artistic genius to create distiguishable and memorable units from only a handful of moving pixels on screen. <
Just a few years before the C&C 1995 release we had games like Dune 2 where you could only command one unit at a time and moving and attacking wasn't just an intuitive aim click away. 

The fact that the remaster has somehow put a modern coat on all this and made it playable in 2020 - that's 25 years later than the original release - without losing the nostalgia effect is a marvel of game remastering. 

The audio deserves a special mention not only because of the remastered music but because of the sound effects.
Tanks fire shells in a powerful bassy fashion, soldiers die in a scream of agony when set aflame and ""unit lost"" gives a sense of urgency to do better unlike any sound effect in RTS.
They've even added subtle environmental effects such as birds singing in temperate maps and a chilly wind blowing on tundra maps. 
If this isn't a sign of attention to detail I don't know what is. 

Lots of RTS games have tried to emulate C&C and many have refined the formula but this is where it all started. 

You owe it to yourself to play the granddaddy of RTS. To Command and Conquer.

The remastered version is exactly what was promised: the old games with high-resolution graphics (most importantly) and some other add-ons (more modern user interface, remastered sound, videos, etc.). I think the comparison of traditional and modern graphics was based on the original VGA version of Tiberian Dawn, not the better SVGA version. At least in my memories the graphics back then was not *that* bad. In the remastered version they really just increased the resolution of textures, there were no more envolved changes (such as more fine-grained rotations).

The game mechanics itself has not been touched. So one should in particular not expect better AI. And in constrast to some of some other critics I think that's good, otherwise it would be a different game. And in particular, some of the missions were designed such that the player can and *should* exploit the stupidity of the AI. If the AI would have been changed (not even improved, only changed), these missions would become a lot harder than intended or not solvable at all.

83,70639184,english,"I'll preface this review by saying this: I primarily bought this for the music, remastered cutscenes, and cool new sprites; for those three elements alone, this is worth the price of admission. The original Red Alert was my first C&C game, and defined my childhood. When I heard the Remastered Collection was being developed, I was cautiously optimistic considering the whole Rivals debacle, which had practically just occurred. As soon as I heard that Petroglyph would be developing it, though, I got hyped, and not without reason. Petroglyph was founded by Westwood employees from the good old days, and still have a bunch working for them. The quality of the presentation bears this out.

Pros:
I'm excited for mod support, especially Steam Workshop functionality. I can't wait to see what people do with this thing. Releasing the source code after a quarter-century was a smart move as well. Hell, while we're on the topic of Steam Workshop, let's talk Steam. Did anyone honestly think they would see another C&C game on Steam? I certainly didn't, and not just because I'm carved from freaking jade at this point. EA has given me loads of reasons to hate them over the last two decades, and this was a big surprise to me. Good on them for doing this. The only thing that would have made it better is if they'd released it on GOG, but a man can dream. 
This was clearly a labor of love for a lot of these devs. I was skeptical of the new unit and building sprites, but they look great. The old DOS installation sequences were remade and humorously showed the improvement in screen resolution. The extras are amazing, especially the behind-the-scenes clips. There's a very good reason Joe Kucan (Kane) runs a successful theater company in Vegas; the way he directed the other actors in the cutscenes was phenomenal, and I enjoyed every second of it that I watched. The cutscenes themselves have been remastered to an insane degree considering their age, and they are a sight to behold. The menus are great; they're more functional while at the same time hearkening back to the look of the originals. The old map screens make a comeback and look awesome. You can go back and play individual missions, even variations you didn't select while playing through the campaign. The menus have the good elements of the original feel down pat, with new stuff that makes them enjoyable. It's great.
And the music is even better, and that alone makes this worth the buy, leaving everything else aside. Frank Klepacki clearly does this for fun. I mean, it's obvious. The legacy Command and Conquer soundtracks are his baby, and he treats them as such. He could have easily phoned this in and just remastered the existing music, but no; he had to go a dozen steps further. I can just imagine him when being asked to work on the Remaster: ""Okay, so we need to update the old music. But that's not enough. Let's dig out the music from the crappy console games that was actually kickass and redo that, too! And we'll let people create their own playlists and listen to music from both games IN both games! Ah, screw it, I'm getting a band together and making brand-new music for this thing!"" Just...phenomenal. I cannot stress that enough. Phenomenal.

Cons:
All of this attention to detail in the presentation, unfortunately, made the gameplay supremely disappointing. They spent two years working on this thing, promising tons of gameplay modernizations, and what do we have to show for it? The same godawful AI pathfinding, still no rally points for production buildings, still only one production queue for buildings and per unit type, still no waypoints, and most egregious of all, STILL no attack move. I appreciate being able to queue up units, but that simply isn't enough anymore. LAN play isn't available at launch, for which we've been given the lame excuse that 'Covid-19 prevented us from testing it', which is absolute nonsense. You had EA's budget behind you. Do you mean to tell me that EA couldn't afford to give you a few networked machines you could remote into in order to test LAN play? Ridiculous. The opportunities lost here are legion, especially considering the (free) competition.
By-the-by, let's discuss that competition, shall we? All of these issues would be forgivable were OpenRA not staring us all in the face, which it is. Over the course of just a couple more years, a team of unpaid volunteers with a budget of nothing have given us a better, more well-polished gameplay experience than either EA or Petroglyph did with this Remaster. All of the problems I mentioned above? Are fixed in OpenRA, and as a result it's far more fun to play, with quality-of-life improvements coexisting alongside the old-world charm of the original games instead of making the latter take a backseat, as many other reviewers claim they would. Does it have the new sprites or music? No, but I'll definitely be sticking with OpenRA for multiplayer and skirmish play. It's a simple no-brainer.
Finally, the new sound effects lack the same punch as the old ones. I think the biggest example of this is the Yak/Hind/Pillbox machine gun sound. The new sound effect just doesn't measure up, and this is a common issue across the board. Thankfully, you can switch between old and new sound effects, so this problem at least has a solution, unlike all the others.

All-in-all, I would say this is still worth buying, warts and all. The presentation alone makes it all worth it, even if the gameplay itself is sorely lacking. It's a step in the right direction, and one we need to encourage EA to keep taking. I want to see Tiberian Sun remastered and, you know, running on modern systems, and buying this flawed yet beautiful offering is just the way to do that. And at $20, it's definitely worth it.",1591897517,1591898657,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197992688080,189,11,632,0,632,1591806816

[h1]TL; DR[/h1]
A really nostalgic piece and a remaster that deserves the name.
The new graphics fit the game perfectly, making it look smoother but keeping the style. The sound lets you feel you are back. But be warned, its quirky flaws (looking at you, pathfinding) also stayed in the game.


[h1]Welcome back, Commander[/h1]
Game mechanic-wise this game just perfectly forwarded everything into the new suit. All good scissor-paper-rock units are back, the campaign unchanged, the trashy video sequences are still trashy and we still ""need more silos!""

For basically everything else you can choose according your preference: 
* Use the old graphics or the new modern one - the latter is a perfect job of keeping the style intact but making it smoother for the eyes.
* Listen to the classic song versions or the remastered ones, which sound very similar and were mostly just adapted for fuller sound. Also there are some bonus tracks and a jukebox, where you can make your own playlist, including the use of C&C tracks in Red Alert and vice-versa and add some bonus songs, too.
* Controls: You can choose, keep the old left-click command and border scroll or change to right-click and add middle-mouse-scrolling.
* The menu was updated to the structure of the later C&C titles like C&C3/RA3, with 4 tabs for buildings/vehicles/infantry/powers. This is one of the few things you cannot change back AFAIK! But I think it fits the game, even though there are not too many units that you would really need it (making the unit pictures a bit smaller on higher resolutions would have sufficed).


[h1]Damn those ants![/h1]
Well, there are some bugs in the game. And not just fire ants.

Old quirks/issues are left in the game: sometimes bad pathfinding, units running behind a moving enemy unit while coming under fire themselfes, units forgetting their movement on a 2nd order, stupid stupid stupid harvesters.

Unfortunately there are also some new:
* APC/water transports often need more than one try to unload their units
* Sometimes the game gets laggy (workaround: open and close the menu)
* On few occasions, the game felt as if the tick speed was not constant, but slightly slower/faster for a moment
* Normal/moderate game speeds are not synchronised with real time (seconds are faster than should be), which also affects level timers (so far all timed missions were manageable though).

While sometimes irritating, all bugs I encountered so far were not crucial and I hope they get fixed.


[h1]Mission accomplished[/h1]
Keep in mind: if you buy this game, you either want back to the roots or just satisfy this nostalgic feeling.

Since the mechanics are still the same as before (in both good and bad ways), you can feel their age - and not only in a good, ripened way. Actions take more clicks than necessary, there are not so many units (some are only cannonfodder), some controls feel sluggish just because they are better in newer games and some balancing is still as off as before.

Nevertheless, if you came here to replay a good old game, this is worth its money.
And also: this game is a rarity in its own way: It is an EA game that is not only playable on its release day and without installing Origin, but which also comes without any microtransactions, loot boxes, ingame money system, advertisements, or tiny-but-pricey DLCs...

Good googely moogely! 

While I came into this with some expectations, given the information shown prior to release, parts of this game have exceeded ALL expectations! Those who have read my other game reviews will be expecting a long winded, detailed review... and I *WILL* get to that. Right now, I'm just in too much shock at how good this turned out, and I'm wanting to continue playing! =D

Quick note, though: I pre-ordered within 24 hours of the pre-order being available, and I have been counting the days, the hours, and even the minutes until release. The FMV in Tiberian Dawn looks amazing! The ""computer generated"" parts still look dated, but I imagine there wasn't much the could do with that. In game looks fantastic! Better than I thought it would! The music sounds great, and even some sound samples from Tiberian Sun made it into one of the songs(Kane... LIVES!) 

If you enjoyed Command and Conquer in days gone by, even if you already own previous versions, you will love this! I dearly hope this does well enough to convince EA to go ahead with more Remasters in the future!

6/11/2020 update:

I have now played this game for 24 hours, and it still amazes me how good of a job was done with it! 

I haven't gotten into Multiplayer yet, and from the videos I've watched on YouTube, I may not. Not because of something wrong with the game itself, but the way many people seem to want to play Multiplayer. 

You see, I'm not on a ""speed run"", and I'm not looking to bum-rush my opponents right off the bat. I want to build my base, do some exploring, allow everyone to build up their forces for a bit, THEN we can get into the actual combat portion of the game. What I'm seeing is a lot of people quick building a small base, sell off their construction yard, run up as many units as they can, and bum-rush their opponent. I simply don't find that fun. I will probably stick to Skirmish mode to avoid play like that. Unless I can find some players who have the same mentality that I do. 

I haven't finished the game yet, as I went back looking for a few of the videos I mentioned before. Oddly enough, I couldn't find them.... however, I did realize what didn't really upscale well was the yellowish-monochrome footage of GDI post-mission video. I also restarted my gameplay to ""map out"" the mission tree for both sides. Some of the missions are more difficult than others. I'll eventually finish the game(as I did in previous versions), but I will take my time and really enjoy the work the Petroglyph team did. 

I still can't recommend this game enough. Yes, it has its detractors, but give it a try for yourself. It's not like any modern game out there.",1591383470,1591891578,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197962263731,105,11,3269,10,30,1601399318

You no longer have to install those .dll files that were missing when you were nostalgic and wanted to play a little Red Alert! The game runs really smoothly and the 4k graphics are great! The fact that all the expansion campaigns are available makes the price a steal!

The bad: Maps in original C&C (now Tiberian Dawn) are extremely small and the difficulty level is somewhat random. Sometimes you'll fail in the first 2 minutes of a mission simply because a grenadier blew up. Kind of a disappointment is that I was expecting the videos to be remade but that was too much to hope for. Pay more attention to the title - ""Remastered"".

The ugly: Sadly, only the graphics were remade. Unit pathfinding is still a b***c - sometimes you'll think your tanks had too much to drink. The harvester bug is still there - when you have 2 harvesters in 1 refinery and 1 of them is just circling around the universe until the other harvester unloads. 

The verdict: Hell yes! Having in your collection the legendary game that kicked off the tactical & resource management - RTS is a good enough reason.

Players who have never played these old RTS games will immediately notice that many features that are included in modern day RTS games are simply not there (particularly true for the original C&C). Enjoyment of these games will depend on how tolerant you are of these 'missing' features.

With that out of the way. This remaster is clearly very carefully put together. The textures are new and in HD but they recreate the exact same animations you remember (for example, the idle infantry animations like push ups). Everything is exactly the same but different and it all looks fantastic. And if you don't remember just how low res everything was before there is even a legacy graphics switch which can be operated at any time using a hotkey.

Its 1996, I am 12 years old and both me and my friend both own an original Playstation. We have a 'Link Cable' to connect the two but only one game CD, all was not lost though as we had a trusty box of matches. Launch the game on one console, use a match to 'prop' the lid open fooling the console into thinking its still closed, then swap the disc to the 2nd machine and WHOOOW away we go :) MEGA lag when we both had multiple units, i'm sure it was quite literally 2fps, but this did not matter. Some of the greatest gaming memories i have came from one copy of C&C, a matchstick and skirmish mode, I will never forget any of them.

This remaster does the game as much justice as it is possible to do. Quite frankly a full 11/10, everything is exactly how i remember it.

For those who have played the originals, this game brings back all the beautiful memories. Options have been added to bring certain features to the modern day (for example unit stacking - THANK GOD!) but you can also use the legacy mechanics while in HD.

And swapping from legacy to HD graphics while in game? Makes me appreciate just how far the original has come.

I also love how you can select which missions you can replay (not just skirmishes). That way I can revisit the alternate missions instead of having to replay the campaigns from beginning to end all over again, and hoping I remember which mission I picked last time.

Having the original songs, and the remastered ones also brings back pleasant memories. Load up your favourite tracks and head off to war. Just brilliant.

I think the only thing that gets under my skin at times (yes, there is one con), is the unit pathfinding at times. When in the middle of a firefight and I try to move my units to a location, the units sometimes trace along the cliffs until they get there. So if the cliff happens to curve like a U or C they will go round the whole inside curve before leaving it and getting to their destination.

Issues aside, if you enjoyed this game back in the day, you should probably pick this up and dive in again.

3,70613577,english,"Are you picking this up? Good.

This is a remaster, not a remake! That means the game play is mostly left alone and that includes some of the poor path finding and other issues. So before purchasing, you will want to ask yourself if you can deal with the frustrations of units taking long roundabout paths or getting stuck from bridges or narrow passages and so on. Personally, I didn't find it so bad, though it certainly brought back memories of watching my harvesters dance around the refinery while waiting to use it. The game is definitely super playable but the legacy programming certainly makes it challenging. To make up for it, the AI is also pretty exploitable. 

There was one fix that makes the game extremely challenging for Nod. In the old C&C Tiberium Dawn, the GDI Bombers would just scan the map from the north west and downward so you could bait the bombers in targeting whatever you wanted them to. Now, they'll target high value units. Unfortunately this makes Nod both more challenging and less fun because it means the bombers will consistently take our your commando and Obelisks. The game was still beatable but it was rough.

That said, if you're new to Command and Conquer, missed the first in each series, or just want to go on a nostalgia trip, this is totally worth a buy. The graphics upgrade is nice but the resolution is the amazing change. It's so nice to be able to utilize the entire monitor and see so much of the map. And the radar minimap is also quite helpful now. There are also some QoL changes like being able to queue units now. There is no attack-move or rally points unfortunately but the game does have mod support so this may be addressed. The story is just as good as I remember it with the cheesy cutscenes and all. Some of the missions left me puzzled wondering how I beat them as a kid because I really struggled now!

Oh yeah, there are difficulty settings now, something the original C&C95 did not have. I would recommend normal. Apparently Easy/Hard will buff/debuff units which doesn't sound that fun. Flame throwers, grenadiers, and tanks (they love running over infantry) are already great at massacreing my entire infantry line even on normal, I can't imagine on hard,

The music has also been remastered and listening to Hell March is really taking me back. Fantastic soundtrack. The game comes with the 4 main campaigns (2 for TD, 2 for Red Alert), and then the expansion missions, console (PS1 and N64) missions, and the bonus campaigns (Dinosaurs for TD, Ants for Red Alert). 

This game was my childhood and it still very well holds up today. Honestly, I enjoyed it more than C&C3 and Redl Alert 3. This return to the roots reminded me what I really love with these games - I really enjoyed when the series was more grounded into reality. Tiberium Dawn is especially interesting and seems like it could be relevant today.

I heartily recommend the game and will end this with some advice:

To make your experience better I would recommend get used to the following keys:
X - Scatter to try and avoid getting crushed by tanks. 
Alt + Click - Force Move on a target to get a tank to run over infantry.
Ctrl + any number - Set selected units as a control group then press that number to fast-select the group.",1591851014,1591851014,True,66,1,0.823249280452728271,0,True,False,False,76561198062206693,316,72,2415,0,2415,1591849005

For some reason I remember the graphics being better? I guess time does that to you. The remaster makes a huge difference, but even the remastered graphics are what they are. You can toggle between remastered and original graphics, by hitting space bar, which is kind of neat.

The pathfinding is still absolutely terrible. You really have to micro your armies, you can't send units across the map unless there is a clear path. At times, they will go all the way around and even travel through an enemy base just to reach a spot, but they could have reached that spot by going around a water or a rock. You really have to guide troops around.

Music is fun and old school. More nostalgia.

15,70611492,english,"HELL YES I RECOMMEND

Command & Conquer is a classic. This remastered edition is just what the doctor ordered.
About 7 years old i got a hand me down ps1 and all the CnC games that were on it. Was the first game i remember popping in. Got hooked soon as i started playing.

Same thing happened here when i started playing i was hooked. Everything from the first 2 games is here in one nice little package. All the campaigns and their difficulty. However, i feel the remaster is more difficult in some spots. especially the GDI mission where you have to protect Dr.Mobius and the villiagers. They just seem to love killing themselves in the tiberium fields. XD
The door knob AI is still here and the Awful pathfinding where they hug the walls.

The graphics looks great. Everything is sharp and colourful. You can switch between legacy and remastered during single player. Which is fun in itself looking at the changes and details added to the sprites.
Example of the GDI advanced guard tower. Always wondered what the hell it was. Now I know it's a deluxe apartment with self defence missiles.

Never got to experience much of the multiplayer CnC of the 90s (console kid) :(
However, now I do! 
let me say. custom matches are straight up fun! You can even skirmish against the AI. Could spend hours easy just playing the skirmish and custom matches with friends.

theres even quickmatch/quickplay which is like the ranked play. Fun too, but your going to run into folks far better (if you're me) and may or may not have stopped playing this game in it's two decade absence. 
Matches can be entertaining as heck. So don't get discouraged, keep playing. Soon as you figure out quickplay is different than house games with friends. You be winning matches in no time.
quick is right. These matches don't take more than 10 minutes 90%. This mode could use a few adjustments I feel. Like, no starting units. maybe redeployable MCV

The game was made with great intentions and they've fulfilled the promise of bringing back the old games with all of their respective content and much more (specifically what the community requested) in 4K. With that said, though, the problems of unit pathing and old technical game mechanics remain a part of the game, and I can't recommend the game to people that are looking for a ""new"" RTS that they can expect to keep playing for the coming years.

The creators, in my mind, should have made the game modern. The devs did perform some adjustments, like what they did to the build menu, but there's so much more that could have been done. The devs should have gone further and created new unit pathing, better unit awareness (what to do and when to do it, such as attacking), added attack-move and stances, changed how buildings are placed, allow multiple buildings of the same type to tab, set rally points, ect. They could have kept the game's core mechanics and units while allowing for better modern playability, making it a competitor for modern matchmaking RTS games. Instead, your units don't do what you want them to do most of the time, and whenever you tell them to go somewhere they take paths and attack in ways that makes the player's input more of a suggestion rather than a direct task.

The game feels like a ""let's make a game for nostalgia's sake"" rather than ""let's remake the game so that it can stand in modern era."" It feels like a project that someone *wanted* to do rather than making a functionally modern take on the game. A good example of what they could have done is Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition. They made the game so it works in a modern setting with new pathing, better AI, and optional feature changes as well as additional content.

More like they gave any of the original staff a check and told them to stay home because I refuse to believe anyone who worked on these two games would throw away the historic product of their own past hard work, and sign off on this POS.

Outside of the music, FMV work and work scrounging up all that behind the scenes footage some unpaid intern probably found, the rest of this is so crap it burnt away all my good will and nostalgia.

All thats good here is what I just mentioned, the following is (not even) everything wrong...
[list]
[*]There are brand new pathing issues ontop of a pathing algorithm that has not been modernised in the slightest. Its so bad I had an empty and full harvester fighting at my refinery.
[*]Lag, theres quite a bit of it, especially in RA. In C&C it was mild but in RA it was very bad spikes.
[*]There are graphical bugs such as the Obelisk's laser remaining on screen in legacy graphics.
[*]Im not sure if it was the same in the original but some units dont have animations. The easiest example is in C&C where GDI infantry have an idle animation while Nod infantry dont. This might be authentic but even so, they should have modernised it in that case and put in some new animations because it sticks out.
[*]Another point on animations: The unit animations are in line with the original, so it makes it a bit janky, which isnt what I would associate with a remaster, especially when I have the option to swap between the remastered and legacy graphics, they might have just dropped the ball here, or it could have been to outside of the scope of the project just to smooth out the animations but you really notice a detailed model with a janky movement animation.
[*]The saturation for blue and other non standard colours is so high it ruins the washed out, realistic look these two games had.
[*]There are a few places where modernising would have been the better option imo, such as the lack of an attack move command or the command to move at the slowest units speed which is explicitly only a feature in RA.
[*]The Skirmish AI is brain dead, the game defaults to the objective of destroying all buildings and when you destroy the AI's Construction Yard it sells all its buildings for the traditional C&C last ditch attack, but now it has no buildings so the game kills all its units as its been defeated, thats not a feature, thats bad AI, and its also a bit too easy, sending waves of units but dispersed so they move in a line.
[*]MP games seem to be limited to 2v2 while even the maps have enough spawn points for 3v3. Not sure if its intention is to be expandable through mods or what.
[*]Shared allied vision doesnt work with AI.
[*]MP disconnects.
[*]MP delay is horrendous.

You came here to hear why you should buy [b]this[/b] one. 

If you're still not sold already by the headline, then I'll make it simple for you.

[b]If you're not a C&C fan:[/b] Buy this to experience gaming history. These games, and their predecessor [i]Dune[/i], are the progenitors of all RTS games as you know them today.

[b]If you're a C&C fan:[/b] [u]Just buy it.[/u]

[b]Developer[/b]: YES. Petroglyph is the closest you're going to get to OG Westwood.
[b]Gameplay[/b]: YES. Faithful to the original and looking better than ever. 
[b]Graphics?[/b]: YES. IMHO, the remastered art looks better than the original! (Toggle with Spacebar, by the way -- took me a minute to figure that out)
[b]Music:[/b]: YES. FRANK KLEPACKI HIMSELF, what more is there to say?!
[b]Sound:[/b]: YES. (EVA's voice has been re-recorded and sounds better than ever.)
[b]Movies:[/b] YES. Smoother than ever and free of interlaced lines!
[b]Mods?[/b] YES. Three words: Steam Workshop Support.

83,70600321,english,"I'm not entirely sure how i feel about this Remaster. I have been playing C&C for 20~ years and this has good and bad. This review is for the solo aspect of Red Alert.

The Good.
-The graphics look incredible. I'm stunned at how well everything looks compared to the original.
-The remastered fmv and bonus clips are extremely fun to watch and it's nice getting a peek behind the scenes after all these years.
-The updated interface is clean and makes most things easier to navigate.
-The updated controls and button mapping is huge plus.

The Bad
-They broke some of the campaign levels. If you don't do things in exactly the right order in a few of the campaign missions it breaks the script of the game so you don't realize its broken until later and the mission never completes so you have to restart it.
-They made saving the game very strange. This one is minor but you can only new save and not overwrite games so when you are playing particularly finicky campaign missions where you need to save constantly you end up with dozens of unnecessary saves.
-The BIGGEST con of this remaster is skirmish is completely busted. There are no in game animations except for movement. No explosions no nukes no firing of tanks. Creating a game is extremely frustrating, no randomizing of colors or faction, you can't place where certain players will be on the map except by going one by one which is extremely weird, it resets your color every match which is just aggravating (no i don't want to be yellow), and the perhaps the most frustrating after every skirmish match it resets every setting you made except for the map. So every time you want to play a new match you have to remake all players with faction selection and colors and placement all over again. Every single time. To me this is worse than the original game which is baffling to me.

In my opinion if you want to only play the campaign this is great but if you want to play multiplayer or skirmish you are better off playing on cncnet. If they fix the multiplayer problems i will change this to recommend but the current remaster just sits strange with me.",1591822768,1591822768,False,120,16,0.607583284378051758,14,True,False,False,76561198093961258,48,3,8263,0,3421,1596073309

Music to my ear holes. this game is pure nostalgia in a good way. The plays just like it did in the 90s when I first played it, but with a very nice graphics upgrade. My fingers are crossed for Red Alert 2 and Tiberium Sun. Please please pleeeeeeaaaasssss!!!!!!",1591812945,1591812945,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198026426940,146,6,491,0,491,1591462477
23,70562178,english,"Don't get me wrong I love Red Alert. It is a great classic legendary rts game on the level of Starcraft and Total Annihilation. I have played it since 1996 multiple times from the CD ROM on the DOS BOX emulator. I have also played the free OpenRA version as well before the remastered release. I am an old Red Alert 1 player.

I am only downvoting so the developers will see what is wrong with this remaster. Remaster isn't simply prettier graphics and a better ui and modernized music. The biggest issues in this remaster is in the programming. I will make a list so they will update it to be even better.

Problems in this remaster:

1. Wierd lag during the first loading of the game. This never occurs on the 1996 CD-Rom version.

2. Windowless window crashes the game. I think computer switches resolution and game gets stuck. You must play on windowed mode.

3. Loading into transports problem. Hinders competitive gameplay. The old programming was based on randomly assigned unit priority rather than closest distance to the transport like other games, such as Starcraft.

4. Unit pathing in chokepoints of large armies will lead them into enemy bases where they will die.

5. Selection reticle box on unit is either hit or miss half the time. Frustrating to click. The only way is to click and drag to fully select them.

6. Missing terrain in the remastered version. Sloppy lemon sky remaster. They clipped off the edges of some maps and left out the terrain. Hit spacebar on some maps to see the original version. You will see why some units will not move through the map and some buildings will not be placed down.

7. No rally point??? You add unit queuing after taking the idea from Red Alert 2/OpenRA, but no rally point. Rally point was something they had from Red Alert 2 and OpenRA. Really?

8. Cutscene loss of quality. If you go look at the bonus rehearsal and cutscenes, the quality of the original takes were still good. They were done in 1996. What they could have done was taken those scenes and remaster the quality from those green screen versions. I know it is too much work. This suggestion is not that important. Still, the remastered cutscenes are ""slightly"" better than the original game. Still hurts my eyes a little to watch them.

9. Still useless scoring system. What is the point of the scoring system if you can't compare the scores with other players in the world to know how well you do on campaign and skirmish missions. I know players do speed runs on games. Also, color is broken. I was saving blue scores as Soviets and red scores as Allies. What it should be:  Blue=Allies. Red=Soviets.

10. Cannot select units if you did not deploy your buildings successfully. If you click on a far spot or blocking terrain to deploy, you cannot right click cancel and select your units. The only option is to cancel construction and select your units.

11. 1996 Game version is zoomed out so original graphics look better. Remastered version is deliberately zoomed in so original graphics look worse and it makes the remastered graphics look better. Even so, the colors in remastered don't match original color.

12. So called ""classic"" music is just the original music from 1996 version muffled. Just listen to the 1996 original songs on youtube and ""classic"" songs from the remastered game. You can tell the difference. Remastered so-called ""classic"" music is muffled to make ""remastered"" music sound better. But in reality ""remastered"" music is the same as the 1996 version.

Petroglyph is a bit scummy with #11 and #12.

People please if you find problems in the remastered version please make a review and comment to make the game even better.

The space-bar option allows you to switch back and forth between 1995 and 2020 graphics during the game. This alone just captures what fans and gamers want. Remastered games are primarily for nostalgia and this feature neatly delivered it.

The gameplay is generally not cluttered and it's simply amazing to play a 25 years old classic with no hassle. Just buy, download, and launch game. Ta-da. Achieving this is much harder than you can imagine, if you consider other failed endeavours.

things i've noticed....

- Unit logic is pants. units take tours via enemy base when not told to. IE harvesters taking stupid routes 
- Game lagged badly until i moved it to an SSD 
- Not enough control customisations for my liking. 
- If you capture an enemy conyard then un-deloy and redeploy you lose their build queue. 
- Units get stuck on bridges and wont move over it. 
- Cant seem to destroy bridges
- Most of the included skirmish maps are pants. AI runs out of money before building any sort of army
- does not feel like it zooms out enough for modern screens
- some of the graphics are still low res and using original graphics. Looks wrong, some explosions for example. 
- Some of the missions seem to plain just not work. Cant complete etc. 
- I feel like the middle mouse scroll is wrong. It should work as if you was dragging the ground not scrolling 
- Hotkeys like place down built structure as mapped to buildings not ""generic"" 
- How to undeploy conyard is not obvious as not mentioned in controls.  
- Microing units is near impossible. They are slow to respond to commands. 

While this may be negative, I am glad this game was made. But i think rather than bringing everything over. The Good and the Bad it would of been a chance to fix some bugs that plagued the original. Or atleast have an option to choose modern and legacy engines. 

I come from an OpenRA background so maybe bias. But many of these things have been fixed. Things that make it unplayable in a competitive way, in a modern setting. They wouldn't detract from it being based on the original. (which i grew up playing)

I cannot rate this easily because i know nostalgia is causing me to grin whenever i hear the music and the audio cues.

Fun, i would recommend for RTS players (if you have not played the older RTS games like warcraft 1 or C&C back in the day, get ready for some pain as there isn't functions we have come to know and love like attack move)

major issue is the AI and difficulty: 

If you played the original, you would know that there wasnt a difficulty setting, you now have one which modifies dmg dealt/taken and unit health for both sides (and unconfirmed extra resources for the AI in campaign).

I would stick to normal, as its the std C&C game without modifiers, if you are thinking of playing on hard, may the cheese be with you (you will need it for some missions) as you will need to exploit AI and the projectile speed with fast moving units with a slow response time in order to succeed on missions without base building.",1591463244,1591802959,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198001240073,596,13,636,0,131,1595348739

but thats about it. I remember I´ve plunged many many hours on Red Alert and all its expansions by playing it through at least like three times on each side.
Nowadays, I actually couldnt remember one mission, so it was all kinda new. Only the units reports were familiar to me. It was kinda funny to play that game again and the feeling of the cursor changing when moving over target was a feeling of childhood.
The music is also cmotivating and awesome.

Anyway many things are missing: 
1. rally points (didnt know how annoying it is without) 
2. they did not improve the quality of the videos - I barely could identify anything on them

Above all, the point that kinda breaks the game to me was the speed of gameplay. Actually, I did not remember it was such a haste. You are just five minutes in a mission and already get attacked on three sides.

The remastered visuals aren't revolutionary but very functional and faithful to the original. Plus it smooths out the game and helps maintain the nostalgia. The remastered music is awesome and there is a lot of it. 

The multiplayer is great, but a bit simple. There is no stats screen to see your overall performance (unless you get in the top 200, then you get to see your total wins and losses). It's great fun but unless they introduce some sort of seasonal map pool that switches every so often I see it getting boring. Also, mass tanks seems to be the simpelest way to victory and a lot of players are doing it. If you try to tech up you can get easily overrun by the enemy that has more tanks than you since you spent resources on tech buildings. It can be done on bigger maps, but you are just playing fancy at that point while mass tanks would also work. I hope the meta changes with some updates because I'd like to see a bit more variety in the multiplayer. If they leave it as is I see the multiplayer dying out in a few months and losing it's base to CnCnet, which would be sad since te remastered quality of this game. Seeing they released the sourcecode and mapeditors, there could be an amazing community driven multiplayer. For that to work though they need to support the game with patches and some regulation in which maps get into the official map pool. I really hope they do but honestly I doubt it.

The singleplayer is as cheesily magnificent as it always was. The remastered cutscenes make them a lot more watchable on a hd screen. Plus there is an amazing amount of content with all missions of both games and all the expansions. If you're a completionist the singleplayer alone will proof to have an insane amount of content and even if you're not it will take you quite some time to play through all missions on normal difficulty.

Enough said.
If that isn't enough for you though. 
I was highly dubious about buying this game due to EA and we all know how much EA likes to mess around with Fan favourites. Having said that I think EA did the best thing they could have done with this game.
They left the developers alone by the looks of it and have allowed Petroglyph to remaster this classic game in a way that does the series and Westwood of old proud.
They've updated the graphics which are decent.
Re-done all of the music to modern standards. I think it sounds better.
Up-scaled the fmv's to look better, but you can tell that they haven't been able to do it for all of the parts of the fmv's and it sticks out then. Overall WAY better than the 1995 vids.

The reason I would recomend this game is that I enjoyed the campaign very much. The campgain was chalanging and funn to play.

One thing that can be annoying is that the units sometimes does not feel responsive, I belive the reason for this is that if a unit is in a animation your order would queued. As the current animation for the unit needs to be completed before the next animation can start. This is where it can be demanding and frustrating to command units, since by no fault of your own you cant controll units by your own accord.

 - Easy game to jum into

66,70567595,english,"Being born after the release of the two games in this remaster, and not getting into PC gaming until 2012, its safe to say that I never experienced C&C until I found out about OpenRA in 2017, which had many hours for me and my friends to experience for free. When I heard about the release of the remaster I knew I wanted to buy it.

It must be made clear that this game is true to the original, and in my opinion that is to its disadvantage.

There are many things that are missing from Command and Conquer that would be made available in only 2 years by Starcraft. There is no attack move, you can't hotkey buildings, there is no rally points, and there is no fog of war. 

These have all been mainstay features of RTS games for 22 years that are not in the remaster.

I think the game would benefit greatly from the addition of these features, not only making the audience of Command and Conquer larger, but making it more competitively viable.

I love C&C as a franchise. I love its style, music, units, voice-lines, and cut-scenes. But I also love the many RTS features that have been innovated over the years, and i'm sure most people do.

If you want to relive nostalgia, get it. If you want another RTS to play, don't.

Great for nostalgia and great for a quick ""command-by-click"" fix.  I even dig how you can see the graphics improvements between 1995 and today.  The ""Behind the Scenes"" of C&C and  access to the expansion set missions are a good thing, too.  

The big issue is how (and even why) this has been brought into the ocean of games today!   That's the big tripwire here.  How has this improved since the 95' and why should I take 30 minutes or more to actually play versus me just taking a few seconds to reminisce?  I was expecting not only to reminisce as I played but to enjoy game play advantages that we have learned since the original introduction in 1995.

I stopped playing because the ""AI"" is so brain dead that it's not worthy of today's term of ""AI.""  I was expecting my soldiers to have the situational awareness from C&C Generals.  THEY DON'T!  Enemy soldiers have range on you while your guys need to be within breathing distance to engage.

81,70348983,english,"Can't speak highly enough of the process the remaster team went through in order to make this game. They listened to fan feedback and really put their heart and soul into this one. 

The Game: The graphics are greatly updated from the original games and look really sharp. The gameplay UI is still a tad clunky but greatly overall improved with the things like unit queuing skirmish mod for the original C&C title. You can toggle quickly between the orginal graphics and remasters to see just much work they put into remastering this one. I tried all the game modes and they're all great. The modding community is already working hard to create even more variety in the game modes. EA released the source code a few days early so the modders could get a head start. They also remastered quite a few of the classic cheesy cutscenes that gave the original C&Cs so much heart. 

One thing that deserves special mention is the soundtrack. The original composer remastered the entire soundtrack and it sounds incredible. Always had one of the best soundtracks. 

So in short if you're a fan of RTS, C&C, or even just good atmosphere games this one does not let you down. it's worth buying even if you just want to support a very good remaster done with honest work. It's also worth buying if you just want to see the same remaster treatment for later games in the C&C series like Tiberum Sun or Red Alert 2.

From the point of view of a time capsule and nostalgia, there's stuff I like here.  The updated visuals in game are simple, but nice, and I love being able to switch between old and new graphics, it's always a great feature.  The music is awesome and sounds fantastic, Frank Klepacki makes me happy.  The cutscenes are improved slightly from what I understand, though the quality is still pretty terrible on them, but I guess there wasn't any way to get around that short of remaking them entirely.  This was my first RTS game back in the day, I remember playing it on N64 and PC over 20 years ago and certain things hit me right.

That said, this game is over 20 years old.  They seemingly kept everything from the original and that includes bad AI, bad AI pathing, there are a few bugs here and there, there are some really not good level designs, you can cheese the enemy pretty hard with sandbags to keep them from attacking your base, and I found that eventually on normal, that the game gets more infuriating than it does fun.  One level in particular you can lose through no fault of your own, because the civilians kill themselves in the Tiberium, so you have to basically rush to corral them behind sandbags and hope you get lucky.  

In the end, for those with nostalgia for the series and are hoping they remaster Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 next, you'll be able to find something to enjoy even among the frustration.

For those wanting a particularly good RTS they haven't played, I don't think this is it.  This game is simple, but there's a lot of old jank that'll keep people from really enjoying it I think, especially if they are use to RTS games that added a lot of necessary improvements later on.

62,70557194,english,"I can't put words to how happy I am with this game. I was completely taken by surprise at the graphics being updated, I had been expecting just a few tweaks to the original but generally pretty much the same experience. You are notified on screen to hit a key and bam! There it was, my favourite game ever was immediately transformed into something much more satisfying to most players. It was not just pretty, but a much welcomed & fantastic quality graphic improvement. 
I had been a C&C fan since release of the first game, me & a friend used to sneak into his father's pc room as children during the summer holidays and smash out a good few levels on both NOD & GDI almost every day for 6 weeks before returning to school & dreaming about the next set of school holidays so that we could get back on the game. 
These were the days that I will often look back with a smile, it was completely fun. Fun, even though we hadn't read the instructions booklet so had NO idea what the MCV was or how to use it. We slowly but surely crush our enemies under our fat tracks, we showed the enemy as we ruthlessly crushed about 5 enemy infantry before we blew up.
Eventually we discovered how to use the vehicle properly & in fact it was not much of a tank but a construction yard to build a base with & THEN....more troops!!!! Our days were dramatically changed, we'd mess up the mission & restart, back & forth until we completed that mission, moving onto the next & repeating the same method.
Minutes turned into hours, hours into days, weeks, months & then it turned out that years have past. His father had not purchased Red Alert on release, but was my father who had got his hands on a copy & passed it to me amongst many other games with the massive collection of CD Roms. My next encounter in the C&C series continued, but turned out that I had missed addons for the original game but no matter, I had this now. Just like the original I spent most days slowly getting through the campaign but this time I had got the addons & the game got even more fun.


Now it's 2020, Westwood Studios no longer exists but that does not mean Kane is dead. His legacy continues in this master piece of a remastered collection. I wasn't expecting RA1 to come out together as part of a collection along with the addons for both games and even workshop was open for the modding community to produce masterpiece maps and possibly units, new effects, money and more fun.

One thing in the game that wasn't the missions or units was the soundtrack that I kinder looked forward to more than actually playing the game again, even though I had the messed Origin version. But O M G the soundtrack is amazing!!! I had listened to it many times on YouTube but even this wasn't left completely like the original. It had been revamped, new technology that brought the music out of 90's disco electronic house to something that was perfect for 2020. Yeah ok, it won't be hitting any of the popular music charts but they still rock like they did in the past. I still get the hair on my arms standing up to tracks like Hell March, Act on Instinct and my fav, Just Do It Up. A perfect track list that beats anything to play along while you wipe out your enemies.

The missions are all there in full, impressive units to destroy your enemies but also buildings to support you as you develop your battle plan have been remastered also. No longer blotchy, lack of enough pixels to treat your eyes to. Thankfully the route didn't follow the comic book graphics of C&C Generals, C&C3 and RA3. These actually look closer to their relatives in the real world. Humvee and Abrams looking like the beasts that they are. Talking about beasts, I haven't even got to the Mammoth Tank yet! NOD also looking fantastic too, the attack buggy looks like the low funded raiding machine that it is. The light tank appears to be something that can punch a hole in GDI's lines without completely changing the unit's entity. Basic, cheap(ish) but effective to do the job. Lastly even infantry got their makeover but doesn't go anywhere near to the squad based unit that happened in C&C3 or the Military Muscle Men toys in Red Alert 2. 
Inbetween missions you will be briefed by Seth, General Sheppard or even Kane but this time it's not ruined by blocks of pixels that struggle to make out an eye. These clips have been improved to be more clear, sound is crisp and refreshing and all done without having to develop the Chronosphere to go back in time with your HD cell phone (mobile in my native Britain) busting into Westwood Studios and fighting with security long enough to understand what Kane's right hand man""Just"" Seth had said.

I've never been a fan of remastered games nor films, and as the date came closer I was a bit nervous after ActivisionBlizzard effing up Warcraft's release. I worried about in game stores that offered 3 different sets of Kane's forehead or unlocking the next mission from purchase of ingame currency. But alas, I was wrong to worry. There's nothing like that. I can't even imagine where such a thing would go nor what they could sell. Which is refreshing after many good games that were continued in a series being ruined by such stores.

My only disappointment was the CGI (not GDI :P ) being updated and having some really up to date between mission scenes being shown in an updated fashion. Not that it mattered, the CGI was pretty good back in the day considering 1995 was poop for graphics, there was no 4k 1080 HD n whatever. These were games that were good, not just look good. This was back when you would pay $50 for a pc game, and another $30 per  addon and got a full game and not some reskin (I actually made myself lol here) of the previous title, we won't need to wait to be able to use the workshop or have online matches!

Finally I'm going to say what I think of this game.

THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF 2020. By far, and I'm being serious. I completely believe this. It's so great to play these 2 titles again without struggling to get either of the buggers to work!! (Origin / EA Version)

88,70554949,english,"I'll probably be repeating what others have said, but I will try to chip in some Original thoughts. I'm enjoying the game, and I think its worth a buy; but there are some issues that should be addressed that should hopefully be irrelevant or solved within a few months or years after this review was submitted.

On the topic of issues that you should know about:
1. Performance stuttering
Many people have reported stuttering and I my self have noticed minor stuttering affecting performance issues. I got around it in singleplayer by loading the mission and letting it run for about a minute before restarting the mission. I've noticed some stuttering in multiplayer, but it seems to go away on its own.

2. Multiplayer Lobbies and Netcode
Multiplayer has a few issues as well like the lack of options to create private matches/passworded games/friends only matches. The net code will need some work as I found that I'm able to load into games faster than others and get a base established before people finally get out the loading screen. So be aware of that.

3. Faithful game mechanics
At the time of the release the game was pretty ground breaking, but being a new genre and an old game there are few things that hadn't been solved by the developers, this mean the remaster has inherited the problems from the original games as well. The unit path finding is the same from the original game, so expect your units to not go in the direction you want them move in or to take weird detours, sometimes not respond at all to your orders. It's generally better to group your units and manage your army with smaller groups than to try and manage one big blob. 

There is also the lack of an attack move key, but you sort of get around the issue by dedicating a group of units to run ahead of the group to soak up fire from enemy units and then manage of the rest of your units by ordering them to attack a specific unit or move them into a specific spot near the enemy forces and order them into guard mode. Thankfully this one should be modded out since the developers were kind to make the source code be open sourced and projects like openra have incorporated this feature.

What's good about it then?
Well for 20 US dollars you get two games, a map editor, plus the expansion packs and addons of the two games, remastered graphics, remastered soundtrack plus the old soundtrack, the games source code, a ton of bonus missions plus bonus missions from the console version, 4 campaigns(GDI, NOD, Allies, Soviets), skirmish mode, multiplayer, and never before seen behind the scenes content.

The game is very faithful to the original both graphically and mechanically and the developers have modernized the game to run on modern systems as well as make multiplayer possible again without having to deal with antiquated systems such as play by mail. So if you wanted to play the original Tiberium Dawn/Red Alert without the hassle of old networking systems or were turned off by the graphics you should be able to try out the game. Also keep an eye out for some cool mods/or total conversions.

Any Minor gripes Constructive criticisms?
I found the TD cutscenes to be of a pretty good quality, while the RA ones to be lower quality and out of focus; but I imagine this had to do more with technical limitations and the fact the original footage is now lost to time which is a shame; but you should be able to still enjoy the campaign.

Hopefully for multiplayer we can see more community building stuff to give that game some longevity like a battle.net chat lobby system and the ability to make private lobby system that we can invite people too.

Final verdict: Worth buying now, but if you are the cautious type wait a week or two for some of the performance kinks to be addressed.",1591736755,1591736755,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197999945092,240,9,1602,3,1054,1601502504

For those that played hundreds of hours of C&C in the 90s, I think many of us forgot the widespread difficulty that existed back then for getting into (reliable) multiplayer matches. The vast majority of us were still on terrible dial-up connections in 1995/6 and resorted to direct modem connections to play each other.

C&C Remastered fixes all that, and more.

If you remember, Westwood Chat (the studio's answer for gaming over IP) even tracked the amount of disconnections you had in ladder play alongside your wins and losses, because they were so frequent.

For me, the Remaster's campaign is great for a trip down memory lane, but it's more about unlocking the multiplayer potential for Tib Dawn and RA. I realize that CnCNet and the open-source projects helped fix this, but I never had much luck getting into a good lobby.

Never has it been so easy to just hop into a match of your choosing, either solos, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, or FFA. Is the gameplay simpler and less refined than modern games like Starcraft 2? Yep. But I prefer the simplicity of C&C's multiplayer meta. It's still awesome and a load of fun. It's great to have well-populated and officially supported lobbies with plenty of humans to play vs. again.

I only played (SP) Red Alert so far (finished the Allied and Soviet campaign).
And i also played only single-player.


So what can i say?

-the music is awesome (but it sucks that there are no music files to be found, wish i could put them on my mp3 player)
-the graphics are nice (dont really care that much about graphics)
-the A.I. is like a loaf of bread, it is borderline frustrating stupid (i can't remember the A.I. from back then but they did a good job bringing back the incompetence)
-yes, it lacks all modern comfort (like rally-points and so on, but i don't want that, because it's supposed to be that way)

Completely uninstall Nvidia drivers and launch the game with no drivers installed, popped up immediately, no issues at all. I then did a complete reinstall of Nvidia, reset all of my options and BAM, works like a charm. Reinstalling the drivers won't work, I had already tried that, you have to launch the game without any graphic card drivers installed, then go into settings of the game and set all of your options, reboot, install a fresh set of Nvidia, latest drivers and presto, up an running.

31,70548172,english,"This is the game that I have been waiting for from EA for years.

My first experience with Command & Conquer was TibDawn when I was 4-5 years old. My uncle played it while he was in the Air Force, and brought it back with him when he came home, installing it on the old PC at my grandparents' house. 

Flashback: The year was 1997, and my grandfather is begging me to get off of his computer and go outside. I'm a 5 year old boy, playing the first three or four GDI missions over and over again, because I barely know what I'm doing, but every replay of those missions is pure joy. My uncle actually helped me beat the campaign, and I enjoyed reloading and replaying from the save in the final mission, where I was just building up my base after the end goals were nearly complete. These are my first memories of this game.

Flash forward to 2008: I'm a seasoned veteran of the series at this point. I own every game in the franchise. I'm home sick from school for a few days, and I decide to boot up original CnC again, determined to beat the Nod campaign on my own. I tell my uncle all about it. He's like ""we have to battle it out sometime."" I'm both excited and terrified for this challenge. We play three games that day. He creams me in the first two. In the third one, I'm holding my own for a while, my younger cousin watching over my shoulder. He starts his big push and leaves me just about in the dust. I look at my cousin and tell him ""This NEVER works... Don't try it. I've lost. I just wanna see what happens."" I proceed to sell everything and throw it at his base in a final attempt to go down fighting. I notice the engineer in my procession of poor souls. They start to pass the defenses. He's actually making it towards the ConYard! I begin to build from inside while he's distracted by the chaos surrounding. I win the game in the stupidest way possible.

And to the present... This game is exactly what I want. All its old goofy flaws and all. The fantastic soundtracks, the campy storyline and cinematics, the absurd units, all of it. This is my entire childhood wrapped up in one remaster. This feels like a labor of love on the part of the creators, and I'm shocked that EA got it exactly right. Even the loading screens and cinematics give me chills.

If you buy this looking for a game that isn't classic C&C, you're gonna be disappointed. If you buy it with the knowledge that this is Command & Conquer, and you loved this games in their original state, you're gonna love this game.

42,70544751,english,"Firstly, I want to say that I am a huge fan of red alert. It saddens me that Westwood studios isn't still around with us today (even if a lot of the original talent was able to get actively involved with this remake). So, please consider that my criticism is intended to be constructive, and I want this game to thrive. 

Firstly, some praise: I am pleased that this game offers some modding support, and having the game on steam is convenient.

Also, this game makes a big show of showcasing the remastered graphics (For example, there is a gimmick which allows you to downgrade your graphics to the original 95 release in an instant), as well as showcasing other creative items which has received some revitalization. Despite the delivery, I appreciate these features.

The thing that frustrates me most about this game is how little effort has been put into making units less braindead. It seems that noone got around to the task of addressing the AI/pathing issues from 25 years ago. Some examples:

* A single heavy tank can wipe out an army of light tanks in a matter of minutes. This is because units are completely passive and wont react to a threat which is 1 tile out of their range.
* If an enemy is behind a friendly wall, the friendly units will destroy all the walls in a straight line between themselves and the enemy, rather than pathing 1-2 tiles around the wall and engaging the enemy directly.
* Traffic jams- if you are trying to load 5 units into a naval transport vehicle, sometimes vehicles will remain in a traffic jam indefinitely. The same applies to an army of vehicles attacking an enemy unit- they often attack one at a time, with an entire army getting stuck behind 1/2 tanks.
* waypointing - if you tell a vehicle to attack an enemy unit, sometimes the vehicle will try to park on top of the enemy vehicle before engaging its guns. This often results in heavy losses because units almost refuse on principle to use a range advantage if they have it.

Other issues with the game:

- A bad multiplayer experience (2/4 of my games with friends were dropped)
- Janky multiplayer menu
- multiplayer games often stagnate because both sides run out of money (this is no different to the original game (except that mutliplayer games on CnC.net often had maps with modded ore regen rates), but for a modern revitalisation I would expect for this issue to be tweaked.)

TLDR: At its core, CnC is just as awesome as it was 25 years ago. Some aspects of the game have received some love, and EA/Petroglyph really want you to notice these. Other aspects of the game are inexcusably antiquated and need some attention. I would hold off on buying this game for the moment (especially if you never played the original) because I don""t feel like the game satisfies all the features of a modern title. I believe that how far this game goes will depend on the frequency and quality of patches going into the future.

60,70541245,english,"People need to remember one key thing when going for games like this. It is a 'Remastered' version.

Firstly, Remastered - What does it mean? 
-In the sound industry, where music is reguarly remastered, it means ""to make a new master of (a recording), typically in order to improve the sound quality."" In gaming, we can simply remove the word 'sound'.

Gamers often confuse 'Remastered' with 'Remake'. Examples of recent Remakes are Capcom's Resident Evil 2, SquareEnix's Final Fantasy VII on the Playstation 4, and Nintendo's 'Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee'. Remakes change the core game in some places, often taking an entirely new direction with the same ideal of story. By changing the way cameras work, the gameplay must change. With the gameplay changing means aspects of the game are ultimately very different. All three examples above are remakes, and are quite different to their original games in many ways.

So Remastered, means to alter or change an existing game. Improve its quality but retain the original. In regards to Command & Conquer Remastered, the only thing they haven't changed is the core gameplay. if you were expecting improvements to it, or changes, you will be disappointed. They are fundamentally the same games from 1995/1996 with all their good and bad quirks. All the little annoyances you knew back then are still issues that exist in this version. Because that was the game. Start to change that, and you change the game.

The Remastered aspects of this game come in the forms of Graphics, 'Upscaled' Cinematics, and Music. The ingame graphics are supreme. Every unit, ground texture, building has been redone to support a 4k resolution and retains the identity of the original. Every unit is as easy to identify as the original graphics. And if you want to have retro-vision, press Space and you can switch between the old pixelated graphics of yesteryear and the new lick from today. 

The music, if you go by the new tracks by Frank and the Tiberian Sons, is all you'll want to listen to for days. The rest of the original OST music is here has all been remastered, the compositions themselves getting a remastering with our modern tech to give it new lease of life. And again, if you just wanna go full retro, the original unchanged OST is in the game too, where you can on or off the Low Fidelity old music, High fidelity music, and Frank and the Tiberian Sons' new recordings. 

I could tell you about the game itself, the gameplay. But you can read 1000's of reviews of those anywhere. It's a 25 year old game, and whilst we get some small UI improvements and Quality of Life - Like being able to change the mouse button to move/attack, queuing unit building. So far most of my gameplay has been exclusively in Tiberian Dawn, as I plan to do that then Red Alert. But the old unit pathing where units get stuck driving into each other on bridges, Harvesters not finding Tiberian if you haven't found it in the Fog of War yet. Tanks not firing at enemies if moving. Units not autofiring on enemies unless within a very set radius. APC's and other units struggling to mount/dismount units if you click too fast. Some of these issues are fixed in Red Alert I am aware. But this is more to remind you that it has quirks from 1995, they have not been fixed. It can be frustrating to players who are used to very modern RTS games that expect everything to work logically, as it won't.

Recommended, on the basis that playing an original version of this game is difficult on modern hardware. Origin has these games on the C&C Collection packs, but they are janky as hell. This makes them a bit more friendly and playable. But the campaigns are not easy, In fact Tiberian Dawn is probably one of the hardest RTS campaigns I have played. So plenty of content to be found.

New UI improvements are awesome
Option to pick between Legacy and Modern controls is a nice touch
So far no big bugs
Wonderful campaign


Negatives or Improvements needed:

With so much improved in this game, it would have been nice to get some improvement to the cinematics, they look bad after playing a mission with  new graphics. AI is also not improved.


Really enjoying it so far, two of the best RTS campaigns now with some modern touchups, while still keeping the feel of the old classics in many ways. This is up there with Age Of Empire 2 DE as great examples of how to do remasters of old RTS games properly! Especially after how bad the Warcraft 3 reforged and Mafia 2 remaster turned out, its nice to see some devs taking this process seriously. This makes me want Red Alert 2 remaster, along with my favorite rts ever, Dune 2 :)

There are even bonus, unreleased missions added and even the console missions from the C+C console game, you can tell a ton of love went into this and that some of the old Westwood team worked on this.

Thanks for the great job on this devs, this just might be the BEST Remaster of all time!

Well C&C Remastered is finally here. I have to admit that I was not hyped for this. As someone who regularly plays OpenRA, there was no lack of C&C on my part, but I was looking forward to the original cinematics and improved graphics.

So how is the Remastered? It's fine. What it does good is the improved graphics, which you can easily switch back and forth (with zoom, nice!) and, i mean that's about it really. The game is the same we know and love. It's good, innit? Petroglyph have done a good job remastering it (something we must now double-check in a post-WC3 Reforged era).

 A few people have been complaining about technical issues, they seem to be a minority. Personally I only noticed some minor bugs (annoyingly, the campaign missions high score list doesn't seem to work properly. it always updates the same position). Also played a few multiplayer matches and while the actual lobby menu seems quite laggy, there was no lag in the game itself; the lobby was a mix of Origin and Steam users so that's good. Another small caveat that I have is the large difference in quality between RA and TD cinematic videos, which I imagine are either due to saving format or the fact that in TD most of the cinematics are face close-ups.

Really for the asking price you can't go wrong, and if you want to experience the singleplayer of the first to C&C games this is your best option. The new graphics are very nice and the game mechanics have, in my opinion, aged well.

If, however, you want to play competitive multiplayer I suggest looking at OpenRA, which also has improved graphics (although nothing on this scale), but the quality of life improvements it brings is really where that version shines most; to name a few: better unit pathfinding, great lobby system + spectator mode, good artillery for alliance (increased range), aerial units now hover/fly-by when ordered to move to a location instead of landing in the middle of a battlefield, units now fire from max-range whenever possible instead of doing that annoying 'guess i'll move two-three tiles closer with no reason' logic and tons of balance changes.

It is well worth your time and money, but It took the remastered to see how spoiled OpenRA made me with it's small changes. I just hope that somebody will port over those changes as a mod for this version, which supports mods out of the box; score extra points!

Unfortunately by the end of our first game we found pretty important stuff that should have been improved and we really couldn't look past. I might not remember 100% the game back in 1995 but with the visuals they should of improved a few things. 

The path finding is absolute garbage and requires some major reworking or tuning to at least be playable.
The list is long but a couple examples that kept reoccuring: 
- you tell the Artillery to attack the Turret from a distance, instead it moves right up to the Turret and gets destroyed.
- you tell the Tank to attack a building on the exterior of a base, instead of moving towards the building in a straight line and shoot from safety, it moves around the building right into the enemy base and starts shooting and succumbs to the enemy forces and turrets inside the base.

Also the AI needs major reworking in multiplayer. My friend and I played a couple games and each time the AI started off really good at first and would attack us and gives us a good challenge. But after a few waves the AI stopped attacking all together, after having a satellite up to see the whole map we realized the AI practically gave up. Their harvesters were all bunched up together and not moving, yet if they explored even a little they could see there was fresh new ore not far away. So since the AI had no more money they just sat their troops in the base and when we would attack sometimes they would fight back with what troops they had left and other times they would just let us destroy their buildings and sell them right before they were destroyed.

+ Looks amazing!
+ The soundtrack is really good
+ Multiplayer support
+ Bonus behind the scenes content

94,70536482,english,"This needs work. This is a great remaster, but is certainly not without its flaws and, sometimes, very glaring bugs.

The AI needs some work, pathfinding is atrocious and seems worse than the original game somehow. 
You cannot use the same strategies as the original game now either, due to other amendments to how the AI works. A clear example of this would be airstrikes against you if you play as NOD. Previously, the AI would always target the most north west unit or structure, so you could effectively use this to your advantage. Now, the AI will target your most valuable unit or defensive structure. However, if you also have a commando, that unit is then the priority.  This makes missions where you have a commando, or even just a select amount of units, almost impossible to do.  Not only this, but the AI can target multiple different locations with airstrikes at the same time. Using NOD mission 11 as an example, I've had airstrikes kill my commando at the top of the map, and also at the same time, take out the artillery at the bottom of the map. This is grossly unfair and honestly, isn't fun.

The fact they did these changes and kept them, whilst also stating they aren't making changes to the AI to keep it 'original', is a ridiculous argument at best. Either restore it fully to how it used to be, or fix things across the board so the units aren't so insanely stupid. Unloading units from choppers and APC's is a complete nightmare as they just refuse to come out 90% of time.

Honestly, I had a little more fun playing C&C Redux, a mod for C&C Generals Zero Hour, that faithfully restores the original C&C game into the Generals engine, and all campaign missions. It also then provides all the QOL changes that C&C Generals Zero Hour has at that point. The game plays incredibly well in that regard. 

If they fix the game up and make it more in line with modern standards somewhat, then this would be a complete masterpiece. At the moment there are too many small, but ever growing issues. 

I hope they fix the game up somewhat, and quickly. I still recommend this and certainly have a lot of fun playing it, but to say it doesn't need work would be a lie.

The original did come out in 1995, so playing the old version on modern hardware can be a pain. Also not to mention, the low res graphics. So having the graphics updated for modern systems is nice.
Another great update is the redone music. Man I found myself rocking out to the amazing soundtrack. Heck I was evening singing in the name of Kane along with the song. Really well done. Besides the graphics and music, there have been tweaks to things such as enemy AI, they aren't completely as predictable as the old version. They even have new dedicated servers, including ranked play, though I never played it yet, I have watched others play the online, and it seems very good. 
Personally I don't see myself playing much online, as I am not that good at competitive RTS, as I  tend to be a slow builder and always get my butt handed to me.
Personally, I am just enjoying the campaign. Sure the story isn't the most mind blowing thing ever, but its the actual missions themselves I play for. Just note, the cinematics are a little hard on the eyes, but overall doesn't really take away from the overall experience.
 Overall for the price, I highly recommend buying this collection, as its worth every penny, especially if you are a fan of the original. Only thing we need now is for them to remaster the other games, as this is only the 1st two games in the series. Though you get all the expansions, so you get lots of content. Also they even added on the PS1 missions, so that is a welcome bonus. I honestly only played Red Alert back in the day on Ps1, I never owned the original game, so its nice to have them both, especially now on Pc, as this plays way better with a mouse and keyboard. On a final note, I did forget to mention, you can switch between old and new graphics with a single key press if you like, though on a high res screen its hard on the eyes.

The Good
There's a lot of care and joy captured in this. 
If you played the originals this is pure nostalgia - the updates account for your rose tinted glasses. If you didn't back in the day, then this is the way to authentically experience them.
The mission design is still great. Slightly cheesy but played straight cut scenes hold up (CGI not so much). An RTS not shackled to the rock paper scissors formula is fun. It does lead to a lot of tank work, but that was always part of the fun. Also knowing this, If you get infantry rushed it's a wild surprise/all in poker move. Risking it all on Allied helicopters was a special thrill back in the day.

Not So Good
It' somehow not quite definitive yet (I hope work is still happening)
- I've noticed the high res mammoth and light tanks in Red Alert just are the tanks for Tiberium Dawn. Which is a real shame, I think of both as distinct. 
- Dog control is also iffy. I can't force attack to make them run at will, and occasionally one will jump a guy and he just survives. 
- There are also some weird slowdowns

Please can we have cross play. I'm sure balancing would need to be done. If tiberium was non lethal and looking like ore to classic factions I think this could work.
A sequel in this style would also be amazing. This is pure fan fic, but what if the next game was post Tiberium Unification Forces vs Old Order Warlords. It'd be kind of fun if the UF was a wild tech tree starting with improvised equipment leading to bizarre sci-fi weapons. The Old Order kind of hinting it had grown out of a GDI Nod Alliance.

Here are a list of the pros and cons

Pros
-Remastered visuals are night and day with the original. They maintain the art style but look smooth and you can tell what every unit is from near or far.
- The remastered music is a big improvement. The tracks are cleaner and bright some clarity to the originals that were compressed. The extra tracks by Frank and his band are also a welcome addition. This also applies to the SFX which also sound better.
- The amount of content for people in this package is awesome. I cant speak to the quality of all the expansion missions but there are a lot here for both C and C and Red Alert.
- C and C now has a skirmish mode unlike the original
- The new task bar is a huge improvement as you no longer have to scroll to find the units or buildings you want to build
- The quality of life changes like right mouse scrolling, unit health always on and left click or right click for movement is another welcome addition for those that want to customise how they play
- Unit queuing is a blessing! you no longer have to keep clicking the unit you want.
- EA seem to have kept their hands off of this project

cons
- Unit pathing has not been changed 
-AI still have strange behaviours

Yes the original AI wasn't fantastic but neither was the graphics. In 1995 this was amazing, but times have changed and small quality of life improvements would have added so much. They updated graphics, even gave us a ""Legacy"" option to experience the original look and feel, allowing the user to choose their visuals on the fly. Why not a similar overhaul for AI? Because Reddit says so? The AoE recent remaster got overhauled AI as well as graphics and it was amazing, really helping the longevity of the remaster. Could have just included an option to satisfy both purists and those actually wanting a remaster.

Pathfinding was always terrible, but even the original did a better job of auto-attacking / defending when stationary. AI stops randomly when forced to follow / defend other units thanks to pathfinding issues, Shooting from Range is also completely broken. The FPS bugs are causing some strange AI behavior particularly when loading a save. There’s also a lot of small improvements that could have been made, rally points for new units, map scroll speed etc.

This feels more like a re-skin than a remaster. 

They really did nail the visuals, but aside from that this falls flat on its face. I hope community made mods can make this more enjoyable (at least less frustrating), but this is why I wanted a remaster that improves on the original poor game design elements instead of doubling down on them.

Big missed opportunity here, I was really looking forward to this, but now I can see this just falling by the wayside and becoming just another steam title in my library that gets forgotten about.",1591683086,1591683086,False,3,0,0.498480260372161865,0,True,False,False,76561198205201149,76,7,731,0,451,1593074068

Those who complain about the game's pathfinding, AI and game play miss the point. The point of the remaster is not to improve the game and make it more playable by modern standards. The point was to give the fans back the original game, just as how they remember it. The developers wanted to stay as true to the original code as possible.

82,70521021,english,"I really hate giving this a ""No"" to recommended, as I can tell there has been a great deal of passion put into this effort. I really don't want to dissuade game companies from doing a similar thing, but the good news is - my mind can be changed. Hear me out.

The original C&C game I played on the PSX of all things. It was one of the first games I ever fell in love with. I really loved - and still do love - the unique over the top style of the cut scenes. The new scenes they added for upgrading the graphics modules were really spot on too. I would put all of that into the things they did really well.

With that out of the way, allow me to explain what I didn't like. What I didn't like is how true to the original game you kept. I know this may sound a little silly - but I expect more out of a remastered game. Look at the resident evil series remaster for inspiration if you need it. The game's core charm was kept wholely in-tact and even bolstered yet everything was modernized - far beyond simply reskinning and upscaling the old video footing as was done here. The original resident evil had horrible fixed camera angles for every room you walked in. they did away with that entirely and made it a first person shooter in full 3D.

First and foremost, you heard me right - I played C&C first on the Playstation. With a controller. I did not have a keyboard. So imagine my surprise when this game doesn't have controller support? Remaster? You sure about that?

There are many annoying things that haven't aged well and could have easily been fixed in this remaster. Example one is the zoom. Literally first day someone posted a mod in the workshop to allow the player to zoom out further. Seems like an obvious thing to fix in a remaster to me. Another thing is the annoying idiotic AI. Telling a unit to, for example, walk to a point then attack a target should not have them dutifully walk right in front of the enemy, while being shot, not returning fire until it's reached the destination you told it. This is identical to how the original game was, and if I'm honest if I wanted that experience, I'd just play the original. I think these things are well known, as later iterations of the series improved upon these things dramatically. I see no reason those same improvements couldn't have made their way into this remaster.

Further, I find the title misleading. ""Command & Conquer Remastered Collection"" is very similar to ""Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection"", but the contents are vastly different.

""Command & Conquer Remastered Collection"" contents:
• Command & Conquer
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert

""Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection"" contents:
• Command & Conquer
• Command & Conquer: The Covert Operations
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert: Counterstrike 
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert: The Aftermath 
• Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun
• Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun Firestorm
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge 
• Command & Conquer: Renegade
• Command & Conquer: Generals 
• Command & Conquer: Generals: Zero Hour 
• Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars 
• Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars: Kane's Wrath 
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3
• Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3: Uprising 
• Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight

I didn't expect all of those games to be remastered, but I do think the title and advertising was misleading. C&C and Red Alert are series not just titles, so I had mistakenly assumed that this was referring to the series, not just literally the first game of each. I'm not entirely certain what I expected, but I think I was expecting something like C&C, C&C RA, C&C Tiberian Sun, C&C RA2. I am to blame for this false assumption as it never says this anywhere, but I do think the advertising could have been a little more clear about this given C&C's past history of selling these games in large packs (to be honest, I'm not even certain that you could buy some of them individually lol - I've literally never seen it).

I hope you consider some of the points I've brought up here. I really _want_ to like this game and recommend it, but I just can't as-is. I would be better off just playing the originals all of which I own a hard copy of.",1591680400,1591680649,False,2,0,0.357068896293640137,0,True,False,False,76561198110249346,379,12,97,0,94,1591681801

But then!! 
I Tryed Command and Conquer Red Alert...This is why im giving it a Recommanded its the best RTS I ever played story was good and just the RTS part was amazing the amount of units and building and how its done is so much fun specially with friends.

However I don't think Ill buy another Command and Conquer game ever they all look dumb to me and over the top with sci-fi weirdness that just dont intrest me this one so fun cause of the Red alert one thats nothing like the other games from what i sceen on steam.

I recall long nights in mine or my best friend's basement playing with headphones, trying not to awake the parents, celebrating our victories in silence as we poured through Mountain Dew and easy cheese. I recall spending hours and hours on the map creator, making my own maps, and going a step further and editing the rules.ini files to make medium tanks shoot mig missles or give spy planes atomic bombs. Many weekends and a couple summers were lost to C&C games like this. Once we discovered online play we'd be up all hours of the night because if we tried playing in the day someone would inevitably call and kick us off the computer causing the games to unsync. Westwood Online sucked, so we'd play on Heat or MPlayer or whatever the next host was. KotG was our turf.

In my 30s now with kids of my own and a few hours into the single player campaigns, this takes me right back. I'm impressed. The nostalgia is there if I want it, or the upgraded graphics and sound remasters are keystrokes away. Having played many RTS games since the mid-90s, the UI upgrade is huge. One of my gripes about the freeware version online is how unplayable the game has become, but not this - this lets you queue unit builds and two-click move your units. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line RTS with all the bells and whistles, this isn't it. It has some issues that plagued the original, but if you want a tuned version of the original that gets the classic elements right while making it playable by today's standards - this is what you want.

I doubt we have the time needed to master my build order, queue my unit firing, climb the old ladder systems, and be ranked, but you'd better believe I'll be telling my buddy to get on Steam to download it so we can play some comp stomps for old time's sake - although maybe with a beer rather than a Dew.",1591669463,1591669615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198150196783,38,7,1157,47,424,1601785781

Negatives:
-Pathfinding issues - The Pathfinding seems to be intact and annoying especially when harvesters,get confused and stop moving. true to the old game mechanics.
-Compressed soundtrack - After digging through the game files, the soundtrack is in MS ADPCM compressed format, why not FLAC or WAV? cutting corners with compression when the game is 25GB to start with, why not go all out and give use the re-mastered sound complete instead of compressing Frank's defining catalog. - this may not matter to most people but the audiophiles would much appreciate it.
-Failing a mission prompts a restart of the mission, should include option to load save-game too
-Stuttering when the game is installed on spinning hard drives, requires the IO of a SSD to run smooth, so install it on an SSD if you have one
-no ability to have separate soundtrack playlists for Red Alert & Tiberian Dawn, they share the same playlist.
-Keybindings seem to lose their settings after you customise them
-Map screen music changed - prefer the old music personally


Positives:
-Excellent graphical upgrade
-Feature complete - All conceivable missions from all pllatforms are included along with any secret missions
-Skirmish mode in Tiberian Dawn
-Remastered soundtrack - going from Mono 22.5KHz to Stereo 44.4Khz sound is link taking a thick black blanket off your speakers, it sounds amazing, having all tracks available in both games is cool but a bit jarring - a surprise, but a welcome one.
-Redesigned sidebar with build queues makes the game so much more playable and fun
-Upscaled video is very good considering the original game files were all they had to work with
-Added ability to zoom in/out the battlefield
-Custom keybindings are much appreciated - if buggy
-Westwood branding intact
-Active updates and support incoming - this isn't a pump & dump effort from EA/Petroglyph
-No microtransaction
-No pay to win
-No cosmetics
-A compete game for a set price
-Not a live service
-No 'roadmap' to dissappointment to speak of 
-The only 'sense of pride and accomplishment"" here is on the developer's part as they should be solely concerned with releasing a game worthy of such

I've been playing C&C & Red Alert since their initial releases after following the hype and development this remaster, this was my 1st preorder in 5+ years after deciding to no longer financially back games that end up being piles of trash, knowing that it's a good game for 25 years seemed to count for something but seeing how Blizzard butchered Warcraft 3 and The Frozen Throne it showed how even the biggest studios can mess up the simplest remasters.

The open coverage on reddit and the C&C community was access to showed that the development was on the right path to be respectful, faithful and targeted towards the original audience, So I decided to pre-order & I'm very happy to say after approx 20 hours of play I do not regret it, it is my hope that they will manage the same level of care and quality in remastering Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 in the future, if they can do that the same or better than this title then I'll pre-order that one too.

I hope Petroglyph are make a good cut from the revenue as it more theirs than EA's property in the eyes of the C&C aficionados, no-one is more qualified or justified to work on the C&C games than the ex Westwood staff who make up Petroglyph.

Maybe after they remaster Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 they could be funded to make Tiberian Dusk & RA3 with EA's blessing, but I'll be happy with with remasters at this stage.

I never thought EA would be involved with production of a remaster that is the standard to measure all remasters against in the RTS genre, without any underhanded tactics, money grabs or strings attached to limit the amount of pleasure the player can have in any way playing the game, besides the fair and reasonable asking price for a COMPLETE game, this rarely happens anymore in the industry, Blizzard are you paying attention? THIS is how you do a remaster.

I have been a C&C fan since Red Alert came out. I fell in love with the original not long after. I have seen the best years, and the worst years. I can honestly say that they captured the essence of the game and did not stray from the original's feel, blemishes and all. For those of you wondering about pathfinding and quality of life issues, they are very real but IMO that adds to the authenticity. If this is an issue for you, they have the full support from the modding community so I would not be surprised if this gets added in through the community.

You don't expect core gameplay changes in a remaster, look at Starcraft remastered. Nothing has changed there except better graphics. Try complaining on Starcraft remastered forums about how the Protoss Dragoon or Terran Goliath AI pathing sucks and needs a change and see how many people are gonna bash you there because it changes the meta.

You find the game too hard? Git gud.

The fact that they replicated everything while adding not over the top features is a faithful remaster. Heck I personally find the unit queuing as too overboard but I suppose that's fine as it is. As long as we can get the important part of command and conquer, that is multiplayer tank battles. right?

Us command and conquer fans never asked for this (frankly because we have CnCnet and OpenRA which are made by the fans btw) because EA botched the franchise before and that stigma has been around since. The fact this happen and it did well, we are happy, we are very thankful.

Heck, I am even open now if they do this exact same thing on Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun using the exact same formula.

Should you buy this if you're looking for a new RTS to play and haven't played the original? Maybe no

While my review may be negative, I can say it's still a 6/10. The flaws of the original however kept me from recommending this game to anyone looking for a solid RTS.

Like:
o Still the same C and C you've loved, no random shit changed
o Updated visuals
o Music 
o Updated UI and health bar

Dislike: 
o Still the same pathing problems:
(1) Units take the long route (bridge, choke points) just because 2 units are in front which occupies 2 square space 
(2) Units are programmed to line-up and slide on the edge of the terrain to go to a specified location if the said location is far away, instead of taking an optimal path
(3) Transports randomly having difficulty to load 
o Still the same energy bar problem: It's hard to distinguish low power once you got the bar to full since it will remain yellow even if you build tons of power plant
o Still the same unit range issues: Units will not take advantage of their attack range and sometimes go melee
o Still no attack move command 
(1) You have to click each enemy structures or units upon arrival before your own units attack them
(2) Enemy structures don't get attacked unless you click on them with the exception of defensive structures

Bug/s found:
o Getting an engineer on enemy MCV will forever trigger an audio loop of ""New construction options"" every time you build a structure even if there really is nothing new to build
o Sometimes building a unit will trigger an audio of ""Construction complete"" instead of ""Unit ready""

Overall, I really like the game. However the things I dislike kept me from recommending it to anyone who's looking for a new RTS game to play to satisfy their itch on the genre, especially if they are used to the newer games which introduced quality of life on an RTS like attack move or patrol. I did see the effort placed in this game so I'll support it. I do hope they will remaster Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 next as those two are what really made me an RTS fan.

45,70515349,english,"This is your Daddy's RTS. Something from the past that should honestly be in a museum. I was 13 in 95. I had a great time playing this with my cousin on a PackerdBell Pentium 1 133 with a whopping 128k of ram and a 17"" CTR monitor. This and Diablo was my jam. Fast forward 25 years later and I'm playing the same game on a 34"" 21:9 monitor with nearly the highest-end consumer PC you can buy. Completely forgetting about how dirty hard games were back then I spent maybe 5 hours on the campaign before saying ""Welp, I hope they make TS\RA2 in a year"". Those were the better games in that era. Combined with competition from AOE2 and Starcraft, I really think they upped their game in those releases. I still plan to finish at least the RA campaign as that it was improved over CnC + multiplayer isn't bad but the AI is not good.

UPSIDE: I really do recommend this game for the following reasons-

1. A walk down memory lane: remastered Music + remastered gfx = 13 again.

2. Games were just harder and content was gated in a much different way back then. 100+ missions but trial and error was a must to get through the story without completely going bald from frustration.

3. Remastered soundtrack is fantastic. Rock on!

4. Future Remaster Releases: I really hope EA will green light TS\RA2 and maybe even Generals. But I worry about Generals as it was fully 3D and I hate what Activ/Blizz did to WC3: Reforged.

5. EA made the game open source. This will improve the overall community. Mods can solve a lot of the issues people complain about. The preservation of the original and the release of the source code give me hope that mods will spring up and modernize the game.

DOWNSIDE: This is a remaster not a remake-
1. AI is crap. They are strong at first but pressure them or learn to cheese them and they are ezpz.

2. Pathfinding is crap. On complicated maps with lots of hills or trees; Units, and particularly harvesters, take forever to get from point A to point B. No easy way to micro fast. Unit hit boxes are giant and general reaction to fast clicks is slow or doesn't work very well.

3. Campaign needs trial and error to complete. You need to mess with the game speed and there doesn't seem to be a hot key for that. So, that is a pain.

4. I don't mind the black bars on the sides at 3340x1440 and I understand why they don't support it for multiplayer. But I hoped singleplayer wouldn't have them. Also, I have to use the full length of my monitor to move the camera around the game area. So just be aware that using a keybind to move around the map with a 21:9 monitor will probably be much easier\faster.

5. Multiplayer is not great yet. Probably the one thing they could've focused on more but didn't because 90% of players just play campaign\skirm in RTSs. They are working on this and I hope they can fix the weird glitches soon.

BTW, Don't listen to some of these negative reviews. Some have legit concerns but others that mention SC are in the wrong year. SC was 2 years after this game. Also, its a friggen remaster. Not a remake. They wanted it as close to original as possible on purpose. People that want auto-attack to reduce micro overhead are just wrong-headed. Mods can solve a lot of the issues people complain about. The devs wanted to create something as close as possible to the original and give the community the ability to build on that.

47,70515308,english,"So let me start by saying i love this remaster. It's a nostalgia trip that i've been missing for many years. Many parts of this game are done well and bring the remaster back from the 90s. C&CR is great for reliving old memories but my main issue and why i can't recommend it yet is the absolute archaic controls, specifically the lack of any attack-move.
I can't believe this wasn't brought forward into the game. I get it wasn't there in the past but this game was a huge step for the RTS genre back in the 90s. That is no excuse for simply bringing that same system back with very little adjustment. Your units are not smart, in any way. You must actively control them to ensure they attack when needed. You must attack a single target with your units and wait for that target to die before your units will act on their own and attack something else. Or simply click on targets individually for your individual units to attack. It's tedious. I'm aware there is a ctrl+alt+click possibility here for your units to defend a certain area but all it does is shine a bigger light on how stupid your units are. They won't attack at their max distance they will react to the enemy when it is too close, sometimes they will move out of position and get picked off. It blows my mind there was no attempt to better the unit AI to some degree. I even attempted the secret Ant level and those ants were running circles around my units while they were trying to catch up. Simply clicking on a unit to attack isn't enough, units will walk around trying to get into view of the target and therefore won't attack at times. If a unit is moving too fast and you missed clicking attack on it well don't expect your units to know what to do, they'll just move past the enemy unit like it's a tree. A simple 'attack' in this direction would solve everything because your assumption would be that if anything enters their attack range they would attack but unless you're actively clicking on a target the response time for your units is awful. In short you really can't leave any units unattended. It feels incredibly dated, this is simply a quality of life need that is in pretty much every RTS game. The fact it wasn't implemented in this game is mind blowing and makes the experience very maddening. I won't say it's unplayable because my love of this game and nostalgia are helping me look past it but i doubt my patience will last for very long.

50,70497540,english,"I rarely review games. I never feel I can convey properly what a game means to me, or even how a game feels to play. I am making an exception for this remaster.

Command & Conquer Tiberian Dawn, and Command & Conquer Red Alert were two of my very first PC gaming memories. I remember going to the old run down computer store in a nearby small town, and seeing the box and asking my dad for it. At the time we were very, very poor but he did end up getting it. I still have that box, sitting in storage somewhere.

I ran up to the attic when I got home and popped the disc into the 486. My dad had just got it a few months earlier while working on a lawyer's house (he just got a new Pentium II). Child me could only gaze upon that plastic yellowed CRT monitor in awe as the installer came up.

Someday I found out about mods, I am not sure when. Every Tuesday my mom would go to town to volunteer as a Cub Scout leader, run errands for my Grandmother, and take my sister to Air Cadets. During that time she dropped me off at the library. I would take my stack of 3.5 floppies and would download every single mod I could get my hands on, and play Runescape!

I had a lot of fear when they announced this remaster, I have seen what other companies have done to games I have loved, and hold so close to me. These were my childhood games, my escape from the inescapable reality of life at the time. Yet here we are, the game has launched, 

I have followed all of the progress. They have cared, and shared their love of these game while making it. The games themselves are old and flawed, this remaster is not. The flaws are the same flaws that I fought with when I was younger. You will fight crappy AI, terrible pathfinding, and sometimes what feels like impossibly hard missions. But I would have it no other way.

This is C&C, this is the game I remember and more. This is perfect.

Once I get enough of the nostalgia RA remaster brings, I'll also get to explore the original C&C as a new game, but in HD graphics. All of that, plus Frank Klepacki's remastered tracks, for a grand total of $19.99? Best deal I've ever seen. Thank you, EA, for letting your developers work their magic and nail this remaster!

As for possible future remasters, I like RA2 graphics as is, although it does have a bunch of compatibility issues with modern hardware, so a remaster would certainly be warmly welcomed.

The remastered cutscenes are impressive, though not flawless. The jukebox alone is worth the price of the game. However, there are some flaws. There are currently connection issues with the online portion of the game, though hopefully these can be patched out. Also, the AI are classic in some less than desirable ways. Units will often ignore each other unless you order them to attack, and attack move (yes it exists, hit control + alt) isn't very effective as there is a few second delay between giving the order and the units actually attacking. However, despite these flaws, I still highly recommend a buy. For new players, I recommend it as a look into the past at a classic rts, if nothing else; and to fans of classic CnC, just sit back and let the nostalgia flow through you.

There aren't many quality of life improvements in this game. The problems that existed with the levels in the old games persist in this one. This is truly a barebones upgrade to get the game running in 4K. The rest of the game has been left as rough and clunky as it originally was. Tiberian Dawn was good in it's day, but does NOT hold up well now. Red Alert holds up much better , however its still has its foibles. But,If you're a fan of the franchise, buy this.
A few issues ( of many ) that appear in these games....
1) The AI cheats ( obviously), as the game, at normal speeds runs very slowly, and that's too slow. So you speed it up and of course now the AI seem to to able to take down every one of your units whilst your units are still milling around for a firing solution. (2) Enemy AI seems to be able to build a miraculous queue of units compared to you and they can react to anything on the map, where as you can only really react to one battle at a time. (3) Regards GDI mission 6 ""Havoc"" where you run the commando around. When he blows up a missile emplacement he seems to forget how to use his gun so the soldiers that survive the explosion get a few free shots before you can make him react. ( 4)  How come the enemy can build power stations away from their base or any other structures?

Anyway, this is a good compilation and are the only two CnC games from my library of every CnC game that just would not run under windows 7. 
Now they do, the collection is finally complete and working.

Lets just not talk about the Generals game. Great way to eff up a franchise EA !!! Life and soul of CnC extinguished in one single game release !!

In my humble opinion  Red Alert 2 is the best game in the series, followed by Tiberian Sun ,Red Alert 3 then Red Alert.
The spin off "" Renegade"" is good fun as well. The rest of the franchise isn't up to much,but if not for the original CnC we wouldn't have all the aforementioned excellent CnC games that followed, so for that alone this compilation deserves your attention.

The primary critism I have seen of this game seems to be centered around not doing enough to bring the game up to modern standards with regards to gameplay. This is not totally unreasonable criticism, but misses the mark, because the goal is to make the authentic, 1995 experience available on modern systems. To compensate for this, they have also very generously made the entire thing open source (it's literally in the install folder, as well as on github). This will make it possible to create mods and overhauls, that can do anything from making a pathfinding that wont get lost on its way to the toilet, to new maps and gamemodes. It's the approach that worked well for WoW Classic and it also works well here, in my opinion.

The only negatives for me at this point is some minor gripes about how the game works that goes back to the original (I'm talking about you, pathfinding!), a few minor visual glitches and an annoying problem that prevents me from saving the game at the end of longer missions, so I would not blame you for waiting a couple of weeks for the first couple of patches.

7,70415459,english,"Really good, but still crusty. At its core it brings the original CnC and Red Alert with their expansions to the current scene. It's more a straight port with goodies than it is an actual remaster. Many of the cutscenes seem to be upscaled with heavy filtering but the original footage can all be viewed through the gallery. It's kind of fun tapping spacebar to see the difference from the modernized and original game.

Gameplay has not exactly held up well, but I had fun on the Fast setting. It's fast enough that unit production doesn't slog and slow enough for me to manage units before I feel like I'm playing Starcraft again.

Difficulty spikes are brutal. There's a particular mission where you need to bum rush your mcv through D-Day, then quickly build your base as you take oncoming waves with only a small group of grenadiers. 

AI pathing is really poor, and there doesn't seem to be shortcut keys for particular unit functions like loading and unloading from APC's. Repairing vehicles at the depot must be done individually as there is no queuing in the AI logic. Basically many, many, quality of life things that I've taken for granted on ""modern"" RTS's aren't present. They have however implemented keyboard shortcuts should you ever capture an enemy MCV.

The most impressive part is the way saves are handled. You should not have to save, ever. All missions are handled through a manager, and the game will continue from that mission you have chosen. This works well as there are branching missions.

I have not played the multiplayer portion nor have modded, I don't plan on doing so. However the built in support for both is amazing in its own right.

All in all, for 20 bucks it's well worthwhile, but if you're just nostalgic or just curious of the games of past maybe wait for a sale. This bit is important, I've only grew up with RA2 and Tiberian Sun. It's a fun experience, but still very crusty.

Even if you didn't like these particular games and want RA2, TS, Generals, etc remastered, support this as much as you can so the other C&C games become possibilities in the future.

Pros:
- Gameplay graphics are great. Pressing space to switch between new and old brings a smile each time
- Tastefully done, not seen a building or unit yet that seems odd or stands out from the style of the others
- Not messed with the gameplay, the same as you remember from long ago. Also ends up being a con (See below)
- Amount of content for the price, they could have easily slapped a few new missions in there, label it a new expansion and bumped the price £10 extra but they chose not to
- Remastered soundtrack is great, some songs are versions the Tiberian Sons played at MAGfest
- Performance is great, I have a decent build anyway but everything has been flawless in this regard
- Source code, mod support, working with the community. Other developers take note, this is how you plan and design a game.

Cons/Bugs:
- We have been spoiled by some nice AI since this game first came out, the frustrations of the poor pathfinding, units ignoring orders, getting too close to attack when they could attack from range and avoid damage, friendly unit in the adjacent tile getting attacked but not firing, etc all come flooding back. I understand this wasn't a remake but I feel SOME AI fixes would have been sweet
- Again, I am spoiled by modern elements but despite adding other modern things like unit queues things like waypoints or attack move were not added.
- Selection cursor flips out like crazy when you hover over a unit or building
- Havoc plays the kill audio randomly even though he hasn't killed anything
- Would have been a nice touch for the unit and building pictures on the sidebar to change between new and old with space bar as well
- I know they worked hard on the video and had poor original quality to work with but the videos are just so dated and look really, really rough. Not much can be done about this though, filming them again with different actors would ruin it.",1591448172,1591649973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198156533378,147,15,879,0,106,1593108226

This is what a remaster should be like. No silly lootboxes, no major changes to the gameplay yet leaving the game open for modders to spice it up, and biggest caveat being something like pushing the game installation to over hundred times what it was because of 4k textures, but that's a small(big?) price on top of the agreeable purchase price to pay to be able to play two really good classic RTS games like these on modern computers.

So the fact that they gave these games a remaster after so long, with so many of the original creators involved, and so many tiny details added, the games being open source, steam workshop support and at such a low price point for two classics, this should obviously be a love letter to the fans, right?
The problem is that while I don't doubt the good intentions behind the remake, these games really didn't age well, and it shows in the remaster too.

So first, the good.

- As I said, they included a lot of cute homages to both the bygone era of dos gaming, and Westwood, the original creators of C&C and Red Alert. (A studio that EA themselves smothered, ironically enough)
- They upscaled the original FMV cutscenes, and they are beautifully cheesy. 
- The UI has been remade for arbuably the better in a few ways.
- Multiplayer has been adjusted to modern standards, including a matchmaking system.
- Steam workshop support, and being open source should hopefully mean a lot of longevity for the game, given proper support from the community.
- The remastered graphics are actually pretty nice for the most part, and in case you don't enjoy them, they are completely optional. 
- Overall you can basically take what they said on the store page for granted, it does have all the new  features they promised.
- With the press of a button, you can swap between old and new graphics seemlessly, however...

Now the bad.

- Once you do, you'll realize that for some reason, a lot of particle effects such as smoke and explosions are missing from the remastered graphics settings?
- And the fancy new polish won't address the ridiculously stupid AI, which plays exactly like in the original games 25 years ago. This leads me to assume they did nothing to address AI players hurling all their resources your way, only to sit on their butt and do nothing for the remainder of the game. 
- A few units were renamed - for what I can only assume to be licensing reasons - such as the Longbow and the HUM-VEE for Christ's sake.
- Pathfinding and unit AI is also incredibly broken, sometimes units won't fire if they stand milimetres away from enemy units, and (I'm not sure if this was the same way in the originals, but) they will just flat-out not attack enemy structures on their own. 
- Controls were mostly neglected too, it's incredibly finnicky to get your units to do what you want them to do, attack-move doesn't exist, neither does patrolling nor flagging rally points for buildings, basically a lot of QOL stuff that modern RTS games all have.
- For some reason these 20+ year old games are lagging on a modern PC? Especially at the beginning of games, it gets incredibly choppy, often dipping below 40 fps and stuttering.

So all in all, I would say give this game some time. Some mods might come along later down the line and address a lot of issues people are having, but until then, I would say OpenRA is still superior if you want a good gameplay experience regardless of graphics. The games certainly still have the nostalgic factor to them, but that alone sadly doesn't carry this current release.",1591641517,1591641776,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198080478722,260,23,219,0,219,1591640016

7,70500877,english,"This was one of the first games I ever played on PC and to relive that nostalgia has been nothing short of spectacular. Here is my review of C&C Remastered.

When I first became aware of C&C Remastered back in March I became excited but concerned given EA's history of micro-transactions and poor launch record (I had some nightmares that EA might incorporate the Spec Ops and N64 missions behind paid DLC). Regardless, I had faith in Jim Vessella, Petroglyph and Lemon Sky Studios to pull off everything that had been proposed from their preview videos. The package the team advertised was promising and I really felt a sense of respect and love to the C&C community with many requests being listened to on the forums. I pre-ordered the standard edition and like many other players waited anxiously until 5th June.

When the date arrived at 18:00 hours GMT, the release was smooth and I loaded the game up within 20 minutes after Steam unpacked the files. WOW! From the initial cut scenes to the sound effects, I fell in love with how everything had been re-imagined in a way only C&C players of old could appreciate. Nothing appears ruined or out of place and the originality is there; the special effects and don't even get me started on the music!

I began the GDI campaign and was simply blown away by the updated video scenes, remastered music and improved graphics which seamlessly switched from the old 95' graphics to the modern equivalent with a tap of the space bar. Genius. No delay, no lag and flawless performance. The game comes with an in-built Jukebox which allows you to customise what tracks you want to listen to (and this includes mixing and matching from C&C and RA1). The unit animations and improved sounds are fantastic and I really felt as though I was re-living my C&C experience. I have to date suffered no crashes, errors or game breaking bugs and (dare I say it) I have regained some faith in EA for helping resurrect ""THE"" classic RTS and bringing it to the modern day PC.

Since release I have completed both the GDI and NOD campaigns and I have made a start on the Covert Ops missions all of which I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend for any C&C returnee or new player into the genre. In order to provide a full review I have played Red Alert 1 in the same context and although I have not completed the campaigns (yet) however the level of detail, gameplay and quality matches that of C&C Tiberian Dawn. In the interest of fairness, over the two games I have identified some issues albeit small; 

- The unit pathing is still as questionable as it was 25 years ago and units can ""sometimes"" have a mind of their own. 
- When using Helicopters I found myself clicking 2/3 times in order to eject units which became frustrating and forced me to re-load.
- Although it didn't phase me too much, there is no way-pointing for units which may put some modern RTS players off.
- The online games have been a little slow with the servers at times but I believe the right support will come to stabilise this.

Other than the above, I cannot deny that C&C remastered has gone above and beyond my expectations. These last few days have been a breath of fresh air in the RTS genre and I hope with this games success, the team may consider a Tiberian Sun/RA2 remaster in the future. I believe that any C&C veterans will appreciate the level of work and detail that has gone into this remaster especially given the price which is very reasonable. This game is a true masterpiece.

14,70406440,english,"Plus sides for this game.  It definitely has the old feel of the original versions, but with better graphics.  The controls are easy and make the game a lot more fun.

Negatives -  The primary negatives have to do with glitches within the game itself, and I do not remember most of these with the original game.  1.  The game appears to be halty or pausing for a split second for certain units, such as YAK aircraft.  2.  Units will NOT do what you tell them to do, such as not shooting and killing the enemy, or pausing midway through executing a command.  Examples, crawling around on the ground instead of open firing and killing the 1 guy which is slaughtering your team instead of open firing and killing him, or pausing right in the middle of a kill zone and allowing a pill box to mow down your troops.  3.  Units will stop moving towards a target or location that you told them to go to even if there is nothing blocking any and all routes to the target location.  4.  Blowing up bridges does not guarantee that enemies cannot drive right over/right next to the destroyed section.  This was not an issue with the original versions of these games.  5.  Campaign Missions do not end even if all enemy units and structures are destroyed.  6.  In the original versions of these games, the instant that an enemy damaged anything of yours, you would get a heads up via radar and vocal alert.  At the moment, it only will let you know after it is almost too late to do anything about it.  Imagine coordinating an attack on one end of the map, having an impressive defensive line on the other side of the map, not being told about it until after the enemy has already breached your defenses and has started to shred your base.  

I know that these glitches will eventually be patched, as some things like this are to be expected with game launches.  Overall, I do recommend these games if you want to encourage EA to remake these classic games before Microsoft makes Windows 10 incompatible with the original game versions.  If you really like this game and want to see all of the fun things that Westwood did not put in the original games, then this pack is definitely worth the 20 American dollars that they are asking for it.  

If you are not interested in paying that much for this game pack, you can get the same games for free LEGALLY from www.cncnet.org   .  The versions of the games that they have there are 100% free, play glitch free, and have a lot more multiplayer customization options than game pack.  However, the graphics are NOT 4k and you cannot zoom in and out with them.

[B]Graphics[/B]: 7/10
[i]The graphics are absolutely amazing when compared to the original, while still maintaining the artistic-style of it. You do have the ability to switch between the original and remastered graphics dynamically, which is a nice addition. One complaint of which I have with the graphics are the cutscenes. I understand that they are low resolution and needed to be upscaled for current resolutions, but the amount of artifacting and anomalies this has introduced and the fact pixels are still somewhat visible is quite poor. I have seen better work utilising an upscaler elsewhere. Otherwise however, I find the graphics great![/i]

[B]Gameplay[/B]: 8/10
[I]Gameplay-wise, Command And Conquer Remastered plays and feels identical to the original, but I guess that is the point of a remaster. It seems as if difficulty settings have been added into this remaster though, as I do not recall them prior. There is the typical three difficulty settings of easy, medium and hard. I have been playing on hard and noticed that enemy units do more damage towards your own units. Minor change, but does add more of a challenge. AI Skirmish has been added to the first C&C game, and plays similarly to the Red Alert's variant. An option of which I have been wanting for ages. The AI in this game can have issues at times, with your only money gathering source (Harvester) deciding that going through the enemy base is a great idea... Other issues with the AI is that sometimes they go the longest possible route to a location, of which is very annoying. Disappointed this issue was never resolved, as it was always an issue in the original.[/I]

[B]Sound[/B]: 10/10
[I]Not much to say, the soundtracks within this game are iconic, punchy and bring back so many memories for myself. Always thought the song ""Mechanical Man"" was saying ""Mechanical Maddie"" when I was younger, heh. To get a taste of this game's music, search ""Hell March"" or ""Act On Instinct"" on YouTube. You can also customise your tracks, to determine of which ones play and of which do not.[/i]

49,70486737,english,"With C&C being the first modern take on the RTS genre, the games still feel surprisingly fresh and relevant today, and at the same time, a time capsule of simpler days where there's no fog of war or rally points.

This collection doesn't try to reinvent the originals. Everything that you loved and hated are still here in the remaster, from APC engineer rushes to blocking off the enemy base via sandbags and stealth tanks, and the truly archaic pathfinding, although the modernized sidebar is a very welcome addition. Balance problems in Dawn are mostly left as is, although with the game speed running by default faster than it did in the DOS originals, the problem with slow units (such as on the Nod artillery and infantry) aren't as pronounced. 

The addition of a Casual difficulty to Dawn is nice if you just want to blitz through the campaigns without the tedium, but even so, there are some difficult missions that require a fair amount of micromanagement and unorthodox strategies to complete (I'm looking at you, GDI mission 8B, the infamous Dr Mobius level). It's also pretty nice to have a level selector to play alternate missions and maps, but to be honest, most of these are just alternate maps of the same mission, and so far in the GDI campaign, only missions 4 and 8 have completely branching objectives.

There's a few minor, non-gameplay related bugs and bit of stuttering that smoothes itself out over the first couple of minutes, but nothing that really detracted from my enjoyment of the game. The development team really did an amazing job trying to upscale the videos from a tiny resolution without the source files, and the FMV scenes with a human actor generally look great while retaining its original 90s video game FMV charm, down to matte lines and interlaced backgrounds. The same can't be said about the pure CGI cutscenes however. Most of them manage to look pretty decent, but scenes with a lot of motion suffer from a lot of pixellation and artifacting despite the best efforts. It can't be helped as the original videos are so low resolution, and this isn't an accusation at Petroglyph, but rather something for you to manage your expectations.

With Command and Conquer being a very big part of my childhood, this remaster does a lot of things right, and I'm personally very happy with it.

So this is a good remaster, they kept in all the bullshit from the dumbfuck routing AI, occasional random refusals to follow orders to cheating AI.

Nice. In one covert ops mission AI will ion cannon shit without an advanced comm center. Nice. 

I would absolutely recommend this game, I feel like this game did a better job than my parents at teaching me that life is not fair, it's actually pretty full of bullshit you can do nothing about and the sense of pride and accomplishment must be earned and not bought with money.

Though imbued with a ton of Quality of Life improvements to ease in new players, the core mechanics have been left untouched by the developers, bugs and all, and this may pose a problem for new players trying to play them like modern video games. These are not modern, these are pretty much the founding fathers of the RTS genre, and they're 25/24 years old. 

To enjoy these games to the fullest, it's naturally obvious that a bit of leniency is required and also the ability to adapt and learn some quirks of old mechanics, like for example the pathfinding which is not as advanced as in later games. 

The old AI pathfinding can be manageable with a few simple tricks: 

1. Don't click multiple times once you've selected your units. 
2. Don't throw your units across the map and expect them to go there. 
3. Micro manage your units. 

Is it worth it? Absolutely. The games can be extremely fun once you adapt to the old AI pathfinding - especially the second one in the Collection, Red Alert, which was a significant improvement over the first one. The FMVs are usually well acted and charming as hell, though cheesy. The soundtrack is brilliant.

i believe this was primarily made for people who played, or wanted to play the originals. or at least who are old enough to have been around when they came out. so if these are deal breakers for you, you may wanna go play some fortnite or something.

21,70487158,english,"Ever since I played this on the PS1 (Playstation) and following C&C, Red Alert, Retaliation & Dune 2000, it brought joy when they announced a remaster.
Today, that all flops towards disappointment, after 25 years of C&C, sure, the remaster is nice, and the music is so good (Thanks to the Ex Westwood devs (Polyglyph) and Tiberiun Sons), it almost makes me want to just listen to the sound track what ever game I play.
Now for the sad part, I'm going to point out many things both old and new, which ties from the whole 25 years of its existence

The Bad:
 * Game has a tendency to lag in Multiplayer, (both on and offline) eventually, disables the particle effects, if things vanish with no cool death animation or explosions, this is probably why.
 * AI Pathing is far more worse then the original counterpart, AI units get stuck, can't cross bridges properly, even just having 1 unit block 1 path, the harvester be like ""I'm stuck, can't move"" even though, the square next to it is completely empty.
 * AI is also dumb, even on the hardest difficulty, they posses no threat (due to the above mention) they also attack with little to no forces and also react poorly, the classic version the AI reacted better, and came at you with an entire army.
 * Resource growth is much slower whether this was intentional or not, but it does lay out an economy strategy
 * (Tiberian Dawn) Whats the point of allowing to place 6 player spawns, even allow 6 players to be selected during skirmish, JUST to have it freeze on the loading screen (more than 4 players), this kinda sucks, as four players is a bit too little, but I understand why, due to the size of the map..... please make the map size to 128x128, and allow 8 players, I know you can fix this, you have the code/technology.
 * (Red Alert) why on earth did allies get 3 new factions?, in the original their was 5, 3 allies, 2 soviets, now its 6 allies and 2 soviets, at least it should have been 5:3 and not 6:2, heck, balance it and do a 4:4 for an overall Allies Vs Soviets.

The Good:
 * Campaign playability, its been so long, now I can get to do the campaign all over again, and get cool behind the scene rewards (this is no sarcasm)
 * The music... need I say more?
 * HD Graphics and quality... A+
 * PATSUX and Ant missions :)
 * Sound effects
 * It works on Windows 10 with no community patches/aids

Overall, the game is... eh, okay, for new players, I would say, sure.. I guess play it, for old and Veterans alike, eh, if its something to do or to get those achievements, why not?, but in my opinion, and ULTIMATELY, in my opinion, if its a Single player experience you want, get this, but if its a multiplayer you want... just download OpenRA, its free, its compatible, the AI is smart... I mean VERY smart, they build ships, they A-bomb you, and come at you with almost anything and everything.

This is more like an album with a browser game attached to it. It's clear to me that the focus was not on the game but on the idea of the game, for example: we got unit queuing! and that's it (no waypoints, no attack move, no extra factions, no extra units, no explosions, no effects, no extra details), and I this this is due to the stupid decision to have the switch option between the pixel version and the 4k visuals. I don't mean changing the gameplay to C&C3 or StarCraft2 levels, but simple tings like bullet tracers, tank wreckage... the biggest problem with the game is that it's based on the old code witch limits its potential.
So I recommend this as an Music album (every single review says the music is great)

I like they included green screen recordings as bonuses

Remastered game and music is great. It is the exact same game. Models have very subtle changes, but if nobody told you what they were, even the units, you would know they are from C&C. They didn't add too much of new elements to the game, which is good as well in my opinion, but they could have worked a little better in the save system.

The only bad thing is the cutscene remaster. They could have worked into recreating them instead of just smoothing them. I mean, if they still have the green screen recordings, they still have the original chosen shots as well.

they may not have the 3D cutscenes anymore, or a way to re-render them, but they could have at least recreated the ""AI processing / female computer voice sections""

65,70482306,english,"Ah the good old days, when games were simple but very addictive.  I still have the original Command and Conquer CDs.  

The remastered collection is great but there are several things that I don't think are correct about it. 

Firstly selecting units is oddly difficult.  I draw a box over them and quite often it misses one or two of them.  I don't remember this in the original game.  The original seemed to work better.  

The second is way-finding, collision avoidance and queuing.  I asked three tanks to cross a bridge and it took them forever.  This is more like Company of Heroes (which I hate for this) than the original C&C.  I also had 2 Tiberium miners playing chicken on a bridge, one empty and trying to get to the Tiberium and one full and trying to get back.  I don't remember ever having to micro-manage units a la COH in the original game. Another aspect of this is grouping infantry.  You cannot send infantry to a square that already has some infantry on it, so you can't easily reinforce a squad.  This is modern age nonsense and should be fixed.  The whole point of C&C was that it flowed effortlessly without constraining itself.  I often saw tanks driving through other tanks and that was part of its charm.  If its supposed to be a faithful reproduction do not impose collision detection on something that was perfect without it. 

The graphics are clearly better than the original (you can toggle between them using the space key) but I think  that they left a lot on the table here.  I originally played on a 16 inch CRT (big for its day but still small!).  The graphics were perfect for that size of screen. Now I have a 40 QHD TV as a monitor but I still get the same view.  I think we could have seen more of the battlefield than the original had, surely?  The graphics are squarely 2d and absolutely fine but compared to COH the graphics are still very crude. A little more work on the models would have made a big difference.  The cut-scenes are much higher resolution than they were which is fine but I missed the grainy artefact the originals had.  They missed out every second horizontal line, I guess to save space and increase frame rate but it looked cool and so much more atmospheric than the heavily filtered re-rendering.

I seem to have said only bad things and that is unfair since the game is mostly a spectacular reproduction of the original game before it went off the rails by getting over-complicated. I did generate lots of maps for the original game, it would be great if they still worked.  We also went into the configuration file and generated several customisations but I guess that won't be possible anymore. There are a lot of lessons for the game industry here when a 22 year old game can still be more playable than the likes of COH and ARMA2.",1591611489,1591611489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970408752,148,58,9743,0,622,1600532547

67,70482146,english,"Amazing nostalgia trip to the game that got me into PC gaming when I was 5 years old. 

The new models look amazing, high resolution without losing the feel of the old game. One press of the space bar seemlessly switches to the 90s graphics which is a nice touch. The zoom and modernised UI are some nice quality of life changes.

They also added difficulty options, being the madman that I am I chose to play on the hardest difficulty as I do with most games I am familiar with.

From a design point of view however I have to say this is utterly broken as of now. Buffing enemy units while debuffing your own completely gets rid of the unit X beats unit Y beats unit Z formula. NOD light tanks shouldn't beat GDI medium's, and as soon as NOD gets access to flame units there's nothing I could do to counter that while being utterly swarmed sitting on low resources. This defeats the purpose of strategizing and just makes you want to cheese the AI.

Make the campaign harder by throwing more and better units at you, but please don't give the AI these damage and HP buffs so they can't be beaten and break missions where you cant build.

-Pros-
1) It's the same C&C game you remember - literally exactly the same with slightly updated graphics
2) The gameplay hasn't changed at all so if you enjoyed the originals you will enjoy this

-Cons-
1) I was expecting more, the game is great but the graphics are only slightly updated
2) I thought they would have at least updated the movement of units - They still move in that 6 direction way as before rather than more fluidly as we'd expect. They could have gone down a C&C Generals route in terms of how units behave.
3) The MP options are limited, you cannot password games meaning you find yourself getting kicked from lobby's alot
4) The maps are really small; there are some larger maps but i'd expect larger maps for longer games.
5) There's no option to control the regrowth speed of Ore/Tiberium - This leads to really short MP games I've found. In an 8v8 it was only a matter of time until the game had to end so if you didn't win initial encounters you are pretty much doomed to lose regardless by the lack of resources.
6) It would have been nice to have more units added even as an added option to expand the game slightly.

I may seem negative about the game but I do enjoy it because I loved the originals - I just don't see it having much longevity.

98,70476730,english,"Possibly one of the best remasters I have ever played. Almost perfect.

I will leave some cons here as I feel that is more helpful than gushing over everything that it does right:

- No real gameplay changes. What you had back in 95 is what you get here, save for some (much-needed) QoL features like unit queueing. No improved AI, no advanced modern RTS commands, no improved pathfinding. No, there is still no attack-move. I really do not mind this as it's not a remake but it might be a con to some.
- Hard difficulty in Tiberian Dawn (added by this release) is nigh impossible. Your units are outright 20% worse in every aspect; damage, ROF, you name it. No other real changes like better AI or new encounters or anything. You will not win equal engagements without some gnarly amounts of micro. An enemy light tank can beat your medium tank in a 1v1, for god's sake. Not sure they tested this. RA1 is probably fine because Hard existed in the original but I haven't attempted it.
- They tried, but the neural-upscaled FMVs just don't look very good. Not only do they look like moving JPEGs, they sometimes also look like a moving JPEG someone painted by hand. On canvas. I don't think this can really be helped as the original footage had the resolution of a postage stamp, but they don't include an option to revert to that either (maybe thankfully? Release big enough as it is).
- Adding onto the earlier point, the entire thing is around 26GB. Quite the jump from what it originally was.
- Jukebox feature isn't split by game, so you can't make two playlists, one for each game, they're shared.
- How the multiplayer is set up seems kind of a mess, as there aren't any private lobbies and you can't rename lobbies, so what happens is you join a bunch of them just to get kicked. No LAN but they said it's coming later.
- Hum-vee got renamed to ""Light Scout"" and Longbow got renamed to ""Attack Helicopter"". Game is basically unplayable now omfg, but there are mods that fix it.

Do not let the above points discourage you however; it's possibly the best injection of life the C&C franchise needed and it's incredible that it came from EA, of all places. Hopefully this is just a taste of things to come.

-pathfinding is really outdated, expecially on tiberian down.
-sometimes difficulty is not really well balanced, you have more chance off winning on certains missions by restarting than loading a previous save because a little bit off time lost can snowball and you will be stuck to infinitly repair what the ia is destroying of your base.
-I have encunter some lags at the start of some skirmish, just pause the game and wait a bit.
-The IA of tiberian dawn in skirmish is far too passive, the skirmish mode is a good addition to TD but they should have change the IA for this mode, hopefully it's ok in red alert.

I read that some people had crash, I didn't like a majority of people, but be aware off this..

But for the rest off the game I think it's really good,I like the new graphics and the new sound design. Some people don't like the remastered cinematic but I liked them, it's just a matter of taste.
The price is really low for what you get, like two games that each other already had two campaign and the addition off the add-on, for 20 euros. 
You also get the full soundtracks of the two games, the original and a remaster.

19,70468602,english,"Runs great for the first few minutes of game play, but after a little bit it starts to chug like a middle age man during a nasty divorce. I don't have the best PC on the market, but this game was never really demanding in the first place. No matter what graphic setting I use, the game (that you just lost) just declines in performance.

While playing the game, the longer the game goes on, the more of a desync between the HD and the original game play happens. I tested it for about 30 minutes in one solo game vs AI and the original game was about 45 seconds ahead of the HD remaster. Its almost like the game is really playing 2 Games and letting play them both at the same time. When the Desync is happening, you will experience failure to command units, place buildings or really control anything on the map, you are there for the ride whether like it or not. 

The game looks absolutely amazing, however, the soundtrack remaster is killer, and the cutscene, but that doesn't make up for the fact that this game runs like sun fried dog turds.

21,70468462,english,"I'm only about half way through the GDI campaign but this is the 11th or 12th time I'll have played through original Command and Conquer in my life and from what I've seen I feel confident enough to give an opinion on it.

Overall I think this is an excellent remaster and I'm delighted with it. It's just ridiculously good fan service. From the intro that apes the original installation programme to the custom jukebox options and fmv gallery, it's great to see the care and effort that went into this package.

But what are you actually getting for your money? Questioning whether it's worth paying nearly 20 quid for a couple of games that are over 25 years old is not an unreasonable stance. The answer to this depends very much on how much you care about the series and what you expect out of a remaster. If you are a long term fan and had the games back when they came out, I think this is a safe purchase, especially if it's a while since you played these particular games.

If you want to see the games in this package modernised and reimagined through the lens of 2020 RTS game design then you may want to skip it or at least try before you buy. The reason for this is this is a very faithful remaster - a remaster in the strictest sense. It's literally the same game(s) from the mid-90's with all the good and bad that comes with that.
 
The updated graphics are gorgeous and I love the style of them. You can switch back and forth between modern and old visuals simply by hitting the space bar and it's seamless. How much you'll actually use this feature past about an hour or so of play is debatable but it's a lovely touch.
The music is spectacular. What you have in this is basically everything that ever featured in both games (including tracks from expansions) and several versions of each. The vast majority of tracks are featured in their original form as well as remaster versions, OST remastered versions and quite often a version by Frank Klepacki and his band ""Tiberian Sons"" - and they are well worth checking out as they are really punchy versions of the classic tracks. On top of this you can put together your own playlist and pull tracks from both games together - so feel free to have Hell March in original C&C and Act on Instinct in Red Alert.
In terms of content you are getting both of the first games in the 2 timelines featured in the series in full. Both are RTS classics and should give you a good few days play smashing through the 2 campaigns in each game. On top of this you get as far as I can tell basically every expansion ever put out for both games, including stuff that was only originally released for Playstation 1. Some of these were designed to be pretty challenging as well and so should keep you busy. Add on to that you've got skirmish maps against the AI as well as multiplayer and I think it's fair to say that there's a fair amount of content to keep you going here. And this can only increase as with the map editors and source code being released and workshop integration, I'd expect to see a ton of stuff on the workshop as time goes by. An interesting feature is you can observe games and replays other people are playing. It's surprisingly engrossing to watch other people play this despite how old it is.
Finally, you can unlock FMV videos in all their cheesy majesty and watch them back in the gallery whenever you like. Granted,  Youtube is a thing that exists and you could of course watch them there, but I really like it as a feature. It's cool that it's in there.

So what about negative stuff? Well there is no getting around the fact that these are from the mid 90's and are exactly as they were then. You may feel they are pretty basic games by modern standards in terms of features. The faithfulness of the remaster also means that some truly horrendous pathfinding has been retained - you *will* shout ""what the fuck are you doing!?!"" at your harvesters from time to time and despair as the tank you told to use a convenient lull in combat to get it's arse to the repair bay decided instead to stop when you weren't looking to observe a nearby tree or rock and is now getting shot by the mob of infantry that were miles away.
Some of the missions will occasionally give you a choice of location and while they do not give any indication of it, some are just plain difficult in comparison to others. It was a pain in the arse then and it can be now to be playing the hard version of a mission with no way of knowing before hand.

I'm not sure if I would recommend it to a total newcomer to the series. on the one hand this is kind of the Doom of RTS games and you should really play it, just to see where the crazy C&C universe all started. This is also probably about the best way to experience these games so in that regard it's a great jumping on point.

On the other hand if you don't have any prior experience with the series, as good as this package is, you may want to start elsewhere as you can probably get other C&C games cheaper.

Ultimately, I would say if you have any level of love for the series you should probably get this. The bells and whistles are nice, for sure. But more than that, you've got the various mods and expansions all collected in one place and you've got multiplayer (if that's your bag) on a convenient platform with a large player base.  This must surely be considered the definitive version of these games to date. I actually can't think of what they could have added or changed to this without them being fundamentally different games.

This is the way a remaster is done. I hope they don't listen to all the noobs that hated the game cause it wasn't direct X 9000 or there was no attack move or it just wasn't their favourite out of the series and because of that they didn't buy the game. 

My only negatives I experienced were frame stuttering which I mostly fixed within Nvidia control panel by applying Vsync to every .exe file in the game folder. This is also know and they are working on it.

Second was for some reason in skirmish the ore when playing Red Alert runs out way too fast that and servers need to be a bit better apart from that this is a masterpiece and its nothing that cannot be ironed out.

The issues with the game is the AI and unit pathfinding (or near lack of), also the FMV cutscenes show their age; however the developers did make great due with what they had to work with. (The original tapes had been lost).

Pros:
Graphics - Outstanding, the new upscaled graphics and models are phenomenally well detailed, the ability to swap back and forth between old and new graphics is amazing for those looking for that nostalgia trip.
Gameplay - Core gameplay is faithfully recreated from top to bottom! Nothing major has been messed with, nice features such as multi-queue units is always awesome to have!
Soundtrack - Do I even need to say anything about how amazing the soundtrack by Frank Klepacki is? Having both the classic, remastered, AND Frank's band the Tib Suns song versions is phenomenal as well as special demo tracks from the original 90's is even better.

Cons:
Frame Rate Drop - The ONLY con I could find, and it is VERY minor, is that when you start the game up and select a mission is that for the first minute you MIGHT experience some stuttering. It WILL level out and stop after a minute or so. From what I've heard this occurs more if you've installed the game on an HD but doesn't happen to those installing on an SSD. But it's so minor to me in comparison of everything else about the game, especially since it levels off quickly.

The games themselves are really well made, the missions are fun and challenging and the story is cool. In terms of content, the map maker is pretty cool, and there are all of the covert-ops missions from the PS1 version which is great.

Graphically, the game looks amazing. Somehow the devs have managed to make the game look as good as your nostalgia goggles remember it looking, which is to say it's accurate to the original, just looking very good.

The best thing is the soundtrack. Frank Klepacki's OST has been remastered and sounds great, but the best bits are the re-recorded stuff by the Tiberium Sons. Getting the Tiberium Sons in to do OST work was a great decision, it actually really surprised me that a project EA was involved with actually went and did this, it is superb.

The controls have been modernised (although this is configurable between legacy and modern options which is a good decision). The addition of keybinds for building and unit construction makes the game feel a bit more Starcrafty, and spares your mouse hand a bit.

15,70463340,english,"Before you read: Keep in mind I'm an aging gamer on the wrong side of 30 who has been getting progressively less interested in gaming as time goes on

I grew up playing these games and they were some of my all time favorites, I have many fond memories playing the campaigns and skirmishes with my friend on dial-up and on MPlayer, so I was pretty excited to play this. I was also really happy to see they weren't charging $60 or more, but unless you've been cryogenically frozen for 25 years, or never played an RTS...you will likely be disappointed after playing it for a short time. 

They did a great job recreating the original games, but the gameplay itself is so outdated now (especially if you've kept up with the RTS genre), that it will only end up annoying you. 

Rose-tinted glasses will only get you so far, and this really made me realize just how far games have come since I used to play this. I would always wonder, ""why don't they make a simple old school RTS like the original C&C games?"", and now I realize it's because there is much better stuff out there now, and modern RTS games have taken all the great things about C&C and improved upon them to the point where the original games are now completely obsolete. 

Because of the technological limitations back then, units have so few voice commands when you give them orders, that it ends up becoming painfully annoying just moving them around the map. Also as others have mentioned, the path-finding is absolutely terrible, and you have to babysit every unit to make sure they go where you want. This was never an issue back when I was 12 years old in 1995 because I had nothing to compare it to. 

The maps were not designed with modern resolutions and aspect ratios, and even though the team behind it did a great job with the look, you'll find yourself accidentally clicking on a unit instead of the terrain and vice versa, and even the act of selecting units is really bad.

If you know exactly what to expect with this...which is a tribute to an old game, and if you like playing older games, then you might still enjoy this, but I couldn't bring myself to do more than a couple of hours. 

If you want to play a good C&C game, imo the best one out there is ""Tiberium Wars"" and the expansion ""Kane's Wrath"". A lot of people will argue that ""Generals"" is the best, but I never felt like those were real C&C games because they didn't have the cheesy FMV's, nor did they have GDI and NOD (even though I do think Red Alert was a better game than the original). 

Since it was $20, I'm not going to ask for a refund, because I might still go back and play a skirmish here and there, but overall it's just a reminder to me that nostalgia is total b.s. and with all the problems the gaming industry has these days, we have become pretty spoiled in terms of how advanced they are. 

I'd recommend Tiberium Wars, Kane's Wrath, and Starcraft II if you want to play an RTS game in the same vein as C&C, even though they are like a decade+ old, they improve upon all the aspects of these older games in every way.",1591570509,1591570509,False,42,5,0.585742175579071045,4,True,False,False,76561197969766266,591,33,110,0,110,1591565072

17,70463214,english,"This is a first review after about 15 hours in-game. Finished the Nod Campaing, played a little Red Alert as Allies and 1-2 online games. 

This game is close to what I was expecting from a Remastered version of the old ones. Graphics nicely enhanced, nothing too much out of the norm. AI is like the old one. I know that devs didn't want to get their hands on that, because it would be too messy, but 1-2 things could have changed. Like unit behavior during confrontations, self-defence, group defence etc. We got traffic jams and bad pathfinding, but ok, it hits the nostalgia button. I liked the gameplay additions like the building queue, but it would be better to add some more, like same unit selection (double click on a unit to select all same unit within visible range), routing maybe.

Cut scenes are so good, if you take into account that were enhanced from compressed files and not from the raw footage, which are sadly lost. Non live action, CGI scenes could have been remade with software to look sharp. I am not a CGI creator but I guess that they could be made quite easily, if you take into account some amateur stuff on Youtube. Some details on the cut scenes like the maps and some ingame screenshots could have been remade too... They look too pixelated.

But enough with the negative(ish) stuff. Command and Conquer Remastered Collection is a very good example of what we usually say, graphics don't make the game good. Excellent gameplay, for those who missed those games and settled for the buggy versions for years, and for those who didn't got the chance to play them in the 90's. Online matchmaking is good and not laggy at all. Single player game experience is tense, like the old days. The overall experience is good, given the facts that we talk about a 25-year old game. My review is positive, and the ""cons"" expressed, I wish to be taken as a friendly advice from a C&C fan that played the whole series again and again since the beggining.

All in all, this Remastered Edition is one great work. I want to thank Petroglyph and the rest (and EA) for this and maybe some updates when you get the chance. You listened to us and got this work done, listen to us once more and make the changes for a perfect title to stand in 2020 like it stood in 1995. I hope and wish we get some more Remastered editions like Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun. We don't get RTS like those any more and these look like a Tiberium blast in vast space.

36,70462108,english,"If you enjoyed Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert back in the day, this is a fantastic improvement. While basic gameplay is entirely untouched (including all of it's flaws) there are some good quality of life improvements in the form of additional hotkeys, replays, observer mode and dedicated servers which result in almost no lag online. If, however, you are a new comer then please know that these games are a bit dated. There are aspects which have not aged well, such as the tilesize restricting granular unit control, awful pathfinding and rather eccentric multiplayer balance. As such go into this with that in mind - this is largely a graphical and audio upgrade.

So, graphically it's quite attractive. Everything is readable, colourful and reflects the original designs well. It's not perfect, there is a lack of oomph in some parts, such as not porting over the differences between TD and RA light tanks (instead just reusing the same art for both), adding greater variety to special effects, extra animations on units or structures, or even adding some form of lighting for explosions etc but it's a good step up on modern displays with a crispness and colourfulness that makes it enjoyable to play. I particularly like the attention to detail on the damage frames of many structures.

The gameplay audio has also been entirely revamped as well, however I'd describe this as hit and miss. RA1 sounds top notch to me with a powerful crunchiness to most of it's revamps, however in Tib Dawn a few sounds lack the impact and character of the originals. That's partly because some were obnoxious, such as the ear destroying Guard Tower guns but it would've been nice if they kept the same aggressive feel - instead they sound a bit weak. On the plus side maps now have ambient sounds, such as wind and distant wolf cries in Red Alert, which subtly add to the atmosphere. The sound engine has also been much improved so that you can more accurately tell where and how far away firefights are, a good gameplay element.

All of the missions are here, including those from the N64 and PS1 versions, with the addition of hard mode for Tiberian Dawn. Sadly it is just straight stat boosts for the enemy, which result in some frustration, but it's not a bad addition for veterans who just want to face the odds. The cutscenes have been ported over but their quality is somewhat left to be desired... the only real quality upscales are the Nod videos, where it seems they had some higher resolution footage to mix in as well, but it must be said the RA1 scenes, particularly the CGI interludes, are pretty rough.

There is a tonne of bonus content which is fantastic for avid C&C fans too, largely behind the scenes footage of the FMVs and other aspects, which can be unlocked by playing through the campaign. Clearly time and effort went into this!

Last but not least, the single best aspect of this release is the INCREDIBLE soundtrack. Frank Klepacki has worked overtime to rejuvenate every single piece of music, some transcending their originals by miles, but all boasting a phenomenal improvement in fidelity and impact. Furthermore, there's a lot of bonus tracks including basically an entire album by The Tiberian Sons cover band, including tracks from across the series. It sounds like Frank knew this was a once in a lifetime chance to revisit the industry inspiring music and he spared no expense. The music alone is worth the price of entry in my opinion, and frankly (not pun intended) it out strips the other enhancements provided in this package with the kind of flare you'd die for in a remaster.

I had to get it; I've always wanted a proper high definition remake of the original games.  This takes me back to when I was in 6th grade and played this with friends over dial-up because the Internet didn't really exist where I lived yet.

I love everything about this remaster.  It's faithfully done with care taken to preserve how the gameplay works though I have a suspicion that there might be a slight improvement in the AI since the original.  Visually it's amazing, the audio is amazing and the music is mind blowingly great!  They're not all just remasters of the original, but completely fresh performances of the original songs recorded by the original composer and his band.  There's a lot of classics I remember loving back in the day that sound like whole new songs today and they make me smile when I hear them while playing.

I've not checked out multiplayer yet but it looked like a no-brainer to get a lobby rolling and invite you friends or make it public and let people join.  I'm going to have a lot of fun playing this.

I will say the only thing I don't like is that if you install this on an HDD there are momentary pauses where you can tell the game is still trying to load assets into memory and it can break up the pace of the game slightly, but the install size isn't terrible so I've moved it to my OS SSD drive now to help it run as smoothly as possible.  Perhaps a little optimization is in order by the developers here to get everything loaded up before starting a map.

You can still play the free ones, of course. They have functional multiplayer and are just as great as they were two decades ago. Currently there are a few stuttering issues for non-SSD installs, but otherwise it looks and plays nice. The bonuses are neat, but arguably a curiosity for hardcore fans more than a reason to purchase it.

The real gold is the soundtrack. Frank Klepacki remastered all them music and it sounds phenomenal, as do the new and unreleased tracks added that were a collaborative between him and the Tiberian Sons. I feel like that was worth my 20 dollars, and having all the usual Steam stuff is just a bonus. I can't really weigh in on how mods are gonna be like at the moment since there are only a few, but having an integrated map editor is also nice.

2,70402863,english,"The C&C Remastered Collection is perfect for anyone looking for a comparatively simple, smaller-scale RTS experience, and for old-school RTS players feeling nostalgic for the early days of the 90s. Likewise, if you've never experienced these games and you're interested in the history of the genre, this collection is the perfect ""primer"" for you: It's two of the granddaddies of the RTS genre with all of their respective mission add-ons, with enhanced audio and graphics, running perfectly on a modern PC. The collection includes:

- Command & Conquer - Tiberian Dawn
--- Add-On: C&C - The Covert Operations
- Command & Conquer - Red Alert
--- Add-On: C&C Red Alert - Counterstrike
--- Add-On: C&C Red Alert - Aftermath
- Bonus materials such as greenscreen footage and new (awesome) songs for the (already awesome) soundtrack

Now, if you're looking for an alternative to modern competitive RTS games such as Starcraft 2, be advised: These games were unbalanced, they had pathfinding issues and the AI was so dumb it only managed to be a threat because it cheated - a lot! This Remaster does not change any of this, and it only adds some of the convenience features you might expect from a modern RTS. For example, while you can now queue the production of multiple units, you cannot set a waypoint for them to automatically move to once they're built.

Personally, I think the games' fast-paced real-time strategy gameplay still holds up after all this time, even without the nostalgia goggles on. But (like with all remasters of classic games), your mileage may vary, depending on what you actually want to get out of them.

BTW: If you're interested in real-time strategy games but you don't think you'll be able to keep up with some of the more complex modern titles in the genre, this might actually be a good entry point for you. Due to the very basic AI and the relatively simple tech trees (no upgrading different armor/weapon types, for example) it's much less challenging than many modern RTS.",1591470052,1591561749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970765000,900,17,1774,0,501,1596761295

You just published a game 
- that doesn't ruin it's original vision, which probably means you didn't fuck over the people developing it... 
- that runs really well and it's relatively bug-free (in my case).
- that has no unnecessary add-ons like microtransactions and 2cool4school stuff that nobody asked for.
- that doesn't require Origin to be installed.
- that even allows mods in the workshop.

All in all, you're a triple AAAAAAAAAAAAAA publisher that gave fans exactly what they wanted - in the year 2020. It's almost as if... you want to make money and keep gamers happy at the same time.

14,70457830,english,"I played C&C when it was released, it was awesome. The remaster feels the same, it is awesome. What I am rating is the rematering, not the game:
+ remaster optics are nice
+ nice to switch back an forth
+ some game play additions, like progressbar of building things in icon. nice.
While I understand that it is a remaster and not a remake, I still think that bugs should be taken out:
- two harvesters can block each other
- transport heli can block an infantry unit from entering when in narrow point
- units waypoint are so stupid. they will drive completely the wrong way even in an entirely reveiled map
- no waypoints setable for factory production
- temp blocked way (e.g. a unit passes through) will be regarded as completely blocked by units, which will then plott a different way and not reconsider once way is open
- units ignore attacks and just die.
- APC unit will interupt unloading when it wants to fire on something. impossible to unload close to a enemy building
- harvesters always end up at the furthest point to harvest, rather than the nearest
- when saving, no prompt when name already exists. name will then be double.

Me personally, would want those to be fixed. At the time it was visionary and these things did not matter.

Played for campaign mainly and fuck me is it unrelenting, this game is from 1995 and it shows.  A-10 bombers in the NOD campaign randomly spawn forever and just wipe out your armies and base and even if shot down will still keep coming, why? What is the point of these? for difficulty? Possibly the worst decision in any game i've experianced. if you start a mission already in a very difficult position, why randomly go ""lol your whole army was just bombed by 2 planes you lose, restart?"". 

you have to save every 5 seconds in the campaign to make sure you don't have to restart because random units spawn behind you or your army was run over my the enemy harvester who apparantly runs on blood. The AI is just so hostile and agressive, fine in skirmish, not campaign.

24,70457142,english,"Command & Conquer™ Remastered is finally here, developed by Petroglyph Studios (Grey Goo (2015), 8-Bit Armies (2016)), former Westwood Studio developers and published by Electronic Arts. It's so close to being the perfect return of Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert, but juuust not quite there. Here's a basic overview of the remaster. What I like, and what I dislike about it.

A full remaster of the music by Frank Klepacki, sound and visuals of the classic 1995 and 1996 releases of ""Command & Conquer™ Tiberian Dawn"", ""Command & Conquer™: Red Alert"", and their expansions, ""Command & Conquer™ Covert Ops"", ""Command & Conquer™: Counter Strike"", and ""Command & Conquer™ The Aftermath"". Featuring a 4K resolution, upscaled cutscenes including ones from the original PlayStation 1 release, complete with smoothed out framerates, playable on modern hardware with ""modern"" gameplay mechanics and updates. Lastly, the ability to go from original art to remastered artstyles on the fly in-game, but NOT for cutscenes.

The variety of keybinds is incredible, buuut, they are let down by the fact the game doesn't allow a more modernized command bar. The current command bar expands as more buildings are created, much like the original release, which means 
QWERTY
ASDFGH
ZXCVBN
hotkeys get jumbled horribly depending on your build. When compared to OpenRA, it's way too behind the times. Allow players a ""Legacy"" and ""Modern"" option, to feature all buttons on the command bar and just grey out the options that are unusable. That way, no matter what build the player goes for, the hotkeys and buttons wont shift around.

I'd also like to see an option to switch between the original 360p cutscenes and the newly remastered / upscaled / framerate smoothed cutscenes by hitting space bar, same as the in-game visuals. Some of these cutscenes look really wonky and terrible whenever there's too much motion on screen or silhouettes, fully detracting from the experience and immersion. Extremely disappointing.

Using multiple monitors? Different resolutions? Avoid Exclusive Fullscreen. This game will forget what monitor it's on, glitch out, and cause you to have to Alt+F4 to fix it. It's also prone to forgetting resolutions. Play in borderless windowed if you have multiple monitors.

Tiberian Dawn is limited to 4p. Red Alert, 8p. There are no private rooms, no password protected lobbies. If you enable a mod, it stops you from playing multiplayer. Enabling or disabling a mod forces you to restart the game. Multiplayer lags, as in, delayed interacting with units via selection, movement, attack, etc. MMR is as basic as it gets. What's the ladder map pool? It's not explained or shown. It's extremely bare bones and poorly implemented. An afterthought at most.

Observer mode leaves a lot to be desired. It's so limiting on what is shown to the viewer. Not to mention, where are my own replays? Why am I getting random replays from random people? Why can't I see what units / structures are being produced by what players at any given time? How many units does each player have and what type? How many harvesters exist for each player? What's the income rate for each player? This is such a HUGE oversight and will detract heavily from a caster's abilities or a viewer's understanding as to what's currently going on.

Lastly, the stutters. If you do not have an SSD in the current version of the game, as of 10:00PM ET, 6/6/2020, do not buy this game. It will stutter all to hell and be virtually unplayable. We're talking full on frame hitching, dropping down to below 10FPS for 0.25-1 seconds. This is inexcusable. Avoid at all costs until this is patched and fixed. 

When there's already a better product out on the market (for free, I might add), and the only major improvement here is the visuals, audio and music, then I can't recommend buying this product in it's current state. If OpenRA didn't exist, and wasn't better in virtually every other way gameplay wise, then I'd 100% say this game was worth it. But the cutscenes are botched, the framerate is a potato (on HDD), observer mode leaves a lot to be desired, and the command bar let's down the incredible key binding options.

-- Group of 10 tanks selected and groups - you select the group and tell them to move/attack ~30% do what you ask, the 2nd sit there doing nothing. painful when you're swarming enemy troops.
-- If you're on an island with a bridge, the units will follow the coast of the island before ""finding"" the bridge, some units will drive the wrong way until they can't go any further before turning round and going the correct way.
--Some groups require multiple clicks to tell them what to do accurately.
--Submarines(RA) are terrible. Will fire into an island/each other rather than at the unit you selected, requires micromanagement. (recommend sending ""scatter"" - default X before firing on enemy)

-Cutscenes are ""eh"", I appreciate it's probably the best quality they could get out of the originals, but it's a little jarring. (Note: this is JUST for RA - the Original game cutscenes are insane!)
-A group of engineers taking over a building will stop when the colour flips, with 0 health. you have to micromanage adding an additional engineer (even if you initially sent it) as the engineer will walk away from the building (Don't remember if this is true to the original, i thought they ""took over"" with a ~red amount of health, not 1hp)


[h1]The Good[/h1]
-Nostalgia in a bottle. 
-Game play is silky smooth, runs very nice
-Campaign is nice to play, interface allows you to go back and complete missions you didn't select.
-Really Enjoyable RTS
-Isn't that expensive considering the content
-Really easy to lose track of time whilst playing.


[h1]Notes[/h1]
NB. Currently untested Multiplayer, I've been working my way through the campaigns within RA.

I'd still recommend the game to most people, however those that aren't great on micromanagement, or aren't used to the Janky-ness of some of the original game, i'd wait to see if anything gets adjusted.

I really hope EA push through and do some more of the early series. Remastered TibSun & RA2 would be a great follow up.",1591543889,1591557639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197967415809,656,10,1443,0,546,1593555618

+ you can play it now on windows 10

+ commes with map editor (tool tip: use ´´shift´´ key to place objects)
+ MOD community
+ online play (4 max)

Its good to be alive to play this remaster! I never would've thought they would ever revisit something old like this. I personally thank Jim Vessella aka ""Jimtern"", Joe Bostic, Steve Tall, Mike Legg, Frank Klepecki, Ted Morris and the rest of OG Westwood employees who scattered to the winds that came to work on this (many went on to create Petrogylph games which includes best selling games like Star Wars Empires at War - another strategy/RTS game). Thank you for listening to fan feedbacks in Reddit with periodic updates which you weren't even obliged to do so. Also Thanks for including the source code for this game in the game file as well; knowing that you guys werent even able to find the original C&C1/Red Alert source code to begin with! (great reverse engineering)/

This remaster brings me back to my time as a mere child trying to load this on my old IBM computer with Windows 95...so much framerate lag but considering the time, I just ""lived"" with it until now. Gameplay is very smooth except occasional tearing in Red Alert (as of launch date; maybe a patch coming soon?). You can switch from Legacy view to Remaster by pressing the Space bar at any time in the game. The graphics/cinematics is upscale to 4k with the help of Lemon Sky Studios which is awesome to see hair on their faces than blur pixels. Also this includes ALL EXPANSIONS/CONSOLE MISSIONS that weren't available before. Map Editor is just phenomenal and its easy to use and create your own missions (""Modern"").

Overall, this is one of my best purchases I've made. I hope that this was a wake-up call for EA (publisher) and that they'll repent their sins and live without immense greed that overall destroy their own creation.

I must say, as a modern CnC fan who started late with CnC3 and RA3 (and then went back to the Generals titles), I don't see what all the bad blood with EA was about.  CnC3 and RA3 are absolutely perfect and play fantastically.  This game was obviously groundbreaking at the time. And the remaster is an interesting anachronism and extremely well done, but anyone who has been spouting for the last decade that the Westwood games were somehow superior to modern CnC games (excluding the horrible CnC4) seems to be re-working their memories a bit.   This is now demonstrably not the case.  

But Westwood created a great foundation for a series that still desperately needs a modern title (while CnC4 should simply be removed from all servers worldwide).

Firstly, you are getting two free games (with season pass worth of DLC each!) for a price of a single AA game.

Secondly, you are getting complete collection of the original content of the first two games that kicked off the genre's appreciation 25 years ago, including resources taken from the various non-PC platform ports in a no-hassle couple of clicks manner. Not that it was not available to the community before... yet it's packed in such a thoughtful, user friendly manner one can't respect this enough.

And really, if not just for the originals, getting bonus content, super high quality community submissions, remastered videos, which are for the most part surprisingly quite decent and new high fidelity music tracks should make it worth buying right now.

1,70451887,english,"Only had Remastered for 3 days now and can fully recommend it. If you're a die-hard Command and Conquer fan this is a no brainer purchase for you. If you're a strategy game novice (from AoE2 or Starcraft or Warcraft) then this will definitely scratch your itch. Petroglyph, Lemon Sky and EA did an amazing job remastering the old game in stunning 4K resolution and modern RTS design paradigms such as right-click commands and tabbed construction queues. There is new remastered music from the Industrial Rock god Frank Klepacki himself and it blends beautifully with the old 90's rock.

In terms of gameplay the game is crisp, nostalgic and actually quite challenging! Tiberium Dawn has a new Hard difficulty mode, which allows the AI to cheat and have stronger units... making brute force strategies fail spectacularly. I've beaten every GDI mission variation thus far on Hard, so it is doable; but very frustrating at times. I have yet to play the Nod Campaign, or Red Alert yet, but I am sure it will be more of the same ☺.

One down side worth noting is there is a slight frame drop when you load a save file. EA Jim said they're looking into it and it should be fixed very soon.

10/10 for C&C fans. 9/10 for other RTS fans. Otherwise wait for a promo.",1591552394,1591552394,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False,76561197997119096,218,26,2713,0,1620,1593537482
2,70451881,english,"The game is what you remember: a innovative and groundbreaking entry which helped spark a period of rapid development in the RTS genre. Here some of those improvements are ported in, but not all, helping to ensure a faithful recreation of the original game's play style, albeit with a new and vastly improved look and sound. 

I would say that this game is a very strong single player package, with four tremendous campaigns which stand the test of time, albeit with some really challenging missions. I don't know if it is as strong a multiplayer package, given the relatively shallow tech trees and basic gameplay modes on offer; Starcraft 2 Dawn of War 2, or even Company of Heroes 1 probably offer more meat on that bone. 

This compares pretty favourably to the other two major remasters that I have played recently. It avoids the problematic gameplay changes that plagued Homeworld Remastered's launch, but like that game benefits from a bizarrely amazing soundtrack; Command and Conquer's visuals are probably a bigger jump compared to the original than Homeworld Remastered was, but that remaster is a few years old and ultimately Homeworld's graphics were sort of timeless anyway. Both games have excellent campaigns, but I think there is more content here, and Homeworld while an amazing game is definitely the more difficult and niche game to get into. Meanwhile, I would judge that Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition is probably the more impressive game, if only because I think that game's visuals are slightly better overall than this, and that is just such a professional package (so much content!) with some really thoughtful and great elements like the advanced tutorials. That's fair though; AoE2 came out years after C&C, and I don't know if its fair to expect the same gameplay elements from what is ultimately a simpler game. This game has campaigns that blow AoE2's out of the water though, as the AoE campaigns were always more functional than exciting, while C&C's campaigns are fun and audacious. So between the three games, I would rate this almost if not quite as good as AoE2, and probably slightly better than Homeworld Remaster. If I were you though, I'd just buy all three.

If you are wanting to play Command and Conquer Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert 1, this is the best way to do it. However, if you are wanting a fully modern RTS which has all the improvements of two and a half decades of development in the genre, this game is probably not going to meet your requirements. I played the originals back in the day, and have periodically replayed this series as time went on. It holds up, it plays great, and it now looks great.

Nos meados de 1998, com meu PlayStation 1, tinha ganhado da minha Nona (Vó) meu primeiro jogo de RTS, Command & Conquer: Red Alert Retaliation.
Lembro que inicialmente fiquei admirado com a capinha do jogo e claro, com o jogo em si, seus gráficos para mim foi a coisa mais incrível que tinham feito.
Mas, não sabia o que tinha que fazer, kkk.
Lembro que andava pelo mapa, com os tanks e soldados, sem rumo, sem entender nada.
Cara, eu tinha apenas 5 anos, sei lá. Era muito novo mesmo.
Anos jogando ele, de uma forma e outra, fui descobrindo como acontecia as coisas e fui atacando cada vez mais os adversários.
Sempre gostei do lado Soviético dele, e o que mais gostava era a Tesla Tower e tudo relacionado aos choques.

Enfim.
Anos mais tarde, tinha descobrido que a EA tinha comprado dos direitos da Westwood Studios e isso tinha me deixado empolgado, pois até então a EA fazia jogos muito bons para PlayStation 2 e PC.

Só que vimos que foi decaindo demais ao partir dos anos, virando uma empresa Mercenária e que não liga para que os fãs querem. Isso me deixou puto.
Quando anunciaram o Generals 2, achei que seria a salvação, mas que nada, cancelado meses à tarde.

Bom, seria o fim?
Final de 2019, com o anuncio dos novos estúdios, e que retornariam com a saga original, em forma remastered, e isso... cara do céu, me deixou muito hypado, demais! Eu quase chorei quando mostraram a primeiras imagens.

E na última semana de lançamento, graças a Deus, pude comprar na Pré-Compra esse maravilhoso jogo.

Que jogo meus amigos, que jogo!
Quando pude iniciar aqui no meu note, aquele vídeo de introdução me feliz ficar muito emocionado, empolgado, maravilhado, muitas emoções.

E sua gameplay, músicas, vídeos, legendas, cara, tudo ficou perfeito, os detalhes do remaster ficou espetacular. Como é bom poder jogar esse jogo de novo.

Parabéns pela EA e os estúdios, finalmente fizeram algo realmente bom, que os fãs querem. Que realmente um jogo te prende em suas campanhas e histórias, pois hoje em dia tá tudo muito vago os jogos afora.

Espero que muitas empresas vejam a importância disso.
E espero que todos possam se divertir muito com este jogo.

13,70442796,english,"I love the new graphics and I'm mostly happy with the remaster. But I think that it should also have functioned as a patch and fix some annoyances of the original game. Pathfinding for example. 

Also they didn't implement the possibility to add rally points to the production buildings, which I found strange to be lacking...

Other than that, the GUI in the game menu can be a little hard to read (especially the list of online games).

And the save / load implementation is a bit silly because it allows me to have several savegames with the same title. Hence I end up with lots of savegames named ""ok"" for one mission that is hard, instead of it writing over the last ""ok"" savegame.

I am looking forward for a patch to make the experience with this remaster better, it would be sad if they don't listen to the community and fix these small annoyances and other little things. But I'm not complaining and I'm very happy with the effort they put into making this!

EDIT: A suggestion to resolve this is described below:

If classic game logic is needed to support the classic missions then I suggest always using that for missions, but for skirmish and multiplayer also have an option for mordern gamelogic/gameplay. Just like we got options for modern sound and mouse controls... 

This actually makes sense and would make the game great for both groups of people; the ones who prefer the classics and the ones who are spoiled with some of the improvements seen in OpenRA.

the graphics is really well done. and the fact that you can change between the old graphics and new ones is just a cool little bonus. dont listen to the people complaining. i have not had a single crash, and this is a remaster, not a remake... some people dont seem to know the difference. my only two downsides to this game so far is the AI.. specially in some missions..
they come at you with 2-3 tanks, 3 flame thrower guys, and some assault rifles...
you defend youre base in witch you lose 2/3 of what you started with..
2 min later they come back with the same force before you even have enough time to build yourself an army to properly defend. and it repeats, everything you build to fight them, gets ripped apart as you protect youre base from constantly incoming AI atacks.. in the end you run out of funding and die. 

second thing i dont like is that you cant use mods while playing multiplayer.
now, this i understand if you play against some one with mods you dont have,
but at least it could have been an option to play with people whom has the same mods.

the AI problem is a bit game breaking, and this is on Normal difficulty.
hugely anoying when you cant get an smal army to atack cause you need it to defend..

What I liked about this game:
*Music – this is an absolute blast! Sometimes, I’ll just load the game just to listen to the Jukebox. 
*Upgraded graphics – play in 4K resolution if your system supports it, you can even toggle the graphics between the original and remaster during solo play
*Some Quality-of-Life improvements like unit queueing and improved sidebar, just to name a few
*Map Editor
*Mods

What I didn’t like:
*The upscaled CGI movies are disappointing but this is forgivable given that these games are more than two decades old. 
*Unit pathfinding issues (like when your loading multiple units to a transport, they still get stuck sometimes)
*Some QoL elements were not implemented like waypoints, move attack and some bugs like units not defending even when they’re attacked, etc.
*Currently, multiplayer games may have issues like lag, disconnects, etc but the developers promised continued support and to work on the issues as soon as they can.  

All these issues (except for the CGI movies) maybe patched by the developer or even fixed by the modders since the game’s dll files have been released. 

Overall, this is a stellar package. You have to understand what you’re getting into. If you’re turned off by bad CGIs and some of the things I listed under the cons, then this game may not be for you.

34,70440261,english,"Probably it is my problem that I expected more, but I'm disappointed.

Basically, it is the same game as it was in 1995 (or at least how I remember it) but the visual is improved. They did really good job improving in-game models and textures, that is something I can't deny. Everything is sharp and looks nice. Kudos to the artists.

Music is amazing. Great mix of rock and ambient makes wonderful music you don't want to turn off.

BUT.

Story videos are very blurry. I know that they had no hi-res sources, but I've seen what enthusiasts do using neural networks. I guess having EA's resources they could have done better job.

But the worst parts are friendly units' AI and path finding. It is as bad as it can possibly be. If I command a unit to attack something, it most probably does it (but not always, Orca's pilot says ""yes, sir"" and stays where it is). But in a group of units some will definitely decide to abandon my order. They can stand still when attacked. They can chaotically move under fire not firing back. They will try to come closer to a guard tower when they can fire from where they stand. A big group of soldiers will move from one point to another as a group of people walking for leisure.

Nostalgia is strong with it, but it is 2020 and the game is priced not as full price games but is not indie price segment either. I think we could reasonably expect a bit more.

It is very good if you know what to expect, but do not expect too much. 

I'm really confused what should I select. Should I recommend it or not? From one hand, my expectations are my problem. From the other hand, I don't think that my expectations are unique and unreasonable.

43,70441500,english,"The game is pretty much the way I remember it (so a nice trip back in time!)... the presentation is nice, especially if you recall the original video clips and story.

I've a hit a couple of niggles... e.g. when using the transport chopper to move your special unit around the map in misison 6, the fog of war does not clear as it should (the chopper has a large circle of visibility - or should have).

Whilst the remaster is quite faithful to the original, it's shame that EA haven't followed some of the nice features that the OpenRA project implemented... particularly the ability to really make use of your huge 4K monitor to see the entire map at once (although perhaps should only be allowed in single player games - or in multiplayer games where everyone has a 4k display attached and/or consents to this option being permitted).

OpenRA also brought some nice enhancements like using way-points in these classic games - which isn't 100% to the original games, but does add another useful dimension without breaking the game in any way - so it's a shame not to see little tweaks like these added.

The ability to download custom maps also appears to either be broken or maybe just unintuitive to use - I seem to have downloaded a couple of these and have ""ticks"" showing in the UI to indicate this - yet can't seem to actually select or play those downloaded maps. This could be me doing something wrong, but a tour through the UI didn't turn up any clues as to what I am doing wrong.

So at the moment, I'd say this is promising and nice to see all of the old content given a new lease of life - but there's still a couple of bugs and rough edges that really shouldn't be there - but which will hopefully get patched pretty quickly.

I recommend this game to anyone willing to understand what Command & Conquer started as back in the 90's, or to anyone who loves the RTS genre, or to anyone wanting to reminisce about the past.

I love it. It is already dear to my heart and I will probably play for many hours more.

The game looks great it is running smooth for me. The remastered soundtracks from Frank is really really good in my opinion.

The AI is still a bit annoying to be honest and so is the pathfinding for the AI as well. Getting stuck on the same places or going another way then you want. Well yeah that's bit frustrating but it is allso a part of the charm of the game.

I know that there has some minor issue since the launch of the game. I had some of the before i switch my game install to my SSD. But the online matches is still somewhat bugged, but i have been lucky to not encunter any of this issuse /bugs that others are expericen.

I will paste the link to the reddit site of command and conquer remastered so you can go and read the stated bugs and issues there. https://www.reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/comments/gxg5nz/remaster_update_and_game_stuttering_online/

Well can i recommend the game. Yes i can to people that are fans of the C&C franchise or just love this game for what it is.For new players i would say maybe, it all depends on if you like this kind of game and have some patient with it. The game mechanic is frome back in the days and do not have the same features as morden RTS games haves.

But if you can make it through all of this then go ahead get the game. And enjoy a bit of game history, and blast from the past. The pricing of the game is fair so nothing much to say there.
But if you still is hesitating to get the game then wait for a sale and go for it then. Or if you want to play a lot of online games or LAN with or against your friends. Then wait till they hade fixt some fo the issues to get the game. But if you just want to play the campinge go for it. In the  end it's all up to you.

This is a top notch remaster of two excellent games: Command & Conquer (AKA Tiberian Dawn) and Red Alert 1. Both are updated with their expansion packs; it's a true remaster in the sense that the devs have been mostly faithful to the originals. We're talking renovation rather than invention.

The old FMVs were upscaled using generative adversarial networks, plus a few manually applied finishing touches tidying up faces and other textures. The results are still a bit pixelated and grainy, but decent on the whole.

The soundtrack is completely redone with a thorough, synthesized treatment of every track. Map/mission selection is tastefully overhauled; a globe animation zooms in. High res graphics look decent and behave as a fresh coat of paint, while an added zoom function using the mouse wheel is handy. You can switch to the classic graphics for that authentic 90s experience. Admittedly the AI is lackluster compared with modern RTS titles; both game's difficulty tends to consist in fending off scripted waves of enemies. However multiplayer is included for those who desire an intenser challenge.

The attentive care taken here indicates real passion from the developers; these veteran devs do nostalgic justice to the legendary Westwood Studios name. For future remakes - Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 etc - if this team keeps their autonomy, we could be in for some real treats...[b]in the name of Kane.[/b]",1591533686,1591533686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197998547567,2929,34,3571,0,17,1598188366

TL:DR: If you're a fan of classic Command & Conquer, you'll love this - just don't expect it to have any modern AI or gameplay tweaks.

Want to get your army across a bridge? If you click across the river they'll usually just walk into walls to get there. Or your soldiers will take the deadliest path filled with Tiberium crystals that will kill them. The path-finding is non-existent, so you need to constantly babysit units. 

Want your soldiers to attack a Harvester or tank? They'll run right in front of it and you'll see 10 soldiers instantly squished to death. The AI is as braindead as it was 25 years ago.

Or the mission with a single Commando soldier - when he destroys a building, 2 enemies spawn out of it and immediately shoot him to death causing a 'mission failed.' You literally have no time to react if that happens and have to reload.

90's gameplay problems aside, for a 1:1 remaster, it works well. The visuals are very faithfully recreated and look fantastic at high resolution. The music and audio effects are noticeably improved, and overall user-experience in the menus is much better. There's also some visual artifacting in the AI-upscaled 60fps interpolated cutscenes, but they do look a lot cleaner than the old pixellated 15fps 360p videos.",1591451044,1591526410,True,3,0,0.531914889812469482,0,True,False,False,76561197970369872,691,45,848,0,264,1594663979

48,70346181,english,"This is an edited review

Launch day:

Positives
1) Game itself is good just like it was, improved UI(Able to Que units make infantry more viable) and also the amazing crisp remastered makeover. Awesome remastered soundtracks.
2) Added Skirmish for Tiberian Dawn, although the AI opponent requires alot of improvement, its currently very poor.
3) Its easy to jump in and play with friends via steam. Just create and invite.
4) Quick match 1v1 makes it much easier to jump into the game vs another player.
5) Map editor.
6) Observe and watch games/replays. However i feel at least let us save our game replays for sharing and viewing.

Negatives
1) Frustrating connectivity issues. Disconnects and all, expected from 1st day launch and also expected from EA servers. Buggy quickmatch due to connectivity issues.
2) Mediocre Lobby design, makes it impossible to find your friend's game if you dont have steam to invite.
3) No default save settings for multiplayer lobby, so everytime i host a game i need to put back all the AI and their teams.
4) Units were not balanced since the 1st game. To me i think this is a negative, balancing units will at least make other units more viable in online play. As of now in Tiberian dawn for example. Spamming buggies and engi rush wins u games, nothing else matters.
5) No rally points or attack move etc, there is a need for more modern RTS commands for this game.

With the negatives (Espescially the online disconnect experiences) i initially gave it a thumbs down.

Day 2 onwards:
Connectivity issues resolved. There is still small lag spikes at the start of the game but so far it has improved as u play along. I can safely recommend this game already. 
But they need to at least Improve on the multiplayer match making and lobby systems and also start balancing units. The AI comp also needs to be improved.

Just a tip for anyone who wants to comp stomp in skirmish, its best you play custom maps where players have put tenfolds of resources in the maps, to get the full vs AI experience(AI will build all units and tech trees due to the mass resources).

If you were a fan of this back in the 90's then I'd say definitely pick it up.

While there have been some quality of life improvements to the game, custom key bindings, modern interfaces, and the ability to queue units, this is still an old game. You won't find many bells and whistles in it, but they've done an amazing job with the remaster, you feel the love that the guys from Westwood put into making this game work on modern machines and on modern monitors.

The graphics are great, and if you get the zoom mod in the workshop then you can see the detail close up that they put into all the scenery, buildings and units. As an added treat, they mapped the space bar to allow you to switch back and forth on the fly between the original and remaster.

I would have liked a game speed change button cause sometimes things move way too fast for you, and, with no unit posturing options (passive, defensive, aggressive), you may find your units just hanging about while your base gets destroyed by a guy standing right next to them.

Still, if you know what you're buying, and you want to support what they've brought back to life, then I'd say buy it, 100%.

Lastly, the bonus material is great, they give you a behind the scenes take on the filming of all of the cut scenes which shows all the outtakes and work they put in to make the game.

The remake is gorgeous, the gameplay is true to the 1995 / 1996 legends and the game runs as smooth as butter. All the key elements that have made C&C the best RTS of all time are here and presented in beautiful graphics. I never knew that engineers wore moustache - thanks to this 4k remake, you'll discover little details that you would never find in the 25-years old original.

The way the game is rebuilt and presented, including a slightly adapted 'installation' process (that was last seen in the first MS-DOS version, but was missing from the subsequent Windows releases) is a joy to behold. Sounds and music bring back the original atmosphere better than anything. The game also contains lots of goodies and extras, like making-of vids as they were shooting the famous cutscenes.

There are no shenanigans here, like in Warcraft 3 Reforged - C&C Remastered is the real deal.

There are occasional little bugs and glitches, but none that I found affect the gameplay in any way - they're mostly related to the UI, like bugged large mouse cursor. Also, it would have been nice to keep the old 'restate briefing / video' recap options, which for unknown reasons are missing here.

Overall, this is a beautifully re-made gem that is a must-have for any RTS fan. If you've never played the original, this is the time to get into it. If you have, then all I can say is that yes, the game is as good as it's ever been, with fantastic looks and gameplay - and this remaster is a resounding success.

I played this game decades ago and it got me into PC gaming. Command and conquer was the first game i ever fully played and completed.

And no come along the remastered versions. Oh my, i think my marriage will suffer.
So now to the games. AWESOME. They have updated the graphics but the games are pretty much exactly the same. The sounds are as good as i remember and the skirmish mode is still great.
Once you complete the dozens of missions then you can have dozens or possibly hundreds of ours just playing on the skirmish mode to have fun.
What makes the games so memoriable are the cutscenes and they are as funny as i remember.

87,70401566,english,"I have only two complaints so far:

1. I wish I can switch between RA and TD without needing to close out of the game (i.e. there's no main menu option to switch from RA to TD, and vice versa). I should say the same about just transitioning to and from the map editor.
2. Also, it'd be nice if I can drag and rearrange tracks with my cursor on the jukebox playlist. I don't like how I need to remove and add them back into the playlist; this feels cumbersome, knowing how you can drag songs onto playlists from folders for others program (e.g. VLC media player).

Other than that, this game looks incredible; the finer details about this game make the remaster more than just updated graphics (e.g. adding in console content, Westwood being the company most prominently shown on the main menus). For reviews that mention the AI: although I know the AI isn't as modern as it should be, somehow the janky AI is charming for the remaster because of nostalgia with how it was janky for the original versions (though this is NOT an excuse to not modernize the AI; I wish I played more hours to know more about the AI issues and comment on them).

All in all, this game restored a portion of my faith in humanity, mostly because of how transparent and attentive the devs were to the community, and how the community contributed to the remaster alongside the devs. Although I can't forget about that awful mobile game, Rivals, this remaster does more than atone for that abomination in my opinion (except I still don't like EA for obvious reasons). I hope this isn't the last time anyone does this in the gaming industry, for any game, any remaster.

Edit: I'll edit this review from time to time whenever I run into AI problems.

Though...while they've done a lot to make it visually up to date, sadly they did nothing for the pathfinding of your forces. 

Trying to mount an attack is near impossible. Your forces always scatter all over the map making a unified assault nullified. Your troups trickle in one by making it easy for the enemy forces to pick them off. Whereas the enemy AI seems to understand how the pathfinding works, to the player it isn't really clear. 
I've had my ore trucks also be stuck in a loop a couple times. They just go from the ore refinery to a random spot, trying to get to ore, but then, for some reason not finding a path, even though there is a clear path between the ore and the refinery. 

I hope they fix the path finding, because at the moment it's just not very playable... Everything looks great, but I just wish they'd also done some work on this. This wouldn't fundamentally change the game, but it would bring it up to date and up to expectations. 

Because of this, I'm afraid at the moment I'd have to give it thumbs down. If they do fix the path finding, I'd change it to a thumbs up...

13,70429250,english,"Overview:
-It's the same great game(s) we experienced back in the day, but with better graphics and a few small gameplay improvements to make it a slightly smoother gameplay experience.
If you enjoyed the games when they first released then you'll definitely enjoy this remaster. It remains extremely faithful to the original and even offers the ability to toggle between the new and old graphics in the blink of an eye with an in-game key press.
There are definitely some things I wish would have been added or improved (listed below), but overall I'm still happy with the purchase!

Pros:
-Much better graphics (imagine graphical fidelity somewhere inbetween RA2 and Tiberium Wars)
-Ability to play with old graphics if you want to
-Slightly enhanced cutscenes
-Keymapping, better sidebar, build queue, LMB + RMB controls, camera zoom scrolling, skirmish, online, etc
-bonus missions from both pc and console versions
-remastered music for extreme nostalgia
-workshop support (hopefully in time workshop mods will fix the Cons listed below)

Cons/Criticism:
-Unit pathfinding remains seemingly untouched and frustrating (I really expected this to be improved. It's frustrating seeing your harvesters go to the tiberium that is the furthest away possible and then do random loops around the edges of terrain to take the longest route possible back to the refinery).
-No user-defined spawn waypoints for infantry/vehicle structures
-No click+drag building for walls
-Aerial vehicles still do not reveal the black shroud when flying (only when they land or shoot)
-cutscenes that are full CGI are ""enhanced"", but IMO should have been remade completely, seeing as there are no actors to replace and could easily have been replicated with MUCH higher fidelity. 
-The option for more minimalist unit selection/healthbar visuals would have been nice. The new textures for the game look great, but are often covered up and hidden by the large distracting healthbars and thick white brackets around selected units. 
-A optional visual aid displaying the circular range of base defenses when they are selected and being placed (as seen in more modern titles) would have been extremely welcomed

The DOS installation sequence in the intro was a nice touch as well. I did notice they removed the glitch where you could sell infantry next to the sandbags.

On the Red Alert side of things it runs and plays well but does a minor hitch. I noticed with the classic graphics that the damage bar and damage ""state"" of the building don't always update when under attack and left alone but it does update when you highlight it. It has no effect on gameplay at all since it's merely visual but hopefully that detail could be addressed in a patch.

For both games I like how I'm able to switch between the old and new sounds and music. The remastered models, animations, and textures are well done and being able to switch between the old and new school graphics with the push of a button offers a welcome change of pace if desired.

[u]""When you kill one, it is a tragedy. When you kill ten million, it is a statistic.""[/u]

Welcome Back Commander!!! My gaming childhood remastered. 

Seeing that install and the Westwood logo, ahhh man. You can really tell the love that was put into this remaster by all involved.

I haven't been this hyped for a new release in a LONG time.

I have adored the original Westwood titles since my childhood and this is one of the earliest games I remember loving aside from maybe Tie Fighter back in 1995. I still have the original C&C Gold and RA95 installed right now as I always pop on to play.

I had no real hope that there would ever be a good C&C release again

I could go on an EA rant here but I will stay on topic of Westwood (RIP all you other fallen companies) 

After the absorption of Westwood into EA and release of Red Alert 2 and Tiberium Sun Command and Conquer to me was never the same again. I will admit under EA I did enjoy Generals but other than that everything else has kind of been poor, lets be honest.

After EA announced C&C Rivals and dragged the C&C name even deeper through the mud, I had all but accepted that EA had finally milked and murdered another legendary brand.

When the rumblings of a remaster started I was very sceptical, I mean it's EA we have the right to be sceptical.

Then we hear that Petroglyph and some of the original Westwood guys were brought on board to help (EA basically saying we messed up, please help us) was a fantastic revelation. 

Then it just got better with player moderators being called on to guide what the community wanted led by “Jimtern”. Then Frank Klepacki remasters his legendary music and brings in the Tiberium Sons as well. 

Then the ultimate icing on the cake and something that gave me a glimmer of respect for one of the most loathed game companies of our era. NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, NO INGAME PURCHASES, NO DLC, WORKSHOP SUPPORT, STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS, MASSES OF BONUS CONTENT, NOT ORIGIN EXCLUSIVE! I was shocked to say the least, apparently they have realised if they listen to the fans they may get a positive response.

We can only hope this comes out as promised and does well as if it does, the chances of a Red Alert 2 and Tiberium Sun remaster seem like a realistic prospect.

Both Games have been remastered to run in 4K with a legacy switch in solo mode so you can see the upgrade by switching between graphic styles in real time. Every unit and structure has been remodelled and all of the pictures in the sidebar build panel have been remade.

Quality of life improvements like using the classic left click move option or changing it to a more modern left click, select right click move. You can even keep the game classic by not having unit queuing as they have now added the option to unit queue like many modern RTS.


The music has been remastered and now has a customisable jukebox including lost tracks from the mighty Frank Klepacki and new stuff from his band the Tiberium Sons \m/ METAL \m/.

Fantastic bonus gallery, showing behind the scenes and how to game was made which is really cool.

All of the original things are still here like Q moving and all the hotkeys. They have somehow kept nostalgic while putting on a modern sheen. Skirmish has been added to C&C which is a nice touch and the Map editor is back.

I think it is fantastic they decided not to make this Origin exclusive and split the community I personally would not of bought it if it was exclusive. Achievements for me is a fantastic addition as I love to hunt achievements and the addition of the workshop is also a fantastic move. With all the mods that can be done to this game is definitely an exciting prospect

Kudos EA, more like this please! Listening to the fans might just pay of eh?

The maps are also unbalanced where you run out of ore/tiberium too quickly. 

Also open-sourced, I played Open Red Alert in 2014 where the developers and contributors worked on balancing out the gameplay, so that's my basis for comparison. OpenRA is a much more modern and playable game because it builds on the strengths of the original while tweaking the weaknesses. OpenRA multiplayer maps and vastly more intelligent AI make the game challenging and worth playing. 

This Remastered version seems to have spent a ton of time on cosmetics like maps and campaigns but little time modifying unit movement pathing and balancing Allied/Soviet troops to be more equitable. I gave it an afternoon for nostalgia sake and to appreciate the graphics. I will likely uninstall and not play again though.

I hesitated most of the release day because it wasn't listed as Windows 7 compatible and I've not upgraded my Steam PC to Windows 10 yet for fear of breaking some of my games. I finally decided to give it a chance since I know I'll upgrade sometime. 

So far the Command & Conquer one is working great for me on Windows 7. The only issue so far is that I have to run it in Full-Screen Borderless Window mode or I get a black screen on exiting the game that requires a reboot. It looks exactly the same to me as Full-Screen Non-Windowed mode, so I'm happy.

I started playing these games when they first came out. I discovered a demo of C&C on a disc included in a gaming magazine and was immediately hooked. I showed it to my friend and we soon had both purchased the full game. That was the beginning of many battles held across a dial up modem connection between our computers. We would continue to play over the years, buying each new version and expansion pack as soon as they came out.

Sadly my friend passed away last summer and didn't get to see the amazing work that has gone into this. I know he would have loved it though.

FestiveJelly quoted the following things as positives.   I agree with the. 
+ Nostalgia, it made me feel like I was pre teen again.
+ The art style. I think the new graphics are actually pretty neat and fit in with the overall aesthetic.
+ Music, need I say more?


He also ranked things he didnt like as: 
1 Ai feels janky at the best of times. Often your units will just sit there getting shot at, even though they are in range and will not react.
2 Ai seemingly ignoring orders. Sometimes you'll tell units to attack and they will follow for a short while then its like they forget what they are doing.
3 No modern gameplay improvements such as rally points, attack move, patrol.
4 Multiplayer is essentially unusable right now

I also agree with the 1,2,3 but i havent tried 4
Re 1.  I think the algorithms were not updated from the original game.  I remember hating that about the originals.  
Re 2.  I don't remember this from the original game.  I wonder if something is broken in the AI or the sound effect for saying unable to comply is not working.  I think when it ignores you its because there is a reason it can't but its not telling you that. 
Re: 3.  Its a polish of the original game introducing modern game play improvements would debalance the game.  Possibly as an option in the settings instead ?  


I think i would qualify the recommendation for this game.  If you played the original and loved it buy this one.  If you never played the original I don't think you will have the nostalgia to put up with the old game play mechanics.   

Personally I loved this recreation of the game.   Even with the sharp edges.

one major thing that i enjoy apart from 4K texture is the ease of use, in the original game, production cannot be queued and gameplay speed is fixed so it's too slow and cumbersome to proceed just only 1 mission. In the remastered however these problem is no more. Also love to see Frank came back to make remastered soundtrack for us too <3 
One thing that kinda have a mixed taste for me is the Upscaled Cutscene's resolution, sure some Cutscene looks damn great when upscaled but when it fails it failed so hard that i would prefer the old resolution or need to be remake for that specific cutscene, however since this is the first remastered i hope  to see this experience and improvement carry on to the next remastered.

Compared to the modern RTS game, or really most any modern game of any genre, this is horrible.  The positive reviews must be people re-living their glory days, it must make them have a lot more fun than it injects into my experience.  My experience in playing this game for 21 minutes was 0 fun.

I do recommend you try it out.  Steam has their 2 hour window for a reason.  It is possible that a game fueled on good memories may inject more fun into your experience.  To each their own.

Stuff like that. The music remaster is phenomenal, and really makes the game more enjoyable. One of my other complaints is mission balance. In GDI Mission 5, you used to be able to build stuff, they removed that, and it makes the mission a bit harder. I never felt that mission was easy, so I don't really understand the change, especially cause you already can't make tanks. Hopefully more missions in the future aren't like this.

EDIT: A few more critiques. I realize the game is trying to stay true to the original, but I definitely feel a few more modern features should be included, such as move and shoot, or patrols. Secondly, the AI is as abysmal as I remember, and I wish it was improved. Sometimes I give orders and the AI forgets about it half-way through or the harvester goes to the farther Tiberian farm instead of the closer one, even entering enemy territory for it.

13,70415617,english,"This game is a dream come true for many, including myself. I admittedly didn't grow up playing Tiberian Dawn or Red Alert 1 but honestly, given how long it's been since we've had [i] anything [/i] related to C&C on PC, this was good enough for me, especially if it's success possibly means Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2, even Generals and/or future C&C games down the line. 

If you've played the newer games and never played TD or RA1, don't be alarmed. This game is essentially the exact same core gameplay, just with all the ""fat"" trimmed out and some signs of age here and there. These are very simple RTS's compared to their successors and other games of the era like StarCraft. Build your base, gather your sole resource which is of course, Tiberium or Ore, and wipe your enemy off the map. For those familiar with the games of old, there are several quality of life changes to make gameplay a lot more fluid and appealing to newcomers, but nothing game breaking.  You can now queue up units in production like the newer games which makes building up armies much less tedious. Also, the addition of being able to map hotkeys for commands and some additional ones like selecting all units across the map and whatnot. Even little things like excluding harvesters when box selecting units is a nice touch. I do wish they added the ability to rally point structures, but that's probably not a big deal. More on that later.

So onto the actual remaster. A this is the third major RTS of old as far as I know to receive a remaster, the other two being StarCraft and Warcraft III. Starcraft's remaster was excellent and was essentially a direct upgrade to the game, without introducing anything that ruined the ages old experience. I'd say what EA and Petroglyph did with TD and RA1 is on par, if not better in some ways. They took an extremely dated game, re-did the graphics from ground up to make it more appealing on modern screens, re-did the audio, all without changing things that made the original game great. They also actively developed this game based on fan input, which given how people reacted to C&C Rivals, I'd say was a very important move, and one that's paid off. It's largely how we've got the various quality of life changes, the Jukebox and all the remastered songs by Frank Klepacki, TD's skirmish mode, and the workshop, among many other things. The weakest thing about this remaster I'd say is the AI upscaled cutscenes. They still don't look great, but given how old they are and how little can actually be done to improve them, it's fine.

Oh yeah, the workshop. Chances are now that this exists, if any requested changes aren't handled by the devs, I'm sure someone will cook something right up, like rally points as I mentioned earlier. Maybe even a Dune 2000 port. Who knows.

Anyways, if you were a fan of Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert 1, you absolutely should buy this. Hell, if you're just a C&C fan anxiously waiting for remasters of the newer games, or a totally new game to come along, you absolutely should buy this. The games themselves are great and the remastering is very well done but what this could mean for the future of Command & Conquer is worth every penny in my opinion.

Enemy AI despite being in range will often just not attack my units until provoked, including the enemy turrets. My own units are insanely inconsistent in their behavior, since grenades cause friendly fire my infantry will often attack units and structures by getting right up against it before attack and then prompty get killed by my own units with ease.

It's all extremely mild but it makes already somewhat dated and simplistic gameplay frustrating. The graphics and sound have been updated faithfully and all looks and sounds nice but the individual unit animations are very sped up and it looks distracting.

It doesn't have QOL improvements to the RTS genre like rally points, attack move and all the jazz.

It's worth playing even for $20 if you're interested in the story/lore, Otherwise they could have done better with the AI, or anything for that matter.

The only large issue currently is the fact that online matches are incredibly difficult to get into, usually once you jump into a lobby you are usually booted from said lobby about 1/3 of the time, then if you're not booted there is somebody having issues with readying up, then if everybody is ready sometimes you'll get frozen on the loading screen while you can hear the game going on in the background, at this point if you where one of the lucky ones who managed to load in you're going to be fighting at least 1-2 bots depending on how many people are in the game and how many lagged out.

Oh my EA, how you surprise me. Not only did you release an amazing 4K upgrade for a mere $20, but you also managed to outdo OpenRA in several key areas. That being said, there are a few flaws, but first:

THE GOOD:
* Much needed upgrades to graphics. The game looks fabulous at 4K. Even if you aren't gaming at 4K, the visual improvements will be most welcome.
* EA open-sourced the core of the game. Kudos to them for that. I have turned my back on EA for years, but their actions as of late have slowly been getting me to buy from them again.
* That price. For $20 you get all the original C&C games and expansions.
* The zoom feature is a welcome addition.
* Downloading user made maps is easy.

THE BAD: 
* Sound quality in FMV sequences appears to be low quality.
* The AI doesn't know how to build air/ships in skirmish mode.
* I have yet to figure out how to use the map editor, and I am a developer.
* No Linux release, though I'm sure OpenRA will eventually incorporate these changes.
* No separate soundtrack for downloading.
* The jukebox functionality is a bit clunky.
* Skirmish and multiplayer could use more rule customization.

THE UGLY:
The AI in skirmish is insanely easy, even on hard mode. It does not know how to build air or naval units.

- Doing this for the community and making room for mods, THANK YOU !

Verdict:
If you didn't play the originals, measure the game against those. Cause these games come from a time, with 100% content/purpose/passion and 10% graphics. We currently have the best graphics in new games, and zero purpose. So, having this overhauled, brings me back to a time, where games had content, not just an expensive 4k wrapping ;-)

However, you are getting two games that were released in the mid 90s, and they play exactly as they did back then. The objectives can be obtuse, the units aren't that amazingly balanced and aren't responsive in the least, and there are a fair few things in the game that make you cry out ""Oh come on!"". 

The winning strategy is to cheese the daft AI in any way possible, because the at least in the Tiberian campaigns the AI gets a massive multiplier to its credits income, so it can churn out almost infinite units compared to the meager army you are able to muster. Be prepared to spend up to several hours in certain missions, slowly claiming the map and blocking the AI with sandbags, finding the cheesiest spots to deploy your artillery and blocking the enemy building spots.

It's certainly the game I grew up with and nostalgia is pretty much the selling point here. Get it if you are interested in experiencing two of the genre-defining games, and the first games in the venerable franchise. Note that you must have a tolerance for nonsense and shenanigans.

That said, This remake, though underwhelming, is a step in the right direction in bringing back an old-but-good game franchise that REALLY needs to gain more popularity. While there are many free Fan-Recreations out there on the web, an official remastered edition with HD graphics, building and unit sprites as well as a remastered and brand new version of the game's music is by far one of the greatest things to happen to my nostalgia since the Brutal Doom Mod. 

The game allows you to utilize both legacy and modern format RTS controls as well as freely switch between legacy and remastered graphics, sound track and unit speech and sound effects. the building and unit tabs have been updated to a more modern and easy to navigate menu similar to Red Alert 2 (alternatively Red Alert 3 or Tiberium wars) and in Red Alert, when selecting your Country/Faction for multiplayer or skirmish you can get a brief description to which country has what specific trait (i.e. Germany has more firepower, England has stronger Armor, Russia build costs are cheaper, etc.) which was something the original game lacked and something i didn't realize the original game had until much, MUCH later in my life. Overall the massive overhaul from the classic game works well while still maintaining that old classic gameplay.

Here's where i highlight the one glowing issue I've been having with the game thus far and i'm leaving comments open for anyone to help out with this issue if that have any ideas on how to help resolve the issue. 
The one key problem i have with this game right now is that, for some reason, when i start a new mission, attack an AI army/base or defend my base from an incoming assault, the game's frame-rate will suddenly tank below 10 fps. I don't know if this is a processing issue, a graphics issue, or something else, but I've tried adjusting all of my graphics options and it still seems to occur no matter what settings i use. I've even tried turning on and off v-sync to see if that would help but nothing seems to work, and that's a little upsetting considering it's a 2D game. Until this issue is fixed i can't fully recommend buying this game to everyone until this issue is patched or something. Once they do i'll gladly change my recommendation to ""yes"".

The game is the original game but enhanced. But that's it and I guess that's all it's supposed to be. But all the factions have around 6 units and 8 buildings. It's just not complex enough compared to modern games. I didn't expect that though, but I did expect to feel more entertained by it. To me it felt like playing an advanced PONG arcade machine. 

Pick it up if you're a die hard C&C fan and have some friends who want to take a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Don't pick it up if you're wanting a complex multi-way method of winning and playing. it's literally build 4 things and spam the spawn unit button unit you win.

Again, it's literally just a remaster and that's great that's what it's supposed to be. But it's just not fun compared to newer RTS games, especially compared to more recent C&C titles.

I won't say that this is a bad game, but there is little room for diverse metas (GDI is still hot garbage) and the mechanics of the game feel very dated. Just one example is that the map is divided into an invisible grid, and units cannot stop in between squares. This means that if a unit is moving, and you give the stop command, it will still take a few moments to stop, because it [i] must [/i] be inside of one square. It's this like this that don't make the game bad, it just makes it feel clunky by today's standard.

With just pressing a button (Space) you can change the way the game looks, from the modern graphics to back to 1995.
Gameplay is the same as the original, so build base gather money build units destroy enemy base, sometimes you will only get set amount of units and thats all. You can choose missions.

For 20 Euros you are in reality get 2 games. Command & Conquer , and Red Alert. So in the end a single game is only 10 Euros, so not that expensive.

For new players the game might be dated, well they need to accept it, or don't buy it then.

The new graphics and updated visuals next to better cutscrene quality is something that was really needed, but I noticed, that the ingame cutscreens looked a bit really not HD.

The side bar splits vehicles, infintry, buildings just like the PSX game but sadly not with the 4th tab for defensive structures.

And though I have these titles on disc and hardware readily available to play it on just as I did in the late 90's, this is infinitely better. But the main reasons I purchased this bundle is two-fold; No reliability on Origin and hopefully encouraging a remaster of my all time favorite title Red Alert 2.
EA, if you are listening, I appreciate not having to also run Origin just to play this single player campaign from my Steam catalog. You will see more of my money if this trend continues. And please bring us Red Alert 2 in HD on Windows 10.
I plan on putting many hours into Red Alert and look forward to the day I can stop using my XP machines to play my back catalog of EA owned titles. 


(to be clear, I still play Red Alert 2 every week on my Dell B120 laptop because I love the game so much. And I own 3 copies on disc just in case, and have it installed on 2 other XP machines.)

The game looks much better it is true, and the music is amazing Klepacki with his guys did a very good job.  But that's about it.

The units are just as stupid as you remember: 

A brige will without exception lead to 2 harvesters blocking each other.
Sandbags still are the perfect defense and offense.
Enemy units will still forever target the unit that firsted attacked it. A mammoth tank will chase behind an attack bike that you've send to the other side of the map, while your small tanks slowly wither it down.

That said, there are some changes to the AI, especially how enemy airstrikes work. They used to target units at the top of the map, now they seem to target by value. 
This make some missions stupidly hard, especially those where you start without a base but 2 groups of units at different sides of the map. Normally you were able to sacrifice 1 soldier to keep your groups safe, now you can expect to lose either your commando or your artillery tanks.

Its been hugely enjoyable, and to my mind is exactly what was promised - taking the old game and sprucing it up and adding a few QoL improvements.

I am experiencing no bugs - and my PC is 10 years old!

Yes the path finding is wonky still - but that is part of the charm and something it was confirmed was going to be left as is.
Yes you can still kinda game the AI  - trap their harvesters and the AI gives up, destroy their harvesters and all the AI units come attack rather than defend their base. 

The briefing videos so far have been good. The full CGI videos such as the Orca in the canyon etc - they in all fairness look worse - as these were just CGI rather than actors I had hoped they would replaced or redone - not ai upscaled.

Beyond all of that the game plays just as I remember, and having just as much fun as I did 25 years ago.

They gave me the courage to step away from the consoles and faith that PC would eventually have competitive gaming. With that being said I've now played 6 hours and I will edit my review.

First off the sound track is amazing. The terrain, buildings, and units all look much better. You can hit the space bar at any point to remind you. However, harvesters look like they are hovering above the ground and it's distracting.

Second is the remastered portion. If they updated the videos in some fashion it didn't help. Maybe they should have just redone them as cartoons because it immediately drops the ball of being remastered. You run into this enough during the game that you may possibly hit space bar and leave it on the old version forgetting to click it back.

Finally, the gameplay itself. They did update controls so I can right click to move or attack which is nice. They did not add way points though. I think it would have been ok to update some of these aspects so that the game could be played again competitively. Unfortunately, there was not enough done to bring this up to that level. It will be a niche thing somewhat like Renegade Ops. They are great games but they are not going to gain enough attention.

I keep my fingers crossed that Tiberian Sun will get a remake, and possibly dare I say it Generals. Those are the two I really want to see. This isn't a hail Mary pass to bring C&C back to competitive levels. It is however 100% worth 20 bucks to experience it if you are an old school gamer.

When it comes to the presentation this is pretty much a flawless experience apart from the low resolution FMV cutscenes (and that situation won't improve because the higher resolution source video is lost to time now). The art assets look excellent and the remastered and expanded soundtrack sounds just as chunky as it should.

In terms of gameplay though the remaster is a bit of a mixed bag mostly because Tiberian Dawn can really show its age even when compared to the first Red Alert. Of course Red Alert was always the main offerring here so TD being TD shouldn't surprise anyone who's familiar with the franchise but if you're a new player you might have different expectations. Long story short RA is a significantly better game than TD so RA should be your main focus here.

There are a few other issues but only one of them is truly significant: I was very excited for the introduction of a higher difficulty setting but sadly it's balanced so badly that it makes a few missions (especially the missions where you don't have a base) borderline unplayable. On top of this hard mode is just not fun because the AI receives a boost to its damage, its HP and its resources so some units become ridiculously tough, a few grenadiers can kill half your army if you're not careful. TLDR: hard is broken so steer clear of it for now and hope for a fix.

The game is great, looks good, you can swap between old and new with the space button. (I always play with remastered). You can also scroll with your mousewheel, to change the view of how you look at the map. Either pretty close, medium or far away.

If you are here to check for annoying things that might ruin the game a bit here are three things:

-Difficulty automaticly changes if you lose too many times. I don't like to give up, and I don't like that the game changes difficulty without me knowing it. I play on Hard and it changes to Medium if I lose one time.

-The queueing more units thing is something that has to work, but sometimes it reverts back to how the old C&C was, and it doesn't work. I solved this problem by going into OPTIONS and reclicking the modern unit building, and it worked again.

-When you're at the map to choose a level, there is no way going back at that point, to regret your choice of map. However...if you go into the Campaign menu, you will be able to not only do those missions you had to skip (because of choices), but you will also be able to read the information regarding said mission.

Multiplayer doesn't work. It only lets you click host sometimes, and then in trying to set up the lobby it will often drop randomly.

Overall, it isnt.
First of all, the AI cheats and seems to have infinite money to buy harvesters in the campaign. I hate that in any game, and here as well. Make your AI smart enough to avoid having to cheat, or do something else besides make games.
There are loads of annoyances present here. If you get your mouse too close to the border of the screen, you can't drag-select, units often don't register your clicks. They will do the voice-response but just not move.

Are there more features they could've put into the game to modernize them, absolutely. But, then it wouldn't be the old C&C experience.

For what it is, a graphical/audio overhaul and [i]SLIGHT[/i] modernization it's great. The AI is still jank, there's still a lot of stupid mundane things like wall placement, the range at which you can build out your base from other buildings etc. But, what seems to go completely missed by the negative reviews is that all of these ""issues"" are what determine how the game is balanced. Tweaking things to make stuff (like walls) take less time to place means getting your defences up faster than the AI can react, same goes for building range placement.

Taking all this into account they wouldn't have had to just tweak the AI, or the game balance. They would have had to basically make a brand new game from scratch. People giving this game a negative review came in expecting a modernized RTS with a C&C skin slapped on it, not a C&C game slightly modernized.

I cannot comment on MP as I have yet to dive in (still getting my RTS legs back) but, the modern tweaks they [i]have[/i] made to the game are great. Unit queuing, right click to attack, health bars being at damaged/full hp instead of only when selected, same with silo/refinery capacity being visible all the time really help some of the [i]really[/i] outdated feelings without breaking the original feel of the game.

If you want more modernization, wait for mods. If you want them in MP, wait for RA2 remaster I guess. I will say they should have an opt in option for mods in MP though.

All in all, great effort and kudos should be given to EA for finally doing something good instead of complaining that the game isn't perfect.

I also can't get units to stay in place and fire - maybe that innovation hadn't come yet, as this was the seminal RTS.

On the positive, it's the old game. They didn't rebalance, didn't add boss fights and dumb garbage like that, didn't add 20 new units and structures. I'm happy about all that. It also works on your modern machine, installs without a problem, and you don't have to manage several disks to do it.

On the negative, they said they'd bring some modern elements, but the most modern elements they brought were from roughly Red Alert 2 era (such as queuing up units.) I'm happy that they didn't change go nuts with trying to update things; but my GOD they could've done a few minor gameplay tweaks to make life nicer.

Things like:
 * Having your units stop when you tell them to stop. 
 * Having your troops stop and attack when you tell them to stop and attack; rather than finish moving to wherever and finally attack. These two are by far the most obnoxious things that make it feel clunky.
 * Deselecting units outside of a group when you press a group-select command. Also adds to the clunk.
 * Fixing the old pathing. Even a brute force approach would be fine with modern systems. Clunk.
 * Being able to tell troops to join a block without having to use the fiddly move back-and-forth stuff.
 * More reliable shoot-n-move. The game supports tanks and buggies shooting and moving; but only in a janky, somewhat random fashion.
 * I think they may have given a little bit of a buff on the AI's brain, but can't be much.

68,70383356,english,"I bought the game with friends to play online, and there are some issues right now with that. These are mine experiences, luckily not everyone has issues.

- you cannot password protect a multiplayer game, thus anyone can join
- almost impossible to find your friends game to join, sometime the list jumps from a to z.
- random times unable to join a session, only a reboot of the game seems too fixed that for a while
- lots of game freezes where it is impossible to interact with your units. 
- random crashes
- menu's not showing up
- frame drops, lots of frame drops.
- sometime unable to move the screen
- unable to finish mission because of a stuck npc that i cannot destroy. (Allies mission 2, a dog will not die)


They should have looked more closely at OpenRA at functionality to include in a modern RPG. Things like setting waypoints from you factory, waypoints for your units to follow. Selecting all units of a certain type (e.g. light tanks) with one key. Allow for queueing buildings and not only units.

The video quality is not what i expected, i think that was overhyped. The upgraded game graphics are amazing, i love that.

Yes it brings back the old feeling of RA, but so does OpenRA which frankly is just way better then this game when you just want to play with your friends. All you are missing is the improved graphics.

Single player will probably be fine, multiplayer is just garbage at this point. Let's hope they will fix this.

The HD audio for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is fantastic, as are the bonus tracks and songs done by the Tiberium Sons.  The revamped sound effects are fantastic, and the fact they went through so much effort to recreate them authentically is -awesome-.  Graphics-wise, they really brought the sprites alive...they look like cleaner, high-rez and more detailed versions of the originals, which is exactly what old fans of the game like myself wanted to see.  All the old maps for multiplayer/skirmishes are presented, including old favorites that everyone loved back in the day, like Tiberium Garden and A Path Beyond (although now just called Path Beyond).

The bad:

The videos for between missions aren't so hot...they cleaned them up as best as they could, but it's really a shame they couldn't find the original footage.  You CAN see some more detail, and the new refresh rate is great...but it's not hard to tell they hit a wall with what they could do.  Not their fault, so not really a detraction.

Red Alert doesn't seem to have gotten the same level of love as Tiberium Dawn.  There are some balance issues, like completely running out of money in A Path Beyond...as in the whole map being depleted of ore in really short order, something that didn't happen in the original version...and annoying bugs, like cruiser shells suddenly not doing their full damage, or explosion animations not happening.

Verdict:

There are a couple of problems, one that's beyond their capability to fix unless the original footage somehow shows up, but they're relatively minor compared to the overall package.  The revamped music and sound effects are beyond my most wild dreams in terms of quality, the gameplay is solidly classic, and the enhanced graphics (plus being able to revert to the old graphics if you want to) are extremely well done.  Plus, the initial startup 'setup' screens really bring in that nostalgia from the 90's, when in a lot of cases even setup programs were interesting to watch.  It's not hard to tell that they worked hard to faithfully reproduce the classic gameplay, and they DID NOT SCREW IT UP.

Even the bugs they do have don't super detract from the gameplay...although it will be nice when they're fixed.

EA has had a crap reputation for a long, long time now...with predatory practices, and a lot of us were concerned that they would maul this like Blizzard did to WC3.  But they didn't, they stayed true to their word, and they even included the ORIGINAL WESTWOOD STARTUP LOGO ffs.  So my hats off to you EA, keep this up and you'll have a solid supporter in me.  Well done, EA, well done.

Buy this game.  It's not only a refreshing change from the RTS's of today, for those in the younger crowd, but it's a major nostalgia kick for those of us who grew up with the originals.",1591464135,1591464135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197966900591,229,16,961,0,230,1599592987

29,70397292,english,"While initially skeptical do to EA's involvement with the project, and their track record with the C&C franchise I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with the remastered. It is like playing the original command and conquers for the first time all over again.

I'll start with issues I have or have run into.

- as of  6/5/2020 It seems that many people (my self included) have run into a performance issue where the game stutters horrendously particularly when installed on non solid state drives. Installation on a solid state drive seems to fix the issue, but I'm sure this is an optimization issue that can be patched out.

- as of 6/5/2020 there is a recurring glitch where the game outright crashes when units pick up crates that kill the unit.

- The game lacks the ability to set rally points for production structures, while not game breaking can be jarring from the perspective of later RTS titles.

- While multiplayer works well, there is no option to make pass worded lobbies.

Easily the positives outweigh the negatives however

- The game looks fantastic, all the classic buildings and units have high definition sprites and Lemon sky outdid themselves here. Even the terrain is highly detailed. The option to switch between new graphics and old works well, though only in single player matches.

- The soundtrack is fantastic, Frank Klepacki and his band went above and beyond recreating and remixing all of the classic C&C tracks. The audio quality is phenomenal and the three hours worth of music the game comes packaged with is by its self worth the game's value. A customisable in game jukebox lets you select the track list that plays during your games, this ranging from the original tracks, to Frank's reworks, along with remixes and bonus tracks from Frank and the Tiberian Sons.

- There are many quality of life changes to make the game play more like a modern RTS, production queuing (something we take for granted with new rts games) has been implemented though as mentioned previously there is no production building rally point setting. There are a number of options for configuring how the game controls if you want to use the modern left click select, right click order set up of newer RTS games or the original left click system. The ability to zoom in and out has been added, while not necessary in an older RTS with small maps like this, it is a nice feature and lets you look at the high def sprites more closely. 

- the original FMVs used for cut scenes are really well upscaled, and the grainy 80's/90's television aesthetic works well given the context of the games. 

Concluding thoughts: If you have never played the original command and conquer games, this is the version to play. It is as faithful to the originals as one can get, while improving on almost every aspect of the game.

- They did not fix the awful pathfinding system, often my units get stuck on terrain, try to ""find their way around"" and just run into defenses and other units, getting themselves killed for no reason. This makes it so that excessive micro-management of your units is required;
- Sometimes units will simply not obey your commands, requiring multiple clicks (tested with different hardware, happens all the same);
- Some modern RTS ""quality of life"" stuff is missing, such as, attack-move (present in OpenRA), formations, pausing;

POSITIVE
- New graphics are amazing;
- The jukebox is a pretty good tool for customizing your gameplay experience.

I'm going to go off topic here. Master Chief Collection is a technological marvel. They way you can switch back and forth between graphics, outstanding. I play like playing the original, because nostalgia. 

This has the same option, but, the improvements aren't amazing, or staggering. I kind of wish there was a 3rd graphical improvement option that made it just amazing. Maybe mods.

Game is amazing for nostalgia, gameplay is horrible. I want this to succeed because I want them to do TibSun and RA2 so bad.

though the original was fun and all, the game wasn't perfect back then and it seems like they didn't fix some of these annoyances. 
the pathing of units is very wonky. not always taking the fastest path. sometimes not even going to the right direction. sometimes units walk way further than they have to before attacking. 
I get they wanted to keep the game feel like the original, but things like this they should have looked at. 
Grenadiers have a chance to instakill units and the AI loves using them. early game you don't have a good way to deal with them and it gets quite frustrating having to deal with them.

RA - Mini Map has major issues, I noticed it zoomed in randomly (This may be a mechanic but idk it hurt me in a couple games) and there where times I could see the entire map and the Minimap would show all black, At Random.
RA - Pathfinding is worse then SC1 Dragoons in some cases, I found my Harvesters going to far far locations to gather ore- getting themselves killed the the process.

No real 21:9 support. Black bars in game.

Command & Conquer Remastered was a game I was quite skeptical of when I heard it was happening. C&C was the first game I picked up when I was 7 years old with my birthday money and played it for years. Game was out for less than a day and I put 10 hours into it, so that's something for me. I see myself hitting a lot of hours in this game.

The Good:
+ True to the game remaster
+ Graphics swap is flawless!
+ Remastered audio sounds fantastic, though its hard for me to identify the new sounds because the classic sounds are burned into my head
+ Modern controls
+ Always on health bars
+ Easy access custom maps

The Neutral:
> Online requires the updated graphics and you can't swap to classic (I prefer classic, friend prefers current)
> New graphics makes it feel like I'm playing a mobile game
> The easy AI feels harder than the normal AI

The Bad:
- Online stuttering
- No way points
- Need a lot more maps for the original

Wishlist:
* More maps for the original
* Ping system for multiplayer
* Online classic graphics
* Way points
* Attack move or at least slightly smarter units while idling

If you're on the fence about buying the game, I recommend giving it a shot. If you never played the either game, I still recommend it, but be aware that it plays like an older game.

Blast from the past on a fantastic pair of games. Runs great with quite a few additional modern day features to help bring it up a bit.

My one complaint is how stupid the AI can be sometimes. This is very very likely how they were initially programmed which was kept in, but I never remembered it being that bad. Units won't auto attack an enemy unless they are right on top of them practically. Units also get stuck very easily which can block resource queues, or make the unit take a crazy long path around where you were initially trying to get an army to go.

I started this remaster today and during the opening intro (EVA installation) I actually had tears of joy in my eyes and goosebumps all over.

The better gfx, UI, options, content, multiplay and all, just makes it worth so much more.

Poor responsiveness and graphics lag were the least of my concerns, but still occurred (despite my gaming rig being able to run high end games on the highest graphics settings). Changing between old and new graphics was fun for about 2 minutes but very much a gimmick.

All of the old issues from RA and C&C are present, harvesters stop harvesting when patches run out despite ore/tiberium regrowth being switched on. resource veins run out far too quickly and the AI stop functioning when resources run out, despite regrowth being enabled. Very few quality of life improvements, unless I'm mistaken no attack moving etc.

As a long time fan of the series, I can say I had very high hopes and was severly let down by this. I've never left a review before for any game, but I feel I have to warn people as this is the worst remake I've ever seen (and that's a very low bench mark sadly).",1591458529,1591458529,False,22,15,0.403951138257980347,0,True,False,False,76561198006536369,167,2,113,0,113,1591457422

First things first I am not gonna sugar coat it, both games AI and path finding are very old and outdated and there several ways to cheese the AI and make the missions stupidly easy, but at other times the AI makes things stupidly hard... (GDI 8 B I am looking at you)

This is not a remake, this is the original games with improved graphics, audio, and some quality of life improvements among other things but core game play is still the old 90's version which I say is honestly for the best, I have played mods and the unofficial patch which try to either balance things or add too much and it no longer feels like the how the games were supposed to be. (DTA makes no sense why RA factions are on par with their TD counter parts despite TD happens at the same time as RA2)

Anyway enough ranting, the graphics first off are amazing and clearly express how everything was meant to look back in the day that we used to fill in with our imagination and honestly to me that makes a huge difference but where this remaster really shines is the audio; so many good tracks of music remastered and the ingame audio no longer jars your ears I had a lot of fun making an audio mix I liked for both games.

Honestly if you like the challenge of older games then this is up your alley and the both audio and graphics make it very playable on modern systems but as I said before this is the core game so if you were expecting something different or more then you will be disappointed...

Pros
-Music remastered by the legendary Frank Klepacki
-Remastered graphics fit the game decently
-Nostalgia

Cons
-AI is the exact same as it was when it came out. I just don't see why they couldn't fix the most pain in the ass thing about playing these games.
-No quality of life improvements with the exception of unit queues
-Pathfinding is still an absolute nightmare
-Units will literally sit there and be shot at without blinking an eye

EA is a shitbag company, though I have much respect for the C&C franchise, I really don't know if them getting back into C&C is a good thing or not. If they made improvements to the quality of life and AI of the game I would recommend it, but this just expands upon EA's marketing strategy of making everything look pretty without fixing the real issues of games they try to push.

Combat units regularly ignore the target you give them and fire at something else.
Gathering vehicules don't go at the nearest resources spot. They will sometimes prefer drive trough the ennemy base to go a another spot even if you manually target something else.

This remaster of Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is absolutely golden!
I played all the originals when they first came out, way back in the forgotten mists of history, and this remake is just about perfect! No nonsense, no twisting or warping the games to force in egregious monetization, just a professionally created remake of the original games.

I am honestly stunned that EA managed to do this without making a dog's ear out of it!
And that they are releasing the source code into open source for these two games just adds to the confusion!
There are tweaks here and there to the loading sequence that are slightly different, but they have been made to make the alterations mesh with today's systems, and it fits so, so well!
I had to laugh at some of them.

The whole experience has brought on a warm and comfortable feeling playing this wonderful remaster, if only this was the case with all remasters.

This is pure gold though, if you loved the originals way back when, then you will love this.
They have made the transition to higher resolutions and quality so much better than I was expecting, and it's honestly just amazing the improvements that have been made!

They have even included the ol' swap button so that you can change back and forth seamlessly between the original graphics and the news designs, without even a stutter in frame-rate as you do so.
I cannot praise this remake highly enough, both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are as near to perfect as possible.

Everything about this has been remade.
The music has been recreated by the awesome Frank Klepacki for the remake, and the new tracks are great, bringing all the old music forwards with subtle changes here and there. And if you prefer the original music, that is also available to use as well!

All the original levels are included too, not just the main campaigns, but the Console specific levels and the Secret Levels from the originals.
You can go back and replay any level already completed from the menu, without having to replay the campaign from the beginning, which includes the alternate branch missions that you didn't take previously.

I honestly cannot think of a single thing that they could have done to make this compilation better than it is!

EA did somthing finally completly right!!!! 

Everyone who ever loved Tiberium Dawn or Red Alert or even its expensions including: Ant, Dinosaur, Covert Ops Mission, counterstrike, retaliation and so on, then this game is perfectly fitting for you! This game includes so much more stuff then you could ever ask for, everything is just remastered and changed in a better and cooler way, the sounds who i thought might have been a bad idea, so much more better for the modern time in 2020, the 4k Solution for every Cinematic is just so much more better then it used to be, as you see on my hours, that i really cannot stop playing this game as there is so much todo in it! Maybe you didn't notice it yet, but this game has Achievements now and it is so worth to play the whole Campaigns and their missions again because you unlock so many Bonus Features that you may haven't even seen yet. The best thing which i love the most is the UI changes and the ability to change between CLASSIC and HD/Remastered graphics in singleplayer/Campaign mode in real time which was not a joke at all, mostly i love that they rewrote the AI itself in Tiberium Dawn and gave it more life such as it will respond in chat and give funny messages which somtimes could make you laugh, the whole design of every Single Unit have so much Detail whenever you switch between Classic and Remaster graphics you notice this huge difference between both art styles versions. But overall i love that Westwood Studios was able to work on this game again just like as it should be, since they made it perfect! In Result of this Remaster i give it a 9/10, the only issue i really have, is that normal mods aren't for the multiplayer mode.

(I have written so much already since i can't stop hyping how cool this remaster is, beside from other remastes who failed miserable) - For the Multiplayer i gotta say i would give it a 9/10 since theres still some tiny flaws such as tiny lags if someones connection isn't good and then we would need the ability to create rooms with passwords so we can play in private (not that its bad you have complete control over your lobby aka kicking people from it) beside from that, the UI menu from the lobbys will remind you a bit of Red Alert 2 which is great as you have alot of options to choose from when hosting a lobby, you also can use User Maps which are created by people (not really mods but maps atleast) who can be used and be played on, theres more colors now in each game which i find great they fit pretty well with the current graphic style and makes it more unique.

The cutscenes have been improved a bit, but are FAR from high definition. I saw some youtube videos a while back of the adventure the developers did to try to find higher resolution footage - so I know that the minimal improvement of visual fidelity in cutscenes is not through laziness. They really tried hard to get it. This upscaled version is the best we could hope for in these circumstances.

46,70392717,english,"It's quite difficult to separate the nostalgia, which in and of itself is a positive for the game. 

So far, I have encountered no bugs or glitches, and the two games run quite well. In terms of the graphical remaster, it's very well done without losing the original feel of the games. I found both the initial start-up sequence where the game 'upgrades' and the ability to switch back and forth with space bar between the original and the remaster seemlessly is a really nice touch. The units have a much more crisp feel, for example, you can easily see the driver of light scout jeep in Red Alert. 

The game runs faster than you'll remember. Dogs and soldiers will show up much faster than you'll remember and you have to react quickly. You can slow the game down, but I found the baseline speed increased difficulty and made the games more in line with more recent RTS titles.

The music... well, this is a pure nostalgia trip. It is extremely well done, and I give kudos to Petroglyph and especially Frank Klepacki for it. This will take you back to the mid 90s. Hell March. Demolition. Airstrike. You can listen to any song (and all its variants, including original and remaster) from either game while playing, including making custom playlists to listen to your favorites. Literally, no downside here.

Pathfinding has clearly been upgraded, though you'll still have some times where large armies will split and drive all the way around obstacles if you try to move them as one. The fix here is to utilize the new grouping function to more micromanage armies. Doubleclicking a unit will select all the same type of units. You can now queue multiple units for production. The interface shows you how much time is left on buildings and units with a glance at the UI. 

Really recommend the games for a decent price point of 20 dollars. You get both Tib Dawn, expansions, Red Alert, RA Counterstrike and Aftermath.

48,70392637,english,"This is a great remaster. 

I've played half the NOD campaign so far and it is exactly how I wanted it to be remastered. There's even a great little surprise when you first the original C&C game from the launch screen for the first time. If you played the game in the 90s it will bring back some serious nostalgia. There are some CGI cutscenes that have not been remastered, but they would look really out of place if they were modern cinematic quality.

For people saying it's just a higher resolution: that's factually incorrect, there is added detail on a number of buildings and units that simply bumping the resolution would not achieve. Also there were resolution options in Red Alert when it originally came out and it quite clearly just zoomed the camera out, quite a different result.

I don't like some of the bonus tracks, especially as some are the original tracks but modified. Fortunately you can just turn this off/select which songs you would like directly from the menu without leaving the game through the jukebox.

There's also a casual difficulty setting which I appreciate. I like playing RTS, but I am really really bad at them. It looks like I may be able to complete the campaigns this time around.

我第一次接受命令与征服系列还是从其资料片 red aler但是由各方面原因只能游玩没有音乐，动画只语音的阉割盗版。。。。美苏“热战”背景以及不同的单位深刻的映像。另外呢不同于当时的很多其作品比如横扫千军之类，red alert就单人战役而言呢，跟家讲究对于个体单位的掌控，很多时候电脑的资源无穷尽的，但是你能采集的矿物是有限的，而且电脑会不阴你一把（flank attack)而且电脑的兵种还会微操它控制的掷弹兵简直圣兵天将一般。。。。red alert秉承着当年即时战略游戏的风格，好好把我对于有限资源和单位的使用，运营能使你更加舒服但是不能确保你的胜利，有时候不出巧技单纯和电脑兵力往往是要吃瘪的。
命令与征服本传的话我第一款玩的是泰伯利亚之日。。。。这泰伯俩牙之战这真本传没有涉及过这次有幸可以一玩。接下来谈谈
pro和con:

PRO:
1) 本体和红色警戒都很好地把握住了小部队作战的精髓，比如对于远程的使用，对于打了跑的使用，对于工程师的使用等等，一味平
a必败无疑，充分显示了RTS的乐趣；
2）优秀的动画和音乐，虽然有点老了，但是还是很劲爆，尤其是remaster还加了新的配乐
3）bonus 加了不少幕后花絮很有意思
4）美苏热战和C and C本体的背景都很优秀，且很有现实韵味和讽刺性。虽然冲突世界（world of conflcit）跟家写实，但其一这已经是好多年后的游戏了，其二天马行空也有天马行空的好处
5）画质有了显著提升

CON：
1）关卡难度很大，习惯了星际啊，红色警戒2/3的平A盆友们有可能不习惯。跟家看中对于小股单位的运用。
2）单位AI糟糕，比如莫名其妙的攻击路线，莫名其妙的不反击，不会绕过友军，莫名其妙的寻路。。。。。这些原汁原味的糟粕统统被保留了。。。。。让人想砸电脑（尤其是电脑操作猛如虎的时候）
3）cg动画还是用了原版的，EA你狗日的偷懒！
4）价格吧不算太亲民，不富裕的盆友们或者对系列不是太感兴趣的盆友们可以到打折时买

总体来说命令与征服remaste是一款宝玉的重雕。虽是宝玉但是明显很多东西已经过与硬核，尤其是某些硬核是由于官方的偷懒导致的（所谓原汁原味），这都会给游玩造成苦恼。但是如果你是C and C或是红色警戒的fan或是生于90年代，那么这感觉是最好的。不过90年代的确是电子游戏发展的黄金年代，这些作平不仅是游戏你能从剧情里看到跟多。。。。。。而且remaster还加了些东西，画面和音乐我还是要称赞的，花絮也很贴心。

All in all，一款本体优秀的游戏始终有其价值，怀旧可入，萌新请务必退散。。。。。。

Not much too elaborate on becasue these are the same games we loved back in the day but simply better:

- works flawlessly
- beautiful graphics that respect the original games
- amazing HD audio
- lots of qol changes and options for customization
- working multiplayer that is not powered by game spy or any other third party service
- no microtransactions or any other bs - this is pure game like good old times

Be mindful though: This is the same old game - that means it does not follow modern design phisosophies, for someone who does not know how games used to be, it may be clunky and jarring but can also be a great lesson in history.

89,70391266,english,"I'm rating this positively because yes, this absolutely is the best way to experience these games, no question about it. The new graphics are well done, the multiplayer is fun, the singleplayer missions are as fun as they always were and a bunch of the game is open source so we're sure to get some fun mods and new missions/campaigns out of it... Also the remastered soundtrack is just awesome and it even has ultrawide monitor support.

There are however some severe flaws.. lots of things you'd expect from a remake that you won't get here

- No modern controls like attack move or rally points, I can forgive this, they tried to keep it closer to the original experience, but honestly, that's one of the main problems with this release, they focused far too much on that original experience.

- No notable AI improvements - The AI is pretty much the same as it was back in the 90s, hard AI just changes some unit stats and increases the rate at which the AI updates, this is the big one for me, improving ai is a pretty bare minimum of what I want out of a remaster... but the good news here is that the ai is in the source code and modders can and probably will dramatically improve this with time.

- No multiplayer mods - I can not stress how bad this is, almost every problem here could be solved pretty effectively by the modding community and I'm sure they will be to make the singleplayer even better but none of those improvements will ever apply to multiplayer short of coding a whole new multiplayer getting implemented or you managing to gather a bunch of friends to play lan whenever that hopefully gets released many months from now.

- Bad video upscaling - Yeah there are limits here and some of the video upscaling looks good (most of the gdi missions in tibdawn for example), but there are just as many that turn into a smeared mess that I'd gladly take the old pixelated low res videos over.. It just feels like some retouching needed to be done here still.


So my conclusion?
Well, I've been playing C&C since I was 5 and I regularly went back to these games to replay the singleplayer campaigns every so often anyway so these are easily worth it for me, but that's just me, for you... 

well if you're looking for an amazing multiplayer experience look elsewhere, the multiplayer is fun but I don't expect it to last terribly long without mod support or balance fixes (hopefully we'll get a few of those.. don't know the dev's plans there)

If you're here for nostalgia then yes this is what you want, go for it.

If you've never played a command and conquer game before and want to experience the campaign and figure out why we all like it so much... well yes this is definitely a set of games I'd recommend going back to at some point.. but probably isn't the one I'd point a new player to since these still lack modern controls standard to all rts games for 20ish years... so instead I point you to red alert 2 or tiberian sun, two of the best games in the series that these remasters fail to beat due to lacking control features and likely not having the long term multiplayer that those (especially ra2) have managed to maintain, not to mention how many ra2 mods people still play in multiplayer frequently.

I liked the fact they did redo the side menu though, I am not that much of a purist and appreciate they split into categories because when you have a full tech tree that side bar got badly cluttered so I am happy they didn't hang onto that!

The FMV are upscaled as best as they can be given the source material they managed to find buried in an EA office somewhere which had the tapes but sadly not the best quality but enough not to be too jarring, part of me wishes they did non filmed stuff with more modern looking CGI but then again that might clash with the older looking FMV.

Also Frank K's restoration of the Audio and the new versions are almost worth the purchase of this alone!

But playing these games again bring back so many memories. So for anyone who played them in the past and enjoyed them - buy it.. for the price Red Alert/C&C and the 3 expansions is well worth it.

If you've never played these classic games, for the price it is well worth it. Be warned though, even on normal the campaign missions can be a challenge, so don't feel bad altering the game speed or the difficulty until you figure things out.

This remaster is how it should be - a meticulously, faithfully and carefully uplifted good old game how we all remember it. And although cutscenes suffer from intense artefacts, especially CGI ones and those featuring much movement, the briefings with actors actually were upscaled spectacularly - when I first saw Seth I couldn't believe my eyes, I almost thought they reshot them (pun was not intended, but welcome).
Graphics are perfectly fine, with that familiar raggedness in animations, but detailed - now I can see what that Nod light tank was actually supposed to look like!
And by the Prophet, the music - my neck was sore in an hour from all the headbanging.
This is all I wanted and then some - and I was sceptical all the way, because, you know, EA. But this time they did good. Didn't encounter a single bug so far, and performance is ideal - and I don't even have a gaming rig. I'm sure that issues people are having, like unstable performance or problems in multiplayer connectivity, will be resolved by post launch support.
Everything else, like gameplay improvements, new units or whatnot - just wait for mods, guys. C&C has one of the most badass, faithfull and creative modding communities ever - and with the release of source code they'll be having a field day with this one.

My only gripe is the pricing - EA jacked up all regional prices and I ended up paying for this even more than europeans and americans - and I don't have even half the average income of those. The thing that actually pushed me over the edge - was the video from Kane himself. That was so good that I just went and bought it. Still, the regional prices are bullshit, EA, bad practice.

Thanks to some very close collaboration between the developers and their community, this remaster really feels like a labour of love. The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics have really been given a solid work-over making it more clear which unit is which, the cinematics are a little wonky as a result of upscaling but they look gorgeous, all around.

I think the only complaint I have at the moment is that, as far as I can tell, it's impossible to password protect or 'friends/invite-only' a multiplayer lobby, which means we have to deal with a lot of random players joining our lobby unprompted (and conversely, means that people looking for a quick public game are going to find themselves getting kicked out of a lot of lobbies).

The sprite and background remastering is excellent, and the UI improvements are welcome. IMO the biggest standout is the music, which has been updated and extended with rich high quality tracks. Outpaces the visual updates, IMO

If I had to nitpick the visual updates: the work on the FMV was a bit lazy - they applied a simple smoothing kernel and called it a day. In some ways, it's harder to make out what's going on in some scenes than the pixelated mess of the originals. They probably could have done more post-processing here for very little cost; perhaps using AI to sharpen/fill in image details (amusingly, that statement would have sounded insane a few years ago, let alone when these games first came out...)

Of course, even with UI improvements the interface is odd and not well explained because these games are OOOLLLDDD. How do you unload troops from transports? Stop one set of units from constantly getting under friendly fire from your grenadiers? Well - you'll figure it out, but these sort of things are not always intuitive or sometimes ineffective.

29,70389123,english,"I've been with you guys for 2 decades and here's my review a bit of nip picking and objective views mixed in.
-Should you buy this game? 
-Yes.

-Is this game any good as it seems? Did it achieved its goals?
-Yes and no.. here's things get a bit interesting.

There are areas where this game nailed. Music and staying faithful to the source game. But as for gold standard that i feel that Age of Empires 2 DE has set, I feel that they just did it bare minimum for this remaster.. playing it safe and didn't innovate more or fix on their previous problems.. they just say they give us faithful remaster to the previous game and that's the only thing they give.

Graphics
-------------
Graphics are ok BUTT for me i have problems with animations.. everything feels like they are just sliding and no weight to them.. espcially those tokyo drifting tanks.. I understand they staying faithful but certain things like a bit of dust on tanks and a bit of tank tracks wouldn't hurt. Planes when they turn don't turn on their axis.. like A-10 for example just flying flat like that.. and explosion effects like tank muzzles or destroyed buildings are just bare minimum.. all could have been a bit better and some efforts should have put in. Now i feel like everything looks crisp, sharp in 4k but that's about it.. doesn't look too convincing without these small details.

Gameplay
--------------
To say it short, gameplay flow is no where close to what openRA achieved which they really should have referenced a thing or 2 from.. Pathfinding is not updated, clunky as hell, Ai is one note just as before. The gameplay just feels very clunky. In a way, it's a win because old cnc was just as clunky. This is where I mean AOE2: DE set the gold standard as not only it was fresh new remaster, the gameplay flow is also good. The animations had weight. New visual, explosions effects and better path finding and AI and I'm disappointed that cnc didn't put effort in those. Maybe like OpenRA and AOE2DE, with some updates down the line, might be better but I don't hope much. 

So CNC remaster is not bad.. It was a classic stuck in time and now it is a classic stuck in time but in 4k.

I still bought it to support and play for fun time to time but not too much to sink in game for house like i did with Generals Zero hour or AOE2DE.",1591451526,1591451526,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198068054597,46,3,437,0,93,1593612788

61,70387759,english,"What a nostalgic throwback! From the opening EVA update screens to seeing the old videos remastered, gave me a real nostalgic experience.

But that's all it was... nostalgia.

Look how many positive reviews are out there with sod all played time. For example there's one with time played 0.2 hours, saying its an amazing game.

People are rating this largely out of nostalgia. So i'm going to list the stuff I actually like, and the things I don't like.

Things I like:

+ Nostalgia, it made me feel like I was pre teen again.
+ The art style. I think the new graphics are actually pretty neat and fit in with the overall aesthetic.
+ Music, need I say more?

Things I dislike:

- Ai feels janky at the best of times. Often your units will just sit there getting shot at, even though they are in range and will not react.
- Ai seemingly ignoring orders. Sometimes you'll tell units to attack and they will follow for a short while then its like they forget what they are doing.
- No modern gameplay improvements such as rally points, attack move, patrol.
- Multiplayer is essentially unusable right now

Maybe modding can fix some of these things but I feel like out of the box they could have done this.

Don't get me wrong is wonderful they have remastered this but I think most people are just wearing rose tinted glasses and are unable to see the glaring flaws that are in launch.
Oh and the whole ""if they improved the ai it wouldnt be true to the original"" is nonsense.

For now my recommendation is dont buy this game yet. Wait until there some mods to fix the issues, you'll have a much better experience then.",1591449750,1591449750,False,538,105,0.566467821598052979,0,True,False,False,76561197984380619,231,12,129,0,129,1591385901

63,70387535,english,"First of all, I would like to make it perfectly clear for everyone: this is a *REMASTER*, NOT a remake of the first two games. Meaning that the games behave and function more or less exactly the same as they did way back when, do not expect the AI to be perfect or pathfinding to be godlike. 

Just like Blizzard did with their StarCraft Remastered, the development team avoided messing around with the basic mechanics, aside from adding a bunch of quality of life features such as build queues and updated sidebar similar to the one seen in Tiberium Wars.

However, both games now include official mod support with Steam Workshop integration AND source codes were released to the public, meaning that the community is bound to come up with various fixes and improvements sooner or later - for those who wish to play through a vastly different experience. Steam Workshop also makes it a lot easier to download and play custom maps. 

Both games feature updated visuals, re-recorded soundtrack by Frank Klepacki and his band ""The Tiberian Sons"", as well as a whole load of bonus clips which unlock every time you beat a mission. It's especially heartwarming to see so much footage featuring Eric Martin who played general Sheppard in the GDI Tiberian Dawn campaign. Mr Martin passed away a year ago and it's great to have his legacy continued in this Remastered Collection. 

The cutscenes were upscaled using AI upscale technologies because there are no more original high quality tapes in existence - something to keep in mind while playing. I've seen a lot of people complain that the videos don't look as sharp as the rest of the game. Please consider the fact that what you're seeing is the artificially upscaled footage back from the PS1 era. 

If you're not a fan of the updated visuals, just tap spacebar and your game will go back to using the original graphics. Same goes for the soundtrack - you can choose to listen to the original tracks instead of the remastered ones whenever you please thanks to the in-built jukebox. Furthermore, it allows you to play *all* music tracks regardless of which game you're currently running, so if you've always wanted to crush Nod with Red Alert's ""Hell March"" blasting in the background, they've got you covered here. 

There's also a map editor included for both games, which greatly simplifies map making process. The in-game multiplayer menu allows to host, join and browse through active matches, with the added ability to join in as a spectator, as well as play against the AI opponent in the newly added skirmish mode (which is entirely new for the Tiberian Dawn, because the original game never had one). 

All this goodness runs like a charm on modern hardware in glorious 4K, so if you're a fan of the original C&C games - pick it up in a heartbeat, you won't be disappointed. Just make sure to remember that this is a remaster, *NOT* a remake and adjust your expectations accordingly. 

Here's hoping this game does well and we get the chance to see Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 remastered in a similar fashion in the future!",1591449432,1591449576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198071570586,43,5,796,0,266,1594063087

My only negative comments are they didn't update the unit pathfinding, which is is still in its original form...so don't expect much unit intelligence.

So hop in to experience (or relive) a historic part of how the RTS genre got popular, with modern visuals and sounds. And since the games have workshop and modding support, I'm 100% sure you can expect some insane mods that bring stuff to a whole new level.

Can't really go wrong buying this IMO, unless you simply hate RTS games.",1591447832,1591447863,True,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198104909627,90,27,390,0,155,1591557128

2,70386294,english,"If you're coming in with familiarity from the 90s or the modern ports: Yes it's still C&C. Totally worth it, and it'll encourage EA to behave like this more often. 

If you're coming in with no familiarity: Command and Conquer is a real time strategy game using the age old template of build base, harvest resources (Tiberium or Gold), build troops, steamroll. Using a two faction, asymmetrical system in both the Tiberian and Red Alert games, it provides a good variety of gameplay for both sides in both games. In fact this game, and Dune 2, created that very template in the 90s. It's been made shiny enough for modern audiences and is still an excellent play even now, although you may find a lack of certain quality of life features jarring, such as there being attack, and move, but not attack-move.

Pros:
- It's all shiny now and still lets you play in legacy pixel mode. Much appreciate.
- Core game hasn't been altered much
- But they've released the source code and modding tools so it can be altered
- KANE LIVES
- All the missions in one convenient package
- Enhanced soundtrack and jukebox
- No Origin or other additional software to install

Cons:
- 25 GIGS? Mostly movies. 
- Some of the cutscenes remastered well. Others... less well. Some noticeable artifacts and frame interpolation.
- Honestly prefer the lofi/remastered tracks to the remixes.

13,70384556,english,"TLDR: Crashed right before I took out my first enemy on skirmish.

Thing that put me off about the remaster on my initional playthrough. Not being able to select the Structures hotkey when a structure is complete to quick place (like in Red Alert2/YR).  Instead they have spread them out and individualised them for no other reason that idk AoE2:DE did it? They should please for the love of god just make it so selecting the structures tab with the hotkey with automatically make placing the built structure available.
You can't right scroll mouse on the map when looking for somewhere to place a building and have the placement marker stick with you. It simply cancels the placement meaning you have to go back to the icon once you've scrolled and found a suitable location. Of course this can be fixed with the individualised hotkeys they've added in but as I've mentioned I'm not fond of that and prefer the one-click type method in RA2.
And no waypointing for buildings? Have I missed something here!? Seems like a silly little thing they missed out, This should certainly get patched in?

Also, repaired units just continue to sit on the repair bay which might make you think it's still being repaired if you don't pay much attention to it. Furthermore, this completely STOP queues of damaged units from getting repaired. If you are in an high intensity game and you send off 4 thanks for a squad of say 10 to get repaired before the next attack wave comes then you are completely screwed given how buy you are counter-attacking, base building, resource securing and everything else C&C demands. Solution? Add waypoints. Please for the love of god add way point and single button completed structure selection RA2 style.
So far it feels good, it's reminicent, but it's definitely annoying and needs some very simple creases ironing out. I hope the Production Team see this message.

47,70384571,english,"Erstmal ein großes Lob an EA und Petroglyph. Es ist ein sehr gelungenes Remaster der ersten CnC-Reihe, ohne Mikrotransaktionen und einem weitgehend funktionierienden System. Mit meinen 20€ will ich Danke sagen und eine weitere Entwicklung späterer Titel als Remaster unterstützen und mehr Bedeutung schenken.

Jetzt zu den negative Aspekten, die mich an der Idee eines modernen Remasters stören:
-Keine verbesserte KI um die Nostalgie nicht zu zerstören, okay, aber wirklich vollständig drauf zu verzichten und die Einheiten weiterhin so dämlich durch die Gegend watscheln zu lassen ist wirklich daneben
-Dass Karten auf 64x64 beschränkt sind und maximal 4 Spieler im Multiplayer und 6 bzw. 8 bei TD/RA im Skirmish zulässig sind ist ein Unding. Selbst OpenRa ein Community-Projekt zeigt wies deutlich besser geht
-Die Multiplayer-Lobby gerade beim Laden von Maps erlaubt eine geringe Verwaltungsmöglichkeit als Admin, denn Spieler lassen sich nicht mehr kicken, wenn sie ewig die Karte laden müssen. Außerdem kann man kein Passwort festlegen um private Spiele zu machen.
-Der Map-Editor ist sehr umständlich. Es scheint halt als Remaster komplett auf die alte Idee der Tiles zu setzen. Es ist sehr anstrengend so zu bauen und definitiv nicht mehr modern. Dass hinter bestimmten Objekten noch was liegen könnte wird völlig ignoriert. Rege mich da vielleicht grundlos auf, weil das früher halt so war. Aber auf ein vernünftiges Layer-System zu setzen, sollte doch auch mit der alten Grafik möglich sein. Zudem fehlt eine klare Erklärung wie man Spielerstartplätze wählt (mit Waypoints P0-P5/P7) oder die Tatsache, dass blaue Ressourcen In TD nicht gesetzt werden können und die Tiberium-Bäume dazu noch gut versteckt sind. Man kann diese auch nicht in der SpawnRate oder Ähnliches verändern, was ich gerade für Custom-Maps sehr wichtig fände

Naja, alles im Allem bin ich trotzdem sehr zufrieden, dass EA sich dazu durchringen konnte. Möglicherweise werden ja auch noch ordentliche Patches dazu, wie der LAN-Modus hinzugefügt und Mods irgendwie auf Custom-Maps im Multiplayer ermöglicht, um die Freiheit des Spiels grenzenlos zu machen. Grundsätzlich hoffe ich dabei, dass noch weitere Teile released werden und irgendwann dann mal doch Generals 2 für 40€ und weitere vernünftige CnC-Teile rausgebracht werden. Das Franchise ist nicht tot, wie die Community ja eindeutig zeigt.

In diesem Sinne,
Welcome back, Commander.

51,70384381,english,"The original of Red Alert was the first game I ever played when i was younger. I was 4 at the time (very irresponsible of my dad I know but we didn't have online back then) and I hopped onto his PS1 for a game of Red Alert with his supervision. I really enjoyed it. That enjoyment is still with me as I play this remastered version of the game I used to play all those years later. But enough about my past and enjoyment. This is why I recommend C&C remastered.

I like the idea of the fact you can put any song from both parts of the game and put them into a custom playlist. Although to be honest, all of the music is great, why would you separate the songs?

Secondly, the gameplay is the same as it was all those years ago. Imperfect but in a way that you would love to play. You get to train your troops, you command them to conquer your enemies, hence my take on the game's name. Also, on Red Alert, each country has it's own perk that they get (for example England has 10% armour or something like that I can't exactly remember.) The reason why I am saying the game play is the way it should be because EA have, for once, done something right and remastered the game in a way that Activision would be ashamed of themselves for. The only difference is that I am using a keyboard and mouse now compared to the PS1 controller back then. xD

Thirdly, the campaign of the game includes everything from the old games, which is a treat seeing as some of the missions I never got to play on this or on CNCNet when that was a free mod. Like the ants missions for example, that was a really good idea to put in, as crazy as that sounds.

Finally, the downsides, yes the frames can be a bit meh at times, sometimes the game feels a bit slow, and I've seen some people complaining about black screens. But all in all I have had no problems with playing this game and I can't wait to play more of this, and eventually, have my ass handed to me online.

To sum this rather skewed review up, a imperfect game, master perfectly. I would pay 2x the price for this remaster, so getting it at £17.99 is a steal. 10/10 would recommend",1591444917,1591444917,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198018620946,300,8,180,13,63,1601559808

sometimes, clicks are not registered. given the large numbers of objects, you have to click really often to make sure your commands are accepted. this makes micromanagement annoying and in combination with the horrible wayfinding even much worse.

switching from old to new graphics is a nice gimmik, this doesn't make up for the bugs and the irritating behaviour of units.

Recalling so many hours I spent on it in the past; seeing it given this treatment just feels like a dream come true, especially with how long the dry period this series has been in went on. Remastered may have a few bugs and some issues; but overall, it presents the classics in a format that is easy and more accessible then the original game is; and throws in some added bonuses for good measure.

If I had one major gripe which is a bit of a dealbreaker, it would be the inclusion of the Difficult adjuster in Tiberium Dawn, a feature that was not present in the original game. Easy and Medium are fine; but Hard mode is almost impossible to complete due to it being horribly imbalanced for Tiberium Dawn's levels. Any mission which requires you to take a small group of units and overcome the odds will require luck to overcome; leading to some frustration factor.

But, aside from that, it's just about everything a fan of the original could want.

While the QoL improvements - namely in multiplayer (which I haven't yet, and at this rate, probably won't touch) - seem like a fantastic way to bring an old franchise up to speed - it seems everything else under-the-hood was left untouched.

While I applaud keeping the game so literally true to it's roots - that's also part of the problem.

As someone who only struggled at times with the StarCraft II campaign on the hardest difficulties - the game was balanced against you through objectives, unit counts, etc. 

The 'Hard' version in C&C simply adjusts numbers so the balance doesn't exist - and you're resorted to cheesing just to get through a majority of the missions.

Clunky pathing, lack of a modern attack-move, units AI (on both sides) responding to what feels like 800 ping (if they respond at all, in certain circumstances) leaves for a beyond frustrating experience.

While I was hopeful for a complete modernization of such a staple of my youth brought into modern times and being able to compete with other heavy hitters like StarCraft and Age of Empires, too many of the game's mechanics fall apart at the base for it to have an enjoyable experience.

While I can recommend this to any veteran of the oldest entries of the series (Pre-RA2) for an impressive visual experience in modern-OS supported HD - I can't recommend this to newcomers.
It feels like if Sony or Samsung released a new VCR. Sure, shiny and new, and probably a ton of amazing bells and whistles - but still the inherent problems with the medium at the time slowing it down from being a worthwhile experience.

This was one of the first games I played; maybe the first at a friends house and would have me loving the C&C saga for the many years that followed.  I fell out of love of gaming much because the deviation away from games like this; not in game purchases, a decent single player gameplay and storyline; what will follow in the years to come was simplistic multiplayer that I think has largely been lost.  Besides that, this is simply a great game – if you are of a younger age and this is before your time, please give it a go; I think you will be pleasantly surprised

The graphic improvements in the game is just right; not too over the top leaving the essential feel to the game, but still makes it look crisp.  The option to quickly see the old graphics is a nice touch, and at first I thought I would be using but the improvements are just too good.  The cut screen upscaling is great, and I’m really pleased they didn’t redo the 90s clunky graphic in those cut screen, instead just making them clearer – it all provides a proper hit to the nostalgic hit.  I can’t explain how fuzzy it felt to see the install procedure when C&C started up… wow… they came good here

I'm thrilled; I don't game much anymore, and dislike EA as much as the next disgruntled gamer but in this case they have my thanks (and money!).  This is the best game I have played in years, which is amazing considering it is from decades ago

44,70372814,english,"Plays and feels just like the original C&C from the 90's! The game is very fun, enjoyable, and reasonably priced at $20. No matter what your video gaming playstyle is, C&C:RC is a great RTS game to play solo or online with your Steam friends. After practicing a little bit and quickly getting used to the old school controls and look and feel of the retro UI, you'll be beating other online players and the AI in no time at all. Be it in the online or offline (Base and Red Alert) campaigns, practice matches, skirmishes, and custom maps and game modes. The game plays exactly the same as it did when we played it during our childhoods, with the exception of it including even more additions and improvements. These additions and improvements include: enhanced HD graphics and visuals, higher fidelity musical compositions and cutscenes, remastered voice-overs, modern day option settings and controls, and streamlined multiplayer with Steam community workshop and mod support. Now, having said all of that, the AI in the game is a bit lackluster and has not been improved very much, if at all. The AI is still fairly easy to predict and defeat even when the AI is set to a higher difficulty level. In addition, while I have not encountered any issues with launching or running the game on release day, what I have encountered includes the following: the occasional slow down in multiplayer due to host latency and server lag, all in-game EA multiplayer network features randomly being shutdown temporarily for 10-20 minutes, custom map host lobbies occasionally not launching and freezing completely during level load screens, and multiplayer matches disconnecting all players due to an EA multiplayer network server outage. However, despite all of these minor, and albeit, rarely encountered issues, the gameplay experience so far has been very solid, nostalgic, bug-free, and fun - especially while playing online with Steam friends! Overall, I would highly recommend the game and currently rate C&C:RC with a 9/10! Buy it! You won't regret your purchase. I know I didn't! Likewise, to all the hardcore C&C fans out there: if enough players buy and support C&C:RC now, perhaps we will also see remastered collections of Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 in the near future? ;d",1591427465,1591440075,True,6,0,0.604519784450531006,0,True,False,False,76561197971524381,475,6,315,0,315,1591412345

48,70381045,english,"So I kinda want to break down who is going to like this game(s) and who is not. Also my first ever review.

I first started playing C&C when I was 9 with Tib Wars in 2007. I became utterly obsessed and would go on to buy and play every game I could and for me the reactions to this game can be broken down into three parts. Obviously this is not totally accurate but this is kinda how I see it

If you're an original fan of the series you are most likely going to love this game with a mix of genuine objective value and nostalgia. If you're an original C&C buff get it, you'll most likely love it and its probably worth your time.

I you came later to the series, like me, and love it you'll enjoy the game but you'll have to get used to it. When I started playing C&C it was with games that had fluid 3D graphics, a range of support powers, stupidly large and powerful units and massivly improved AI and quality of life updates. This combined with my parents PC's problems running a then 15 year old game made the original games feel unplayable for me. This remaster helps those problems... mostly. The game runs perfectly for me but I still feel there are many niggling 1995 things that will fustrate a modern C&C player. This would have been different with a full remake but then the spirit of the game is lost. You will have to get used to much more micro tactical play. The game is less forgiving and harder than the modern ones. You cannot just steamroll on any difficulty other then easy and with the lack of massive support powers you have to be really careful with your units. 

Finally if you've never played C&C, have no love for it and are used to modern RTSs this game will most likely fustrate you. It's a great game but for 1995 and unless you are prepared for that it is going to annoy the hell you.

Ultimately if you love C&C and you want a version that plays well and is easy to run without having to go anywhere online, get it but as with any game from the mid 1990s there is an element of a labour of love to it. 

My ultimate hope is that they remaster Tib Sun and Red Alert 2. Those two (ESPECIALLY RA2) were epic. I remember sinking hours into RA2 as a kid",1591440008,1591440008,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042235269,39,1,724,0,311,1592409418

It almost looks like apart from asset and FMV upscaling (they still look rubbish though), not much else has been done here. Especially lacking in the game mechanics section. Pathfinding is still horrible and units can get stuck for no reason or start going around the whole map if cannot find best route.
Furthermore some missions have dumb objectives like having to defend a civilian village from NOD attacks, but civilians cannot be controlled and have a tendency to step on Tiberium and die. Game over, just like that. Kinda annoying. 
All this stuff makes the game feel like it hasn't aged well despite the remaster. Honestly the community over the years have done a better job in some cases i.e. by rewriting pathfiding algorithms.

First of all this is all based on playing Tiberian Dawn, not Red Alert.

In my less then two hours I had multiple issues including:
- Bad multiplayer experience: no way to setup friends only games, laggy servers, bugged out during victory.
- AI can't play the game: in multiple skirmishes the AI had all harvesters stuck in their base unable to get any income and pose any challange.
- Game suffers from severe stuttering after 15 minutes of play, the only way to mitigate it is to move all 25 gigabytes!! of gamefiles to my limited size SSD.
- Low quality remaster: the CGI cinematics should have been fully remade, the blurry upscaling looks horrible and results in story critical text being near unreadable. The upscaled live action cinematics are fine, but I fail to see what benefit there is to this ""HD"", at the cost of needing 25 gigabytes of space for such a small old game.

All these quality issues would be bad enough if it was released by a small indie studio, but with EA I can only assume they severely underfunded it to rerelease an old westwood property as a cheap cash grab targeting folks like me by nostalgia.

Would NOT recommend for it's current 20€ pricetag. Wait until the issues are fixed and/or wait until it's priced appropriately for a multiple decade old game.


There are of course positives, such as the fantastic remastered soundtrack, the zoom feature, and several quality of life additions (no attack move still, but eh can live without it) and how the game can be run on modern systems in borderless fullscreen.

The second most important part for me is the source code and mods. The source code appears to be commented well, but the source files are just slammed into a project with no structure, no folders.

63,70380516,english,"Firstly, Like many others before me, i'm not a Fan of EA.
Its a shame to see a company with a long and proud history of quality games resort to shady business practices and destroying beloved franchises. 
When i first heard of C&C remastered i physically groaned at the thought of them destroying what little dignity the C&C franchise has left.
But curiosity got the better of me.
Well..
They listened, they learned.
And what an amazing job they have done!!
Its everything i could have hoped for and more!
Just to be clear, this is a remaster, not a remake.
The new graphics have been done with an incredible attention to detail, everything is just how my imagination saw it all those years ago.
The cut scene FMV up-scaling is also of a better quality than i thought they would be able to achieve.
The remastered audio is also of a very high quality, this is one area i wasn't expecting a marked improvement as the original audio music and SFX were awesome! but they really raised the bar beyond expectation.
The Jukebox feature is also worth the price tag alone, there are numerous bonus tracks and tracks from the OST also remastered.

Its not a clear cut copy and paste remaster, they have altered a lot of the UI, and i must say the improvements are really good, definatly brings it in line with a modern interface and makes most things far easier to do.

The added multiplayer and skirmish modes are excellent too and i can see will provide a lot of replay value.
Also, the plethora of missions from the add on's and consoles are a nice addition too. 
Speaking of replay value, it's nice you can watch replays, a feature i really liked from later games i wasn't expecting, so that's a bonus. 

If i had to be critical, as no review, no matter how glowing, is complete without criticism, there are a few downsides and faults to C&C Remastered, and they're big ones!!

Firstly, Although the original C&C and RA had probably the most difficult campaigns of the franchise, this was largely achieved through your massively limited resources against a superior enemy, which was necessary as the AI sucked!
Prime examples are they'll let you rock up near their base and they'll ignore you until you're in firing range. or on the original RA, in skirmish mode the AI simply wont build a navy so its a guaranteed win if the map has water.
Sadly the AI doesn't appear to have been tweaked in any way, although i can understand this from the point of view it would probably unbalance the single player campaign and would cause the developers a whole load of headaches and any balancing would likely take away from the authenticity of the remaster, it would have been nice if the AI could have been rebalanced particularly for skirmish and multiplayer.

Secondly, As much as i love the new UI, i do have an issue with it, the way that now all buildings, and all units are grouped under their own tab, Historically, for example, naval units were under their own tab, as were defensive structures etc, With them all under one tab, it can make finding what you want difficult when you need it in a hurry, costing you crucial seconds in a fight. This is more of a minor annoyance than anything though.

Thirdly, its a shame they didnt re-do the purely CGI cutscenes, for example the construction yard deploying scene, mahoosive polygons!

Overall though, i am well impressed with this game, its a real trip down memory lane, and it was clearly made with love!
Definatly worth the relatively small price tag! 
I really hope they do a Tiberian sun and Red alert 2 remaster next.
Great job EA",1591439187,1591439187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198001934885,66,3,907,0,227,1597705174
64,70380460,english,"I was super hyped for C&C Remastered because i'm a huge fan of the franchise. Red Alert 1 is my most favorite of the entire series unlike most people, who seem to prefer Red Alert 2.

My pros and cons so far:

The positive:
+ High resolution graphics.
+ Smoother animations.
+ Epic remade music from Frank.
+ The new UI is great.

The negative:
- You can zoom in and out but the max view is limited to that of the old 640x480. I loved the huge view from CnCNet when running the game on 1920x1080. It gives a better map control.
- Games starts nice and fast but after a few minutes slows down to about 20fps for the rest of the match (tested on an Intel  i3 7100 and an AMD A8 7600 APU, will try later on my i7 2600k)
- The high resolution graphics make the game look kinda cheap. It looks to clean and unrealistic.
- It's difficult to select moving objects.
- Limited settings for skirmish games. You can't for example enter how much money you start with as it maxes out at 10k.

Verdict:
In it's current state i can highly recommend this version for the campaign but for skirmish and online play i lean more towards the CnCNet version until they fix the performance and increase the maximum viewing distance.",1591439095,1591439095,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561197988666763,182,10,3783,224,157,1601209457

I will first write a tl;dr then go into further details below.

Buy this game if you are either a fan of Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert or you are interested in the history and legacy of these great games.
Do not buy if you are expecting a 2020 game or a 2020 remake of the old games, because this is a remaster of two 25 ~ years old titles.

The difference between a remake and a remaster is that while a remake takes a game and builds it again from the ground up, a remaster uses up 100% of the original game while adding new features to it.
Now that we have got that out of the way, what are the new features exactly?

1. Upscaled graphics and increased fps. The game looks much much better and is generally more fluid, which is especially visible in the FMV briefings the franchise is famous for. 
2. QoL improvements like additional control and ui settings you can choose from. You can customize when health bars show, if you want right click move or not etc. etc. There are also accessibility features like speech to text. Mission selection screen so you don't have to keep saves to play through A and B scenarios too.
3. All missions included, from console versions too.
4. Online multiplayer lobby, which is actually one of the downsides for me. It is great that it exists, but at the moment it is not very great, it is hard to find the game you want to join, the room is hosted as soon as you navigate to the host menu and you cannot protect it with a password either.
5. Upgraded audio! This is one of the best things about this remaster, the soundtracks are all killers, and now they are in orgasmic quality.
6. Bonus materials, making of footages, additional soundtracks.
7. Community support!! The community is already making great maps and mods, and the source code is open now! This literally means only your abilities limit what you can create from the base game.
8. A new install sequence that will make any diehard fan cry tears of nostalgia.

Now some things this remaster doesn't have that people complain about: updated AI and pathfinding. This is personally something I feel could have been included in the remaster, but the devs already said they won't do it, so everyone knew well in advance. If you still buy it then get disappointed that's on you for not doing any research before hitting the pay button.

Overall I feel this remaster was done super well except for the multiplayer portion but I sincerely hope that either the devs or the commuhnity will fix it soon. When the return of C&C was announced, they actually asked fans if they want a remaster or a whole remake or even a reboot. The grand majority voted for remake, including me. If you wanted a remake or reboot you didn't get, please don't blame the dev, blame us fans.

If you have read this review up until the end, then sincerely thank you and let me know in a reply if you agree/disagree with something and why.",1591437113,1591437113,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197974347260,884,4,811,0,181,1594766999

the only issue i have had with the upscaling so far has been when there are still images in the FMVs, they come across as extremely grainy and do not look great tbh.

There are a ton of extras here, and what this project mainly wanted to do, it has done every well. The gameplay itself isn't changed at all, clearly this is not a REMAKE, which is a very good thing. Even surprisingly, the slightly stupid controls and AI are still there, which surprised me, but then again it would make it a whole different game.

EA has the reputation of thoroughly butchering gaming franchises, the C&C franchise was no exception. I mean, no microtransactions here? No 50 euro's for a DLC? Which you actually require to play? EA listening to fans??

Either someone in the EA head office has been struck by lightning, or after 15 years of complaining, they finally saw they were on the wrong path.

Anyhow, C&C remastered brings back the feel of the first C&C games. This game is nostalgic as they come. This game shows you how far the RTS franchise has come throughout the years. 
My favorite thing about the remastered is the way they handled the graphic improvements. It still captures the vibe of the original and it also looks really good. For anyone saying in the reviews ""I expected a 3D version of the original."" or ""The graphics are worse than minesweeper."" I have to say that it would be really hard for WestWood studios devs and EA to capture the vibe of the original AND make it 3D graphics because by making 3D graphics you ultimately lose the vibe and the nostalgia. It would mostly feel like a different game or a knockoff from the original.

Sit playing so long id blink and 4 hours was gone. Before this game was released the EA/Westwood devs communicated to us that this remastered was only going to go so far as they wanted to keep the game play similar to 90s cause they didnt wanna over enhance and mess it all up change them missions and overall game play. they also told us that while they was able to enhance a lot of the game the cut scene would be a different story as they couldnt find the original tapes so they have to use the files already had withing the game code and they enhanced it as best as they could. For me this still excited me because i remember everything so blurry and the sound being very high in tones no lows really.

You can select what song list you want to listen to which is great and the ability to play the old mission from console days is freaking awesome even from me cause the interface was horrible on console and the game flopped there. just too mouse dependent. 

having tech support once again to a game made from the 90 is awesome bring fresh air into the game deeply needed and maybe old issue within the game may now find fixes. 

If your getting this game never played it and your use to modern RTS .......DO NOT GO INTO IT TO COMPARE.. this AI is old it doesnt work like todays. tanks will not fire sometimes.. you can run right by thing at times. you have to baby sit and really focus at time. when moving a massive group sometimes they will split up and some will take a longer way even tho the shorter way is directly in front of them. That how it was b4, thats how it still is now.. remember its a remaster not a remake, and they couldnt make to many fixs cause itd break the game.

I expected more for the classic game's remastered. Yes, the original game gave me a pleasant time back in 90s but of course with some limits. That was the time when RTS first introduced, so such limits’ existence can be understood. Soon after that, these issued were fixed in later RTS games. However, this remastered seems want you to remember all the old feelings, including the limits which you can easily fix in current 2020s.

Suspect all AIs remain the same as 90s: when enemy attacking your one unit, your other units nearby don’t fight back and just standing, looks like they are irrelevant to their friendly in the battle. After you manufacture an ore track, no matter from ore refinery or tank factory, the trucks usually don’t know to harvest nearby ores before you give commands. When you order a group of troops to board a transport ship, the queue is really horrible: the most nearby unit don’t board first meanwhile the far away unit have to align slowly. At the same time, other units have wait unit this unit complete boarding (don’t mention if your ship is not well aligned. If this happens, good luck, god knows how long time you need to make it aligned manually well…). Same scenario also happens when a group of units entering fix depot…Come one, you have even fixed these silly issues in later CNCs in 2000s, so you can’t fix in 2020s? 

UI wise, ok, now finally you can order to manufacturing multiple infantry/tank units in a sequence (like in later CNC series). But how come you still only able to order to build one building at a time, which you all already solved in later CNCs? Isn’t obvious you can easily improve? Is this your promised improved UI?

Some mission design, for example, Soviet mission 4. All ores can’t be regenerated. Think about it: after you confront enemy and build new units intensively for few minutes, suddenly both sides have no ore to harvest and run out of funds, both sides just stopped, none can fight further. Isn’t frustrated? Don’t even mention you have to transport your unit to another island through a long journey, means you may repeat this horrible cycle for a second time. If you think the original game was like this, I remember no, in this mission ores could be slowly regenerated in 1996. I guess such design is to encourage both side attack more initiatively instead of “defend-build-gather big troops-win in a one wave” strategy, but in practise it’s even more disastrous. What’s more, the old version’s “search and kill the last infantry in the map corner to complete the mission” still remains, what a nostalgia…

The cutsences are not remake, even not fully HD remastered…

Afterall, the “remastered” is purely game graphic remastered, issues in the original game remain and some are even worse. I don’t feel the sincerity from it. Don’t recommend…

华文：

本来我还挺期待这个游戏的。没错，原版游戏在90年代真是令我喜欢，尽管有些缺点。但考虑到当时RTS类型刚出不久，这些缺点的存在还能理解。之后这些问题在后来的RTS里都修复了。但是，这款“重制”就是想让你回忆起当年的一切，包括一些早在2000年代就能修复的问题

真怀疑AI是完全照搬旧版没改：敌人攻击你一个单位，他周围的友军就傻站着不反击，好像战斗和自己无关似的。你刚造一辆矿车·，不管从矿场还是坦克工厂造的，他们经常不知道主动去采矿，直到你下指令。当你安排一队兵进运输船，那排队真是烂。一个近处的单位要等远处的单位慢慢摆正自己的位置然后上船，它才能慢慢再上。要是你的运输船位置不对，呵呵，恭喜吧，等你慢慢·手动把船摆正先。你安排一队坦克进维修厂也是一样的状况。。。拜托，这些问题在2000年代的命令与征服就修正了，你到了2020年反倒不能修了？

界面嘛，好吧，终于一次可以选择按顺序造多个步兵/坦克了 （就如在之后的  命令与政府系列一样）。但轮到建筑，还是一次只能选一个造。这点问题难道不容易解决吗？你们说好的改进界面那？

有些关卡设计，比如苏联第四关，矿不可再生。等于你激烈的和敌人打了几分钟，造了很多兵，突然双方都没矿了，没钱了，不能再造兵了。于是双方大眼瞪小眼谁也无法继续战斗了。难受不？更不用所这关你还要把部队送到远处的岛上，再把这套重复一遍。我记得原版游戏里这关的矿可以缓慢再生。我猜现在这种设计是鼓励你进攻，而不是“防守-建造-暴兵-一拨推”策略，但实际状况非常差劲。而且过去“为了完成任务，满地图找最后一个敌人小兵”的情况还是存在。真够怀旧的。。。

过场动画不仅没重置就不说啥了，结果也没彻底高清化。。。

也就是说，这个“重制”就真的是纯粹画面加强，老问题都保留，甚至有些地方更差了。真感觉不到诚意。不推荐。。。

- Can switch between HD and original graphics but pressing Space
- Can switch between Original music and remastered versions
- Mod support!
- They added some quality of life stuff to Command and conquer (Tiberium Dawn) that wasn't in the original, like zooming in and out and queuing up unit production (Thank god)
- They added a bonus menu so you can re-watch the cinematics as you unlock them

The only downside so far would be that the units can feel a little clunky but given how old these games are its not suprising.

IMO C&C and RA are the best RTS games other than maybe RA2, so my review may be biased.

If you enjoyed the classic Westwood Studios RTS games and fancy another go this is a great remaster. Lots of things have been subtly changed, but nothing sticks out. All the changes are made in ways that are consistent with the original look and feel of the games. Basically it's the original games, but packaged with nice HD textures. All the FMV have been up-scaled and have the scan lines removed. They generally look nice (far better than before), but there do seem to be some kind of interpolation artefacts on a few of them (most noticeable around faces, like the edges of Seth's face in NOD briefings).

Some of the updates include adding the options to use right click to give orders, toggling health bars on/off (or only when damaged) and having resources always display. The ability to zoom out is very much appreciated too.

This looks like the perfect remaster TBH.

--

I'm genuinely surprised that there are so many positive reviews and can only imagine that they are born from nostalgia as others have said.

I love RTS games and remember playing RA back on the original Playstation and it's nice to see the original mission intros a little less blurry.

That been said the HD graphics are clunky and don't mix well with the game play, the tanks seem to just glide and the troops look out of place. I switched back to the original graphics and it actually looks better.

The major reason I'm disappointed is because i've been playing RA almost regularly since COVID19 started with my colleagues from work in the form of OpenRA and honestly it's 10000% better, so it's unlikely I will run this version again. I've no desire to re-do the missions with this kind of game play.

All that been said, EA can keep my money. Why? Two reasons, they provided the dll files so people can mod the game, so hopefully someone will mod it into a playable version and second, I want to see the rest of the series do the same because strategy games like Tiberian Sun, RA2 and even RA are the strategy games I miss playing.

I will say, however, that I have spent extensive time on other ports of C&C, such as the C&CNet releases, as well as OpenRA, so they might alter my judgement of this particular version of the game. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
 - Plenty of settings options for a variety of resolutions, mouse sensitivity options, chat filters etc.
- Custom hotkey support
- The option to switch between remastered and classic graphics, sounds, music and voice overs
- Gameplay is very much the same of the original games
- Great selection of music, including original recordings, remasters and fan tracks by Frank Klepacki & The Tiberian Sons
- Updated visuals are nice, the new building, vehicle and unit models are a good balance between the classic art style and modern graphics
- Customisable skirmish and multiplayer lobbies
- Workshop support (though mods disable multiplayer)
- Steam achievements and trading cards
- Map editor

[b]Cons:[/b]
- My biggest issue with this remaster is the zoom levels. Even zoomed out to the max, at 1080p, it still feels far too zoomed in. I acknowledge this is probably a decision to retain the feel of the original game, but further zoom options would be welcome. There are mods on the workshop for zooming out during skirmish games, but this disables multiplayer and is not (at least, to the best of my knowledge) compatible with campaign. 
- The Red Alert cutscenes are significantly worse in quality than the remastered Command and Conquer cutscenes. I read that this is due to the original files for Red Alert being lost, so upscaling the resolution was the only option available. 
- The building UI sidebar takes up a massive portion of the screen, and does not seem to be able to be scaled down
- Although building healthbars can be toggled to always visible, it would be good to have a small construction progression bar above buildings too
- Unit pathfinding can be a little average
- AI in skirmish games give up too easily

I've been watching the development of this remaster for some time, since the original pictures of the Construction Yards and Tesla Tanks were posted. The developers seem to have a genuine passion for the titles, and have a great reputation with the community. They have demonstrated they are open to feedback and community suggestions.

39,70373971,english,"I remember swapping floppies out to get Dune 2 loaded, typing in words from the book for the copy protection. I was about 4 at the time, kicking around on a 486 DX2 33 with not very much RAM. I still have it in my closet.

It worked on PC Speaker and beeped and chirped and was absolutely amazing. My parents helped me write a letter to Westwood asking when Dune 3 came out, and they sent a letter back saying ""we're working on something new, Command and Conquer.""

I distinctly remember that very little me wasn't impressed.

My parents got it for me when I was about 7-ish. Installation went smoothly. This was far different from Dune 2. The graphics were different, it looked real.

The sound was way better, too.

I clicked the icon with the bird, ""Are you picking this up?"" and boom, little me's mind was blown. There was a guy in a computer game and he was talking using his real voice.

It had my attention.

Then that beach came on-screen in graphics far better than I'd ever seen, and Act on Instinct kicked in, the gunboat launched missiles and I wish I had a picture of little-me's face because I'll bet my jaw hit the floor. It was the most awesome thing I'd seen.

I was a fan of the series in that instant and zealously followed it all the way up through Kane's Wrath, and then Red Alert 3 - which felt more like a Dead Dog Dance after most of your friends have gone home than a main event. I knew the series was over. C&C 4 happened, a sad end to over a decade of gaming with people whose style and sense of humor helped develop my own and whose games made me want to get into working with computers - I'm now a computer engineer playing Command and Conquer on a dream workstation setting up supercomputers and I can blame that achievement on Westwood Studios.


But I thought my time with them was done, that EA had eaten them, that this particular brand of humor was dead and buried. The original Dune 2 floppies are under my bed in a box, as is the manual, my Tiberian Dawn, Sun, and Wars disks and my Red Alert series disks sit not 4 feet from my desk. As do my Dune 2000 and Emperor: Battle For Dune CDs. Renegade, too.

I thought that this was a bygone chapter of my life, like friends I wouldn't see again.

This remaster lives up to and honors Westwood's legacy. I literally can't give higher praise. Buy at full price.

I knew what I was looking at with just the opening cutscene, which felt like an old friend walking through the door unexpectedly. All it took to bring me to tears after that realization were the three words that announced Westwood every time they showed up with a new game, three words that brought me to tears today as it dawned on me that I was looking at the Westwood crew's handiwork and how much I'd missed this series as a touchstone in my life:

60,70373260,english,"I have been a fan since 1995, and here is what I'll tell you:


PROS:
-It's Command and Conquer and Command and Conquer: Red Alert with visual and audio polish. The soundtrack and audio have had dramatic improvement and really help make the game a blast, and all of the units / structures in the game are fun and interesting to look at to see how they compare from the OG game.

-It's fun to play, and exciting to see if you're a lifelong fan of the franchise--it's definitely a nostalgia trip.

-It's challenging (but it's Command and Conquer, challenge and C&C go hand in hand)

-Despite the remastered aspects of the game, it plays like the original almost to a tee

-Mod support & extras (which I'm hoping will be big in the future)

-Multiplayer support & map editor

CONS:
-It's Command and Conquer and Command and Conquer: Red Alert with visual and audio polish. The reason this made it to cons also, is because the game is 25 years old. For people in 2020 that are not lifelong fans or aficionados of the series, you may end up not being as impressed or excited about this, which is understandable. Fancy graphics and movie-level production doesn't necessarily make a great game, however, and I'll reserve that judgment for you, the player.

-I've noticed a stuttering issue from time to time with the game. It's minor, and doesn't affect gameplay really, but a little off-putting considering the game has never had that issue before, and we've now gone backwards in terms of performance. Don't get me wrong, it's still a ton of fun to get into and play, but I could play OpenRA or the original series collection and not get any stutter whatsoever.

-I will be honest--I am far more excited for these guys to put out Red Alert 2 or a Generals remaster, which I think a lot of the other fans have echoed. C&C 95 and RA were great games in their heyday but a lot changes in 25 years. I think Generals and RA2 would benefit much more significantly from a remaster, and are the at the peak level of Command and Conquer's greatness / what made the games so great. I don't want to take away from how well Petroglyph remastered this game--they did a killer job, and it shows that they worked hard on it. I just hope the cycle of greatness continues and we get something more.

Also, the attack dogs in this remaster are massive in size, which I found comical.

Units (like V2 rockets) don't attack targets when ordered, but instead move to the enemy and die.
Units sometimes don't listen to your orders.

I also want to be clear that that I'm approaching this with a kind of semi-nostalgia. I'm a lifetime C&C fan - since I was 5 years old - but I grew up on Red Alert 2, Renegade and Generals. Before this remaster I hadn't actually played anything pre-Tiberian Sun before.

So far my experience has been buttery smooth. No bugs, no issues with framerate or anything. Gameplay has been clean smooth fun and the visual improvements are genuinely hard to understate (you can toggle Original and Remastered graphics with a pre-assigned hotkey).
Control groups and unit selection work great, it was easy to grasp building mechanics and which unit/building does what. Mission objectives are super clearly displayed and explained on the pause menu.
The Jukebox is also an awesome addition and is super easy to use and the library is huge. You have Frank Klepacki's tracks both original and Remastered as well as additional tracks by The Tiberian Sons.
Speaking of additional content, you get Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert 1 PLUS all three expansion packs PLUS bonus missions that were originally only made for the console version of Tiberian Dawn. A pretty good deal if you ask me.

Now, the issues.
The unit AI can be really fucking annoying and the games pathfinding is quite obviously brought in from the original game. This means that when instructed to move 3 metres forward, a couple of units might take a 3-mile detour through Tesla Coils for no reason. Another thing to note is the lack of a ""Guard/Defend"" stance. Most units in the game will not respond when fired upon. This is initially frustrating during some of the ""keep Tanya alive"" missions and such but you get used to it suprisingly quickly via the use of control groups (which work fantastic).

A few players have reported issues such as stuttering for the first 20-secs of a game when V-sync is on, or the ability to remove fog-of-war on certain missions by toggling the graphics settings but I am yet to encounter any of these in my own experience.

All I can say is, never played Tiberian Dawn or Red Alert 1 before and now I wish I had. This has been fun as fuck and I'm genuinely surprised by that. I feel like I've gotten $30 worth of enjoyment out of it and I hope you do too.

C&C is RTS game that was around during the 90s and early to mid 20s for OG Fans, before EA killed WestWood the crew have moved on to form a new Indi studio Petroglyph Games responsible for a few game 
Ex. Star wars Empire at war,Grey Goo and few other low key games and a recent Conan RTS.
If you want to know more about C&C universe you might have trouble finding it as the distribution of the games have long been out of stock and the only way to get them are by other means or go to EA Origin but even then its not the most stable as the original games are not able to function properly with modern hardware. Some don't work outright but if your willing to go above and beyond to get the games and experience them go for it but it can be a while.

Is game good for you? Well that depends do you like RTS and Iconic factions and characters with a few celebrity roles? The story is fun,enjoyable, interesting and unique.With a few more patches to add some features rally points and few others and its good.

The game itself looks great and runs great as well. The AI is unfortunately very bad.
I am marking 3 points off as the AI does make the gameplay a bit tedious. (You have to babysit every unit, they wont fire back if attacked). You also cant send a bunch of tanks into a base and think they will auto attack any nearby structures.
Finally if you have any AI opponents in a skirmish, the bots seem to stop doing anything after a certain point. (Maybe this was just an issue with the custom maps I downloaded).

Overall a great game if you want to relive the good ol days. Im happy to have a version of this that I can run without issues.

32,70368782,english,"TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL WITH SOME LIFESTYLE IMPROVEMENTS:

To understand my excitement, you have to put yourself in my shoes, As a 16 year old South African coming out of the Apartheid years in isolation. Flying to Europe for the first time to travel the Netherlands, France, Belgium and England on a 4-week trip. When in London I walked down Oxford street and walk past this massive music and game store. In the window is this new game from the creators of Dune. A game I played, and we could not buy in South Africa. Begging and convincing my sister that we should scrape every penny together to buy Command & Conquer (she still teases me to this day - I chose a game rather than explore London more).  On the plane back to South Africa I read the manual over and over. Got home, hardly greeted my parents, installed Command & Conquer and played through the night until I could not keep my eyes open anymore.

Supported every Command and Conquer game since. I still long for just that type of game-play, music, atmosphere. Later years I ran 7 consecutive gaming competitions with Command & Conquer & Battle for Middle Earth at the South African RAGE (Really Awesome Gaming Expo).

C&C 4 was so bad that I have yet to finish the game to this day!

It was thus with suspicion that I approached this C&C Tiberian Dawn remaster. Could EA ruin this again with their greed and corporate culture and modern micro transaction monetization?

Luckily the producer, Jim Vassella in charge of this did not and he stayed in contact with the community and understood what we wanted.

This is a classic game with some of its original faults improved so that you can enjoy the original experience and tap into the nostalgia. From the upgrading of the original installation sequences to the AI path finding issues this is true to what the original Command and Conquer and Red Alert games were with some much-needed graphics and UI improvements.

The star however of this game is the music. It is amazing crisp and hard hitting. Better than the original. The music alone is worth the price. Frank Klepacki and the Tiberian Sons are great.

Thank you to the community, the developers and the people that supported brought this into high definition so that I can enjoy a past experience with some modern conveniences.

May this be the start of some good things to come.

Not that ""First Decade"" release that was just half-assed (I mean really, they did away with the cinematics?). But that's in the past. This? This is the past brought into the future.
Pros: 
- They kept and updated as best they could all the cinematics, including the old installation ones.
- The use of a keystroke to transition between updated graphics and classic graphics is flawless.
- Updated UI is SO MUCH BETTER to manage.
- Original unit voices and yells with updated weapon sounds.
- Remastered music is spot on for that mix of nostalgia with a modern feel.
- The 2D formula that made C&C such a defining RTS is still utilized.
- The damn sandbag trick in the original C&C still works lol

Cons:
- Can't put it in windowed mode even when selected, but I have a feeling that'll be patched. It's only day one.
- The save menu could use a little reworking instead of having to type in a new save each time you want to save.
- You might forget to eat meals.

Really though, this is the RTS I've been desiring. It's giving me the nostalgia I crave while providing a modern feel so I don't get bored. I came home from work and suddenly 8hrs have passed.

That said, this is a good remaster. This 25 year old game is now tolerable to those who want to play it, and they've started off on a good foot.  I can only hope they decide to continue remastering the series and update Tiberian Sun,   and possibly RA2 too

anything after that however.  EA needs to make a new CNC game,  cash in on the good will they've earned with CNC Remastered, and give us something to truly make up for killing the franchise with the awful CNC4 and Red Alert 3.

The game looks and sounds both fresh and true to the original style, the UI has received just enough touch-ups to be usable and there's a ton, no, a TON of content to unlock. There's even a few neat extras, like an added Hard difficulty level for TD, which has, for the first time ever, forced me to restart as early as GDI 03.

Some minor gripes still exist, of course. The production hotkeys don't make much sense, the soundtrack isn't available separately (thankfully, it takes about a minute to download the free MegEditor and rip all 203 tracks from Data/MUSIC.MEG yourself) and I still think an attack-move key wouldn't have turned the game upside down. Or at least the queue-move functionality from RA.

But those are just that, minor gripes. By itself, C&C:R is definitely one of, if not the best remasters to have ever come out - as much a game as it is a carefully restored museum piece, lovingly preserved for the future generations.

This is one of those remasters that is great by its own right because it lets old players enjoy the game exactly how we remember (back in 96 these graphics were the rage), no second thoughts or ""it didn't age well"" comments at all. EA was also surprisingly benevolent enough to show some respect for Westwood and leaving their logos and credits displayed which I think is a really nice change of attitude from them.
Mick Gordon sure is a great composer but back in our days we had Frank, and the soundtrack still kicks ass to this day, hell I even think From First To Last covered Hell March 1 as a tribute when the warped tour was the rage as well!

6,70351008,english,"Summary- 
This is a very solid bread and butter RTS for the more casual player, if you think it's above and beyond else is just your rose tinted glasses and nostaliga. Competetive is very dry, campaign is fun, and the soundtrack kicks ass. Some bugs, but overall polish is good.


Graphics - 
The new HD graphics are great though I can think that a few units look a bit clunky and soldiers a bit too 'cartoony' in their animations. I would have wished to be able to zoom out even further with the camera to see more of the game screen. The cutscenes are still a bit too blurry in my opinion but decently upscaled. I would have liked to see new editions of at least the CGI cutscenes. Most units, portraits, buildings and terrain look good, though there is room for improvement.

Controls-
While the addition of hotkeys, movement, unit que, healthbars , etc. make the game easier play, it still requires a whole lot lot of very precise clicking mostly because the game has no attack-move and also because you have to jump back and forth between tabs, for example when you've built a building and have to place it on the map. Camera pan speed, even at maximum is way too slow so you'll absolutely need to work with the minimap. There are a few small bugs, but it mostly works.

Sound & Music-
You can get this game for the soundtrack alone and in my opinion the greatest addition to this remaster. The new music and us breath of fresh air and I'm stunned by just how many tracks there are and how great all of them sound. New SFX are great, but still prefer the old ones which I believe have more character and punch.

Multiplayer -
The quick match absolutely needs to be put to at a faster speed, with larger maps in the map pool. Otherwise the addition  is really good. However multiplayer at competetive level is very badly designed, basically all you do is spam tanks. More casual custom games with mods are a great addition and will add a lot of fun down the line. However word of warning - If you want to play a good competetive RTS just go play Starcraft 2 or Broodwar. Currently servers are a bit unstable, but that's understandable for launch.

Value - 
I feel the proposition is a bit high, which is my biggest complaint. If you're not a huge fan, I'd wait for the price to come down to at least €10 before considering a purchase. Objectively it's still an older game that's pretty dated, and it has a few bugs that affect the experience of playing with others.

 Consider also most of the game is available free with both campaign and multiplayer component on CnCNet. If you're a fan of CNC or RA  it's a no-brainer, because you're getting a ton of fan service and quality content. In the future, if interesting mods are added it will of course add even more value to the game.",1591388925,1591410533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198238074078,66,12,2193,0,181,1592987219

Several good things in fact. For the first time in a long time they acted like a decent publisher and just let Petroglyph do their thing, and bring honor back to the C&C franchise.

This game has serious problems with selecting units and managing mouse/keyboard inputs, this is obviously directly related to LAG, but i tested the campaign and Skirmish and is just not as responsive as it should be. There is no way to make mouse scroll faster, and because the game is running on a central server instead of P2P units blink and they get impossible to select adding a very stressful and annoying online experience. 

Otherwise the music, the graphical assets and the mission are fun and great, but this is a NO review for those trying to jump into multiplayer, i don`t see much future to it.

Or buildings health bar wouldn't change until the halfway mark when the building image was chanhed to the damaged version. These are easily fixed though.

But on the otherhand there are many quality of life improvements I would have liked, especially as OpenRA has them. Such as helicopter queueing for rearm when there are more units than pads. Or service depots. 
Units can be queued from the build menu, but not buildings?
Cruisers still have fuzzy accuracy from some angles (but this could be by design).

I expect this to get better as the devs polish this off although I would have liked this on day 1. But I definitely want more modern quality of life features in order to streamline the gameplay. It might be worth waiting for a patch or two.

The AI is complete dog crap. You can have a humvee sitting right next to your units and if NOD comes and shoots it, your units won't return fire. So you have to baby sit every little tiny thing.

The cursor wasn't adapted for high resolution. Everytime you have a bunch of units selected and want to put them next to a barrier or literally anything, your cursor ends up changing to the select cursor even though you're not even touch another unit or building, there's a radius to it that automatically changes it.

10/10 ...would ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND TO ALLLLLLLLL MY FRIENDS!

I'll leave the ""technical reviews"" to others... but here's my personal response:

When Command & Conquer was released, games like Fallout (the original) and Age of Empires wouldn't be out for another two years (1997), Warcraft: Orcs and Humans was already out for a year (1994, DOS), and I had been loving it!!! ...and then Warcraft II came out, along with this new title nobody knew would become EPIC, Command & Conquer.  The year was 1995.  I was 15... and I can say without a doubt, that this game, and it's sequels would go on to shape my gaming experience for two more decades!  I continued the trend with games like Starcraft and Homeworld... but we all know, without a doubt, that Command & Conquer and the original genius that came from Westwood Studios was really the catalyst for all RTS games... even if it isn't ""the first.""

Now, 25 years later... FINALLY!  A REMASTER!  

For anyone who has EVER played Command & Conquer... you will absolutely LOVE THIS REMASTER.  I do... and I can't think of any reason why ANYONE could complain.  If i had to make ONE SUGGESTION... it would be to echo what others have said, and allow ultrawide monitor support in singleplayer.  I'm fine with restricting the resolution in multiplayer, which makes sense.  The only other comment I have, isn't really a complaint, as much as a disappointment.  It's a shame the original data for all the cinematic scenes wasn't saved, so they could simply re-render or upscale from the original files and video... unfortunately that left only one real option, which is what they have done to upscale the video cut scenes.  It looks... bad... but you wouldn't even be able to make out any detail, if they had left the video the original scale and simply stretched it to fit modern resolutions.  It's not worth complaining about.  Who cares?  The game itself is ...dare i say... flawless.  Have fun playing... enjoy the campy cut scenes, and...

[b] Long version: [/b] Command & Conquer Remastered Collection has been my most anticipated game for a while now, and now that it's here I'm happy to say it has exceeded my expectations. A lot of the original team behind the games worked on this remaster, and you can tell. It's a real labour of love.

Both C&C and Red Alert are packed with content, like all the console exclusive missions, all the expansion packs, and a ton of behind-the-scene extras. The incredible soundtrack has also been remastered, and there's new tracks here too, but the originals also remain if you want them.

Graphically, the updated units and terrain designs are good, and on certain stages are actually an improvement. For example, the dinosaurs now look less like floppy rubber toys and more like actual monsters. That said, I still usually play using the classic, blocky look from the 90s, and you can switch between the two instantly.

The FMV sequences have been upscaled using AI, which was the right call when you see the old ones, but there's no denying they're far from HD. It doesn't matter though, the live-action scenes are still great, and the classic CGI are cool time capsules. Plus, for all the jokes about how corny the story is, I honestly think all of these actors did a great job. Frankly, I've seen MUCH WORSE acting in FMV games from the past few years! In fact, some performance (e.g. Kane!) are genuinely incredible.

Overall, it's one of those 'plays how you remember it' remasters, but the core components have been left alone. Even some the minor changes, like being able to queue unit building in C&C, can be turned off if you want to be super-authentic.

If you are an old fan of the C&C & had played both Tiberian Dawn & Red Alert before, you'll feel right at home. The remaster is very faithful with tons of great qol improvements which helps tremendously with the experience. It feels like new really. The visual is downright fantastic & looks so better to look at. Jukebox is amazing to make a custom playlist of your favorite songs which keeps on playing during a match & you already know how legendary the soundtracks of these games are. I believe the enemies are harder too than the original which should prove both fun & challenging at the same time(and of course, frustrating too xP).

Now, If you are a fan of c&c games but never played the original Tiberian/RA games, you still should enjoy this remaster. It has all the essence that made the c&c franchise so great in the first place. I mean more cheesy B rated movie lookalike cut scenes?? Yes, plz!! Absolutely best of the best.

And, those who are completely new to the franchise but are used to other rts, honestly, you may have to put some efforts to come in terms with this game. That's mainly because most of us are overly familiarized with what modern day rts has to offer in terms of functionality/balance/ai. Also, the graphics won't be similar to a modern day rts. So, don't go expecting anything like that. Do remember this game is from 95/96 & it's a remaster; not a remake, so, gameplay's been left untouched completely & these two were not perfect c&c games in that regard. But there's still plenty to fall in love with. Kane will make sure that you'll fall in love with erhm...'him'.

Some important things to know before trying out this classic rts:
- No ""Attack Move"" command for units.
- No ""Building Rallypoint"" can be set(these two options weren't in the original; pretty sure there will be a mod for these in the future).
- AI can be clunky sometimes. Like really really clunky!
- Balancing - both the original TD & RA weren't huge on balancing & there are some imbalanced units in the game. Remember that before diving into multiplayer.
- In skirmish, ai enemies will always have a steady flow of cash all the time.

Personally I haven't faced any technical problems & game's been running smoothly, using my old & rusty yet dependable friend - 4790k, 1070ti, Win 10 ver 1909.  But there has been quite a good numbers of threads on this issue in the forum. So, do check them up.

All in all, this remaster is a pure fan service to the older fans like us. Never actually thought EA could deliver this but I was wrong. May be EA couldn't get it wrong because of Kane. After all,

I just feel that while they remastered music, cinematics (only poorly btw - see original ingame screenshots in the cutscenes... halfassed job done there) and other things, which obviously are all great to have, the gameplay really didn't receive as much love, which should have been the main priority. And before people lynch me, I don't care about graphics. I wouldn't mind playing this remastered collection on the original graphics, but sadly UI, pathfinding, selection of units, rallypoints, responsiveness, AI and much other core gameplay technical solutions just aren't up to 2020's standards. Also RA1 stuttered multiple times on the first soviet mission already, which is inacceptable for a remastered version of a 20+ y/o old game. 
So, even when all these issues would have been solved, one major issue would still persist - the lack of any balance changes for 25 years. Therefore I can't recommend this collection to anyone looking for a good RTS. On the other hand, if you grew up with TD and RA1, this probably might give you good nostalgia feelings.

If you're playing with the remastered skin, sometimes you'll see something that seems a bit out of place. Swapping back to the Legacy skin reminds you that it was just a quirk from the old game that translates a bit oddly onto a remastered skin.

Frank Klepacki lends his remasters, remixes (and covers) of some of the original songs, and they are phenomenal.

The good:
- So much attention in sprucing it up. From the heartwarming DOS-based installer intro to the cutscenes that aren't all pixels there's been so much work put into making it look right. Oh boy!
- So much customisation. Access to OpenRA resources included, Steam Workshop.
-The Audio work. Bringing back EVA's original VA was one thing, making Martin Alper sound good again (rest in peace) was another. Keeping all the sound effects and their distinctions different between both games? Check, mate.
-That Soundtrack update. Frank K does what Frank K does.

The Bad:
- I don't know if this is a feature of my mouse but I keep losing my drag for selecting multiple units. Hopefully it's old man being old man.
- The A.I. Pathing is the same as it always was. Ore Trucks will still go through the enemy base to get that one bit on the far side of their base. AI after the initial storm in skirmish often lose the will to assault you when the funds run out. In retrospect I know we're talking about a 24+ year old game, I know.

They could have recreated the animations and re-recorded the 'live action' parts, but I think it would have lost all the nostalgia that comes with this remaster. The game runs smooth and fast with no lag, which is a vast improvement on the Command and Conquer Ultimate Collection from Origin that didn't even run on my PC.

I did notice a few bugs when changing the games settings, like switching to queuing soldiers, but I imagine this will be patched in time as it is currently only day one.

There are more than a few problems, maybe glitches, and the ai is interesting to say the least.
If you played the original, this is better. If you like rts's and never played these, they are blast from the past with improvements. Don't expect modern gameplay.

I understand its part of the original games design, but dear lord some of the ai interactions are bad. Also hard mode doesnt seem to change anything other than damage ratios. Instead of making a level or skirmish more intense via money or tech, enemy units just do 5 times more damage than you and are twice as tanky.

It's especially nice having the remastered graphics as well as the few changes they did, that make the experience better than usual. (I like my Higher Res Hand of NOD)

There is literally 500 pounds of effort into this release, and it just shows. Probably the best C&C release besides RA2. There are performance issues but are minor for me at least, most likely will get patched. I still recommend it because the package is really good.

You get C&C and Red Alert, plus all the expansions and console missions! It has the dlls open source, and heavily moddable. You get networking as well (LAN not yet included but eventually due to mr.virus) and a map editor. All working under modern machines!

It is exactly what I wanted from a remaster of these games and then some. An impressive and faithful update to the visuals, the original soundtrack intact with remastered and bonus tracks done by original composer Frank Klepacki and C&C cover band The Tiberian Sons, QoL changes like UNIT QUEUES and tons of other great things(bonus videos, workshop support, etc).

Note that it is still TD and RA1 so there are a few issues but those existed in the original and were a product of the time as the genre was still in it's infancy. If you can deal with that then this is a must buy for RTS fans. Hopefully the success of this will give EA a message that C&C deserves to come back with a new instalment and hopefully a remaster of this level if not better for TS and RA2.

75,70357665,english,"It was okay. 
That's about all I can really say. Well, not really. There's plenty to say, and definitely can offer some insight. 
I played C&C as a kid for hours, days, weeks on end! My friends and I loved these games, and couldn't wait for each new one to come out. We tore them up, ate them up, and blasted each other online. The nostalgia for this particular game was super high, and I was looking forward to it.
Then I got it. The cheesy great opening, the ripping good music, the new look to the UI and interface, were all top notch...
Then the gameplay. It, wasn't what I remembered. The game always felt fast and frantic, but I can't imagine we were playing these games back in the day at more than 30FPS. The pace seemed more exact and like it was made for that era. Also there's been 25 YEARS!!! worth of RTS innovation since this game came out. Simple, small, almost necessary quality of life additions could have made this game a bit more fun to go back to. I understand that with that, I will definitely be in the minority here. But no attack move? No way to rally units? No putting buildings on hold to build another thing? And just more and more features that kept adding up that I couldn't overlook, and just overshadowed the sheer nostalgia. 
I'm sure there is a very happy audience out there, ready and waiting for a return to simplistic RTS style, I just ain't it.

The music and soundtrack is the one thing that had the biggest overhaul in this remaster, you'll definitely enjoy the music that Frank Klepacki has redone and the new songs he released.

Do be warned though, this is an old game in a new paint job. That means the AI and pathfinding have weird behavior sometimes, for example the AI stubbernly chases the first unit even though it could attack your other units nearby.

As for pathfinding, if your units are blockading your other units, the latter will take the longer route to the same destination, which might end poorly sometimes when you don't pay attention.

Moreover, some of the intros and outros for every mission have some weird animation quirks due to them being from the 90s.

Lastly, the difficulty scale is a poor excuse of one. Hard difficulty merely increases the stats of the enemy units and decreases them for Easy. Just leave it on normal if you want to have fair fun is my suggestion.

As for other details, the balance hasn't been changed, to the joy and detriment of some. This means the campaign will play out exactly how the old C&C veterans experienced it... this also means the multiplayer is horribly unbalanced as it was in the old days.

In closing, my suggestion for anyone who's a first timer to C&C is to go through the awesome campaigns first.

Not tried multiplayer, mostly purchased for the Campaign. 
It works for me without issue so far but you might want to spend 5-10 minutes going through the options menu and keybinds to tweak it how you want.

Overall as a remaster it is what i expected, a couple of issues but i can see their intent was to hold true to how the game played in the past. This fact is most certainly not for everyone but i wouldn’t expect it to be vastly different else it would be a remake or C&C 5. With this in mind fully expect things like way-points and attack move (Not force attack) to not exist and overall balance to not be there. However the additional build queue is nice to have now! Despite this Tiberian Sun still has more quality of life changes. 

Be prepared to micromanage on a high APM scale if you want to make up the lack of above and poor AI. The kind of pace i find annoying to maintain. I know this may sound negative but i am happy its very similar to how i remember it.

One cons however. I didnt see LAN option, wireless LAN. thats something you could do in the original version, if you have a friend over and you can connect to the router or make a group of it. And invite that person to play with you. Or maybe i am just not understanding this verson so much.

There are few nitpicks here and there like, i am not fan of the grey outline much. And i also think it sucks ""While i do understand you cant have mods in multiplayer because some may hack it, its too bad if its to make the game work better on appearance"" but outside that. Good remaster.

Personal stories aside, initial thoughts:

Things I love:

+ Command and Conquer. FMV cutscene campaigns, goofy pseudofuture/past plots, fun single-player map design. Honestly the best series of singleplayer RTS games ever made.
+ New visuals look appropriate and faithful to old visuals, option to swap between them at will in campaign is perfect and ideal for a remaster.
+ Remastered audio is great, all the songs have fantastic mixing and they're really crisp and clear. Old formats too, if you miss that nostalgic fuzz! Just use the custom jukebox.
+ Lots of QoL improvements for things you forgot annoyed you because you got so used to them. Like queuing. Or being able to switch between right/left mouse unit controls.
+ Runs super smooth, having a bug-free experience, which is rare these days

Things I Don't Love

- The cutscenes were AI-upscaled, presumably because they don't have the original footage or it was filmed on lower-fidelity equipment. This means EVERY SINGLE FMV CUTSCENE LOOKS LIKE WRITHING WORMS. I honestly wish they'd left in the old cutscenes or made them an option. The fuzz and fidelity have a nostalgic quality. (if there is an option to switch, please let me know, I couldn't find it) 
- Skirmish design/AI is still dumb as bricks. While Skirmish is new to Tiberium Dawn, it has the exact same qualities as Red Alert's skirmish: the AI cheats to tech up within seconds of the game starting, then idles forever (or not as forever, on higher difficulties) while you figure out what you want to do. I know AI design, particularly for skirmishing against human players, is hard. But RTS skirmish AI has significantly improved since 1996.

Things I Don't Know/Care About

= Multiplayer. I am not good at any Command and Conquer in multiplayer so I can't tell you if this adaptation is good or not.

I've been following this since it was announced on reddit and literally counted down the last few hours before release.
Both of these C&C games are very special to me and formed most of what I remember as a kid.

The cutscenes have been ""remastered"" pretty well but you can tell it's done using AI.
Certain bits look pretty close to an acid trip and images distort a bit but that's still pretty entertaining.

The game plays great and it's exactly how I remember it being with a few tweaks and features from games later in the series.
Nothing major though, just things like being able to left-click or right-click, unit queuing and the sidebar from the later games with tabs for structures + units.

The AI and pathfinding is a bit stupid but still doing what it did in the original versions which could probably be annoying for some picking this up for the first time.

It still holds up and plays incredibly well, I haven't found any issues performance wise and the remastered textures / sprites look so cool.

The remastered soundtrack is just so damn good and they're super punchy.

Everything just works here.

positives:
-graphics are fantastic!
-qol updates amazing
-the animation even is the same amount of pixel art is phenomenally smooth
-the building in the new taskbar is perfect and finally not attached to the same game logic thread
-the remastered music is mind blowing
-the new G.U.I in all menus and screens is simple yet rich in options
-is stable no crashes so far
-the fmv have been upgraded enough based on the bad source material they had to look very nice
-the modern rts options into the classic feels amazing and fresh
-they even made new awasome installation and configuration intros like the old times
negatives:
- i miss lan but i can wait a bit
- i miss the modern option of rally points in skirmishes but i can live without it
- minor details in the online game GUI and mission selection that can be fixed
- i will die playing this game for the next days in my room now...

-1st of all Frank Klepacki & The Tiberian Sons did a fantastic job with the remastered soundtrack.
-The gameplay is solid for a remastered 1995 game.
-The nostalgic feeling you get from playing the game for the first time since the 1995 version is definitely there and that should be one of the huge reasons you buy this.
-Workshop (huge plus)
-Online play with ELO, yet to be seen long term, but hey its something.
-A ton of added content in terms of behind the scene videos and retakes.
-Added campaigns (back in the days you had to unlock this with cheats or own a console) and even more added campaigns.
-Not a Warcraft 3 reforged launch, stuff works.

Cons

-Game can be hard.
-1995 AI (but I have seen much worse).
-Something to get use to for first time players (new players).
-Can lead to mild frustration in some cases.
-Can give you flashbacks that might lead to nostalgic sadness.....

Welcome back, Commander!

Yes, about time Command & Conquer and Red Alert had finally be remastered on modern PCs! I grew up playing the classic iconic RTS back in 1996! EA and Petroglyph (Westwood) did a great job of remastering C&C and Red Alert for veteran fans and newcomers alike.  

This is a love letter to Command & Conquer fans! I am really grateful for this and EA listened and brought back Command & Conquer! Nostalgia at its finest and C&C still holds up even today. The C&C community is great at making mods and full on mod conversions, let's see the community create works of art! 

I had no problems with the launch and I am really satisfied with this great remaster! The UI has been souped up and is in HD, the graphics can be easily swapped back and forth with the Space bar just like Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition from the Halo: Master Chief Collection on PC! Lots of cool bonuses, a large soundtrack, and map editor! 

Command & Conquer is back in full force and Warcraft III: Reforged failed! I've always loved the Command & Conquer series!

16,70353447,english,"I recommend, but with a caution.

First off, the new models look gorgeous when fully zoomed in. I personally do not fully agree with the artistic interpretation of the sprites (but then again, those old sprites are more a Rorschach test than actual 
assets), but they are well detailed and atmospheric without being overly serious. 

There is also just SO MUCH fan content to get lost in. I knew about the hours of Behind-the-Scenes/B-roll content and remastered music before buying, but still the amount of content is quite impressive. I especially like the B-roll scenes that show HOW the scene exactly slowly came to be and the jukebox that lets me ignore the soundtracks I never heard as a kid, as to not break the immersion and memories.

I also agree with the modern UI and gameplay changes. The gameplay changes are fully optional and IMO necessary to cater both to new customers and allow purists to play it like it was back in the day. In 2020, the old sidebar is obsolete and frustrating to scroll through, being a result of the original 320x200 screen limitation. Removing it and replacing it by the current UI was the right decision to make. The zoom function is something I didn’t expect to be as cool as it is in game either.

The bad? 
There is no way to report bugs without an EA account, which is a problem since there are some serious fps issues going on, which fluctuate wildly for no apparent reason and is reported by a large number of players. There is also a really annoying edge-scrolling glitch, which won’t allow you to use the mouse to edge-scroll, and the Options menu is glitched as well. The Harvester pathfinding is still as attrocious as it always was, and finally, there is no search function for included maps. Considering Red Alert has a couple dozen maps, scrolling get tedious quickly.

31,70353161,english,"Great nostalgic trip!!

The first 10 minutes already made it worth while for me, I felt a flood of nostalgia the moment the loading screen started up - 'press space to update graphics' was just an awesome touch. 

Of course, I wanted to see what the rest was like and in my brief stint here's what I found:

Pros
+ The units, and game itself looks fantastic.
+ The option to change music tracks is great
+ There is an ABSOLUTE TON of content and can pick which maps you like
+ There are a LOT of quality of life improvements, nice to have unit stacking (and the option to remove it if you want that extra bit of nostalgia) 
+ Ran quite well on my six year old laptop 

Cons

Online Mode
- The online mode was a bit iffy at first by saying I had the wrong game (lol) but ultimately worked okay and had no lagg in matches
- Hosting was odd and took me ages to get people joining. On the other hand I got kicked from the few games I did join (though I'll optimistically put it down to there seemingly being no create 'private' game option)

Offline/Skirmish
- Movies didn't seem so upscaled to me which was a bit of a downer considering everything else looked so great (perhaps it was intentional?) 

General
- No attack-move or Rally points really bothered me, some dude sent a tank straight through my base because I couldn't bloody click it 

*****
Overall i think this is a great game that's easily worth the price tag (much better remake than another rts i was looking forward to)

I really hope this game does well and with any luck we might spark enough creative interest for the developers to consider an RA2 remaster in future.

50,70352799,english,"This was a love letter sent to fans and I'm smitten.  While this is the earliest I can ever remember writing a review, I haven't been this excited for a 25 year old game.  

Everything about this remaster is done with care and understanding how fans want to relive their old games.  Command and Conquer is one of the godfather of real time strategy (RTS),  While the mechanics may feel dated to a few, most will love how this classic feels especially with the effort Petroglyph have put into this.  Every aspect of the original games is present but with a beautiful new shine to it.  
The soundtrack is great.  It is a true remix of the original tracks.  If you were a fan of the original music you will probably really enjoy this remaster.
Nothing is missing and they didn't bloat this remaster with anything that didn't already belong.  Fans of the original, it's time to come home.  I really hope everyone experiences this classic game that help start my love for RTS games.

Pros
+Updated graphics look great. 
+Soundtrack is really fun and good.
+Original presentation option
+Not a cheap remaster.  Not buggy on day one.
+Nothing added/taken that wasn't in the original or in the spirit of the original
+No micro-transactions
+Map editor
+Galleries of in-game movies
+Mod/Workshop support
+Updated UI

Cons
-Anyone who isn't nostalgic might be turned off by graphics even with remaster.


It's obvious when a developer throws a remaster out that is just a emulator with a decently updated UI.  And when a develop rebuilds the game from the ground up with modern machines in mind.  Thanks for a proper remaster.  10/10

A few notes:
[list]
    [*]The gameplay is near identical to the original games
    [*]Spacebar smoothly fades between legacy and remaster graphics
    [*]Mouse wheel zooms in and out (for some reason both games start zoomed in, so put this to use immediately)
[/list]

Trying not to spoil anything, the installation screens are present and have been both remastered and altered (to fit 2020) - very nice.

I think people need to set their expectations. The game is nearly as old as I am and hasn't changed much and it shows. This isn't OpenRA either. Given OpenRA is free, I expect plenty of people to play that instead and skip this entirely.
This is a fresh take on the original games and at £17.99, it's worth the money if it's what you want. Sceptical? Wait for video reviews and playthroughs.

59,70350836,english,"This is it. The one that started it all. Although technically not the first, C&C was the RTS that got everything right to elevate that genre from niche to mainstream success. 

It had two attributes that made it so irresistible. First, as I only now realize, it was the soundtrack to my 1996 life. And I still love it. 

But more than anything else, C&C has Kane. Oh boy - how much more fun was it to side with that charismatic loon than to ally yourself with those proper, hewn-from-marble straight-laced GDI guys (I never liked Shepard)? 

Of course it helps that C&C's mix of strategy and fun was - and is - just right: Only one resource to harvest, a nicely balaced tech tree, and truly great choices when differentiating NOD from GDI forces, requiring different strategies for each side. It it immensely playable and fun - without any of that 3D UI stuff that really only adds complexity without any benefit.
And it was followed up by Red alert, the game that is to C&C what 'The Empire Strikes Back' is to Star Wars: the sequel that is actually better than the legend that spawned it. Jaw-droppingly good, and both games are included, along with all expansion packs.

The remastered versions don't really add that much to the old (successful) formula except updated visuals (most noticeable during the cutscenes), and quite noticeable) audio polish - and man, I love that music. And maybe it's just my memory slipping, but the mission briefings seem... too brief. I seem to recall that way back when it was a little clearer what I had to do (e.g. the first commando mission), but maybe I'm just getting old.

So why would you want to get the remasters - after all, you can get the originals as a legal free download? First, of course, is pure convenience: running C&C or RA - even patched - on a Win10 machine is a hassle, even more so if you have more than one monitor. The updated graphics are nice, but let's face it: those corny cut scenes are *still* corny, Kane notwithstanding. So that alone does not justify purchasing the game over again. But it is a nice touch.

More importantly, though: network play. C&C and (especially) RA are incredibly fun to play in multiplayer, and direct network support is so much better than the hassles you have to go though with the originals.

Most importantly: MOD support. Need I say more? This version has full Workshop support.

Also, C&C didn't get *everything* right - and when you play in 'Legacy' settings, you'll immediately recognize what they missed: the right click to assign target / destination. There are some other smaller changes that we are used to, and the ""modernized UI"" allows you to correct those shortcomings, making C&C a whole lot more fun.

The included Map editor is a boon to have, I guess, but appears to be a community effort - it's of questionable quality, looks like a Windows 95 hold-over, and is exceedingly difficult to use. But it's better than nothing, and it can generate maps for both C&C and RA. 

In all - it's one heck of a blast from the past, with just the right amount of polish to enjoy playing all those missions over again.

17,70349815,english,"A labour of love; from the second you boot the program up and are greeted with the old C&C/RA CD Install screen, you can tell the people who made this were having a great time. The visual upgrade is excellent, maintaining the spirit and recognizability of the units with modern-day resolution and detail work that reflects how the units and structures look in the between-mission cutscenes, which is a great touch. It takes a cue from some other prominent remasters in letting you switch the graphics on-the-fly with a button press, so if you were ever curious what a particular blobby pixel on one of the original units was meant to be you can now tell for sure.

The gameplay is the classic formula it's always been; I've been playing a lot of fairly complex RTSes lately (SoASE, the newer C&Cs, etc.) and it's incredibly refreshing to go back to this era. You can build up and fight with a huge army without worrying about cycling through units to select this special ability or that, or trying to level up heroes, or capturing flags/points/whatever- You build a base and cause some carnage. 

I've only dipped into a couple of campaign missions, and the cutscenes are there in their live-action and CGI glory. You can tell they were up-scaled (there is a slight bluriness), but it's a vast improvement over the pixelated postage-stamp size renditions from the originals, and if you have even a little bit of nostalgia for the campaigns then you're going to get hit full force with happy memories.

19,70349786,english,"Blizzard, this is how you do a remaster.

It is damn honorable from EA to give Petroglyph, a game developer studio filled with RTS and Westwood Veterans, the chance to do the remaster on their ""baby"".

And Petroglyph took this chance with much love. The graphics, the soundtrack... damn the soundtrack! Frank Klepacki is a real surplus to this. He has remastered his classic titles like Hell March, Act on Instinct and Mechanical Man. The soundtrack's quality is so incredibly high that you instantly fall in love with it.

As for graphics, Petro (Westwood) enables you to switch between the old pixel-style and the new reimagined HD renders by a button click (backspace). The transformation from old to new looks lovely and makes it obvious, that this got some serious artworks done. 
In terms of graphics you also have to mention the video sequences. You notice they are the original ones but upscaled. The images went through an AI process to have a nearly HD quality. That works surprisingly good except for 3D rendered sequences. 

And there is the nostalgic factor: You see the Westwood logo, you even see the old EA logo in the main menu. I would have not expected that from EA to allow this. As they are a big business and they probably want to save their brand image. A very cool move from EA. You got some real good progress on being less greedy and negative by contributing the publishing of this excellent remaster and give Petroglyph the freedom to realize it.

Lastly, there is another big reason to buy this game: We all want a Tiberian Sun and Red Alert Remaster. We need it. We want it. And damn I am sure Petroglyph want it, too! Make it happen!

A con at the moment is online skirmishes, as they seem to lag hard in the lobby. I also encountered a timeout issue already several times. I do not know if it runs via official servers or via P2P. If it is P2P, then this point is invalid.

It is a remaster of like 1995 game, so if you compare it to the original game,

However, there are still something about this game that ruins the experience.
AI is too good, it micros to dodge your projectiles using scatter command,
but due to bad pathing and lack of attack move command, it is really hard to micro units.

On top of it, the build radius is too small, you have to put a structure right next to an existing structure.
To make things worse, your buildings are way too big
A lot of the times you cannot even place down structures due to limited space.

Well, overall, if you want your childhood memory back, then buy it.

53,70345682,english,"I wouldn't recommend this in it's current state. I'm going to keep it brief in points and I will be comparing this to OpenRA which is free.

- The units feel horrible to move around, the harvesters do some insanely questionable moves, like going around the map to reach the same point.
- Incredibly limited options for a Skirmish, let me have explored map and no fog of war if I want to, when playing with my dad he prefers this when we play together on OpenRA. (How is this not already an option?)
- Mods won't be usable with other people Online even if they have the same mods.
- The Zoom level for 3440x1440 is absolutely horrible, I feel like I'm way too close to my screen. And Ultrawide support currently is average. The Menu on the right works, but then for no reason there's a black bar on the left. Why? Changing to 2560x1440 stretches it in fullscreen, nice!
- The cursor 'fix' in the options doesn't change anything and feels horrible when placing structures or selecting units, they have a huge hitbox. 
- I'm aware that this wasn't in the original but at least add Waypoints for the Barracks and War Factories, I get it's a remaster. But this isn't exactly a crazy option is it? You would never benefit from setting a Waypoint to an enemy base unless they had zero defensive play.
- Everything just feels clunky and ugh. OpenRA has seriously spoiled my expectations for an official release. 
-[strike] Red Alert has like +10% buffs, was that even a thing? I swear different factions had different units. Who wants +10% speed or whatever? I dunno. [/strike] The original did have this, I stand corrected.

There are some pro's though. 

- The AI talks smack, 'No you're the AI!'. 
- The AI actually seems pretty smart on some of it's decisions. 
- The Remaster graphics look pretty damn nice. 

I'm not going to play Campaign, so only the Multiplayer really matters to me. I may keep it in hopes for patches but I could already tell that this just isn't close to OpenRA.

So i like the C&C series. My uncle and I have always played it together, and this was actually the very first video game that I played that wasn't intended for younger kids. I love Command and Conquer as well as Red Alert. However, I do have some concerns about the intent of this game.

Although the AI is mostly the same as before, with a few minor and noticeable debuffs here and there, the games present are pretty good. However as the name stands, it alludes to more C&C games than just Red Alert and the original C&C. Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but I was really hoping to see a Red Alert 2 Remaster within this pack. 

Overall, however, the game is pretty good. I'm glad you guys shifted away from Origin and back onto Steam, and I'm also glad the original cutscenes remained unaltered.

That moment when Blizzard fails to create a proper Warcraft3 Remaster and ignores it's whole community and is officially voted worst game in the history of games. And that EA would come out SWINGING and releases this masterpiece.

In short, buy it, support the developers this remaster has been made with the true C&C community and we need to show them this is the EA we want, the one that cares if this is successful i can't wait for the future remasters RA2/Generals/Tib/Renegade anyone?

If you had fun playing this on your Windows 95/98/XP, you'll have a thrilling refreshing experience again. Playing this in my youth on my father's Windows 98 was a thrilling experience, playing this game day after day with no remorse. 

From the start of the game, or re-playing this in general, it was very nostalgic. When you'll see the Westwood Logo on the screen, you're going to feel it, trust me. 

[h1]Difference from Original and Remaster[/h1]

- The Graphic Overhaul is night and day. You can instantly switch back to Legacy and the Remastered version. I play this at 1440p Resolution 144Hz, it's phenomenal to play this game at that resolution. It's a refreshing experience.
- Audio has been updated as well, including the awesome soundtracks.
- Cutscenes have been updated. They still look dated but it's at least something due to limitations. 
- New Missions and Bonus Content including well worth Expansion Packs.
- Steam Workshop!

Some side notes worth mentioning:
- Game doesn't have a great 'Zoom-Out' feature like Online C&C has. Game feels cramped.
- Monitor went black a few times while playing (Not sure if Driver related.)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you're feeling nostalgic, want to give this game a try when you couldn't play it before. Yes, I recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS games. I will admit this could be a biased review just for the fact this game takes a huge chunk out of my childhood. Just wait until I talk about Red Alert 2, heh.

Look at this that way - original Red Alert after starting would cause a reaction -  ""Wait, that is what I've remembered?!?""
This remaster will cause an expected reaction - ""HELL YEAH, that's how it was""

96,70348502,english,"C&C Remastered Collection is really straight to the point, both as a title and a game - it's a 1-to-1 enhancement and definitive edition of both the original 1995 Command & Conquer and 1996 Command & Conquer: Red Alert. And as an enhancement and definitive edition, it is excellent in bringing back the original gameplay, almost unchanged - with every single piece of bonus mission or FMV ever released for both games with great modern multiplayer functionality.

As a remaster of the original story and FMV, it works really well and improves over what already existed. The original uncompressed FMVs (containing both actor performance and CG elements) were unfortunately never recovered (and may have been destroyed, even), so EA and Petroglyph wise chose to simply upscale what they already had. The results are pretty good, all things considered.

C&C and Red Alert are among the best strategy games ever made, so this gets an immediate and absolute recommendation. It's worth buying as a great gaming package, and is great for online skirmish - and it's also worth buying because if you vote with your wallet, EA might see the demand for a remastered Red Alert 2 (+Yuri's Revenge) and a Tiberian Sun (+Firestorm) and hopefully consider it.

Good:
- The start of the mission is really funny, I for a second I was humming ""Did i really wait for this to get that?""
- The re-generation of the buildings (I would not call it remodeling as I do not feel there are were any extra details so far) is great.
- The remodeling of the units is crazy good! of the units and buildings is amazing!
- Music is great

Bad:
- The cut scenes bring a lot of amazing memories, but in 2020 they look bad, like really bad.
- The vehicles look like they are drifting.
- The units movement is very AI stupid! (runs towards the target as if running on a straight line, when meeting an obstacle use right hand path). Even Red Alert 2 in its own time had a better logic for moving units. We are in an age where AI technology is thriving, we can not have a unit that moves with the logic of 1990's for the sake of keeping the game original!

Pros:
- Command & Conquer (My favorite RTS game, my best C&C game is 1st Red Alert 2, 2 2nd General and 3th Tiberian Son.)
- Gameplay.
- Kane.
- Made by former Westwood Studios (who made Star Wars: Empire at Wars)
- Mammoth Tank (and every Mammoth Tank in all C&C game especially Overload and Mammoth MK.2)

Neu:
- Too much battle and hard to control all unit that just run bypass enemy unit.

Cons:
- No waypoint. (Yeah)
- [spoiler]Technician.[/spoiler]

Overview:
Well, old Westwood Studios have return to remastered this game after never have any real Command & Conquer PC game for 10 year since Tiberian Twilight (that game is bad except for Mastodon unit). Gameplay is much fun and overall chaos at same time. Kane should live again with his new remastered cutscene. This game is made by Petroglyph, a former Westwood Studios that close down since General have been release as who is known for made Star Wars Empire at Wars. I am the fan of Mammoth Tank, as well as every Mammoth-type vehicle like Mammoth MK.2, Overload Tank and Mastodon (and Prism tank & Angry mob which these are OP unit in C&C ever).

Although the game is well funny gameplay, but there are no waypoint unlike RA2 or General (despite have right-click that introduction since General). As well as [spoiler]Technician[/spoiler] is the worst C&C unit ever (after Limpet drone and Brute) in my view.

Also, My Commander Mode (and Tsundere) is back!

I am a huge fan of the C&C franchise, and i had great hopes for this.
But alas EA being what it is, disapointment was bound to happen.

What is wrong :
-The upscaled cinematics are really bad half of the time, especialy on human faces, where it gets very noticeable, it wouldn't bother me if there was a way to have the original versions play, but there isnt
-The ergonomic features of a modern RTS are completely absent : no attack move, no rally point, nothing but bare minimum. In comparaison, the mod OpenRA and many others for the legacy versions inculde such features, and with the game workshop and going opensource, they undeniably expected modders to do all the legwork in this regard. This is bad

Otherwise, the graphical upgrade and audio upgrade is nice, no complaint in this regard, and the core gameplay is still good old c&c, nothing to pester about here.

The game itself is unchanged from how I remembered it, and this is not some nostalgia goggles talking, everything is as I remember only that I no longer have to rummage through the internet to find out how to play a beloved game. 

If you are new to the RTS series and want to give the game a try I highly recommend you get it. This, along with Warcraft, is what started the entire genre. The remaster offers all the campaign missions from way back when including their expansions, the gameplay is the what you'd expect from an RTS game.

You build a base, you harvest resources (1 type) and you build an army. Then its a fight between you and however many opponents you have with the sole purpose of coming out on top. There's no unit abilities, nothing too confusing you need to remember, its just a simple rock paper scissor. As all base building RTS games should be.

On top of it all you have the original soundtrack from the 90's and the remastered soundtrack to keep you company for a long time while playing. Add a dash of 90's cutscenes with real people (the developers of that time) playing characters in the game and you got yourself an entertaining game.

I am incredibly surprised EA didn't sneak anything into the game. It might be too soon to say this, but I'm glad and I hope they continue doing this in the future.
