2017-09-09,0,0,1479,True,Recommended,Great game love it. Do buy. Not sure what all this talk about stream snipe bans is about. But I absolutely love the game. Butttt I think too many people just want to shoot things on it... not really a surv game if everyone plays like that. Would be nice if more people played to win instead of to kill.wish they would add more things like wild animals day/night more weather. different modes like a less rushed version? lots of people panic about the circle would like to have more things to do than chasing circle. I wouldnt mind a longer match if this was a mode Game is early access tho?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a fun playable version of the famous Battle Royale comic series. It mixes survival with FPS with potentual friend acompaneiment with customizable character. The fact that it's still in beta mode has me even more excited about what updates are to come.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I was in a motorcycle in the desert map i had stopped to get a new vehicle a bmw van. suddenly when i stop i notice he continue to hear a engine sound. 2 seconds later I get hit by a man on a Buggy crashing into me still on the motorcycle and multiple broken down cars around me. It made a huge crashing on bending metal and it made me jump. The man shot me dead with two shots. I lost around 20#. These are the details I love to see in all video games. I love the accelerating jump and scream I make and feel in me head as i go over a big hill in my jeep wondering if I would make it.

2017-11-22,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,"How a promising game became a cashgrabAfter about 150 hours played since 2017 June i just can't recommend this game. I did fell in love it first because it was so promising but now it's just nothing but a cheap cashgrab by the developers.After about a year since it was first released at steam the gameplay still feels clunky the servers are still crap with low tickrates. And back then it wasn't that much of a problem because it was an early acces title and there were attempts and communication from the devs that they're working on fixing the game.Since the past few months all i can see that we're getting weapons skins more crates more cosmetics a new map which is a great thing in itself but this game is rotten in the core and from where i stand it seems like the devs are milking out what they can from this game before it collapses. They have no intentions (or capabilities) to adress the most urgent issues so they just blind us with ""shiny new stuff"". But it isn't enough. Ask yourself when was the last time we did get a patch that improved stability servers or anything that about the core of the game and not just cosmetics/new map?I really want to love this game because when it works it's so much fun and i can't mention another game where winning feels so good like in PUBG. So please devs prove me wrong and make this into the awsome game that it deserves to be.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-15,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,Great concept but technical failings (frequent crashes lag spikes and connection issues) will mar the experience. Can recommend only when it enters a reasonably playable state.2018 update Game is much more stable but the experience hasn't stabilized by much mechanics feel janky now and with the introduction of paid DLC I fear the developer has taken a turn for the worse. Still do not recommend if battle royale modes are your thing I would suggest a more polished experience like Fornite or BO4 Blackout.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-26,0,0,1404,False,Recommended,I've gone back and forth on whether to recommend this or not but the bottom line is this it's a challenging game (both in physical gaming ability and the strategy necessary to outsmart other players' tactics) and it's fun to play. Is this a AAA game? Not quite but I think it will be there soon. However it also doesn't currently have a AAA price tag either.Are there major glaring issues with the gameplay? Yes namely the server lag when there are still 80 100 players left alive. That being said my most recent matches since the official 1.0 release have had very little or no lag at all the entirety of the match. Within the first day or two of release the lag was as bad as ever so I think the large influx of new players has tapered off and combined with fixes released for the game/servers the lag is at an all time low.Playing on NA servers I have not knowingly come across any hackers. I also usually watch my deathcams and have not seen anything that would suggest I have been killed by any hackers. That being said it sounds like hacking is still rampant and needs a more permanent solution.Crashes also need a permanent fix. Overall I believe this has been improved over the past couple months but I have still experienced a few game crashes that seem to have been completely random.Again the driving factor for me is whether or not this is a fun experience overall in spite of the issues with the game. That answer is still 'yes'. If you can survive the first 30 90 seconds of intermittent server lag (if/when it actually occurs) the next 20 30 minutes you spend fighting to the death are worth dealing with the minor frustrations that still exist.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-30,0,0,56,False,Recommended,PUBG is for the most part an amazing example of how to correctly do a survival shooter that mixes difficulty tension strategy and most importantly fairness. You might never get a Chicken dinner but you don't need one to feel like you've had a satisfying game. It's an almost perfect blend of what makes these types of games so popular to play and watch and if it wasn't for a large amount of bugs and performance issues the game would be up there with the best multiplayer games steam has to offer.I can't say that I have actually personally experienced many bugs at least bugs that I can remember. But from the feedback all over the internet I can't refute that the game is actually bug free the game is in early access and I wholly expect to find bugs eventually. Rather my largest issue with the game has been performance it might as well be unplayable for me as most of the time I get stuck on a loading screen until a couple of minutes after I hit the ground. I will still highly recommend this game because without this issue the game is fantastic and because other than that the game runs amazingly. A friend of mine runs this game at nearly constant 60 on his potato of a PC even if it's on minimal graphics. If you want to play this game I can only recommend you make sure you either have an SSD or a good HDD I have a great PC and my friend I mentioned earlier has a potato. But his HDD happens to be faster than mine. Without a fast SSD or HDD this game just wont load fast enough. I can't say anything else about performance because despite what I've heard this game can run on a wide vareity of PC's.Chinese players are also another problem I've heard being brough up I've seen them and there definitely needs to be a region lock for them because from my experiene Chinese players that region hop are hackers. But it's not a massive invasion killing the game like I've heard. I'll hear a couple occassionally for 30 seconds before the game starts and never see a Chinese player again. That being said you need to region lock the Chinese for the sake of fairness and balance.The game has been given a lot of money and it has been in development for a long time now. Still give the game a break. Developing a perfect netcode for a game that is designed to handle 100 people on a surprisingly large map and bullets in real time on top of that. Is actually a surprising challenge. Especially when you're doing that for far more servers than the average game has in spite of not being a large publisher. The game is technically Korean and as a result Korean servers will get priority fixes as well as other Asian regions. Games take a surprising amount of time and resources to develop especially when there's a massive list of things you need to fix and add. If you aren't prepared to deal with the issues a game still in development has then wait for the game to be in a more finished state.tl dr/final thoughts The game is great and it's fantastic when it works perfectly. It's not for everyone but you don't have to be a survival game buff or a god at shooter games to have fun. It's brought down by a number of issues most of which are fixed by having a better computer or ISP. The game is still in development and the most important factor you should consider when buying this game is whether or not you are prepared to deal with the issues a game in development is going to have. I definitely recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However when you take a step back and actually look into it you can see that PUBG is actually beating the outta you. It's the abusive relationship trap. You had good times with it and geniunely believe that PUBG can fix its act and be better. However it keeps doing the same thing to you each update is a brutal beating hidden behind false affection. Example would be the recent Event Pass. You think that it's a good idea its a box of chocolate....with a fist coming right at you after you buy it. BlueHole is sticking its nasty practices as a mobile game company into PUBG. I will still keep playing PUBG but I cannot recommend it to new players.

2018-07-24,0,0,607,False,Recommended,"300+ Hours Played. A huge thumbs up. Despite all the tweens raging about the same things over and over ""OPTIMIZE SERVERZ MAP SELECT FIX BUG"" this game is actually HELLA fun! Every match is thrilling every kill incredibly satisfying and when you actually win a game you will feel a wave of emotion throughout your entire body. How many games offer that? If you ever played and enjoyed a first person shooter then you will love this game. If you have ever wanted to try a Battle Royale game look no further. As for the negative reviews 90% of them are trolls/teens. Here are their most common complaints BUGS/CRASHING My game crashed TWICE in the 300 hours I played.MAP SELECT If you don't like the desert map you can literally back out of the match with zero penalty and join another match.No clue why they keep whining about NET CODE I get the lowest pings I've ever gotten in any game I've ever played with PUBG. HACKERS The ONLY legitimate complaint. Yes there are hackers just like in every FPS ever made. Do hackers ruin the entire game? Short answer No. Is it annoying to be killed by a hacker? Short answer Extremely.Is Bluehole addressing this issue as one of their primary objectives? YEP.I give this game a 95/100.

2018-07-18,0,0,250,False,Not Recommended,I like playing with my friends and one of them bought this game in alpha about a year ago. He convinced me after harrassing me for weeks to buy it as well so we could play together. I didnt have much faith but the thing that convinced me to buy it in the end were the promises bluehole made around those times. The game was going to have full mod support and dedicated servers. This made the game way more interesting to me. The first few weeks i played but it was barely running at all. This improved over the course of time to a certain extend. As you see ive played for almost 250 hours now before finally giving up on this game and bluehole as a company.A year later the game still runs like absolute garbage and so do the servers. Bluehole have been ignoring community suggestions and are silent regarding any of these issues for months now. They do not admit it or try to fix it at all. Servers suffer from horrible desync and getting 60fps steady on high setting would need a $2k rig at least because of the poor coding quality.I could probably look past this to some extent when the rest of the game would be great but unfortunately its just not. The only updates we are getting are skins. Rewards for playing are points to spend on loot crates. When you can finally afford a few you have to pay for keys to open them. Really bluehole? Those points are literally the only reward system and dont get me started on your BS season pass. Secondly there is no sign of dedicated community servers an update or ETA is it even on the roadmap anymore? Mod support is something I'm laughing at I ever believed in. Bluehole could not even pull that off if they tried. TLDR Ignorant company ignoring all the issues makes for a game suffering from all the t you would expect from an early access game made by a small studio.. Except they are making literal billions and development has come to a standstill. The game in its current state is an embarrasment and i'm now one of many who have quitstill 30 bucks for 250 hours isnt abysmal only if half of the time wasnt spent rendering /s,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Honestly the graphics are terrible even though this is a battle royale game and the gamesd you can compare this to arent the best either and I only play on the lowest settings!

Dupa ce am invatat sa ma joc mai bine am hotarat sa caut niste persoane cu care sa imi fac o echipa doar pentru fun! si asa i am gasit pe Vanilie si pe Rares doua persoane foarte de treaba.Tot respectul pentru ei!Din fun am inceput sa ma joc din ce in ce mai mult pentru ca imi place jocul mai ales ca in fiecare saptaman vinea cate un update nou pe care il asteptam mereu!Acum jocul este si mai bun sunt mai multe mape jucatori buni deci daca vrei sa devii mai bun trebuie sa te joci foarte mult!Jocul isi merita bani pentru ca te pune in niste stari de fericire maxima cand castigi un meci dar sa nu uitam si de partile rele cand mori si devi nervos atunci mai da i odata Start si asa reintri intr un meci nou unde poti sa iti repari greseala din meciul precedent si asa poti sa devii mai bun ! Recomand jocul tutrol persoanelor care au mai avut intalnirii cu jocuri FPS deoarece te ajuta experienta din alt joc in accest joc.Grafica este unde foarte buna chiar daca uneori mai ai si lag sau nu se incarca texturile developerii fac tot ce pot pentru a face jocul cat mai bun si cat mai bine optimizat!Comunitatea este una foarte de treaba poti da de jucatori care sunt tari poti da de jucatori buni etc.Poti da si de jucatori cu CHEATS doar stai calm daca le ai dat report in scurt timp o sa primeasca ban deoarece anti cheat ul este unul foarte bun!Recomand Jocul din tot sufletul!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Every game is different sometimes you're a pan wielding god and other games you will be target practise for other players. This game is fun to play on your own however it really shines with friends. Me and my friends have spent many an evening just playing squads and having a blast every time. Some games we will really try hard and go top 10 or even get a chicken dinner !

This is a better looking and more fun version of King of the Kill. You can open your crates by just playing the game and earning a reasonable amount of credits per match. The health system is more simplistic than that of H1Z1. There is no bleeding to worry about. Overall I'm having a blast playing.

Playing in a squad makes it worthwhile but trying to go into a squad solo don't expect anything from it. The main issue this game has is a HUGE influx of asian players that are taking advantage of the ping difference. Game needs to be region locked BADLY.

2017-08-16,0,0,348,True,Recommended,Pros Pubg is one of the greatest in gaming put a 100 players in a match and let them survive it is one of the best games of 2017 and deserves most of its attention the gameplay is great the guns are great and its constantly being patched by the devs. Theyare also constantly adding new maps guns and other awsome additions to the game it is one of the best multiplayer games a gamer can ask for and if you play with friends the fun doubles. It also has one of the best gun mechanics in a game and bullet drop is so good and it fells so rewarding to kill a guy with a sniper that is about a km away.Cons Ok i will stop sucking this games it is amazing and all but for gods sake make the maps smaller and fix the lag bluehole like please this game is almost unplayable at the begining and plz fix your loading screens and i will remind you again make the maps ing smaller and why the are the skins not rewarded when you do something special why the do i need to open crates please dont go down CS GO path.Final thoughts OK this game is amazing and is continuasly being patched with somefixes here and there this could be an almost perfect multiplayer and for gods sake make the maps smaller bluehole.SCORE 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A long time staple in the Battle Royale community this man single handedly pushed these types of games into the spotlight. What originally started out as a mod for Arma 2 then eventually H1Z1's KOTK. This is the first true standalone battle royale game of this quality and scale. Although this ghme isn't perfect its fantastically fun the action packed into this game never ceases to amaze.

Obviously have alot of issues with servers sometimes crashing you dont render buildings wierd clunky bugs in the map that when your driving can just outright kill you I recommend this game for the fun of it. One of the best games in the genre of Battle royal survival fps games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-02,0,0,748,True,Recommended,"This is an excellent game to play with friends. While still excellent in Solo mode playing with one to three other friends is an absolute blast! While still imperfect it is the best of the available ""battle royale"" genres.The shooting mechanics are similar to the hyper realistic ARMA series. That is either highly appealing or appalling. I quite enjoy it despite the immense learning curve.The only downside to this game is that practice makes perfect and this game won't allow you to practice aside from throwing your life away by landing in hot zones to engage with other players who are either just like you (trying to learn and practice the shooting mechanics) or confident in their skills enough to tangle with the worst (and far more competent than you). So prepare for some frustration in the learning curve.However there is always the next game. Which is what keeps me playing. There's always another chance to get a chicken dinner!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-06,0,0,101,False,Recommended,"The birth of this game was also the death of H1z1 and the reason behind it is so clearThis game is far better from every single point of view. For example it has better graphics better fights and no filthy ""h1z1 car mechanics"" and there is much more. This is literally the ONLY battle royale game to this date that is actually skillbased and fun compared to laggy H1z1 and the minecraft look alike game Fortnite which only purpose is to scam 12 year olds of their parents money. In all seriousness though. This game is too much about the ""looting phase"" and there is little to no fighting ever occuring. When those short and rare fighting moments actually happen though they are the most thrilling and exciting thing in the battle royale game world. But they are just too rare. And that is literally the only downside to this game. People are scared to fight and it is not as rewarding to fight than to just loot.The game is just too slow in comparison to Fortnite and H1z1. Meaning that the looting phase takes too much time. What the developers could do is to balance weapon somewhat and make the players not rely as heavily on attatchments and medic supplies as they do today. Another option may be to shrink the maps removing the open spaces between the major cities. This could lead to less long range battles and thus maybe more clusmy and messy battles on the other hand.I would give the game 10/10 on a good day without a doubt.But to be honest it depends on so many different variables so a more accurate rating would be 7/10.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-03,0,0,333,True,Recommended,Im not gonna lie this is the first time ive done a review on steam! I heard about pubg from various people mostly my friends about how awesome the gameplay was and let me tell you it is exhilirating! Seldome do games have my heart pumping with adrenaline and my fingers tingling while crouched in dense grass as the game circle gets ever smaller and smaller!The game is still in its early stages but the developer has promised more updates that will not only make the game infinitely better but also offer a varied experience through new maps and possibly game modes. This game is all about stealth and cunning. When you first start off you are dropped via airplane (c130) into this island with a 100 other people. It is your job to find a safe haven to loot and find as many weapons/health packs as you can. The thing that makes this game great is its weapon realism. Weapons work like how they are in real life and when other players start shooting you can literally make out where they are based on the echo of their gun shots. The only gripe i have about this game is that there are certain bugs that still annoy the living heck out of me. One of those things are there are no vaulting animations. When you encounter a barricade or a wall in this game and try to jump over it most the times your character can get stuck because you cant jump high enough to clear the obstacle even though your not scaling some 10 foot wall but a mere picket fence!Despite all that i think this game is wonderful and should be on your TO BUY LIST!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-11,0,0,268,True,Not Recommended,"Cannot really recommend this games as it is really rng heavy from the loot to the zones. Everyone saying that this is tactical and skill based shooter are talking poop. Also the performance on AMD cpu is really subpar as my framerates fluctuate from 25fps to 100fps usually when a firefight occurs it drops drastically hindering the experience.You can say that ""this is an early access so deal with it"" but a game should be somehow playable without the fps fluctuation with a PC that exeeds the system requirements easily. Even more so when it implements microtransactions.Of course no one would play a game for 140+hours if it was really bad. I have had fun with the game mainly because I have been playing with friends but fun nonetheless. The problem for me is just that all the bugs FPS drops and glitches start to wear you down as time goes by. So now the game mainly invokes feelings of frustration and anger as the small things start to ad up.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have played both the standard and test servers with these settings with no issue at all and apart from a few very minor graphical glitches all is well.Im loving the gameplay and running around trying to loot good weapons to stay alive has been really cool and at times heart pumping. Hiding while cars and jeeps drive past and sneaking into buldings never gets old.Im not sure why so many are getting such poor perfomance from the game on thier systems but mine is by no means a gaming rig and im running 1080p with very high in game graphics settings just fine considering its still in alpha at the moment.so far i have no regrets buying the game and look forwards to seeing it grow and get new maps and weapons ect,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

These reviews make me laugh they complain about the game when the people who wrote them have literally played them in the past couple of days. At the moment yes it is hard to run but they are working on improving fps which is seen the test servers. This game is fun to play with friends and strangers though can be ruined by hackers if the devs don't keep updating the anti cheat. Soon (surprisingly) kill cams are now added (i really hope this isn't the next ing CoD) however this is going to make it harder for the hackers to hide themselves so the game is slowly getting rid of them. People do get salty in this game cause no one wants to watch your teammates play if they die (It aint csgo so if you die early go watch youtube or some cause you are gonna be waiting for atleast 15 mins if your teammates aren't dumb. Although this game is fun listening to how people complain about hackers is funny as hell they will suggest dumb things such as ""if people hack they shouldn't be able to play any steam games it ruins the commuity"".

2017-08-10,0,0,313,True,Recommended,It's a great game everything that I wanted that DayZ wasn't. Very polished for an Early Access game and content is consistently added. Only issues are with the developer's communication with the playerbase. They added microtransactions which they had promised they wouldn't. For me it's not a problem because they're purely cosmetic. It's an early access game they need to test stuff before it is released. Of bigger issue to me is their constant coddling of streamers and handing out unfair bans. Though is will never affect me as stream sniping and honking around streamers is a bit childish it's not banworthy and PU has gone about this the wrong way.It's a great game and if you're morally okay with supporting a developer that may break some promises and handle PR poorly you should buy it,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You get knocked The point of the game is for your teammates to get you back in time but in 99.99999% of the cases you get finished. Instantly. Its no fun.It should be removed to finish people. The people shouldve taken their sight away so they cant scout and have to wait. You always just loose the fun when 3 of youre friends gotta run while youre dead one person is always forced to watch because people camp for 10 minutes straight in a house. They literally dont move and dont make a sound.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-15,0,0,166,False,Recommended,PUBG is a Multiplayer based game which involves you a player who will be dropped in to a land by a plane with another 90+ players. You're main objective is simply be the LAST PLAYER ALIVE. Aside from all Battle Royale Games Genre this is is quite unique from others. Yes there all the game mode but each on is different style and gameplay. 1.Getting into the game.You'r gonna be in a plane along with many other players with you and have the choice to get out of the plane to drop any landmark you wish to go for a plan to commence. Once you dropped you'r first thing to do is FIND A GUN Because there is a chance a player has landed next you and have to defend yourself from any danger ahead. First thing is rush to the nearest building that either may provide you with a gun or possibly small supplies which is helpful for any type of unexpected scenario. And remember luck determines on what the building is hiding a gun for you or might have nothing at all.2. Loot hunting.For a higher chance to survive you must grab any possible Medkits drinks/painkillers which is considered ESSENTIALS to porgress the game easier. And ofcourse having a gun is a MUST or whatelse you have a choice of rushing to the enemy bare hands. You can easier be bothered of looting every house you find since it can be a small waste of time or simple kill a person who has looted since most likely they have done the looting for you. And one more thing The best place to every get loots that will EXTREMELY have HIGH VALUE to increase your situations tactically are Loot boxes that can be dropped from the plane after the game progresses with time. HOWEVER remember a dropped loot crate means MANY player will try to get it as well. And some will use it as some sort of bait. So better check the area for any suspicious Vehicle/bushes/buildings and mountains since they have an angle to snipe you.3.Equipment Value. Armours have levels of quality which how they absorb and levels reach from 1 3 and level 3 helmets are now ONLY can be optained by loot boxes. Guns however... sometimes can be a preference and so far the BEST/ MOST FAVORED gun is the m 416 since its considered as the BEST assualt rifle for all situations. Snipers are powerful in early games but gets useless in the last final circle. and the game has attachments who helps to upgrade your guns and favour its gimmicks like recoil vertically or horizentally. Its your choice yo decide. Also it varies from sights from Red dot to x8 scopes even a 15x which is only for sniper rifles. so yeah.4. The circle. The circle is VERY IMPORTANT to keep up with so always remember to watch the map from time to time to know where is the next circle to plan your next move. Because the game has something up its sleeves. Something called the RED ZONE. Once your in it FIND SHELTER is a must to survive the dropping bombs of death. and knowing the circle before your enemy will give you the advantage to think your time which is the BEST spot to hide and fire at will. Because if not. Your gonna die before you know it as the enemy will be in various spots which will most likely a death for you.btw don't player in asian servers cause Chinese hackers are always there to kill you. Stay in either EU or NA servers since there most likely away from hackers that will ruin your experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-18,0,0,46,True,Recommended,Alright i'm going to start by saying don't forget that this game is in early access and everything will improve eventually but for now this is my review.First optimization is terrible servers are all ed up like the AS server is closer to me and has a ping of 99ms while the EU server has 137ms BUT the AS server glitches and lag spikes are so ing frequent that its unplayable but EU is completely fine which i feel to be super ing weird.Second driving is fun but when there are bugs that stop you in the middle of a field even tho there is nothing there is really ing annoying it's like driving on a highway then you crash into the ground.These are my complaints and thats all By the way im running on a RX 480 8GB THAT IS WATER COOLED AND RUNNING AT 1340MHz or 1.34GHz 8GB of RAM a i5 6500k and i have the game on a SATA SSD but im running on medium thinking .but seriously buy this game its super fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The kills are satisfying to get especially when you snipe someone 500 meters away. The gun mechanics are spot on because of the realistic bullet drop and sounds. In terms of optimization I get 100 fps constant and never dip below 60 that's probably because of my beefy rig. I actually have not come across a cheater but I probably will in the future. The only thing I can say I don't like is random people in your squad that don't even speak English like how am I gonna understand your callouts.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And all the microtransactions put in place since launch have been rediculous and quite frankly i think the game is heading in a bad direction although a very fun game with friends it gets very boring playing by yourself and even after a couple of hours it gets boring with friends and the fact that after sanhok came out they removed the feature that allowed you to choose which map you wanted which is utterly absurd overall in the state it is in right now i would rate it around a 5.6 its unfinished even after a year of open beta and half a year being fully released i woulds till recommend this game however because it is fun for the first couple of hours by yourself and with friends the game can last a lot longer but be careful.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I don't have time to practice handling all the weapons learn every nook and cranny of every map and then work out strategies. Still for me PUBG delivers a solid gameplay experience with some kinks but all the while very enjoyable. I can try to play sneaky I can try to play hard I can play however I want. And even though there are sometimes weeks between my play sessions every trip into PUBG is a thrillride.I really want to praise the devs which are doing a great job to GIVE US A LONG LASTING EXPERIENCE. Yes they had huge inital success and could have hired hundreds of programmers. But then pubg corp would have to shut down after a year because they cannot pay the salaries anymore. Instead they accept that their product does not improve as fast as it theoretically could but stick to a promise I read Playerunknown give PUBG will be maintained actively for 10 years. So all those dollars they made in the inital year have to last a while.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-17,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I think it is a great game to play with your friends any time of the day and you really can't get bored of it. I find this game VERY addicting and tricky at first. Just ignore all of the negative reviews. They are completely Butt Hurt because they can't play the game well. This game is very similar to Day Z also available on the Steam Store. It is a Battle Royal Game. However this is an Early Access game and you shouldn't expect too much from the game yet. If your a big fan of the ARMA series then you'll absolutely love this game. The maker of the Arma Series made this wonderful game. If you have a spare $30.00 then I would recommend this game all the way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-18,0,0,248,True,Recommended,Best game i've ever played makes me want to play more and more everyday. Such a good stratgey game that constantly has you thinking even with only one map it seems so large. Every game is completely different and amazing if I die or not because every time I know i'm getting better. I still can't believe this game is great and is still in early access beta. This game will have life for the next 2 3 years and I can't see myself getting burnt out quick. For $30 considering how in a month you make that back on cases and start making profit can't beat that anywhere else.

2017-12-16,0,0,1069,True,Recommended,There s this number it changes at times it also gets higher more often then lower . What is it ? # 2 181 396 In Game right now as 02 25 HRS 2017/12/16. That s two million one hundred eighty one thousand three hundred ninety six people currently playing the game. PUBG (Source Guinness world Records) 1.) Fastest time to sell 1 million units for steam early access. 2.) Fastest steam game to gross $100 million 3.) First video game to to reach 2 million concurrent players. 4.) Most actively played game on steam with a record smashing of 2.64 million players at one time with Dota 2 coming in at 1.23 million players concurrently respectively. 5.) most concurrentl players on steam early access game . 6.) most concurrent players on steam for a non valve videogame. 7.) First non valve videogame to be most played game on steam. NOTE These are Guinness world records not awards. PUBG has also received numerous awards. Also PUBG has made constant improvements versus other early access games that are still not close to having their VERSION 1.xx near final release. All the negative reviews I see are peoples opinions and some are rightfully respected but what I can not respect or which ones I won t respect is that when see multiples' of copy cat reviews which all that do read negative are all of a sudden negative for issues occurring since back when people have started back to the beginning of their 100 hours. Even more hours going back to when the ones complaing about alot of the issues which have been prevalent in discussions reviews google searches etc. Simply put I m not going to play a so called crap game from me seeing what some people are saying calling bad crap game for 100+ hrs then hop and a band wagon to throw in snarky reasons that are trivial in their attempt or an attempt to un fairly are trying to bring down the rating in m opinion of one of a sincere game developer and with their team whom genuinely shows effort constantly listening to feed back you can get support if needed .Also they are not trying to make you gamble with micro transactions or up charge you make a quick buck. Also they're not trying to screw over early adopters of the game with the release of 1.0 coming this week. If this shoe fits wear it . My cons of PUBG are as follows I also know the main issues plaguing the game right now the most serious is cheaters . Also can we talk about region locking to have teamates to communicate to such as english speakers with english speakers whether from asia to australia and the USA. This is a team game after all isn t it? Then let s talk about how stupid it is that i have to constantly ask people if they have a mic so I can work with them as a team.It s 2017? Isn t it ? So why isn t it addressed that the game isn t able to put mics wiht mics no mics with no mics together also did I mention cheaters ?!? My pros OF PUBG are as follows Addicting Fun Team driven Communication driven Every game is different for me Entertaining Mild to wild random personalities Able to meet new gaming buddies You get to have chicken dinners all the time I recommend this game and would recommend PUBG 10 out of 10 times for the pc.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Don't believe those theories you hear about them keeping the cheaters so they can buy marketplace items for more profit. It's utter BS and stupid (and very time consuming for a said cheater which makes no sense in today's world). This is a great game that I would highly recommend as long as you don't have a crappy computer. An Intel i5 2500k and GTX 760 should be fine on optimal settings 1080p.

2018-12-23,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,This is my review for a very unfair gameI am a kid who can rarely buy my games and one of the few times I did was when I bought this game PUBG I thought I would enjoy this for as long as it had a good player base time when by eventually it became one of most played games then even more time went by until became a reasonably skilled player I was pretty good a controlling recoil got myself some wins and a few sketchy kills one day I thought to my myself I wonder if I get banned I ignored it considering a game like this will have real problems and actual hackers but in the next three days I was banned permanently a few tears were drawn but then I realized wow a game like this banning players for a few sketchy kills ( i think) at that time this game was suffering defeat through the hands of fortnite and I see why this game introduced loot box systems and things along those lines it deserved to die . This is a long review but at the end of the day i would really recommend just buy another BR game tons are coming out and we already have some amazing ones i will end the review here.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-12,0,0,841,False,Recommended,You either love this game or you hate it. I've been playing this game since early access and it has gotten much better since then but there's still a lot of improvement this game requires in order to be on the same level as other shooters. The worst part of this game is the netcode. In high action situations (lot of people battling) you will get desync. Doesnt matter how baller your PC is or how many hundreds of dollars you pay per month on your ISP desync will happen. The game code is there but Its impossible to get 144FPS constant unless you're playing at Ultra Low graphics and you don't hot drop.All that being said this is still on of my favorite gaems to play currently. How the metagame has developed over all the balance patches makes this game interesting. Up until the last balance patch ARs/SRs/DMRs were by far the best guns to have in any situation. Now the shotguns will 1shot people much more prevelantly and SMGs as a whole are very strong even in mid range situations. Optics are very interesting now since they added 3x and 6x. You don't have to grind for that Red Dot and 4x/8x or you are useless like before.The best part about this game is the fact that you can choose your playstyle. Its not like COD where you have to play Hyper Agressive or you're a bad. You can play super risk averse and do well. To be a great PUBG play you need to know how to be risk averse but still be able to bang like clutching a CS GO match.TLDR 7/10 good game but it could be way better if PUBG corp had better devs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,125,True,Not Recommended,This is one of those games that can be super exhilarating when you reach the top 10 and you're duking it out for that chicken dinner. I put some time into it on account of a friend's recommendation but it just isn't for me.I regularly find myself looting for 10 20 minutes only to die in a gun fight. I find the gun mechanics for this game to be extremely frustrating with little feedback on improvement. I try to shoot just like how I see them do it on youtube and I can't seem to get enough shots to land. Sure I secure a kill now and then but regularly am I outgunned at longer ranges by people with crappier guns. The gun mechanics feel like your arms are pool noodles and you're trying to hold your aim steady while the enemy is landing every bullet on you. Often you will have a long 30 minute match to die from some unknown location. You will never get this time back. Playing with friends is probably the best way to go since you'll have communication. However because the looting is super random or if you have played so long you know some of the guarnateed loot locations you can find yourself without a proper weapon to help your team. The worst being if you die to some suicidal guy at the beginning of the match and have to watch your three buddies play for 30 minutes on spectate. The survival factor is great it really is but it quickly becomes a rinse and repeat with little depth. If you can aim with these unweidly weapons great you'll make for some impressive youtubing. However I would strongly recommend you pick up a game with a little less RNG determining how much time you'll be wasting. I really don't know how latency factors in when there's 100 people but I know there have been lots of rumors of cheaters and when you just get smoked by some guy with a shotgun from super far away you kind of scratch your head and ask wtf am I doing.Also they won't let you mute global voice so you have to hear people scream and try to annoy you. It hides behind the alpha sign but we all know this game won't be done for a couple of years and when that happens the player base will have lost interest and moved on. Seriously like 90% of games out there. Play solo at your own risk. It's a camping fest until you've dumped hours into this game to adjust for the aiming mechanics and then it's luck.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So I buyed the 10 $ Pass to support this great game.At last I would like to give out my referral code for new players.Referral Code ""EACQAS4XTM2"" &gt I would really appreciate it if you use my referral code we both will get awesome stuff like skins and Ingame currency",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-20,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,Well I'll give the game credit where credit is due this game is popular.But unless you want to play with your friends because all they play is this game i wouldn't recommend it. Terrible optimization and ok graphics.Gameplay wise winning/losing is dependent on luck. Of course aiming is important but at the end of the day whoever lands in the luckiest place with the best weapons/vechiles/armor/backpacks/medkits usually wins. I also dislike the extremly slow pace of the game.Now the real reason why i recommend against this game is the 30$ PRICE TAG this game defintley doesnt worth 30$ for a game with 2 maps and a solo/group mode.Fortnite Battle Royale is free and it includes more features than PUBG.If you want a battle royale game get fortnite save your money,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-24,0,0,37,True,Recommended,Here i was thinking this was just another FPS multiplayer until i actually played it. I was drawn off of multiplayer shooters like CSGO and similar online games because of the community and how competitive it got. I just wanted to have a fun experience and this game is bringing me back. Whats good about it is that the players dont have a rank system and you start off with nothing but your fists. You are first seen in a crashing jet and when it jets over the island it will give you time to choose where you start by jumping out of the plane. the only problem with this is that people leave at the same time and there could be like 20 people in the same area making it a hunger games simulator and you would just die as soon as u landed.The game itself is bugged but thats to be expected from an early acc. game. I also dont like how quickly they shrink the map. if you are too far away because say if you wanted to start at the edge of the map. you only got a few minutes to sprint towards where the border will be. i know thats to prevent players from doing nothing but its too short i feel. i have experianced lag spikes mid game dropping to zero frames and getting killed. Its fixable tho. im not picky or about it.I do wish for there to be a kill cam or something. when im checking corners in what i think is a empty town. bam im dead. I dont know where it came from and would like to know.Finding guns and equipment is a good concept and if they add a strict anti cheat policy and keep polishing the game and keep adding cool stuff. It has alot of potential. Overall Go for it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

People who say the lag makes it unplayable are wrong the lag is only a 30 second long period once youve dropped to the ground and even then you can still walk around. You can have lots of fun in this game especially in squads with friends and you can do crazy stuff with the vehicles like flips and rolls of cliffs and hills. 9/10 would most likely buy again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm in South Africa and this is the best update i have seen with my below minimum cpu requirement i3 220 cpu but gtx 970 and 200 240 KBps internet speed. You guys got what you want so bad the graphics quality and a few other things but all you care about is the cheaters/hackers and decide to give negative reviews on a game that has so many players playing that the game went down a bit and devlopers had to fix it. I think they are doing their best at trying to ban/stop all the cheaters/hackers. They probably don't want to loose their reputation of the amount of playing e.t.c. if they do then the game won't be much talked about on the internet loosing people hearing reading about about and thinking or trying to buy the game (Advertisment news achievements). Okay we get about the cheaters part but really their are so many players out that it is hard to be able to ban/stop all the cheaters in the game so just live with it or play something else until there are less hackersOMG the new Update/the 1.0 pc launch is better than i expected. nice and smooth even on my i3 220 cpu with gtx 960dispite the cheating that people are talking about (get over it you got the most out of the 1.0 pc launch sheesh).Thnx you developers for this update and all your hard work. i am loving the update and the game itself.My Graphic qualit has up the anti even though i have a i3 220 cpu which is below the minimum. texture ""medium"" rest ""low"" but with very little lag once every minute. before 1.0 my graphic settings were all ""Very Low""I pay my respect to the developer for their hard work and this game and what they have done so far.

Even though the key costs $2.5 I dont think its something to freak out about because i can just sell i for $1 $2 (why the are you complaining about free money?). I couldnt care less about those crates because I can ing pick up a pair of timberlands and a supreme cap from a hack. That aside something that me off is the fact you added honking like who the needs honking? Just giving knobheads a reason to off players and streamers and then when they get banned they start complaining about it.

2017-12-28,0,0,390,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Truly one of the most hated games which I just found revolutionary.Yes PUBG has become quite the storm in the PC gaming community. What makes this game really cool is that it's also a PC exclusive for the time being. And at this point in time probably 15 matches later give or take it's a game I cannot NOT recommend. And quite frankly I feel a lot of the hatred is due to the popularity which is fine with all things popular comes hatred.There are a few elements I just adore. One being the cooperative aspect the need to work together to achieve one goal victory and survival. So this game has some what little room for just trolling around. It has a very open world environment which is quite refreshing coming from a game like Counter Strike. There's nothing more pleasurable than enjoying a ride on this gorgeous map especially with your squad mates. Something special about the open environment kind of like GTA5 the graphics in this game are also beautiful even on medium. Yes it has a difficult learning curve even for those familiar with the FPS genre. But I embrace the challenge because it feels authentic. I fully understand why this game is so popular it's a lot of fun. And I haven't even been playing with English gamers but I find a way to speak Mandarin maybe I'll learn a lot in a month or two.Learning curve is tough but once you get the hang of it things become more straight forward. Extremely team oriented in good ways. With these types of online games it really makes you hooked. Enjoying the game so far even with people who don't even speak the same language.

Cons/Random framrate drop and network lagHigh ping or bad connection for a quick second means auto disconnection.Walking Running and just moving in general feels clumsy and odd.Jumping is the horrid when trying to get over a wall or obstacles.And our biggest pet peeve... SHOTGUNS!!! JESUS CHRIST! We can pump a guy full of 5 rounds of 7.62 or 5.56 with him having almost no armour and he doesnt go down! Then he turn around on us while we have full level two and level three helmets on occasion and shoots us twice killing us immediatly!! It renders the SK12 a god weapon! The verticle and pump are on par with the SK12!ProsIf forgetting about the shotguns... Most firefights are intense and interesting always with the better marksman coming out on top.Driving is fun and hilarious! Especially doing backflips on motorcycles!Airdrops add hot zones with intense action and a ""good"" reward.Grenades are done decently with the accuracy of the through being ok but if its a smoke or flash its fine.The map although MASSIVE AND ANNOYING TO TRAVERSE adds area to hold down and engage enemies.Sadly this doesnt pull PlayerUnknowns out of the sad and frustrating place it currently is in.

You think you will have a safe land and an easy time finding your first few weapons. Then suddenly in the corner of your eye you see another parachute land the same time if not moments before your own touches down. It's now a race to the death.Whoever finds the first gun survivies.Running to the shed you think you see a shotgun and you were right. You pick it up hoping the other parachuter hadn't found a gun of his own already. With barely enough time to think he comes around the corner and you shoot praying for the best.His body topples over and there are now 93 players remaining. All of which will be differently handled and none of which will be easy.For early access this game is 10/10. For a ""almost fully developed"" title it's like a 6/10.

Just in my opinion though the game is much more enjoyable with friends but solo is still very fun. so overall don't listen to these negative reviews you will like the game and if you are on the fence about getting it buy it there's a steep learning curve but the game is great.

2017-07-22,0,0,86,True,Not Recommended,PUBG or Player Unkown's Battlegrounds. The concept of this game is to persevere against all odds and win. So how do you do that? Well you don't.Now hold your pitchforks and let me explain. First of all let's start with the hackers. There is an abundance of them everywhere you look. The hacking client is not hard to install and it gives you x ray vision so you can see through walls. The other issue that must be addressed is the player circle. You will get a notification that says 'player circle closing in one minute' but that is not true you get half of the time needed. Try it out right now if you don't believe me. Also the lag and latency when dropping down does not help this game either.This game is in early access but I hope some of these issues will be fixed. It should not be that easy to download a hacking client for a game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-14,0,0,104,True,Recommended,I've never been interested in multiplayer games I tried WoW years ago for a few days and I've played Rocket League with friends for maybe 7 8 hours but that's it. PUBG however has really got me hooked big time. I play on Solo servers and it's ideal for me because I don't need to or want to talk with other players. To save your ears CTRL + T mutes the chat.I like that each match is fairly short at about 30 minutes max if you can keep yourself alive to the final circles and if you do get killed in a few minutes you'll be again in a plane heading for Erangel with the other psychos. Jump out of a plane parachute to a promising huddle of houses find a gun and some ammo maybe a car and try to survive until someone shoots you. Rinse and repeat. Bit like Groundhog Day really. Except with the sound of your heart thumping in your ears. It's quite intense sometimes.My few complaints are that jumping is quite annoying but Bluehole are working on a vaulting/climbing mechanic so that should fix that annoyance. Also the game can get a bit repetitive with one map so far but they are working on new maps which will be different in size and location there will be smaller maps than Erangel maybe more fitting for close combat. They also recently added forced first person servers and it's a nice addition as a first person viewpoint feels more claustrofobic and when you peek around corners or over the walls you run the risk of exposing your position. I've no preference between the viewpoints myself I like to play on both.Paid crates and their introduction in Early Access against promises seem to have riled some people up but as these are cosmetic items that you don't need to win I don't mind.My PC (i7 4771 3.50GHz/8Gb/GeForce GTX 780M) isn't a powerhouse (mobile GPU and all) and I have to set settings quite low to get good frame rates (fluctuating around 50 fps) but as the game is in Early Access it is being optimized and frame rates probably will get better but of course PUBG will never look great on my PC.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-19,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,Having played this game for 30 hours now I think it is enough to make myself an oppinion on it.First of all did I have fun playing it ? Yes but only during short bursts. There is an adrenaline feeling during the matches that is unmatched yet the problem is they are very few and far between. Most of the time you will spend in this game will either consist of you running to the next zone because you were unlucky enough to find no vehicule and to drop far away from the circle or it will consist of you hiding in a house for 20 minutes because you got lucky and most of the circles were in your location.None of these 2 are any fun they are both pretty boring and the only way to really win a match (unless you are some kind of god like DrDisrespect). But that doesn't grant a bad review does it ? After all you still have fun when you hear soundsteps and yourself only to find out you have the advantage and then manage to kill the person and grab his loot. This is fun but only on one side the side of the winner. The looser will feel cheating and 95% of the time when he looks at the death cam he will either see someone camping or somone running and just stumbling on you by coincidence and getting a free kill.But still the game is still fun from time to time why do you not recommand it ? Well it turns out this game is supposedly not in early access anymore but it also turns out that this game still feels like an alpha test. The presentation is attrocious with clipping everywhere bugs in all directions money not being given at the end of a match for some reason terrible optimisation (GTX 1060 manually Overclocked with an I7 7700K and 16GB of RAM and I still get huge framerate dips and other problems like crashes midgame) and above all else terrible graphics.You might think this game looks okay and I agree it doesn't look terrible but it has absolutly no personality it's bland and the draw distance has some major issues. You see you are supposed to hide in the grass that's why they made it so that you can't remove it but they also made it so that it disappears after a fairly short distance. It means that when you are hiding in grass the player a hundred meters away will see you right in the open. This completly breaks the flow of the game and you suddenly rage after watching the death cam and leave the game frustrated.The shooting is also attrocious it feels like you are playing some bad shooter made in Unreal Engine in 2 days. Weapons have poor accuracy in third person but also in first person which is weird. There's a problem when I shoot 20 bullets with my revolver at an ennemy 50 meters away and only one of them hits him even tho he wasn't moving much (I was flanking his cover) and I have aiming right at him in first person. Its downright dumb and frustrating. It also doesn't feel good at all. Can't we just have a Battle Royale that doesn't play like crap but instead has some good mechanics and shooting ? This game would already feel a 100 times better if the shooting was more like Battlefield with higher recoil.And the worst part of all this is that it costs 30 . Don't spend money on that game just download Fortnite or simply don't play a Battle Royale game. At least Fortnite has some personality and good shooting PUBG is a broken mess.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Everyone who has read this comment and is thinking about getting the game get it. It's so much fun. Lots of people hate on this game because of things like Fortnite or in game purchases. If you have any interest at all get it because it is only on sale for a limited time. Just for referance I have a 1050ti and i can run all high settings at consistent FPS ratings of 60. There is a reason it was the most played game of 2017 with over 35 000 000 copies sold. And the in game purchases are not required. Just like in CS GO the most well known game in PC gaming history (even if you didn't play it) there will be in game purchases for a payed game. Wow... Such a big deal. I can""t BARE the pain!!!! AHHHH! (that was sarcasm btw). If you don't like the in game purchases which are only $2.50 for crate keys (just like csgo) then don't get the in game purchases. It doesn't mean you can't buy the game. It is purely for aesthetics. So go on ranting about the most minimal parts of this game but don't come crying back when you can't get a single win in Fortnite.

The only other game that I have ever played that gives you the same adrenal rush was ""The Culling"" but unlike this game The Culling devs completely fire bombed their own game with horrible updates. PUBG irons out flaws which also means the occasional side bug...it happens. It's still worth getting.For all the people freaking out about adding paid crates...calm the F$%&amp down. Yes they made a ton off of the initial sales but they are a company. You think upkeep of servers and staff is free?

2017-08-15,0,0,366,True,Recommended,Quite possibly one of the most infuriatingly addicting games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.Put out into an 8x8km map with up to 99 other folks your objective is to be the last and only braindead ninny left alive. But let me back up infuriating? Yep. Nothing is more infuriating than when you walk out of the Military base weaving and dodging the other shmoes who dropped there with you. You've got a Karabiner 98k sniper an 8x scope and the dark clothing to match your soul. Set right? Nope. Some wankoff who grabbed a pistol and got a supremely lucky headshot when he came around a corner. You died. Infuriating.Now your only option is Ragequit? Or load up a new game and try again. 9.9/10 times you're going to pick the latter.Just like you'll pick up this game. And strive for the almighty Chicken Dinner.

2018-05-15,0,0,1254,False,Recommended,daft though it may seem to some of the haters out there I actually am really enjoying this game its frustrating yes and your chances of winning are not 1 in 90. Cheating wise im sure ive run into a cheat quite often but given the kill cam is apparently useless its difficult to tell. Im usually reporting those that are shooting with little to no recoil or are shooting metres behind me yet getting a kill.Cheating aside the rounds are quite tense and I manage most often to get into the top 10 or top 5 which for an old like me Im quite please with! .. the only thing I would complain about is the lack of maps you can play the same map 5 or 6 times in a row which can get quite boring and its a bit of a money grab with the crates (which I refuse to buy for cash).. have loads of them unopened now no idea what to do with them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-29,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,Player movement is awful. It's one of those things where they made it so realistic they killed the fun. Yes in real life there is some acceleration time to get up to speed when running but you don't notice it in practice. In this game player movement is more like driving a boat. A boat that gets hung up on things constantly.Player movement and controls literally feel more natural on the mobile version of the game.

They aren't the greatest devs and are still working towards it.Game continually has interesting new modes content and weapons that keep you coming back for more.You'll get an itch for the game that nothing else will scratch.It's popular so Chinese people try and exploit it.

2017-11-05,0,0,342,False,Not Recommended,I'd recommend this game but why do you let us chose the server? can't you just make it to chose the closest servers ? Like that people in EU play on EU AS on AS and NA on NA and block the kill ping user that try to get on other servers servers.Edit 31/05/2018Still don't recommend it. Deathcam is trash. You don't really see how he kills you. It's a look a like deathcam and you'll have a look a like view of how you got killed so you can't really see if he cheated or not. Seriously grenade update ? and what about vehicules? more diversified gear for protection. More air drop spawns like 2 planes and 4 air drops to get people to fight more over airdrops to change the paste of the game. Looting for weapons in buildings that are full of AR attachments is getting boring...After a year of dev this game is not even scratching the surface to being good.Oh and the only good thing there doing is taking other companies to court for copyright infractions. At least that a good news. Cause i've had enough of hearing about battleroyal games. I wanna see more of the other games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-20,0,0,147,True,Recommended,I have never written a review before but here it goes Pros this game is very fun to play with your friends and makes you focus on your surroundings in order to keep on living... it is quite a unique feeling to be the final 10 alive in a tiny circle and you are just waiting for the right moment to shoot the last person so overall i would say its a really fun game cons this is a wide spread issue if im corret but there is a serious problem with textures right now i have a i5 6500 cpu which is pretty good and a gtx 1060 6gb and 8gb of ram. now i can max pretty much every single game i play and this includes pubg however no matter the setting i have this dumb bug where it takes like 30 seconds to a minute for the building textures to load in which often gets me killed. I've read lots of forums and looked through redit and they all say to upgrad to an ssd or boost my ram to 16gb. now that may make sense to some people but i personally will never beef up my system for one game due to an unoptimized engine. i can max every single other game textures loading fine so i see no reason why this one wont be able to in the future so until then ill just play with friends and die right off the start like usual.Final thoughts if you have an ssd and 16gb of ram then go ahead its a lot of fun. if you have a normal drive and the standard gaming ram of 8gb then maybe hold off until they fix this stupid issue,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-27,0,0,133,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. I've had this game for almost a month now.The first time I played this I could not get 60fps constant at all. It would always drop into the 40's and I may not have the BIGGEST system (g4560 rx 470) but I figured even on lowest I'd be able to get the good FPS. Well few days ago PUBG released a Optimization update and fixed everything. I almost never drop FPS. Anyways...PROS Arma like feel dev made the Battle Royal mod for Arma 3 inspired by that game. Graphics can look really good or really bad. There's player customization for in game currency you get from playing and can also be purchased on steam Battle eye anticheat so there's almost never any cheaters excluding some teleports you can come across on youtube. Switch between first person or third person first person driving is almost as good as a simulator. You will catch yourself making car noises.CONS De sync issues since everything is mostly client sided can die behind corners or can die after you're down on your screen. Visibility issues can happen some people use ""ReShade"" to increase/decrease contrast or saturation to get better visibility Sound my computer is at 50% and the game volume is maxed the volume is still really quiet but this may be me.Conclusion Buy this game.

2017-06-30,0,0,366,False,Not Recommended,"This is my OPINION which means even if I recommend the game or not the review only helps you to decide for yourself with some pros and cons I've come across playing the game.30 dollar price is not too bad at the moment cheap enough for people to get and expensive enough for hackers to not buy it after many bans please no sales.UPDATED 29.03.2018 Or just the 1.00 update.Pros ++ Fun as hell.+ Gun variety.+ Foliage bushes and trees are excellent for gameplay decisions.+ Ability to somewhat decide your spawn location.+ High skillcap. Even with the worst spawn you can make your way to the top by playing it smart.+ Fast paced matched (30minutes max) Might be con for some. They can still feel slow if you like camping playstyle.+ First person mode and third person mode for variety of gaming they feel completely different and fresh from each other.+ Static weathers variety rain fog and about three different sun levels. Now there are two maps!+ Dedicated DEV's with long lifespan planned for the game.+ Vaulting was something I never expected to like makes looting way more enjoyable.Cons Somewhat broken HITREG shoot someone find out in killcam you never shot really annoying. Game doing stuff like hitreg and smokes for example on clientside leads to conflicted firefights. Performance issues/Optimization issues large fixed out but still not best 70 105 fps GTX 1070 i7 3770 8gb RAM in 31.12.2017 SSD or high amount of fast RAM is almost a must have. Do not believe the minimum system requirements as of 30.10.2017 The developer has broken some word's about adding microtransactions during the EA period of the game. This might be a minor con for some people and major to others if you care about developers complete transparency and integrity. Constant fixes on games optimizations that get broken after few patches only to be repaired to same state and not improved upon. Rng ""Algorithm"" on this game seems broken mostly noticable when map gets selected you can easily get either map 5 times in row loot piles being same items. Unbalanced BP rewards from different party modes it makes no sense to gain 700 bp from top 10 solo and 170 from top 10 squad mode games take similar amounts different kind of effort to win but doesnt justify huge difference like this. Official 1.0 release was a complete joke just a way for the devs to get community off their back while piling usual ""weekly updates"" into one bigger patch. Bugs are rampant.Neutral 00 Clear concept of a game with clear path to launch and beyond 2018 we have a celar roadmap now!0 Not able to select the maps/map variety you want to play can be bothersome.0 New lobby system is way better than the old one can still get some work done.0 Gun skins some variety but not much good for people who care about these tho! What does that make of the game? Bumpy as hell early access period with somewhat okay launch good features added but the game didn't feel like release yet more like polished early access title.Will this great early access success last beyond the bumpy release? Probably but it does not feel like it is a real release yet.Recommended even after mostly negative opinions for past year of the games early access period. The game has a promising future with fun as hell gameplay as for now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-01,0,0,233,False,Recommended,"Well this is the game that started the whole ""Battle Royale"" craze. Heavily inspired by movies such as ""Battle Royale"" and ""The Hunger Games"" PUBG has up to 100 unarmed players parachuting onto a large island finding weapons and then fighting to the death in an ever shrinking circle until there's only one player remaining alive to be declared the winner. There are a number of islands to play on and each have different terrain vehicles to ride on and special weapons. To keep players off balance there are helicopter loot drops which can be picked up for powerful weapons camoflague and armour. Additionally there are ""red zones"" which are subject to random artillery bombardment making them temporarily dangerous to enter. Falling outside the shrinking circle also harms players so all remaining players are eventually forced into close quarters combat. Getting to the end results in many tactical and strategic decisions working out in your favour against the gameplay circle and other players.It's a more mature game with an attempt at realism and correct physics. Definitely no building or craziness as you may have seen in PUBG's most well known clone ""Fortnite"".The sense of fear and tension when you first play the game is amazing and winning against 100 players the first time is an experience that you are unlikely to ever forget IF you can do it! Since it's random every time you play no two games are ever alike. Will you go in guns blazing and kill as many people as possible? Or will you hide for as long as possible to snipe the last player remaining? Or perhaps you will die in the first few minutes as you race with another player who landed next to you to get to the only available gun nearby....Play with a squad of friends is also great. Coordinating your attacks over comms is a lot of fun.Negatives? Well the vaulting system isn't flawless (it's not that easy to climb over everything) and many of the players are from China and there's no region locking. This makes squad matchups less likely to have everyone speaking the same language. Being a multiplayer only game essentially it's communities that make or break games like this and while the devs are constantly trying to improve the game (it has come a long way since it's initial releases) there are still niggles in the gameplay. Cheaters were once rife but anti cheat has improved over time.The matches are usually over in about 15 minutes so the game can be enjoyed casually in short bursts without taking up too much of your time. Otherwise it's a modern E sports classic to keep on your computer and come back to for casual fun and endless replayability.... well for as long as it's popular and you can find others willing to play.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game has a few different maps that you can explore and master by yourself or with a squad of friends. If you are interested in a semi realistic Battle Royale game then this is the game for you. Weapons have bullet drop and travel time. The weapons range from easy to handle to hard to master which raises the skill gap immensely. This game however has many downsides to it. Hackers are rampant the RNG is insanely annoying and the hit detection could absolutely be improved.

2017-05-11,0,0,293,True,Recommended,This game is amazing! I loved old H1Z1 amd Arma/DayZ combat but could never really find what I was looking for. H1Z1 got to Esport arcadic and Arma didn't really have the player pool like I wanted. This game combines everything I love about the two and combines it. Not only that there isn't gimiky skin purchases ( except that hooded coat y'all are crazy) or terrible gun play. The game overall runs okayish I mean it's early access sooo not optimized too well but good enough to play on some older hardware This game also has some very well done co op in it. With duos it's teams of two and in squad it's teams of 3 4 . The game also has pickup and play mechanics you don't have to go through tutorials or any of that non sense .Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes a good battle royal game.

OC servers are an absolute joke unable to play any game type until at least 8pm with the only server being Australia where the ping is still quite high. Every other server is as laggy as you can get and completely unplayable. Along with constant crashing and updates that don't fix anything apart from new vehicles and asthetical changes to the game there is still allot of hackers have what sems like free reign of the game. The devs really don't want to fix the main issues like server lag desync and basic queue times along with other issues that make the game run smoother. 10/10 would play again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-28,0,0,6,False,Recommended,For those who want a quick review I'll say it now the game is one of the best games I played. This game is fun and challenging it forced you to think along the way. And before you buy this game I recommend playing other games like Rules Of Survival PC or H1Z1 if you like it buy this because games like H1Z1 are close to this game but I think this is better than those .Full Review.This game is great I recommend this game but you need to get at least minimum recommended specs before you can play or else you have to use it on low graphic settings like me if you do not have the proper video card but overall is better than the other games instead of buying this game you can download other games as good as this like Rules of Survival H1Z1 etc. But nothing truly beats this game. This game is challenging but fun you get to meet friendly players team or not you are forced to use your brain al lot you also need good communication with your team and think of strategic ways.The game rewards you through the in hame currency BP you can use it to reward your friends buy crates .Character Customisation is great with a lot of clothes to choose from from head to toe. Also weapon customisation is great camos are cool especially now. Guns are great and the game also allows you to play in 3rd person or 1st person. The scopes are great and the bullets don't fly straight forever they will slowly descend too.Overall Customisation 5Gameplay 4Players 5Requirements 4 (It a need to reach minimum required specs)Difficulty 3 4Communication 4Price 3Controls 5 (Easy to get familiar with for most Battle Royale games uses the same)Weapons 4Notes If you do not have the minimum specs you need to put your settings medium orbelow also one thing you need is perfect wifi i find it more challenging than ever if you have bit slow wifi wifi that lags sometimes.What You Need While Playing BrainMicGood WifiMinimum SpecsFriends for more fun gameplayA lot of free timeAnger Control just in caseStrategy,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-22,0,0,234,True,Recommended,The gameplay itself is amazing. The developers are working hard to add new weapons improve bugs and just make the game better. HOWEVER. The biggest problem with the game isn't hackers or poor gameplay but the performance. Obviously the game is still in Early Access. This excuse is valid but only to a certain extent. It seems like a lot of players have different issues. A common one I see is where textures of buildings won't load in. This means the player can't enter them as they just float in the air. This is a major problem with the game as getting the loot early on is a must have especially in a populated area.It doens't seem to matter how good your computer is this issue pops up on most people. This will be fixed in time but I think it should be a priority of the developers. Awesome game please keep updating it and PLEASE fix this issue.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,784,True,Not Recommended,Gets very repetitive real quick. Even playing as a squad could be horrendous especially when other players dont have or refuses to use a mic. Scores take forever to accumulate. But the worst is the overly constant Network lags and random game crashes. WAAAAY TOO MANY SHOTGUNS and the center point of each map is way too predictable if you watch the pattern of the angle of plane when the match starts.IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED A better score system. It takes way too much time to get your score high enough to get more clothing.Better building design. Too many of the buildings are hard to find the stairs (takes too much time even if you do a quick 360) and many times its hard to get from upstairs back to the ground level (especially when you need to leave in a hurry).Better vehicles What I mean by this is (again when you are in a hurry) it is hard to get to right angle to pop up the option to enter a vehicle especially as a driver. Its next to impossible to do so while under fire.Better vehicle rules on a team When a team is shooting from within a vehicle friendly fire should be temporarily turned off.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-01,0,0,970,False,Recommended,If you want to relax and play for the sake of communication with friends then this game is for you. It has everything from bugs to desynchrony . The game is cool but not for everyone.As for me it is worthy occupied a niche in the gaming industry and no wonder it is considered a pioneer in the Battle Royale . Many games immediately began to introduce the same Riga games in their games. I think as stated by the respected developers of this very game if they will continue to improve this game it will play. And you can add a lot to this game...From new guns to new modes. But they should also think about the players first of all and not only about the income of the game.After all if the game will be more accessible to players with a weak computer hardware and players will be more.... Well accordingly there will be more players who are at least small but part of the profit will bring. As a player from Russia I would like them to pay attention to the fact that the RCN in connection with the struggle with the social network of Telegrams there are some difficulties when entering the game namely the match itself is not loaded.And I think this problem is present not only in me which requires the use of VPN because of which the ultimate high ping which is not reverent to a good game as someone less ping he will have an advantage. What I would like to say about the game as a whole. The game is good the mode is good there is something to develop it but such moments as VPN fps drawdown and how the player gets into( not understandable damage) spoil the overall picture of the game. I think the game at the moment if you count on a five point scale has 3.5 points.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-10,0,0,173,True,Not Recommended,Game has severe issues with hackers. Game runs a BattleEye anti cheat (this AC literally does not work I played ARK SE and it runs the same anti cheat I would constantly have Chinese hackers spawning instakilling dinos on almost all the official servers this is corroborated by many many reviews at the time). Game has terrible performance issues. Once again I'll mention ARK SE. ARK is in no way shape or form optimized. Yet I can run that on Ultra with my current specs. I can run PUBG on low with the help of an optimization guide and my temperatures go WAY up. I don't have this issue with any other Steam title I own (300+ atm) I don't have this issue when rendering 3D animations or HD videos either. The developer has a distinct lack of morals. He lets hackers run rampant and chooses to instead divert more attention into banning those who kill popular streamers or letsplayers instead. Gameplay is very similar to H1Z1 infact it's almost a complete 1 1 if you don't factor in a few things. Instead of the much needed optimization being done it's instead been chosen to make a console port even though it barely runs on some high end machines without severe tweaks.Save your money if you can. I got it discounted by almost 30% via Humble Bundle and it's in no fit state yet and by the developers current actions it will be another one of them EA titles that either stays EA for the foreseeable future or is pushed into a stable full launch dispite not being stable or complete.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,905,False,Recommended,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All jokes aside this is my personal review on Playerunknown's Battlegrounds which I love this ing game and spend hours playing it. Positive things about PUBG *Endless fun with your friends or even random people playing on the Zombie mode or War mode.*2 large maps + 2 smaller maps (more to come) which allow people to chose faster or longer timed games.*Various guns weapon attachments vehicles clothing and much more.*Graphics are pretty awesome and unique considering other games don't look like this.*Devs are willing to listen to community feedback eg They removed the grenade feature literally pushed players away.*Lobby music is ing amazing.*Top played game on steam meaning you'll always have people to play with.*Lots more awesome things which you can find out from other people...*All your stats are tracked and tell you how many people you've killed longest shot etc..*Games always depend on your team's choices and how you counter other players.*FOR 3 maps and more maps to come AWESOME CLOTHES GUNS AND LOOT VEHICLES GAME MODES You should buy PUBG! people said it would die and look at it it's beat CSGO H1Z1 DOTA2 League of legends(Even though that game is a dota thief.) Negative things about PUBG *If you have a low spec PC then you'll struggle on Low/Medium.*If your hard drive isn't running well or is slow then you'll struggle with rendering stuff in faster than other players eg Buildings and yes LOOT.*If your motherboard is dying you'll run this game like a turd on ultra low settings which isn't nice.*Game is optimized as well as it should be but the devs are working on it.*Physics aren't the best for example if you hit a plastic chair with a car then it'll be like smashing into a 4000 inch wall of concrete.*The slight kiss of a car hitting you will do some serious damage and most likely 'knock' you out to the floor.*Memeory errors/leaks everywhere. You could be enjoying your day driving and boom you get nice white box with a red cross.From the first time I've played PUBG to the present time now I can say the game has had a roller coaster of development getting better and worse but overall it is improving. I recommend you buy PUBG so that they get sales and I get free merch from Bluehole )*Terrible server issues causing you to still take bullet damage whilst in 100% cover.*Shroud quit,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-03,0,0,1297,False,Not Recommended,I usually don't review many games but i've invested a large amount of time and money into this game hoping like everyone else that Bluehole will make this game as great as it could be. I'll go into further detail.I purchased this game when it was very new and i uninstalled it very shortly after a few hours of playing or attempting to. The game was terribly optimized and most of the time nothing would render if you were able to drop.Came back a few months later after like 8 patches or so and gave it another shot. I reintalled because alot of my friends were playing it so i went for it again and the game was still pretty laggy low fps poor bullet registration issues with objects not rendering and just normal early access issues that would eventaully be fixed when the full game came out. Pc release comes out 1.0 launch game is still just a hot pile of garbage and actually almost runs worse with more problems then early access build???I won't go into detail about all the things i hate about this game because there is a lot this company has made it super clear what there intentions around based on there actions over the last year. They launched a half made piece of trash on pc and refuse to fix it. They then launch a even worse pile of trash for Xbox and its still a broken pile of trash. They release a mobile game to grab some more money and let another company develope it and it runs better then pc and xbox releases ??Now they are running international tournements and flooded there game with loot boxes and skins trying to get every single dollar they can out of this piece of hot sh!t before the large companies observing from a distance develope better versions of this trash game that will run better and have better support and maybe cost a little more money but worth every single dollar to not support this company that cares nothing abou there game and how it runs for the people that buy it.All in all this game had the potentional to be a very good game to entertain us for a long time with endless maps to be made and fun to be had. i got my 1100 hours out of this game just waiting and hoping that it would get fixed and sadly as soon as one of the big ones comes out this year ill be uninstalling pubg forever.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-24,0,0,644,True,Not Recommended,Since the release of micro transactions the game has become awash with hackers looking to make money selling crates.For some countries the amount of money they can make far outstrips the cost of buying the game if they get caught. Bluehole seem un capeable of handling this large influx of hackers.In a game that has 100 players in any given match this makes the game incredible frustraiting. You will now most likly come across a hacker yourself every few games.This was NOT the case before they fully implimented micro transactions.The game is still great fun in Duo's or Squads where the hackers rarly show up (as it's not a time effective way to farm crates). But near unplayable curently in single player.August 2017,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-18,0,0,213,True,Recommended,This game proves that a fresh gameplay idea is more important than graphics and that new IPs can be wildly successful despite it not being the smoothest experience.This is one of the few games in my life where the gameplay is so immersive and engaging that recapping the matches the next day with friends brings the excitement right back and makes me look forward to playing again. That is game of the year material and for that I highly recommend it.With such a bright spotlight Blue Hole/PUBG Corp had a chance to redefine the entire gaming industry. Instead they re solidified the awful tactics that is the abyss that the industry is sliding into. Instead of showing AAA publishers that you can still make hundreds of millions of dollars without gimmicks they decided that it wasn't enough and just had to cram lootboxes (gambling) into the game.The greed of in game monetization that is leaking from the mobile app ecosystem will ruin gaming and gamers are doing it to themselves.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,789,False,Not Recommended,THIS GAME IS INFECTED WITH HACKERS AND IS BECOMMING MORE AND MORE UNPLAYABLE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM UNTIL BLUEHOLE GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND SORT OUT THIS SH!T!!!I can't stop playing this game wether to have a laugh with friends on duos or squads or trying to prove myself in solos this is definitely a game I've found addictive. I've actually revised this review. It was once positive but since the first review was early access this will be my review of actual release.Currently the devs are too busy shovelling sh!t ports to any possible console that will invite them into bed leaving the PC version and subsequent ports an unoptimised dirty mess. A game that I was once able to stream on low settings with a regular 40 fps now jumps from 70 while looking at the sky to 15 and lower even going so far as to freeze while scoping in for a shot which is great for a battle royale game.Add to this the dev's complete mishandling of streamer and player issues dishing out bans for unqualified reasons or honking of f*cking car horns at streamers (a feature the devs added into the game). All the way to now calling playing xenophobic (almost racist) for wanting ping block to help prevent the in game mess of bullsh!t deaths and missed shots that were dead on.F*ck you developers! F*ck you hard.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-22,0,0,101,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS aka PUBG or Angry russian royale is a game like no other and I know it's like H1Z1 and other games like in that genre but it doesn't feel like I'm playing one of those kind of games (Not saying I don't enjoy them games as well)The game in my opinion is most enjoyable when playing squads which is you and 3 of your friends or random russians. The reason this is more enjoyable then duo or solo is because you can annoy the hell out of your degenarate friends and get them killed by firing a shot while hiding from other sqauds and the salt and the screams among your dying friends is rather satisfying.The lobby is probably the most annoying but best part about this game. Hearing people shout in fake indian accents and then popping you constanly in the head. Or my personal fav when you shout I'm a snake down the mic and prone and crawl around starting a line of other players shouting the same line acousticly as you.So if you actually want to win a game then I have some pro tips from the pro himself which is myself and trust me I'm one of the best players in the EU region with a whopping KD ratio of 0.36.Here are the pro tips for y'all scrubs Land somewhere no one else is going. (If your looking for a bit of fun then I do have to say landing at school is rather fun) Do not try to cross a bridge after 5 minitues of the game starting as the COD player base settle reffuge on the bridge making it impossible to cross just like a immigrant trying to cross the mexcain border apart from guns will be used on sight. When a supply drop is landing use your car and drive underneath and take that drop for a ride far away before the salty 12 year olds gun you down for not letting them get the AWM inside the supply drop you just stole of them only to find out you escaped to get a 8x scope and a level 3 backpack. Always make your squad members enter buildings first so they can die instead of you. The frying pan is the most underatred weapon. The pan can block bullets by the way. I never leave home without me pan. If you are outnumbered and will lose the fight offer your teamates lives and try to barter your way into thier squad and ditch them near the end and then make them regret the decsion of sparing you.Overall I have seen the developers keep working on this game so much and this may be one of the first games in this genre to not remain in early access for 7 years not firing any shots to Day Z or anything if anyone remembers that mess of a game.I have played a lot of this game and I just keep coming back to play with my friends as it is a really fun game wether that's annoying my friends or try harding for the odd time because being the last few sqauds alive is so intense and once you win it's so satisfying It's like when your friend that has been stuck in bronze in league of legends or overwatch etc. and they have finally escaped elo hell and you all cheer with excietment for your scrub of a friend. The shock of winning among your friends is a beautiful moment you then all debate your feelings towards each other as the bond between you all went from 0 100 and now when your friend asks you next time to jump in the back they aren't on about the buggy this time.Just get a group of friends and buy this game you will not regret it and If any of your friends are russian then always queue with them cause they are the real mvp's of this game. Hope to sell you my squad members and shoot you on the island soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-21,0,0,25,True,Recommended,TLDR at the bottom Gameplay The game play is fun frustrating and tense only down side may be that if you're playing in a group and you're one of the last one standing in just the group or in the match the tense and frustration meters will sky rocket. every match will be different you might win with only a frying pan and your underpants while the next round you're fighting for your life with damaged armor and only a pistol with a few bullets remaining it kinda makes every round feel ''fresh''Graphics Just put it on (Very) Low everyone does it and its because on higher settings you'll see more bushes and foillage people on lower settings don't so while you might be near invisble on your screen you won't be on somebody elses you'll just be lying in the middle of a hill top for them but non the less the visuals look incredible even on lowSound i would honestly put down a negatieve review if the sound wasn't good sound is one of the most important things in PUBG. its of the essence that the sounds work and that they sound good and thats exactly what it does tracing fired shots just from the direction where they coming from doors below you creaking open alarming you of a possible threat avoiding threats by hearing gunshots and explosions across a silent hill or field. the only annoying sound is when you ahve voice chat on all and you join a lobby because you'll need to buy tampons for your earsEarly Acces State With the full release stated to be somewhere at the end of the year i and many other players hope many of the game breaking bugs and gltiches will fixed. Currently some of the most game breaking bugs are houses not loading properly or loading at all for a player or Mouse stuttering (not sure what causes this but some players incl. myself have had experience with the mouse suddenly stuttering mid firefight this msotly occurs indoors) or just the good 'ol falling through the map and landing in some undergroundwater. there are smaller ones like when you crash into another car you get launched into the air but i'll over see those as they are rather funny and i wouldn't mind if they didn't fix it. Community People went from playing CSGO to this nuff said.TLDR Pros + ''Fresh'' Gameplay each round+ Amazing graphics even on low+ Great SFXParallel Hilarious glitchesCons Gamebraking Bugs and Glitches The communityVerdict This game is like warming up some chicken wings that have been half eaten its broken and its not ready yet but ya still want it. 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-23,0,0,259,True,Recommended,Don't listen to all the recent negative reviews. This game is awesome fun and extremely playable in its current EA form. It can only get better and the game is being constantly updated. For people moaning about the honkers being banned there is a limit to how annoying people can be before being banned so that they don't ruin it for the entire community. Yes its funny once or twice to honk the horn to the streamers but when you are doing it game after game circling the building and honking without even playing the game at all not looting not even trying to play properly it makes it unplayable not just for the streamers but for everyone. Can't hear anything in the building because some idiot is driving and honking so that they can s to themselves and claim they are on the streamers stream. Not only that but they disconnect and follow them straight into new games when they die making the game they were in less competitive for everyone else.Regardless of that gameplay is amazing and the guns just feel right with loot being evenly spread among the map. Car and bike mechanics deffo need to be worked on but am sure they are working on that. 9/10 game in its current state.

When I finally get into a game it will often crash. I can choose to rewconnect into the game but when I try it will crash before I can get into the game again. after 5 8 minutes of loading I can play again but unfortunately I would have died before that time comes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-30,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,It's a fun game. Can get boring if you play solo as there is a lot of running around and lull points moving from one area to another as you try and find loot or other players to kill.The game can look great but that's asking for trouble even on high end systems as the game is very poorly optimized. Add that in with large amount of server lag you're going to have a tough time hitting other players. It simply doesn't rnu smooth or responsive at all.Not recommended until the game is more optimized and more responsive from player input. If you have friends who want to play with you or if you feel like you're missing out on the current flavor of battle royal that is PUBG then go ahead and waste your money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Idk why? but if you assume that everyone cheats because your BAD quit this game instantly and go play fortniteif you cannot win there then even those kids are better then you and go dislike that game aswell.I know there were a lot of cheaters but maybe once every few games but thats something bluehole really putted effort into it they captured people who owned cheating sites with police help they also banned much cheaters if you golook into other games some don't want to put their effort into it.Pubg was made with a small group and people liked this game if you think it is bad try to make one yourself.I am happy that PUBG is here there are much less cheaters now and i am happy with it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-13,0,0,211,False,Recommended,"Honestly I really don't see why there are so many bad reviews for the game.Graphics are pretty average the gunplay is good and the replayability is great at most.People keep complaining about hackers and cheaters without realising that its bound to happen when a competitve game gets released. The dev team IS doing something about the cheaters since most of my deaths have been reasonable. Sure you'll encounter that one match with a hacker but hes bound to get the boot sooner or later. (Also i think region locking china would help too idk thats what the community mostly talks about.)I also like the fact that no matter what gun you're stuck with with the right thinking and plays you can kill other players that have better equipment. This game also punishes you for playing dumb which is a neat factor. In some cases with other battle royal games if you encounter other enemies in a sticky situation you can either build cover or use an ability to get out of said position while in this game if you don't check your surroundings and run in the open you're bound to catch a bullet in the back of your skull.As a new player don't get heated when you die because you will die a LOT. This game doesn't give you any helping hands it simply throws you into a map with 100 players with weapons and wishes you good luck. But don't worry with each game you play you will start to learn from your mistakes and slowly improve and adapt to the game. If you're complaning that this game has microtransactions and thats the only drawback for you that is not a viable excuse. Microtransactions in this game is cosmetic only and you can get cases that are free to open or requires a key to open just by simply getting the game. You can also pick up other dead players clothing / weapon skins too. As for me I like to just play the game get a random crate with the in game credits you get each match sell the key only cases and open those that are free. Every game has microtransactions if the cases had gameplay turning items in there then it would be a problem.While 12.5 hours (at the time this review was written) could possibly not be enough time to write a review about this game I wanted to relate to other people who are new to the game or those who are looking through the homepage and getting nervous by its ""Mostly Negative"" raiting.TL DR Give this game a chance. Its a fun to play with friends and will always get you on your toes when you hear a close bullet hit the wall (or you). The realistic setting and gameplay is what seperates this with other battle royal games. Hackers are being tackled with more maps are being added and the graphics ain't that bad. (I also heard that the PUBG devs are upgrading the game to a different engine although i may be wrong.). If you don't want this game thats fine but it doesn't deserve the rating it has.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-16,0,0,487,False,Recommended,"I have just surpassed the 200 hour mark in this game and still feel the same eagerness to play yet another match as I did when I had only 1 hour in this game. Don't get me wrong this game has some flaws and developers who are care more about money than improving the game and fixing some annoying bugs and the ever present hacker problem but overall this is an incredible game. You'll need 50 hours and an iron will to pick up that chicken dinner but there's nothing in all of gaming more satisfying than finally getting to kill that last annoying little player and being shown the infamous phrase "" Winner Winner Chicken Dinner "" .

2017-06-09,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,"Too glitchy to enjoy and it doesn't really add anything new to the genre. Slightly better graphics thanks to the Unreal Engine than most competitors but the lag is very real. I have a solid PC and numerous others have said the same thing.I just can't suggest it if it added something new or was a unique addition then maybe I'd suggest it but with how many EA titles never actually get completed and never get fine tuned I just don't have the faith anymore. I'm going to ask for a refund at this point. Some of the fun I've had in the game including not seeing a single person until there was 25 left then hearing a gunshot and getting an error message pop up about server connections I didn't get disconnected I just lost all control of my character while someone shot me down. Another experience was starting off parachuting down watching around me for others dropping and not seeing anything. Still being cautious when I land. I'm inside a house had closed the doors so I'd hear people coming looting and someone kills me from within the same room. Zero noise. Hum... Ok. This latest time I was in the open was very sketched out and had run from one of the red zones which basically drop bombs on a small area I was constantly checking my sides and behind me as I was in a very wide open area then again without making any noise whatsoever a buggy appears next to me made me jump because I had just been looking the direction it apparently came from buddy manages to kill me. This is real easy to chalk up to me not being very good at the game but I'm not buying that explanation. A vehicle should make noise opening doors should make noise there's no way I would have been caught unaware like that especially in the second situation because I was very paranoid with my positioning. I was expecting to get sniped from a distance at any second and instead a vehicle appears from what I can only describe as ""no where"" and manages to somehow get the drop on me? That sketchy combined with the losing server connection and the general lag of the game I mean again I have a great PC and even with everything on low I was getting bad frame rates and very chunky gameplay and the graphics which like I mentioned at the start are really the only thing this game has on others of the same genre the graphics blow because everythings set to low. Not enjoyable. Maybe if they get the underlying code sorted out so things aren't so laggy but I'm not sticking around to find out.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-28,0,0,55,False,Recommended,I've been enjoying this game quite a bit so far so I thought I might as well leave a review even if it's utterly pointless because I was the last person on Earth who didn't have this game so it's not like my opinion can influence anyone anyway.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is the incredibly popular battle royale game that has dominated the Steam storefront since it emerged back in 2017 and for good reason it's quite a fun competitive game whether you're avoiding your enemies and using your skills to survive in solo or putting up a more coordinated effort as a duo or group. Everyone knows what it's about but basically you parachute onto a map from a plane with a large number of other people (maybe around 80 90) and have to survive and kill your enemies while making your way to the increasingly shrinking circle within a set amount of time before you start taking damage. You can also choose whether to play the game in fixed first person or toggleable third person an interesting use of the game camera that actually changes the game quite significantly as it alters the field of vision considerably and may give some other advantages like being able to peek around corners.There are three large maps available one of which was introduced recently the classic Erangel a Russian island populated with various towns and military installations Miramar a desert scattered with ghettos and ruins and the new Sanhok a jungle with a lot of natural structures like caves. It's a decent selection and it'll be a long time before I see everything these maps have to offer and there's lots of locations where a range of loot can spawn. Honestly I don't really like Sanhok that much I don't think it's a BAD map I just don't really like the playstyle or aesthetic there personally but the other two are definitely quite appealing to me.In terms of the gunplay and combat I have to admit that it's a bit of a struggle for me aiming isn't easy by any means (I was going to say that it's 'realistic' but honestly I don't know whether that's true) and there's lots of different attachments to get for your weapons from scopes to extended magazines to compensators to suppressors that spice up the shooting considerably. There's a good selection of weapons with a range of different advantages and disadvantages to each one and it seems fairly balanced there's also some nice extra detail like the frying pan melee weapon being able to deflect bullets. Vehicles can also be utilised in combat and I've been run over a couple of times! Though really I think they're more practical for escaping the oncoming blue wall of death than trying to ram into other people.The community of this game seems decent for the most part. They're very vocal in their (perhaps rightful) criticism of aspects of the game such as the event pass and lootboxes and I do think it's shameful that paid cosmetic items were added to the game at a very early stage when other issues like optimisation don't seem to have been handled very well. The game actually runs fine for me on a 4 year old AMD setup so I don't have any issues personally but some people claim to be on similar or even better specs and run into difficulty so maybe the developers need to work on making their game more compatible with the drivers out there. The only thing I'm noticing are some fairly glaring latency issues at the start of the match that a lot of people seem to get and I keep spamming the button to pick up items soon after I parachute down and it won't work for a good five seconds it's only a minor issue but in a game that's sold this well I don't think it's unreasonable to expect such things to be fixed.What would I like to see from this game in future? Really I think it's got a lot going for it already and I don't find anything in the game to be particularly lacking the only notable thing I can mention is text chat which is somehow not a feature in this game. Not everyone uses a mic (personally I'm a notorious shyboy) and whilst I can use steam chat when playing with friends it's difficult to do this when I'm playing group games with complete strangers I've randomly been matched with. And of course as previously stated I think there are a few technical issues that could use some work.I think it's good though. Not the most amazing experience I've ever had in an online game like some people would claim but definitely a solid 8/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A lot of the game feels polished in comparison for some other games that have been in ""Early Access"" for years now.HOWEVER Blueholes PR department needs a run through because it's pretty much non existant. They introduced crate and key microtransactions into the game through the last patch and unfortunately for me that pulls it down enough to leave a negative review. They said at launch all free ways to get cosmetics would be gone and we would basically have to do the CSGO ""gambling"" method to obtain anything or buy off the steam market place again forcing us to spend real world money on the cosmetics. There is no leveling system in the game no sense of progression or reward. If we can't get cosmetics for free then I have to ask what's the point of playing? We play games to get a sense of an achievement a reward sprinkled along the way to whatever goal we have is necessary to keep our attention. If they added a sort of Overwatch system where you can level up and gain free crates with that then sure that would be amazing. As it stands though I am comlpetely against their crate and key system and not having anyway to get items for free after launch scares me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-03,1,7,376,True,Recommended,200 MBPS Connection and wired in... all day today I caught nothing but network lag and screen lock up. I understand this is early release but I just want to point flaws like this because it is extremely frustrating.I would catch the network lag connection screen and I'd close out the game and reconnect and it would work fine. Then 3 minutes later the same thing would happen.I don't want to recommend this game currently for purchase because the game is still experiencing problems like this that prevent you from being able to actually play the game.As far as game play when it works it is amazing. I love the concept but game inhibiting problems like this are kind of a deal breaker for game purchase.UPDATE This network lag detection seems to be router specific. After locating a reddit post about it I was able to fix the problem using QoS settings. It was strange thought this only recently started happening.

2017-05-27,1,2,29,True,Not Recommended,Hello! So a few weeks ago I purchased this game because of all the talk about it. I was very excited to open and play a new game until I got into it.. So this game is honestly just a complete rip off of H1Z1 King of The Kill which is a game i love! This game has fancy graphics and fancy guns which is a factor that H1Z1 needs. First of all this game is CPU dependant which is not a good thing for me. My cpu is really crappy and this game runs like I have a 200$ CPU and this game cant freaking run. My cpu is kinda old but its expensive ( I could run this game on ultra with 40FPS (also i have a GTX 1080) Im used to playing games smoothly with a solid 100 or so FPS so when a game plays at 40 FPS it looks like trash. GAMEPLAY This game is really pretty and consists of you falling out of a airplane onto a large map filled with 100 other players. You battle to the death with guns and weapons you find around the map. What I hate is that this LITERALLY IS A COMPLETE RIPOFF Of H1Z1 KING OF THE KILL. This game does get a bit boring after like 2 hours of playing it. Idk why this got so boring when ive played h1z1 literally all night. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Ah yes my favorite part of any game (not really) The character customization is simple and crappy. You can choose a hairstyle gender and color of skin. Its really frekin' bad. For example In fallout 4 (one of my favorite games) the character customization is really good because you can COMPLETELY alter the face of your character into whatever you want. This is my longest review lol Weapons Weapons are a big factor in these kind of games. The weapons are very nice in this game with good sound effects and good textures. In H1Z1 there are only like 6 or 7 guns compared to like 30 in this game. Idk if there is any melee weapons in this game or not so im not going to touch this subject. Conclusion My final rating is 4/10 a decent game for newer gamers but crap for expierenced gamers..ALSO THIS IS MY OPINION DO NOT GET MADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Must be nice to exploit the battle royal genre in order to profit big time $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ (11million in the first day of steam sales...) 7/19/17 The lead developer would rather spend his time moderating popular twitch streamers and banning them at the drop of a ball for one team kill as opposed to sending a warning out saying Hey we have a no tolerance rule for team killing. Don t do it again . If team killing was a no tolerance offence why wasn t the game released with a system to report team killers? I know that I am not going to take the time to record and then formally submit a complaint to the website in order to get a mere team killer banned Then the dev went as far as to claim victim over a joke on twitter because they got beat up in college or something stupid like that Dev logic Create a game based on violence then get triggered over someone who s character is based off of violence speed momentum... Are you serious? Are we 10 years old? Can we not take an obvious joke? These are actions from developers I do not support. The game is not that great to overlook these actions taken by THE LEAD DEVELOPER HIMSELF If the lead dev is getting mad over violence imagine what this guy is going to turn this game into . The overdramatic money hungry devs will guaranteed turn this game into the s h i t show that H1Z1 became.1.0 Update 12/21/17Dev logic work on new sh*tty map cars skins loot boxes and vaulting instead of fixing the major lag issues or all the other game ruining problems . 1.0 is an unfinished pile of garbage for a game.

2017-05-14,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Do not buy into the hype just yet huge warning as the game is still in alpha stage it is not optomized at all. Ignore the minimum specs even the recommended specs will run the game sluggish. When the game did run on max settings on a gti 1060 it still didn't look great (the game isn't about graphics anyways) it is the performence of the game that killed it for me and had me go get a refund. For how the game looks and feels I don't see any reason what so ever for an excuse as to how it actually runs. buildings will warp when you try to go through doors sometimes you just completely freeze for no reason even when running good fps it would just completely drop to zero. from what I read i7's and i5's are having the biggest problems I ran a gti 1060 with 16gb ddr4 2133 and a h270 pro motherboard with an i5 4460. This rig and setup runs everything you can throw at it on ultra but because this game is not optomized it runs poorly at times and can cause fps drops and warping near buildings.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Or that could just be me. This game is what you make of it. I generally don't like online FPS but the game premise intrigued me. It's basically like the movie ""Hunger Games"" In the sense that you survive by scavenging for supplies and fighting others players. I hoped to see a sense of tooth and nail stratergy in battle. Unfortunatly the gameplay 95% of the time consists of you getting shot and dying all within the span of about two seconds. There's no way to counteract this. Other FPS titles such as ""Battlefield"" or ""Call of Duty"" get around this dilemma by offering instant respawn. Loading between each match (especially since a game could last potentially no more than a minute) takes about five minutes (which is abysmal).

2017-04-28,1,2,26,True,Not Recommended,Sooo... what do we have in Playerunknown's Battlegrounds? you have your customizable chracter you may play alone or in a group up to 4 people in it you deciede where and when you want to jump out of plane safezone appears after everyone lands on the ground weapons are highlighted so you can't miss them on the ground you will find cars and motorcycles you earn ingame money to buy crates with clothes for your character you may customize your weapons with optics muzzles etc.UI and inventory is clunky but I guess it's a common thing to all games inspired by Arma.Moving your character feels like you were tryng to take a selfie with a brick mounted to your selfiestick.Also every freaking vehicle in this game is a hovercraft in disguise. Seriously I'm worried that if I drive faster I might actually take off with no way returning to the ground. Vehicles are weightless and terrain doesn't affect them as much as it should. Sound variates from good to terrible. Single shots are good but explosions and many simultaneous shots will make your ears bleeding. It's like sound is looping.Despite all similarities to ArmA3 PUBG is an Arcade Shooter and feels like it. While wearing helmet you can eat main dish made of lead twice before it force you to horizontal stance.There is effect of engagement and accomplishment which is good. Participation in game makes you a better fighter and earns you little cash that you can spend on your character.Although I can't recomend it right now especially when you are fellow gamer who earns his money in currency other than $ or . Price 30 is too hight for such a small arcade game even with nice character customization options. It's bet to wait for a discount 20 would be a good deal and everything below 18 sounds like a great deal. The game concept is good but needs some serious polishing. You will encounter lags frame drops bugs that gives advantage to you or your oponent texture glitches drop spawn delays and glitches sound glitches etc. etc.If you believe in optimisation in this game you may as well believe in Satnta. But there is actually a miracle here coz game runs the same on all visual settings. Well different story is that it runs like horse crap.Since my first visit not much has changed I hope developers will keep to their promise and they will fnish the game in a half year period.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The first time I played the game (the day of the release) I remember that I had that feeling telling myself ""this is huge"" .... The last time in my life I had a such great feeling was the first time I played Counter Strike (Alpha version) back in 1999 I told myself this game is special. Ok to be honest I may have told myself the same thing the first time I played GTA... But honnestly I haven't played any game in my life that much I played Counter Strike and I am quite sure that PUBG is here for a long time. What I love with PUBG is that I can run a game in solo whenever I want to play and I don't need to rely on any third people... Random teamates use to be a mess... I love even more when I play the game in squad with some friends and that's what initially loved in Counter Strike the team play.Now many people complain about this game at the eSport level being too random...

You stare at yourself in the mirror. All your clothes are ridiculous looking and your haircut is horrifying. You have terrible taste and it doesn't just show in the games you play.

Hackers are now gone but from my experience I have only encountered 2 hackers (potentially 3) hackers. There's more content in the game now with a new map on the way. (Which is decent have played it.) Mechanics are a lot better compared to EA. Driving is better(ish) Terrain is getting reworked soon Custom Games are really good. New Events Every 2 weeks(?) more or less.I'd bump it up to a 9/10 (From the EA version)10 if they would optimize it more and add more weapons.EARLY ACCESS REVIEW IGNORE ALL THE PLAYERS THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT MICROTRANSACTIONS AND THE BUGS This game is a WIP (Work In Progress). It is in EARLY ACCESS so there are going to be problems with it.All the microtransactions do in this game is give you cosmetic items clothes masks gloves hats etc etc.The game overall is Good .Sure there are bugs hilarious ones at that but who cares? It's not like your life is literally on the line.They're going to fix things like the server issues right now. (Being fixed by tomorrow at the latest)They've already pushed a patch a few hours ago optimizing FPS/Stuttering/etc.I'd give the game right now a 7/10.Needs more content like maps weapons cosmetics.(Cosmetics for the people who do not wish to dish out a few extra dollars)Needs more weather etc. By the way this is all already planned. 7/10. With this new Vaulting System coming out + plus the new map and HOPEFULLY optimizations...Easily could bump this to 9/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-22,2,2,199,True,Not Recommended,"While this game is great and I enjoy it I am giving it a bad review simple because of its players the way people play is disgusting the way they camp I was fully equipped and ready when I heard a guy outside I was on the roof I looked around couldn't find him I finally see him he is at the bottom of my building he has no helmet still has a shotgun and no loot this was at 28 remaining and the safezone was pretty far and quite dangerous if you stayed in it so I try to jump on the ledge on the roof but thanks to this games 100% working mechanics my guy just jumps and gets blocked by ledge meanwhile the other guy went into the house so I decide to be the brave one and make a move I jump down to make a run for my car to at least move away so I am safe from the ""gas"" to my ""surprise"" as soon as I land he kills me with the shotgun now I died I get it you can't win everygame but the fact I died to a guy camping me downstairs with a shotgun no helmet 0 loot at 28 remaining is just like how do you do it?!??!? Like how does this happen how do you not have loot??? was he camping these very houses the whole game? Because they weren't looted like what if I never jumped down? He never knew I had a car I parked it behind another house like if I stayed up there what would he have done? Like it baffles me how he didn't rush me so he can get the **** out of the gas considering he had no helmet and no weapon except a shotgun I highly doubt he had any medical supplies to heal up against the level 3 gas phase and it's like why do I waste my time looting &amp killing to die to this? It isn't worth $30 not in its current state (Referring to all the bugs still in the game and to a lot of stuff that needs work like I landed one time directly next to a guy but my parachute got stuck and it takes like 10 seconds to cut off parachute so I wait and this guy is just staring at me confused when I finally cut it we run for the same house he goes in like 2 seconds earlier from the back and I come in through the front the extra time he had was useless! He had 2 seconds ahead of me and I still managed to loot the m16 and ammo while he looted a shotgun like if I had never got stuck because of that glitch he would've been an easy first kill by far the slowest looter I have met). While what the guy (camping me) did is not wrong its just a waste for my time to be honest and that is why I say the way people play like why not rush me and fight me bro you have a shotgun man the up game is full of cowards don't get me started on the people who loot an x8 scope and an SKS and run for the center of the safezone and camp there.

2017-10-27,0,0,287,True,Recommended,"After about 260 hours of playing this game. There are flaws but there are good things well. A lot of angry entitled kids are gonna whine about a game that's in early access. To those people YOU BOUGHT EARLY ACCESS DID YOU THINK IT WAS GONNA BE DONE OVERNIGHT? IT'S NOT A AAA TITLE RELEASE. That being said here are my pro's and con's.Cons The servers do lag hopefully to be fixed at 1.0 release. The hackers but it comes with the territory. Look at CS GO. At lease the ban waves do come out. That being said I only see real hackers once every 20 games or so. The bugginess. I know most people don't like bugs but I ing love them. But that's only like the car bugs and the ones where you fall through the ground. It gives the game character lol. That being said picking up the same weapon 4 times until it registers is annoying. Single player is kind of dull if you aren't good at the game. I finally have gotten somewhat decent and can hold my own but when I first started it was miserable dying to people that were super good in less than a week of the game being available. Close combat sucks. Shotguns are unpredictable. SMG's are less so but still. They need to fix how much skill you need for close combat. Need more clothes please. I know we just got abunch for gamescom but still not varied enough.Pros The game is a total blast with friends. The thrill of never knowing what might happen gives every match anticipation. My hands shake sometimes when I am on the verge of winning a tough match. Few games make my heart race like this. Strong map. I love how varied and big the map is. It's really fun to drive through the countryside pull over to check buildings to find another team and blast your way through them. The equipment. I like how the guns are varied enough that it just is exciting to find your gun. Every time I find a SCAR L SKS or Mini 14 I get real excited. I am obsessed with getting the attachments I need for them. I once got a fully fleshed out M4 and made my friend spew his drink when I said ""You may be an M4 but you've got a sweet little "" The visuals are pretty good when maxed out. Graphics aren't so high end that I lag or lose frame rate but they are high enough that I enjoy what I see. Good balance of function and form. THE LONG RANGE GUNPLAY IS ING ROCK SOLID. I love taking a shot with a Kar 98k and seeing the bullet zip through the sky and diving straight into someone's skull. It's truly a satisfying feeling. Vehicles Not entirely bad not entirely great. But it's pretty fun ramping off hills in motorcycles and doing flips or crashing through people in the UAZ. Buggies are good. I think Dacia's need some work though.Overall the game has flaws but its strengths stand out. I suggest playing this game with friends but play alone to learn and hone your skills. This game has tons of replay value and is overall good if you realize it is early access. Anyone who complains about the servers lag or other similar flaws before release doesn't really have a right to until 1.0 release. They are just being entitled.SCORE 9/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers who dedicated all of their time just for this game are all wonderful they all support their community as well as listen to the community. I feel that they honestly want to create the perfect game for all of us who has supported them since the beginning to those who support them now and no doubt for those who will support them in the future. This development team and the PUBG is definitely worthy of all of my support as well as all the support the community has given them. I m honestly glad that I was able to witness PUGB from Pre Alpha to Beta. They ve come a long way in such a short period of time it s pretty amazing. I want to say congratulations to Bluehole Inc. on making it this far and for all the entertainment PUGB and the community has given me. Everyone I ve met talked to and played with have been great.

Oh and within months of Alpha release they before updating optimization found time to add in paid content (which they said they would not do until they released Beta). They allow world wide server switching allowing players to have extreme desync advantage. The loot spawns primarily for only those players who have 150+ constant twitch viewers to make the game seem better than it is. Aimbotting hackers in every game. Buildings never render and get you killed instantly when finally starting a match.

2018-06-23,0,0,175,False,Recommended,Let me help you decide if the game is worth your time.PUBG is the game that made the BR genre so popular and is by far the most played game on Steam. It has realistic gunplay mechanics and I haven't yet played a multiplayer game were gunplay is better. The weapons are very good for the most part and a recent balance patched made many of them viable and usable. There are 2 big maps Erangel (green frields and mountains) and Miramar (rocky desert). With the addition of Sanhok the third map this game got a new fresh feeling for me personally. It's very fun and rewarding if you master it and has a really high skill cap.Now a bit about the bad sides of the game. Optimization is poor but getting better. If you have a medium range PC you should be able to play this game easily (my friend is running it with an Athlon X4 AMD Radeon 550 and 8gb of DDR3 ram without problems). The server tickrate has been increased which improved gameplay a lot. The servers are unstable from time to time and that can sometimes be annoying but the devs are very communicative on Discord and quickly resolve these issues.What people have been crying about but is honestly a stupid reason to complain about are cosmetics clothes and weapon skins. They are completely irrelevant to the gameplay and expecting to get them for free is unfair. Nobody is forcing you to buy it if somebody really wants them he will spend 10 for a weapon skin. Focus on playing the game properly instead of playing it with fancy skins.Conclusion The 20 price tag is really good for somebody who wants to get into this game if that somebody likes realistic shooting mechanics a big map and hardcore gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Despite this there are downsides as all modern day games have. Lets start with the pros It is fun very fun. The safezone system works very well and is acurate/fair on its damage The feeling of winning is great each and everytime The current map Erangel Is great it has such a variety of areas to go to which can never get boring the new Desert map sounds great as well and will only boost this games immense popularity I personally like the crates and cosmetics for this game its a nice feature. I know it went agaist what the developers said to be in the early access version but it is a much better experience with it than without it. I still don't get why micro transations are so hated its your own choice to buy them and people like me can make money off it and it helps out the dev's. And many more that I will have forgot to mention Moving on to the cons of this game You will need a fair PC to run this game Currnetly the movment while jumping things like the walls is clunky but that should be fixed in the next vaulting/leaping update There is lag at the start of each game making picking up items a little messed up and glichly which can really screw you over at certain parts of the map e.g. School. Servers are not the greatest to say the least Overall its a great game 10/10 from me which it will only get better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A real shame...I only recommend this game if you have a group of friends that already have this game who you can play with. This game get REALLY sickening if you play for much hours.

2017-03-23,0,0,2229,True,Recommended,First off let me say I put in ALOT of hours in the open beta and couldn't not wait for this to hit EA.What I like The gun selection is awesome and it looks like more to come even one came out with EA's release You don't just find weapons lying around in this Battle Royale you can fit your weapon with various scopes grips and other mods The realism (compared to the other popular Battle Royale game H1Z1) You can't premed before a fight in order to have an upper hand on your opponent Jumping exists in this game but none of this unrealistic rage inducing bhopping that can prevent others from getting a hit on you (might I also bring up the prone and crouch spammers of H1 here As well) Vehicles are balanced and it isn't practical to play hide and seek all game in one like in H1Z1 (plus you can't jump out at high speed to get the drop in an enemy like in H1. Gameplay is smooth although you can get stuck on certain things fairly easy so new players beware jumping on everythingWhat I think should be improved and my only issue is optimization. However it's at the top of the devs priority. Also most negative reviews you will see her give it a thumbs down for this reaon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-26,2,1,419,True,Not Recommended,Wish I didn't buy this game it's fun at first then gets boring very fast if you sit in a building and play safe the entire time it's an easy win Most servers have insane Lag gotta pick up ammo 4 times and then load your gun 3 times overall it's not worth buying because you will quickly get bored of Tyler Perry's battlegrounds aka a ing joke of a game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2019-01-04,0,0,32,False,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is currently the largest battle royale on Steam. I first played this game when it just came out and was still in beta. Back then it was a buggy mess and it still is but I have seen lots of improvement for peformance. This game is not easy to run and I do not recommend playing this on a low end computer. The weather is pretty loud honestly but it doesn't bother me that much. PUBG is also very slow paced and not everyone is a fan of that. Controls feel fine in my opinion and the shooting is also great. I hope to see improvements to the game in the future. I rate PUBG a 6/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I highly recommend this game for the price of 30 /$. Since it hasn't reached the release yet I wasn't mad that first person servers weren't implemented until a few days ago. Just look at BF1 that game was released at full price without optional hardcore settings (How could they ever do that?) while this game already has everything it needs! The whole drama around microtransactions was rightful and as you can see the devs listened to the players We now have free cosmetics and optional ones! Great!Only negative aspect atm I wished that ""stream sniping"" wasn't against the rules. Other devs handled this issue better. IMHO I think that streamers should worry about that issue not devs. Banning people for stream sniping who claim to be innocent left a bitter taste in my mouth.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Overrated game honestly 30 euros is too much for this I'd say about 20 is enough.Meh they should add meh as an option instead of just recommended and not recommended.This has nothing to do with me being a CS GO player cause I see "" only CS GO players woud hate this cause it overpassed CS GO "". It did but that dosen't mean anything to me honestly I just don't like it at it's current state.I refunded to buy something classic but thats not really immportant.Overall this is overrated basic survival game atm hopefully they will add more and make it better in future.

Thats 1 headphone a day. Ive basically muted the game entirely at this point and im looking towards getting a restraing order on everyone i queue up with because of my female character model. I get sexually harassed for having a girl player model i picked on accident and i cant afford the 3000 coin fee to change my character. The PUBG corporation really bit the bullet with this one.

Would be good for them to concentrate on the basic stuff and get that right first. But they seem to keep adding things to keep the cash flow going first and losing the original players.So it is now official it has been announced that this game uses RNG to determine hits.... in an FPS!

Even then the game looks super blurry cartoony and laggy. I don't always complain about grahpics but the settings in this game make it unplayable. With Medium high settings you can't see more than 100 feet before it looks like you opened your eyes underwater. In its current state I can not recommend this.

It's frustrating that I'm not allow to play but it gives me time to review why I played in the first place. Currently I play Pubg at a steady 19 21 fps maximum on very low settings. Even though I get frustrated all the time lagging through space and time I enjoy the fact that I get to play with my friends. I hope Pubg would reconsider their ban on my account as soon as possible because these times of fun doesn't last forever. I would recommend all to come play Pubg to earn that Chicken Dinner.

Most of this game the only thing youll be doing is running to get to the zone for 30 minutes then dying to the zone anyone not finding a gun after looting 10 buildings failing to pick up the loot even though youre pressing f on it then an enemy picks it up or just have the game not be able to handle the amount of people land in one area and it turns into a ing slide show.

2017-10-27,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. TLDR This game is trash buy DayZ instead.What is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds?PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds (or PUBG for short) is a battle royale shooter game developed by Bluehole Incorporated. Originally it was a mod for the popular Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead mod DayZ. It was later re released for Arma 3 as a mod which would later lay the groundwork for H1Z1 King Of The Kill. PUBG finally became a standalone title when the closed beta testing started on 7th of September 2016. It was released on Steam on the 24th of March 2017.I first heard of PUBG was around the start of this year the Twitch streamer Xiceman (pronounced x ice man) was playing I was almost instantly intrigued by the game. I would later be able to play the game when I received it as a birthday gift.Since its release as an Arma 3 mod it has barely changed staying almost identical in gameplay. This may seem appealing to those who played the Arma 3 mod version. Every match is the exact same jump from the plane down to the map grab gear get some kills head to the next circle before the blue circle catches up with you grab more gear get more kills rinse and repeat. There is little to do in PUBG except play the normal mode and hopefully be able to play the zombies mode. However it does feel different but the same with every match giving a false sense of variety. There is no strategy to PUBG it s just hoping that you can find good enough gear enough meds and that everyone else has the accuracy of a stormtrooper.The mechanics in this game are at a minimum of very basic shooter mechanics. This means you can run walk lean throw grenades shoot aim jump drive and heal. As I said very basic. Ths may take away from the game to some people as they may expect more from a game that has gone through so many iterations.Even through all of its flaws this game currently holds the most concurrent players on Steam at over two million players.Why don t I like PUBG?Some people that may read this will think Oh you re just salty because you re bad at the game or something along those lines but that s not the case as I find that PUBG is far too one dimensional. All it is is just running around grabbing as much gear and killing as many people as you can find. There is no character there is no sense of progression. It s nothing but an endless cycle that never changes in the slightest. The community is another huge drawback for me a large part of it particularly toxic attacking anyone who criticises the game. Streamers are also a problem in the community as there are countless false reports of people being banned for stream sniping (stream sniping is when someone watches a stream to obtain the ingame location of the streamer). The reason these would be false is that Bluehole s anti cheat is particular towards the big streamers as they promote the game in the biggest way possible and they do it for free. I definitely can t forget the bugs and other related issues with this joke of a game. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches that can cost you a match. The servers are also an absolute joke. It doesn t matter what server you play on because you will lag. The performance is terrible the game is poorly optimised as it can barely run on a computer 10 times as powerful the recommended minimum. Christ DayZ runs better than this! Speaking of DayZ let s talk about how that is a better game. The optimisation is far better. You can at least run that on a Nvidia 940mx on low and get a good frame rate whereas PUBG can barely reach 20 frames on the lowest settings on a Nvidia Gtx1060. Oh and don t forget that DayZ isn t just a glorified kill fest. It actually has variety and depth in its content. Now I know someone will see this and say Oh DayZ that s such a bad game. It ll never leave early access. If that s the case then neither will this. Bluehole have set an unrealistic deadline for the full release of PUBG which is later this year. If they were to be realistic about it then they should have set the date for mid next year. Considering half of the features they want to put into this game there is not enough time for the dev team to implement the detailed mechanics the new map optimise the game in time and release a stable console version. The history of PUBG is extremely similar to the early history of DayZ. The devs have promised a lot but have delivered little. The best way to describe PUBG content wise is wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle. Because of this I recommend that you do not purchase PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-01,6,47,750,False,Recommended,After more than 500 hours of playtime I feel it's a good time to write a review. As of a few days ago this is the most played game in my beloved Steam library (with almost a thousand titles in it) but is it the best game I own (or ever played)? No no it's not. It goes without saying that the game is very addictive and fun but it has its fair share of problems. The game looks and runs pretty good (after who knows how many patches) but there are still bugs and connectivity issues (that I find understandable considering just how many players are in the game at one given time). The gameplay is the main star of the show the concept itself is great 100 players start a game and only player (or team) can win combine that with tight gunplay a loot system and tense situations that constantly keep you on your toes you get a one of a kind thrilling experience that will often leave you shaking from excitement (especially the first few times you get in a top 10 situation). When you actually win in a match it really makes you feel like you accomplished something amazing. This game would be close to a perfect experience if not for the problems mentioned before and the cheaters that (although not nearlly as much as before) still plague the matches and ruin the whole experience for everyone. Even with the problems this game has and the frustration those problems sometimes cause it would be foolish not to recommend this game to pretty much anyone who enjoys multiplayer shooters or just wants a thrilling experience like no other in a game. Oh and the developers are constantly working to make the game more stable and balanced root out the cheaters and also add new content constantly (although sometimes it seems they could do a better job fixing issues considering just how many funds they have). Oh yeah there are also in game items an purchases all of which is completely optional and cosmetic (no pay to win crap). All in all this is a great game and an even better experience but come armed with a lot of patience and strong nerves ) 8.9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-13,1,9,838,False,Recommended,PUBG is extremely fun and rewarding for some and excrutiatingly painful for others. From 600 hours of gameplay plus another 600 of watching people stream the game on Twitch I believe I can pinpoint the type of person who would enjoy it.PUBG is for gamers who enjoy the thrill of an extremely hard earned victory the challenge of playing against other humans in PVP the freedom to play as aggressively or passively as they prefer and still be rewarded the freedom to go anywhere you wish and try different strategiesAnd perhaps most importantly the chance to constantly improve and adapt after failure and defeatThere is a lot of failure and defeat in this game. There are some bugs too but I personally am not bothered too much by the bugs. I quit playing when the hacking was out of control but it improved quickly. The bugs are very annoying but you can learn to play around them. If you are someone who rages when things do not go your way do not play this game. You will get beat a lot mostly because of your own mistakes. There are enough bugs that it is very easy to blame the bugs instead of your mistakes and if you fall into that trap you will never get any better. So if you rage easily don't waste your time.A note on PUBG Corp and their failure to fix issues the game is most popular in China and in China Third Person Perspective (TPP) is the most popular mode. Players put a lot of stock in their appearance. PUBG is filling this need through pay to look good options. Players who enjoy the more competitive FPP rarely see themselves and care much less about clothes and more about game performance. PUBG has predictably focused more on the money than on optimization. Like the many negative reviews on Steam I agree that PUBG is making a mistake in this regard however unlike most of the reviews I still enjoy playing the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Played everything from Civ/age of empire/TF2 to CS 1.6 to Starcraft when the game would lose connection from a phone call to Overwatch being top500 last 3 seasons. I played a bit of dayz when I had a computer and it wasn't very fun because of how bad it would run for me. Fast forward to this past month I picked up a new computer with one of my paychecks and bought PUBG because of a suggestion from a friend.From my first game I've been hooked the thing I love about games is the adrenaline rush of an intense game. With this game its almost like every second has that adrenaline and is 10 fold more when it gets to the last circles. Nothing I love more than that feeling of hands sweating and heart pumping out of my chest. So far I've won about 8 games and even when you lose that 1v1 there's only a quick second of "" me"" but you can always tell where you went wrong and what you did wrong in those situations which I love.PUBG has ruined games for me I don't get excited for them anymore which I've figured out in between weekends of the beta where I realized how boring Overwatch was even in top500 winning games as widow.

After sitting in the connection screen for quite some time it just returns you to the main screen with an error message that the connection to the host was lost. Happened to me 11 out of 13 times by now. The forums contain plenty of threads regarding thing but neither the dev nor a mod have yet made any announcement regarding this. I'm fine with Early Acces games being buggy or poorly optimized but if the Early Access game is a multiplayer only with obviously non funtionion netcode I'm not fine with it. PU should get back to mod existing games instead of programming a new one at least with stolen netcode it works.""I got it done and it now works for me regarding the matchmaking so this point is cleared BUT The game still crashes on returning to lobby and the optimization is quite a big deal. Right now at it's current state I will keep my negative score as I don't think that the game is worth it's money right now. But as for Early Access performance and the lobby crashing might/will change with future updates. I will keep this review updated with every change (be it for good or worse)EDIT After quite a while with the game now I still say it is fun ... when it works. The connection issues are still present just like the server lags. The performance even worsened over several patches instead of getting better. Beside this issue the game still is lacking some major features which were promised on EA release FPP is extremely unstable and glitchy no offline shooting range still messed up vehicle physicsAnd besides those issues the developer devided to not take care of those bugs and performance issues or even implement new features instead Brendan Greene (real name of PU) decided to put microtransactions into his game and host tournaments. While as a game it is fun if you can play it stable Greene turned out to be one extremely shady and disrespectful person even going so far to ban someone for being accused of streamsniping of which Greene (he admitted it himself) had no real proof but the streamer said he was streamsniped (he was playing without any delay ... come on ...). Also several threads pointing out especially this shady behavior and especially pointing out that PUBG shows more and more signs of being a scam&amp run in the long shot (2 to 3 years) are deleted without any notice of the deletion. Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is one perfect example of a shady dev milking the good faith of customers with misusing early access and this should not be supported. Anti consumer at it's finestEDIT ****************************BREAKING NEWS******************************************I'm a bit late as I nearly missed it and just learned about the latest Bluehole shenanigans The amount of chinese players led to a lot of downtimes queueing issues and server crashes on the chinese side as BH's provider could not handle the traffic. Instead of getting in touch with a capable provider and getting some more potent servers running they decided to contact a fee based chinese proxy provider. Now chinese players have to PAY on a MONTHLY base a THIRD PARTY COMPANY to be even able to play the game. This by itself is ridiculous enough but in the bigger picture are not only the chinese forced to pay third party to play they are also raising the traffic in all other regions as they have to play via VPN on the servers.

Player movement seems to be synchronized over the network so it feels very laggy at all times. It's not the Unreal engine or my hardware that makes it laggy but the game's network architecture. The results of in game shoot outs are very random and it's impossible to run and gun due to movement lag so everyone just sits in corners and waits for other players to move.

2017-10-02,0,0,432,True,Recommended,Great game for anyone who actually likes shooters. This isn't your standrard bs Call of Duty game it's raw and realistic (to a point). Your heart rate will eventually go down after the first time you're hiding and someone finds you before you find them. The only real way to win this game is to be tactful and stragetic with your movements. The map (there is only one right now) takes a while to learn I would suggest looking up some youtube videos to get ahead of the game. Everyone has their different stragetics. I would suggest joining the discord channel that's linked on the /r/puBATTLEGROUNDS subreddit. Easy to hop into a match and find team mates along with advise if you want to seek it out. There is an automatching service in the game but there's a 50/50 chance your team mate will just track you down and kill you since the reporting system is a shell in it's current state.Perfect 5/7 in it's current state. It's still an EAG so expect server issues and bugs.

You can't connect to a server if you are over 200 ping. It won't work for you.This on the other hand they allow everyone to connect from anywhere. The battle eye anti cheat must be a half day working anti cheat. It only recognizes the cheat signatures. It doesn't prevent the cheats. So someone can play hours uppon hours and still cheat if it doesn't see the cheat signature.You can't get a good team game alot of times because the asians connect to north american servers and some of them cheat you can't communicate with them obviously. But bluehole insists on this stupid social expierment. They think it brings players together. The maker off pubg things we are racists because we want to play with only people from north america.

Well PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is the game for you! On top of that the game is a full product without any issues! Spraying a full magazine into a person from point blank range will always kill them!

2018-09-13,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Playing this game has had its ups and downs I will say that. But the game is for people who want to have a strategy and more realistic game play than Fortnite or Call Of Duty Black Ops 4. Now I am not saying these other games are bad they are all equally good it just depends on what you want. You want cool skins and to build then there is Fortninte if you want faced paced future is tic then there is Call Of Duty Black Ops 4 and if you want a longer more strategy and realism game then there is PlayerUknown's Battlegrounds. The point is there are 3 great battle royal games that offer different tastes. ( I am using these three battle royal games but there are more). So for me personally i like a PUBG better than the other ones but i respect the other battle royal games and play them and enjoy them as well.

2017-04-10,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,"So I've beem playing this game for a long while now ( a little after it became avalible for purchase ) And when I first got it It was understandable the bugs the random freezing the atrocious hit scan and net code but hey its an EA game ( at the time a pretty new one ) so I expected it to improve as time went on but here I am 3am having some pancakes writing a review for what I hoped was going to be a vast improvement over my initial one quite the opposite sadely. The hit detection has gotten a bit better but it seems as though even with a power house of a PC on low graphics and with above average internet connection the game freezes for almost a half a second every twenty to twenty five seconds.In a game where reaction time is 75% or more of combat this is unacceptable. Next we have weapon inconsistencies. Shotguns fall into the generic shooter catagory by either blowing a hole the size of a bowling ball through someone or firing confetti. SMGs and PDWs are marginally useful but the only one of real use is the vector the UMP9 is nice (easy to find ammo good ROF accurate well rounded) but the 9x19mm just doesnt hold up the the ROF and .45acp of the K 10. ARs are your best bet and snipers are well sort of a gimick. SRs are there to satisfy the AWP users from CS and sniper mains from TF2. You can do the same thing and more with a AR. ""Oh but it does more damage and rewards people for accuracy (headshots)"" The ARs do the same thing but bring more to the table different firing modes for longer or shorter range shorter i.e. better to peek corners and clear buildings can fit everything from mags grips stocks barrel attachments red dots and holo's to ACOGs and rifle scopes (8x). That in conjunction with what was said in the previous paragraph and the one to come make precision shots difficult at longer ranges especially with a slower firing harder kicking rifle. This coupled with character models being slightly ahead of their hit boxes and other player's connections coming from a taco bell in northern india make the combat laughable at best. Countless times I've been in situations that would have ended in a piping hot chicken dinner but because of the issues listed above other players were simply able to use the half a second of time to dome me. I hope to see this game improves it has so much potential so much character a passionate and energetic player / fan base to go along with equally active and passonate devs etc. They are driving down the right road but instead of slowing down to see what the strange noise is coming from under the hood they keep pushing on instead of addressing the issue and trying to fix it before continuing on and even though they might get to where they are going they will be left with a smoldering pile of garbage that no one but a select few will want to stick around to play.

2018-07-27,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I have only accumulated 9hrs thus far. And it will probably stay around that. The reason is simple Gameplay and movement mechanics.To me this is the most important aspect of a game. It is why I have collected over 3k hrs in counter strike in total. It is why I loved the Jedi Knight series back in the day. It is what makes Titanfall so enjoyable and it is the same reason why I took the time to learn the ins and outs of Fortnite. Movement is fun when done right. In PUBG the movement feels similarly as it does in Donkey Kong or in the old Mario Kart 64. It is imprecise it feels wishy washy and everything but crisp. These two however and unlike PUBG have some charm to them. Whether through their art style or the characters themselves or the sheer nostalgia. PUBG on the other hand has neither the looks nor the charm. A friend gifted PUBG to me.

2017-08-04,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I could elaborate but this runaway abortion of a game should be canned. Shallow repetitive gameplay mixed with an obnoxious player base makes this a waste of your hard earned money.

2017-10-11,0,0,21,True,Recommended,First off i'm a total noob at playing the game but i have watched a few hundred hours of twitch streams before finally taking the plunge.Anyways....If you are not a y stream sniper sulking over a ban (3/4 of the downvotes) or actually have a reasonable spec machine (the other 25%) it's a great game. )It is early access so there are some wrinkles yet to be addressed and i daresay many more yet to be unearthed. While it is true to say that the philosophy of not wanting to lock the game down completely while monetising cosmetic upgrades has at the moment attracted a rash of script kiddies which is unfortunate. but the presence of cheaters is hardly the developers fault (weeeeeeel mostly not their fault). Hopefully this will be addressed soon. For sure it sucks when you get headshot from about 3 miles away 1/2 second after you break cover but what you gonna do? considering 99% of the times you get killed is a result of you doing something dumb ) at least there's not some big narrative with cut scenes to sit through. You get dead dust yourself off and start murdering all over again.The thing the cheaters don't get is the inexorable rise of the heartbeat as that number in the top right gets smaller and smaller and from the streams i have watched that feeling never goes away.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's not that great just houses on a grassy plain. 2) Game is buggy...clipping looking through walls etc. Lots of exploit opportunities.3) Game is slow to load and is massively unoptimized.

(Downside is that they seem to love focusing on making them only drop in care packages!)Ok ima be honest here at first this game ran pretty i run it on a 1050 ti 4gb but from the last few monthly updates and weekly updates hot damn playing this game on ultra everything is amazing! especially when it runs in 55 75 fps across all the mapBoats...they're always fun to have chases inGet this....People ing about the gamescom crate needing money while H1Z1 needed money for almost all their crates! sure every 5 levels in h1 gives you a free crate but once you get higher you out of luck in this almost all the crates (With few exceptions) can be bought with In Game points! best part? if your like me and have good and bad games you'll get points fairly easyattachments DO MAKE A GREAT DIFFERENCE!swimming is fun...map is big but very rich in details in where it mattersif you want to play a round or two not taking the game seriously at first land at military base i always have a blast even when i dieleaning! i can lean! yes! believe me when i say i lean ALOTAlot of people DONT know this but They have a ""Rainbow Six Siege"" stealth mechanic in the game when you hold ""Alt"" and move you're Much more quiter and take of your shoes and crouch and hold ""Alt"" you literaly become a ninja!Driving is AMAZING in my opinion i love the way the vehicles feel and drive also ""phyx"" is alway fun to play with managed to catch a supply crate with my Hood of my docia (Regular car but ironically the fastest vehcile in the game aside from the Motorcycle) here are some of MY consnew weapons are being more ""one sided"" as in you need to actually get them in the crate in the gamemotorcycles are fun...but very easy to die from if you have no skill like mei play with graphics on ultra everything but those who play on very low everything can see crystal clear in shadows while i cant! this woulnt be so bad if it wasnt for the fact that on low everything the players can be more""Prominant"" (as in easier to see)It would seem as though the ""Ban hammer"" is getting ""heavier""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-29,0,0,82,True,Not Recommended,This game would be good with better circles. You have idiots who are number hungry kill wise and will go for every kill possible disregarding the circles and not aiming to win the game which is the objective of the game. The situations with the circles always force this rushed scenario where those who try to win get shot in the back and those who aren't trying to win or are simply stupid die in the blue after shooting at someone else. Network issues cause players to clip through walls etc so that during a gun fight you are shooting at where you think the player is and then they come back around the wall they were at 3 seconds ago to shoot you.Summary circles need to be HEAVILY revised to prevent these ridiculous situations that will kill most decent players with the hands of idiotic players or the circle itself and people lagging need to not gain an advantage from this against other players otherwise this will get abused.EDIT Game still sucks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I very much hope soThe game has ALOT of problems and the developers aren't doing anything at the moment about it... BUT! When/if they do then this game will be absolutely perfect i have never won a single game and i am absolutely garbage at the game but it is still so fun! I am 10 times better at Fortnite Battle Royale (A complete rip off pubg) and i have won a game of that during the 3 days i played it for. But Fortnite still isn't fun PUBG however is a very very fun game despite all of its flaws the game will be perfect once the developers fix all of those flaws hopefully before its full release in December... Overall despite the flaws its a fabulous game...P.S. So i heard that this game will be coming to XBOX once its released in December if a Bluehole developer sees this (which i doubt they will) I would love to see if they could also port this game to PS4 aswell i do not own an XBOX or a PS4 but I know some PS4 players who would adore having this game on their consoles i think that everybody no matter what platform they use should be able to play this great game...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Having to constantly run when trying to scavenge for supplies and if you dont run you die. That simple. The game is fun when it runs right and that so far has been a rare sight.

2017-05-08,0,0,299,True,Not Recommended,"First off these ""early access"" games need to stop just because can be ""played"" does not mean it should be sold. Maybe i am just old school but games should at maybe 60 65% then doing an alpha test for the devs and family. Then take it down finish most of the game up 90 95% then if you want do a closed beta or an open beta test the game out. Then take the beta down finish up the game polish it up and then sell it. To me it is like selling a car to someone here is your car.........oh sorry there is no oil in the car.....or brake pads....or brake lights....or transmission fluid....or gas........or side view mirrors........but you can at least get in the car and push the pedals and play with the steering wheel. Sure probably not the best thing to compare it to but you get the idea i was going for. But the big things are the loading screen you sit and wait and the loading screen. You can hear everything else going on the plane flying people talking but the loading screen is still up. /even farting around with all the settings turning this down and this up that down and this up. Uninstalling the game and reinstalling it trying the F11 trick so the screen goes to window mode and back.What i did see from the one game i got into it did look really nice and sounds were amazing. 3 / 10.

2017-03-25,0,0,178,True,Recommended,Ok so this is probably my 2nd or 3rd review on a game so take this review very lightly as I'm new to this. Thanks.PRO Action packed Fast Paced Sounds are spot on servers host just under 100 people you die? you find a game within 10 seconds devs seem very keen on finishing this project it has a duo/4 man team system which is great for me with mates. there are more but I can't think of them as of now.CON No Ocienic Servers Mic spam is insanely loud crouch walking is louder than running I find this weird. it may be only my headset doing this. massive lag at the start of a match and through out the match sometimes hit detection feels off you can light a guy up with 4 5 confirmed hits with blood spirting out and the guy shrugs it off and one taps you with his mini uzi. Vehicals seem broken but work much better than arma 3 vehicals. the force fields visibility is really hard to see through so don't expect to see someone behind you if they are behind the electric wall. hackers I've seen many youtube clips of people hacking. its sad anyone that hacks needs to have their entire steam account Vacced. we need more variation of weapons I know there's a fair bit out now but I find almost the same things in these buildings akm m16 m4 sp12 pistols. its fine but yeah would like it to be harder to get a gun and less ammo avaliable. no skins for guns I know its early access but perhaps get the community onto it now and when you're ready have a quick geez at them. probably more but will edit if I remember.overall I give this game a 7/10its fun its addictive fast paced consistant fluid and most of all a real tactical shooter.

It was really surprising to me how enjoyable the game is behind such a simple premise parachute into an island and kill each other last person standing is the winner. No story being told. No plot twists. Just... madness and gratuitous violence* until 1 out of 100 players wins the match! I started playing and in less than 2 weeks at least 5 of my friends joined me. We now play as squads whenever possible and that's an even better experience you wouldn't believe a war game could end up being so hilarious with friends!Another interesting thing the game seems to very quickly pay for itself if you sell your cosmetic items on the Steam Market. In 63 hours of play I've managed to sell about 80% of the game's price in items you get as rewards for simply playing the game. I'm guessing this game will pay for it's own cost in no more than a couple of weeks more. That's pretty neat.*(don't worry though there's no gore at all just ""red mists"" when you hit an enemy)EDIT After a couple of months and almost 250 hours of play time this game paid for itself more than twice over for me.

2017-04-18,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,I'm gonna give this game a streight thumb down until they don't remove the third person. However don't get deceived by the trailer there are no situations like these in the game since the players will just camper in a corner of a house in the safe zone waiting for you to pass through and then killing you instantly. You can't react in the first place it is very hard to spot the players in the environment and even tho you see him the lag and the fps drops will make anything you do useless long story short the first one who shoots wins. The combat system is very unpleasant everything feels too small fast and inconsistent and all these things make the aiming inaccurate just as the movements. Not a bad game tho it's the best battle royal for sure but it needs a lot of work.It's still an aplha probably will remain an alpha forever just like the other games in early access but i hope in some decent improvements from the developers. And above all please let's get rid of the third person camera.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-30,0,0,47,True,Not Recommended,Apart from the fact that the game gets boring after a few hours because there's only one mode it runs like poop on my high end gaming laptop. I can run any other game on the market on the highest settings but this game....start up is slow loading is slow freezing is commonplace. Nothing worse than having to stand around 3 5 minutes for buildings to load so you can go inside and loot them. You're either going to die before the buildings load or you're going to be significantly behind everyone else. Now I realize not everyone experiences these problems. For some the game runs perfectly. However with the massive amounts of money the devs are making off this game they should have the resources to fix these issues which a decent chunk of their playerbase appears to be dealing with. When new modes are introduced and issues like the ones above are fixed I'll change my review. So till the game is optimized I do not recommend PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-24,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,Positives Addictive/Replayability The game is somewhat addictive as much as I loath this game I keep finding myself playing more.The idea behind this game is great which I believe is why a lot of people initially jumped on board with this one.Some of the ideas implemented into this game such as the closing circle forcing people to face combat with each other is a great idea.Negatives Poor graphics For a game which initially pushed me into buying a GTX1080ti OC running this game on ultra is not quite as satisfying as I would have thought the game environment looks very unpolished and even games which were made 5 6 years ago have better looking terrain and textures than this.Poor Physics In this day and age you would expect a level of Person to terrain relationship that adds a feeling of exploration and sense of success when you find some hard to reach hiding spot that makes you feel like you have found your own cool little corner that nobody knows about unfortunately with this game you do not get that experience as the physics engine is very basic and often quite buggy.BUGS So many bugs collision in this game is on a prehistoric level but with bugs at least prehistoric physics engines worked.. For the most part. I think some of the bugs which people are complaining about is a little bit blown out of proportion by all means the game is definitely playable and some of the collision issues such as dying on a crashed motorbike because you hit a tiny mound are things you get used to and can get around although tediousHACKERS Despite the devs claiming to have a hard stance on cheating in the game you will notice it quite often that's not to say that every single game will be won by a hacker in fact most games I have played I have not noticed any hackers but I have come across a couple and in a game where you can spend quite a bit of time roaming around finding good loot and even getting within the 10 player count.. To be killed by someone who does an instant 180 zoom to your head is ragequitting material..Player Base Unless you live in China you will probably only find a game during peak times I am on holiday at the moment and do not bother matchmaking during the day as nobody is on.. Seems this game is dying on top of all the other issues it faces.All in all it is a good game but in its current state I cannot recommend anybody buy it especially considering the following.1. The devs (with all their money) do bugger all about fixing core issues and adding content (that you don't have to pay for)2. There are surely other great games of this style by now which are probably a lot more active.3. The game is slowly dying the devs and their foolishness are aggravating people into going somewhere else.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-15,0,0,210,False,Recommended,"First off I have to applaud Brendan Greene for fighting though the hardships of making his game concept a reality through the years of hard work. It wasn't easy and took many years but he did it and now is reaping his well earned rewards.Secondly if you have never heard of this new game style is called Battle Royal. The concept is amazing. You drop in a city of your choice loot kill and fight to find cover in the new play area which is constantly being restricted until one player is left alive.However there are some major issues with the game which are Bad Servers performance Hit detection Audio is only left ear/right ear also front gun shots sound the same when being shot from the back NOT (7.1 or even 5.1) Cheaters of course (you can make money from in game items) and the desert map is too big when only 50 people who are left after 15 min..walk/loot/drive simulator. Honestly I think the idea of the game is something that will resonate throughout the gaming industry for a very long time. I can understand why Bluehole created the game in a unexpensive way. I feel they did this because they had no idea it was going to be so popular.Currently the way the handled their player base complaints in the media was very poor. Additonally the lack of fixing the major issues with servers sound and cheating personally leads me to believe that Bluehole is finding it very hard to fix these problems because of the way it was developed or they do not want to put too much more money into the game than is needed. They made much more than they expected.The reason for not wanting to put exorbitants amount of money into this game is I and many of the player base feels something is off in the PUBG air. Eventually an established gaming company will release their version of a realistic Battle Royal and PUBG will be a memory of the past which will be referenced in a comical fashion towards other games.Unless Bluehole finds a way to build their newly founded gaming business and fix these major issues Server performance Hit detection Audio location Cheating and creating a map that is more suited to the way the rounds playout I feel this game will not last the player base will continue to drop as it has been for some time now.It is a lot on the table for this newly formed gaming company and I really hope they are able to fix these issues sooner rather than later. Finally I would recommend this game purely on the basis of being able to relate towards others after its' day has passed but I would not get over worked with these issues just yet as it is still is in Alpha and was made on the ""cheap"". This game has major potential ""fingers crossed""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

First off this game's hitboxes for bullets never count when they should. There is very little skill involved in playing as the weapon spawns are completely random and it only matters who jumps out of the plane first who grabs the best spawned random loot wherever they dropped first and reloaded it faster. I think it would be even playing field if everyone at least spawned with a pistol for some type of self defense. Next point getting punched in the face with a stupid targeting system instanly kills you. WASTED 30$. Don't fall into the hype train for this game definitely not worth it.

2017-12-24,0,0,142,False,Recommended,I waited to buy this game due to being swindled on 3 early access games so far and I can say it is deffinitely worth it. I just came from h1z1 and fortnite and this is way more fun to me. If you think the price is a tad steep I would recommend going to cdkeys.com and they sell it for $25 then go like their facebook page for a discount I ended up paying $23 and am fine with that $30 is just a little much for an early access game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,1103,True,Not Recommended,"Really unhappy with the direction this game is going. From their official FAQ Are there going to be microtransactions?Yes but only for purely cosmetic items and only after Early Access."" PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds FAQPlayerUnknown said there wouldn't be any tournaments until it came out of EA. Yet here they are using the crate money to fund a tournament.He said there would be no micro transactions until it came out of EA but here he is adding one that is limited time only. Which means if you don't pay for it during the few weeks it's available you won't be able to get it.They've pushed the launch back and moved the micro transactions forward. This is exactly the opposite of what PU claimed he was going to do and everyone seems to be cheering it on.No free crates in the future https //i.redd.it/z7sjytczirbz.pngThey believe the CSGO model is the best for them https //puu.sh/wTsPw/13b3a89981.pngI can't support this game any more if this will be their model and it just goes to show they care less about putting the game out and meeting their promises and more about lining their pockets. It's completely anti consumer. It's not an issue of ""being affected"" by it. It's an issue of ""I want this and the way they're trying to sell it to me is t"". I know some of you play games like CSGO or whatever and think a system like this is reasonable because you're used to it but it's not.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-18,0,0,120,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The intentions of the develop are clearly dishonest Be aware that only the first reward item you buy ingame is bough with the points you score ingame.After that you have to pay 2.5 euro/dollar to actually access a random item.....this item can be just a white shirt or something else totally insignificant.The problem is that when you find out you'll be passed the 4 hour refund limit that Steam upholds and you cant get your money back.Aside of the value of the reward I think it's dishonest not to clearly state that you play for rewards that cost you actual money. There are no level you gain or anything else just a bunch of clothes which look like anyway,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-14,0,0,51,True,Recommended,I think a review should be based on the game itself and not on the developers or their actions but on the quality of the game itself not that I have a problem with purely cosmetic microtransactions in a 30 dollar game.If you're looking for a game that is essentially one massive battle royale then get Battlegrounds.The gun and vehicle mechanics feel good and the graphics are great if you have the rig to handle turning them up to high or ultra though medium settings like I run with are still pretty good for a game like this.I dont have a very high end PC but on medium settings I average about 30 40 FPS which for me is satisfactory especially considering I've never had a PC before reacently that can run games like this.Even though I haven't played it much just due to my friends and I not being able to set up a time to really sit down and play for a while yet to me it's a fun game with a lot of potential that like I said if you want to play a game that is a massive 100 player battle royale I recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Great graphics better netcode guns feel like they have more of an impact and overall the game feels a lot less buggy. Weather effects make it a lot more atmospheric and little things like a gridded minimap and hold click third person aim tap click first person aim make a big difference.The only thing I feel it needs to improve on is the optimisation. The game can go from 90fps to 30fps depending on how built up the area is but I hear the next update will have optimisation fixes.The dev also want to add mod support which is always welcome.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In the meantime I play pubg because it makes me (middle aged white man) forget about how terrible my life has become since letting my cat outside. I leave food out every day but I haven't seen it for like 8 months now I know it's still around because I can smell its spray on my uniform when I leave it on the line. I think its gone back to my exs because thats not too far away. If that what's it costs to keep an eye on her and her new bf ""Chad"" (thinks he's a big man telling me to leave when Im out the front its public domain CHAD I can stand where I want).

2017-09-01,0,0,221,True,Recommended,Fantastic game so far!Needs some optimizing but thats obvious the movement system needs updating the ability to vault or climb small fences or objects would be a top notch addidtion to the game along side some smoothness in transitions that make the movement feel very clunky and juttered at times. Visualy its stunning which i imagine will only improve over time. I am fortunate enough however with my setup to be able to run most settings on high and some on ultra without any drop in frames bad enough to make the game feel unplayable or laggy. The combat is pretty comprehensive love the wide span of weapons available and and the customization which helps the overall scavanger feeling as the first most hours you play the game it feels as if youve never seen the thigns your finding over and over again. Eventually you do get to know the weapons and items in the game but you still never know what your set up will be in the game as each play through changes your play style. 9/10 Will be 10/10 when movement issues are resolved.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

De sync makes the game unplayable. You need to give players time to react to getting shot at. Overpriced.This game needs to be fixed.

2018-06-17,0,0,203,False,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a great tactical battle royale. It is esay to learn but hard to master and the mechanics feel smooth and relibale. First off the shooting in the game feels conistent and rewarding and also takes alot of skill to get perfect so good player can outplay their enemies and new players can get a chance to kill someone.Next off the movement everything from running to jumping feels smooth and consistent and with the addition of vaulting you can get to unperdictable locations to surprise your enemies which further widens the skill game so talented players can thrive. Next off the maps. They are very different to one another and give a new playstyle in each. They both look beautiful and are fun to play on however sometimes you can go a full game without seeing someone due to the large map but this is not going to be a problem when the new map releases which is much smaller in size to the 2 we have now.Attachments. They are very fun to use as you can pick and choose your playstyle to what you want in each and every scenario. You could have a holographic sight for close up encounters and a 6x for the long range battles. Also if you are having trouble with the recoil of certain weapons you can put a grip on the majority of weapons to calm down the spray.Finally the vehicles for the majority of the time they work like a charm and work perfectly but a few bugs can occur while using them for example the 3 wheeler motorbike will sometimes flip randomly often resulting in death. But the rest of the vehicles are fun and easy to use and they work how they are intended to.Now for the cons I feel like the pros outweigh the cons but before buying PUBG you might want to consider some of these things. First the game dosen't have the greatest optimisation and older graphics cards may have a problem running the game at high framerates. Second in my opinion parachuting feels quiete clunky and you will sometimes get stuck on a building or just be left to hover and not be able to cut away the parachute. Overall I think Playerunknow's Battlegrounds is a fantastic battle royale game and definatley worth a buy because there is nothing better than some juicy chicken dinner!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game itself is wonderful the mechanics are becoming more fluid each and everyday. However with each huge wave of bans more and more hackers pop up into the fray. The games however where you aren't instantly headshot and survive it out win or lose are wonderful. The anticipation as you trudge through the map trying to beat the blue circle of death. But the feeling of winning is so strong that I would still recommend this game even with getting frustrated from versing hackers after hackers.

I especially like their maps the adaptable weather in the map their various events from time to time graphics and lots more! This game is realistic and unrealistic at the same time which is great in my opinion. Although there a few bugs or some error here and there in game that can surely be fixed and I respect their devs and support team ensuring always updating and trying as hard as they can to make this game a 100% in spite of all the negative comments they get.

2017-11-13,0,0,5,True,Recommended,After about 4 hours worth of play time I can draw a few conclusions keeping in mind the development team is considerably small and that the game is in early access.First of all I'll say that this game is responsible for the coming wave of battle royale games and that PUBG's developers should not have the ability to claim rights to this genre. And yes I'll say it I actually prefer Fortnite Battle Royale over this game Visually the game looks fine but I turned down the visuals in preference of performance. I did experience frame rate drops on many occasions even with the visuals lowered especially when the map was foggy similar to the problems experienced in Fallout 4's Far Harbor expansion. Since I am particular with how my games sound I will say that this game does silence perfectly. Since the premise of the game involves mostly hiding for long periods of time every noise adds tension and suspense to a life. Map construction is done well aside from the fact that there's only one map. Loot is evenly and realistically dispersed across a sizeable map that feels alive and dangerous. However even after a few hours I got bored of seeing the same environment and the same map again and again and chances are I won't return to the game until additional maps are added as I know the developers are planning to do. The only other thing I can complain about is the controls and there isn't even much to say. They weren't easy to catch on to with no tutorial but after a few rounds of experimentation I was able to figure them out. To sum it up there are some shortfalls but nothing that shouldn't be expected in the game's current state and I look forward to added content. As it comes out I'll edit this review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-18,0,0,1008,False,Recommended,Lately I think they are doing a great job improving the game performance over time as well as taking action against cheaters. My system specs are not great and I have noticed very positive changes i7 4th gen + GTX970. After getting more experience on the game it is now easier to know why you got killed and identifying the difference between performance issues skill and luck. My advise for players is to stop blame shifting it is easier to rant and displace blame to performance issues when they die than to try to learn. Just relax and enjoy and focus to be better. Fortunately Sanhok came to refresh the game experience and Im really looking forward to the new snow map at EOY. To make the other maps more playeable and avoid boredom I would like to see a loot rate increase. This avoids a monotonous game.Finally there is a ton of things that the game can improve but we got the negative comments to focus on them. I would like to see more accountability from the devs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-17,0,0,206,True,Not Recommended,Right now there is too much up to chance/RNG. Even if you're the best PUBG player in existence you can get screwed with a terrible spawn and have no weapon. I want to see a shift towards player skill rather than luck.Edit I still stand by my words this game is not for me I ing hate it as a matter of fact. So much time is wasted in this game rather than enjoyed. I waste time spawning getting a gun and then getting mowed down.Or the performance.One of my biggest regrets as far as purchases go.Another complaint the games playmode/style actively encourages camping of all forms. Spawn&gt move to circle&gt wait to kill players entering circle&gt repeat. I constantly die to camping and cant do anything about it because it gives them all the advantage.God i ing hate this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,482,True,Recommended,Best EA game I have played. (2nd most popular game on Steam on 4 months of EA can say that)It is kinda addictive. I tought it was just a hype wave but I'm having some good laughter playing either with friends or solo.Micro transactions did not bother me there are still free crate drops. AND even the payed ones are purely cosmetic. I do not know why people hate the system(and negatively review the game) even if it does not affect them.BTW Game is at its best state right now Lag is gone fixed.

I have decided to do it in just a pros and cons list as I cannot be bothered to go into great detail about why this game is so great!PROSSimple Premise but still endlessly hard to masterGreat continuous updates from developers Great support from developersGreat listening to community feedback from develepors Great gameplayScope mechanics are goodNot so many bugs for an early access gameGreat to play with friendsGreat to play soloFirst person mode is great to cater towards the people who don't like third person or are tired of campersOverall great game!CONSNot so great for people with lower end PC'sYou can look around too much in third person (I feel making the viewmodel more like H1Z1 would helpCaters highly to noobs with its ""Its about winning not getting kils"" saying by PlayerUnkown. I feel it would you should be rewarded for kills and wins around 50/50 as it is not hard to get a good placement though if you don't really have any kills you aren't good or haven't played a good game.No rank systemNo XP systemKind of expensive for an early access game which put me off at first and was the reason I didn't buy it the day it launched.That is all I have to say its overall a great game and I am sure I will keep playing it long into the future!

Then when other games like Fortnite came out I kept to Battlegrounds putting faith into them making it less clunky and more like a fun hacker free game. This never happened. Therefore I soon switched over to Fortnite and had a lot more fun. This game had lots of potential when it was first released but now other competitors have caught up with it and taken away that potential instead having it for themselves and the game is now a hacker heaven and a bad experience to say it is fully released now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've stuck with the game since first month Early Access and have never turned back. It is the most fun I have had on a MP game by far. I have tried Fortnite. No thank you was not for me. This new Sanhok map and Event Pass are a great addon! You people that complain about a $10 event pass for a $30 or less game need to get over it. That puts me $40 into a game ive stated before spent 750+ hours on. That is pretty worth it. Again 100% recommend especiially if you got friends to play with. Just try it!

2017-09-01,0,0,185,True,Recommended,This game has a massive potential and can be quite addicting annoying make you want to rage quit and question the integrity of the human race. Its not as bad as Rust everyone starts out with nothing but it can be close.I have a slower internet connection than most (yay rural america) with a decent computer I havent determined which of the two is responsible for the slow load times but I suspect the internet connection might have a lot to do with it.Many times I parachute onto a roof or near a building and it wont load for close to 30 seconds i cannot enter a building for safety or pickup a weapon if im on the roof (does this weird hopping thing).The third person perspective could take what SCUM is doing and make it so only you see what your character sees this would drastically reduce camping and ambushes. Although for the time being they have a test function of the First Person Perspective or FPP game mode in the launcher.The prospect of new maps incoming (currently one large map) is a good thing and should hopefully eliminate the repetitive feel the game gets from time to time.Personally I feel the matches and 'zones' could stand to last a few more minutes but for those that have been playing the game for what seems forever their knowledge of best loot spots means you almost always find the same people in the top 10 at the end of each match.Don't let your immediate view fool you foliage is invisible after a set distance on low settings so I end up playing the game on almost all low settings with only textures and view distance set to max The rest end up being a handicap. So try to actually use hard cover instead of concealment.Overall I rather enjoy the game with certain modes being better or worse than others. I for one find Squad play the most enjoyable with DUO having what seems the highest play count you encounter players that know the exploits of the game it seems that many of the gun sights are not true to aim and end up either higher or lower (more often way higher) than their actual point of aim. That being said I read somewhere that the game actually makes the 'bullet' come from the eyes of your avatar when in third person this means you encounter MANY players that you will never see because only their eyes are visible with the gun behind cover. But It could just be desync due to my not so great internet.TL DR. Game is in alpha much will improve currently its hate/love and it seems it will improve.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-29,0,0,997,True,Recommended,Honestly it's a fun game but it does have alot of faults to it aswell I would recommend buying it but I'd say wait for the game to officially come out before you do there are de sync issues that usually occur around the beginning of every match and some of the up close gameplay is a bit glitchy but other than that is a wonderfully fun game to play either with friends or by yourself. The game has alot of playability because usually every match you play is different most of the time you'll never have the same loadout or you'll have a different better position with the circle all these variables is what make people want to keep playing the game so buy it if you'd like to try it out you can always refund it if you have less than 2 hours so go for it enjoy the game as I have.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Can't say that my review caused the patch but it is odd that it has been fixed just days after the review now the game is a blast. I can upvote this easily... still need to fix the asian POP on NA servers though.EDIT 2/20/2018So many hacks and hackers in this game.... 1 million accounts have been banned in just January. If you plan to buy wait until they actually take care of hackers before you purchase or you will waste time getting to top 10 to get wallhacked or teleported on or a grenade will spawn at your feet... in a bunker.. while guarding the ONLY entrance. Ohh yeah i have to play one match and not load in to be able to play now as well... ehhEDIT... AGAIN! 2/22/2018After a ""minor update"" the game is so sluggish and laggy it's not really playable but hey at least the aim bot users cant hit us with the mega glitchy running in circle fights XDEDIT....... Again!

So full of hackers it't not even funny anymore and all they do is release crates then try to pull the CS GO season pass thing... yeah we want to pay to play with hackers in nearly every match. We had maybe 2 good matches with fair skilled players got to top 5 and then got 1 shotted through lvl 3 helmet and armor from a UMP?

My only problem is that the game has multiple incompletions it needs to be finished already. Its come to a point where my game is crashing atleast once a day for untold amounts of time. When you charge full price I expect im able to play the game when I want. Talks of new maps and game modes sounds awesome but when the base game isnt even finished it makes me fear they are gonna pull another H1Z1. Now that they raked in all this money they are being lazy and slow with the patches. yeh they do updates often but there are some things that just need to be fixed months ago. The parachuting is ""cutting away""... more like im stuck lets cut away and lose 40 to 50 percent heath right away. Feels slow like the response time is a second off.

2017-10-25,0,0,172,True,Recommended,Even though the concept of the game is not unique anymore (H1Z1 Fortnite and mods for various other games) it is still good and attracting for many players. Yes this game got major of its playerbase thanks to twitch streamers and yes it is very flawed. Although many bugs aside there is this one single flaw that ruins everything sometimes. The rendering of far away objects. This type of game needs to be run on an engine that can render stuff from far away better.For example when you aim down the sights the trees bushes rocks etc load in the process confusing the sh*t out of you. There are those nasty bushes that you think are players until you zoom in.Besides that a really great early access game that needs a bit more polishing and hopefully transfer to a better engine.

2017-08-20,0,0,312,False,Not Recommended,I'll ignore the crap show that was early access and focus on what's been released since.1.0 released a new map with some insane rubber banding in the early game lots of initial patches to fix things and a huge amount of long time bugs from early access that still weren't fixed. Recent patches fixed the rubber banding but broke hit registration and made desync even worse. On one hand the game play was much smoother visually on the other the core mechanics were still put to shame by plenty of games from the late 90s.If you want a shooter with a lot of tension and occasional wanky physics that you can have fun with your buds with give it a shot when it goes on sale.If you want a shooter with solid mechanics like hit registration latency correction and net code that doesn't make dial up look like future technology then give this game a very very wide berth. The new company seems to have inherited all the bad habits of the Bluehole devs in making something look visually acceptable while hiding all the rotten code underneath.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-21,0,0,601,True,Recommended,This game is great its fun and different everytime you play it because of the RNG involved. I don't think this can be on a top tier level when it comes to a compeitive game because of the same RNG involved and its not so much based on pure skill but that to me is not a negative at all. I believe there is still plenty of room for big tournaments that would be both very entertaining as well as very fun to play because of the randomness of the gameplay. As for the all complaints of late regarding the banning of stream snipers. I for one think that is good for the community if you are caught leaving games repeatly only to stop when you are in the same game as a streamer to harass them you should be banned. I say good job on the devs on that part of it and I do not see that as cartering to streamers either. The other recent complaint that is coming up is about the micro transactions. They are cosmetic only and have no impact of gameplay at all. And I say that being aware that some people actually believe the purchased clothing give better camo that too is false. There is no advantage given with the in game purchases.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The lag is intense so when you actually try to line up a shot for a kill you fire your gun and notice the enemy has ""hopped"" away from it and is suddenly gone.When you die you don't get to see what happened to you. there needs to be a kill cam replay of when you died. This way you can scoff and rage about how it's t someone killed you with a revolver pistol from the otherside of the map.The open mic is incredibly annoying while sitting in the plane and should be muted for the duration while you fly before jumping out.Good game to watch streamers play and laugh at their misery but not a fun game to play unless you want to rage a lot.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-31,0,0,368,True,Recommended,Seriously I dont know why people hate this game so much.PubG is the game people has been asking for ever since DayZ bent us over and f***ed us up. This is a alternative to a zombie survival game where death awaits behind every corner. This game is hard it's competative and you're always have to be on your watch. When playing for the leaderboard you have to think smart. It's not only run here shoot there. You have to mentally prepare yourself for where the enemy might show up where is the most common places people peak from which areas has the most players atm judgding from different aspects. Like the game as a whole gives so freaking much considering its a early access 30$ game. To play this with a friend or three is great fun. You work togheter use different tactics to win the game. Play safe play aggresive. It's all great fun.Alot of people have been complaining it's a bad optimized game. It's not bad but it's not good either. It's somewhere in the middle. And when people talk about bugs overwhelming the game I've played 180 hours ish I've encountered 2 notable bugs during my gameplay. Once the buildings didnt load in and another time I fell under the ground. Thats it TWO INSTANCES IN 180 HOURS. People need to know how to relax.As for cheaters. Yes they infest servers more in other regions I assume. I play in Europe mostly in First Person. I've NEVER encountered (what I know of) a cheater while playing here. But in NA it happend twice and probably because I played third person not first. I think somehow the first person mode deactivates the cheaters capability of cheating (Proof needed).And to all the players whining about the devs banning streamsnipers and such. Trust me people 9/10 times the bans are LEGIT. PUBG would be another unfamous game without any funds to improve it if it weren't for these guys. People have to understand their position. I've seen tons of streamers trying to play the game but people mass around them like rats honking and playing stupid irritating music and killing them. The ball is really at PUBG's field now. They got more than enough funds to improve this game. The risk that they say f**k chill in the Bahamas with drinks is big. But even if they do this game gave hours and hours of entertainment for only 30$. So people need to chill with the negatives reviews. All in all its a good game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-21,0,0,40,False,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is one of the few Early Access games that made through the beta phase quickly enough to be released as a full fledged game. Prior to the PUBG 1.0 version I would have NOT recommended this game at all due to its critical game breaking bugs optimization issues lags and horrible netcode. After 1.0 this game feels much smoother even on my potato desktop PC. On medium settings I can easily reach 50 to 60 fps along with better hit registration. Finally the most important update comes with the introduction of Killcam. This allows players to witness the moments before his attacker killed him and determine if it was legit or cheating. TL DR PUBG 1.0 finally feels like a game made by professional developers and not as a mod made by ameteurs.My Specs Intel Core i5 7500Gigabyte B250M HD3AMD Radeon R7 265Corsair Vengence DD4 8GB 2400Hz,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,213,True,Not Recommended,"Save your money for the deluge of ""Battle Royal"" spin offs to come (Imagine a MGS V BR mode). You've no doubtly heard of the developers introducing paid crates after explicitly saying they wouldn't. This is just the small tip of the iceberg of a company run by a 20 year old youth this and other examples such as multiple broken promises on ""definate release dates"" and weird development tangents such as a co op zombie mode all point to a couple of kids who have no idea what they are doing. There actions show that they are now priotizing monitization on a game that's not even halfway developed over production of the game itself and trust to its customers. By the time this game is finsihed (if its finished) we'll have quality adaptaions by AAA companies companies who don't lie to their customers. Let BlueHole know that failing to keep your promises to your customers if one of the first ways to fail as a buissness. There is almost no chance that these kids will use the money gained in EA in an efficent productive and honest way if BlueHole doesn't go bankrupt from poor finincial and developmental decisions within a couple years I'll be in disbelief.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-22,0,0,521,True,Recommended,"Awesome game to play with friends but shame on the developers for catering to the popular streamers. While I don't personally agree with ""stream sniping"" (actually it disgusts me) it is something that is going to happen when you put yourself out there like that. Celebrities don't like the paperazzi but you have to expect it. Getting people banned because they annoyed you or ""harrassed"" you is just being a whiney . You want to play a round where that doesn't happen? Then don't stream. That's just the world we live in. My other complaint is in line with everyone else. Paying money for anything other than the game itself is a turn off. Being able to buy camo isn't just cosmetic it's a clear advantage. I still recommend this game but devs please don't ruin this with greed.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I wanted to love this game because I wanted to play a first person BR with realistic graphics but every game i resisted the urge to uninstall right then and there. I decided to uninstall when I was top 5 and pushing to the circle when i saw a head pop up above a window sill in front of me. I stopped for 2 seconds to aim and shoot and i got sniped in the back of the head from someone who was camping in a building behind me. I dont know if it was always like this or if the meta for wins is just to camp but regardless it just wasnt fun for me. Also the gameplay is so slow and feels unresponsive it feels like it takes 3 seconds for a door to open after i hit F.

2017-06-12,0,0,119,True,Not Recommended,First off I m going to start this by saying that I absolutely love this game. It s fun and different in a world drowning in first person shooters. But my god is it frustrating. It s poorly optimized to the point that I have seen even monster machines fail to run it optimaly. I ve had more crashed on this game than I have any other game I have ever played. But the fun I had playing this game far outweighs any of this. I can t say this about any other game I have ever played. The developer releases regular updates to the game. Brendan Greene seems very commited to making a fun game and I hope he continues work on optimizing this game. So this is a genre of video game Greene is credited of making popular single handedly. The battle royale style gameplay pits you off against 100 other people playing online at the same time. Honestly this game depends more on knowing the map and spawn locations and a lot of luck. Sometimes you die at the very beginning of the match and there isn t a thing you can do. But when you win a match or even get into the lower tiers nothing gets your adrenaline pumping faster in the world of video gaming. While winning a match is rare nothing beats the feeling of accomplishment you feel in yourself having that win on your stats listing and then having it taken away as soon as they update the game. Now as I have said before this game is poorly optimized. Sometimes when you play the game you will find that all of the houses are anthropomorphic blobs that you cannot get inside. This can be especially frustrating as it makes it impossible to get a gun and defend yourself because all of the guns are inside houses. Besides shacks which arent garunteed to drop any weapons. Also while playing solo I ve noticed a prevalence for people knowing where you are regardless of them not having a way of knowing you are there. I ve done some research and apparently they allow you to alter shaders in the game. Some which can even get rid of grass. So playing fairly can give you an unfair advantage playing this game. But in summary I won t be giving this game a positive review but if they continue to work on performance I will be changing my review. I mainly came to this decision based on the fact that if you don t have a godlike pc you have no hope to run this that way it should be based on its requirments. Being that most people won t have a monster of a pc and can t recommend this game.The recent E3 expo has me hopeful on the future of this game. And I hope it continues to get better because I love this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,105,True,Not Recommended,The developers of this game plan to introduce a SCGO style of micro transaction making you acquire crates and pay for keys. It's a terrible system IMO. PUBG has recently shown what crates can contain and some of the items are more than cosmetic and will give you an advantage early on against other players. A good example would be the ability to acquire a faceplate protecting you against headshots.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-08,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,"I just can't recommend the game in its current state.To me PUBG is ""just okay "" which in my opinion just isn't good enough. With frequent server latency and hit registration problems it's a common occurrence to have well aimed shots utterly miss their mark. Combined with high player movement speeds poor recoil handling and scopes that seem a bit off you have a recipe for frustrating gunplay. Since that's all the content there is in this game there isn't much else worth noting.While the prospect of winning a 100 man battle royale seems appealing the novelty of bragging rights and point rewards for gambling wears off quickly when you've opened your 3rd reward box (out of 5) containing fingerless gloves or been the victim of yet another crash. After which the crash reporter crashes.If you take away the fun to be had simply by playing a competitive multiplayer game with friends you're left with a generic repetitive game with little incentive to continue playing after a few dozen hours. Perhaps the game will get better but by then my friends will have long since abandoned it moving on to bigger and better games. And I for one will be too.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,"I like a lot about the game. There is one very big issue that keeps bothering me. I like multiplayer games for many reasons one being customization of your playeable character. You see that trend in most games now (COD Overwatch etc). The issue i have is that it takes a loooooong time to earn BP (point system used here) to earn enough to buy a ""crate"" to unlock a customizeable item (like a shirt or mask). I've put in a few hours in this game and have done fairly well (between top 5 and 20 still alive in most matches) and i've only had enough for 2 crates. One crate i got a white tank top (yes....plain white) and the second was a black tank top /If that wasnt bad enough each time you buy a crate the next crate doubles in price. I just purchased a crate for 700 points and now the next one is 1400. So let's recap....it takes a long time to get points the content of the crate is mediocre (spelling is probably not right) and it gets more expensive every time. WT Eff??It would be great if the items you find during the game could come back with you (at least one item) or if the points system was revamped. Honestly it's nothing more than the developers being stingy. I can't imagine that the developers havent realized that it is standard in every game for there to be a high level of customization (it helps with replay value).Anyways thanks for making it this far into my review.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I live in Australia My net connection isn't terrible (100Mbps down 40Mbps Up) but nearly every game seems to rubberband at the start If you can survive a minute or two after the drop it smooths out alittle but sometimes the doors won't open ( They do open just visually they stay closed ) and getting in a vehicle is more often then not a good way to get shot. Whether you will manage to get the drivers seat is entirely luck based and if your mad bashing of the F button lags you could get in only to get back out seconds after getting in.Next is another issue that seems to be on the rise CHEATERS. I could be in a great hiding spot (Second story building in a bathroom) Next second a gunshot takes out a window Then a grenade blows the door apart Then another grenade lands in front of me from outside the house. There is no way he could know I was there I wasn't moving and I have been camping this house a good 4 minutes before this so its unlikely he saw me enter.

2017-04-19,0,0,127,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Good game Idea bad executuion.Would of liked to see more realism. Takes too many bullets to kill people in the currrent build. The game takes WAY too much luck to win and that's why I don't like it. It's not fair. Not a very competitive game at all. It's fun at first but long term the game is very stale. I really only enjoy games when I win and since there is literally only a 1% chance of winning each game you don't win a lot. So for those reasons I don't think the game is fun. Not everyone has an equal chance of winning each game. Some times you get lucky loot and sometimes you don't. It's just how it is. The game is very unforgiving.Don't get me wrong it's a decent game but not worth $30 in my opinion. Even though I did get the game for free from a friend. Probbaly the reason why I played it so much. It is very fun with friends for a short time. If you play more than a few hours I think the game annoys your entire group. I can honestly say that this game has made me rage more than any other game in the last few years. It's frustrating to lose when you spent so much time in a single match just to come in 2nd place. There is no rewards for 2nd place. Wins are only awarded to 1st place. I wish they would keep track of your ""almost wins"" in duo and sqaud. It does keep track of your top 10s in solo though but overall I wish it would count my top 10s for duo and squad and top 25s for solo. Plus the leaderboards should have an ""Average Placment"" for each game mode to allow you to see where you rank up to others. Comparing 1st place wins with other players is almost pointless because I firmly believe 1st place wins are awarded with luck over skill. The game does take skill to get kills but It has WAY to much luck involved. I won't be playing this game again until they come out with a realism mode or a hardcore mode. I can't count the times where I shot a guy 5+ times and didnt get a kill. It's rediculous.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-03,1,1,184,False,Not Recommended,"It's actually sad to me how such a gem of a game had so much potential but was ruined by it's developpers. The principe was very good some of the mechanics are on point and yet it can be fun to play. Yes it CAN be. Unfortunately this game gives very bad performances with pretty much any rig. By poor I mean important fps drops studdering etc... This is without talking about hackers server lag very annoying bugs wether it is with the ""ADS"" mechanic driving or even hit registration at some times. As you would have guessed the game is very poorly optimised and it is a pain for me (who has a decent rig) to be constantly anoyed by frame drops even playing at low settings. So to get around 80 fps (which looks horrible on my monitor...) I have to put the graphics down to a point where I simply can't see anything because of how bad the environnement and player models look. Also some people like the ""survival"" aspect of this game which is based on RNG and makes you not find half decent loot 1/4 of the time. This also annoys me because people that want to play squads always choose people based on their stats (ADR K/D) and such. And with that said ""survival aspect"" most of the time I die without finding a weapon which affects your stats then people don't want to play with you because they think you suck. Some will say ""Then do safe drops"" (dropping away from the populated areas) and to that I will answer I'm sorry but looting alone for 20 minutes or getting cucked by the circle right away so you have to leave without having anything is no fun to me. Other than the game not running fluidly you must wait from 2 to 5 minutes before joining a new game (where my frustration of dying without having found a gun and or had a chance to defend myself is from.) Other than that since a little while the communication with the devs has died almost completely... The devs also don't necessarely listen to their players. With that being said we almost never get informations on patches updates and stuff like that. So at the end unless you have a very good PC and patience...

Start of the game is pretty pointless to fight because its just luck who wins as telporting and shots not landing or getting shot behind cover.. I'd just hold off see if they fix anything. Could deal with the lag and stuff but cheating just kills it.

Hackers ? well ppl say they met some but personally I never seen one. Performace? they are improving it not perfect but playable mind you i have gtx 1070 i get 80 60 fps drops below 60 to the 40s when its raining but still playable. with bugs here and there nothing major There is solo duo and team (4 players) Q so you won't run into people ganking up when you are playing solo which is a big plus for a BR game. Almost forgot you can find attachments as loot that you can use on your weapons too which is cool.However (this is for players that are new for the Battle Royle genre ) you get 1 relativly big map 1 game mode and very limited number of viable weapons that you will use 90% of the time (SCAR L AK M16) also loot gets a bit boring after a while.Is it worth 30$ atm depends if this is your first BR i would wait till they improve performance and add more stuffIf you're a vetran BR player well you've probably already bought this game in this case idk why you read reviews for a game you already own!so here is my verdict (tl'dr)You short on money ? you have an old pc? wait for sale or till they improve performance this game won't go anywhere anytime soon. additionally there is the risk with EA games devs tend to cash out and sell their IP to another dev team that would fk it up You have money laying around ?you like BR games? have a decent pc? buy it.I will give it a thumb down for the time being BECUASE most ppl are from the former group.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game has so many hate just because some stupid idiots DIDNT READ THE MINIMAL AND RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS and then were angry that their game wasnt running well. A lot of people also gave this game a negative rating because of some glitches... oh well every game has glitches but these people these people that just experience one glitch immidiatley get angry and give the game a bad review. Lots of people are angry about the region locks i ask why well they are angry because now they need to play in their region? Wait whats so bad about that i wont get angry that i can only play EU... 2. IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THE MINIMAL AND RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS and the game runs smooth gratz. This game runs VERY SMOOTH if you have a decent pc lots of people can confirm that... in my opinion the worst thing about this game are the developers they kinda on their game for example sometimes when servers are busy and all of this your name becomes #unknown you have trouble inviting friends into lobbies etc.3. There is nothing wrong about the game its self really well thought of good selections of weapons very good fighting environment. Lots of people dont like Miramar (desert map) i personally dont like it either but i sometimes play it to break the Erangel (original/first map) streak from what i have seen of the new 4x4 map it looks great. Maybe the developers finally decided to listen to the players thats great!4.

2017-08-04,0,0,234,True,Recommended,first there was mod in arma2. but it wasnt as popular as arma3 battle royale mod (probably because everyone was hyped about then new dayz mod for arma2). inspired by infamous movie of the same name and probably with elements from hunger games this one was a huge hit. then there was h1z1 kotk based on the playerunknown's mod. and finally he himself decided to release a full game playerunknown's battlegrounds based and build speciffically for battle royale type of gameplay.and is it a success... it just took over 2nd place on steam stats from csgo. i never thought some game will come out (and in early access) and took player count from csgo. in my opinion marketable crates helped this too. people are suckers for those )now about the gameplay itself. if you ever played any of the mentioned above games like arma br or h1z1 br you know what its all about. 100 players jump from plane to an island and fight for survival. last one standing is the winner as simple as that (or last 2 or last 4 depending if you play solo duo or squad matches). process is you parachute down without anything. you loot buildings for equipment (clothes armor vest helmet backpack) rifles (and its attachments scopes etc) ammo and boosts. starting game is over whole island then every few minutes electric field in form of circle is shrinking around the island. so playing zone is getting smaller and smaller with each circle and since every player is going slowly towards the same spot on the island more killings and fewer players are left with every circle and as said before last one standing is the winner. if you stay behind in the electric field (or gas as someone still call it) you recieve damage with every next circle that starts shrinking is dealing more and more damage. if you are too distanced from circles there are random spawned vehicles available too for transporting faster towards the goal. you also get occasional airplane drops in form of crates which can consist of weapons not available for loot in game otherwise.and thats all there is about gameplay its pretty simple yet very fun and very appealing way of deathmatch. the game is still under heavy development process in the time of writing this review its in beta and the game is getting better and better and getting more and more players with time. comparing the game to closed alpha phase it has improved a LOT. and this is why i believe we will have very playable optimized nice looking game closing the full release. developers proved that they can optimize the game and make it very enjoyable. this type of game was never about eyecandy effect but despite that this game looks very beautiful with all settings turned to max (although its not playable yet that way on most pcs even high end ones due to only 1 or 2 big optimization updates have been released).gameplay mechanics are just right for battle royale game. its not too arcady and unrealistic as h1z1 is and its also not too harsh on realism movement as arma is. its just in the right spot leaning a bit more towards realism. more mechanics are yet to be implemented so i guess it will only become better. 1st person only aka hc servers are also introduced. on full release game will also be open for modding so there will not only be battle royale game mode but probably many other survival and deathmatch modes.the game is obviously huge success and people are interested in this type of gameplay. so for any fan of not only this type of gameplay but any multiplayer pvp type of game i must recommend this game as 10/10 (with promissed few fixes about performance and server lag in mind).p.s. modding will boost this game even more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-08,0,0,49,False,Recommended,TL DR PUBG is a great game with its core gameplay/graphics/everything but its gonna take a fall towards CSGO and Fortnitealrighty so this game is super fun alright its the first large scale battle royale AND NO FORTNITE DIDNT COME FIRST but anyways back on topic.this game is suuuper fun and is the only battle royale that can actually pull off vehicles (ahem epic games)its realism in shooting mechanics and its damage system are both really goodits physics system needs some tweaks but its not used a lot since pretty much everything is static. the cpu/gpu load is high enough already and implementing physics interactions would not help much.this game is not really optimized extremely well but it runs allright on a budget rig like mine gtx 1050 max q i5 7300HQbut recently bluehole is taking this game in fortnite's direction and i urge them to change that. the battle pass (yeah it has a different name but pubg has f**king DLC now so that sucks anyways) the other gamemodes (really other gamemodes are not needed and are just overcomplicating the game) and why did they even have to add emotes?pubg is taking a step in the direction of fortnite and csgo adding more and more microtransactions of flashy pointless items to the point that its going to literally become fortnite,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-04,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I went into this game expecting an intense battle experience where survival was based on wits reaction speed and composure under pressure. I expected it to be super serious and I expected to not at all enjoy it because those sorts of experiences are often a little too much for me to really enjoy easily.I was surprised however that the game wound up being one of the most boring experiences I had ever had. It was as if someone had taken all of the joke gameplay loop concepts from Battlefield (Run for 10 minutes doing nothing then get sniped as soon as you get somewhere for those who haven't played) and made a full game out of it. What I mean by this is that the game forces players to move into a further smaller play area and gives them a huge open block to run around in. It makes sense of course how else do you force the rounds to be short and push players into combat? Now see I would have just suggested small maps but I guess they wanted the whole grand scale setup. The map designs suffer from similar issues as heroes and generals where it is way too open for the amount of space you'll need to traverse. The design of the ever closing battlefield exagurates this fault and makes it a case where you have to be continuously wandering if you didn't drop into the right place.RNG basically determines your successes of all of my matches thus far i have not gotten a single kill. I would blame the gunplay but I honestly haven't even had any opportunities to shoot back at people. I always wind up with short range weapons and get sniped by someone miles away that I cannot see. Hence the second part of the battlefield loop.I imagine if you drop into a hot zone the gameplay might get a bit more intense but the clunky movement system combined with the clunky looting system makes it particularly hard to enjoy that either. And even if you somehow come out on top after you clear a huge battle area of enemies you still then have to deal with the gameplay loop I mentioned earlier so that doesn't really solve the problem.I went into this game with pretty low expectations and I managed to somehow find an even poorer experience than that. Maybe I'm just bad or maybe I just don't get this game very much. But I don't really understand how to play DOTA 2 either but can still have fun playing that with friends. This game was just... Dull. Not frusterating or annoying I didn't expect to be good right out the bat or anything it was just boring.Maybe things will get better once it leaves early access but I wouldn't hold my breath.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-27,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,I have played this game for about 8 hours now and i can say it feels a lot like day z. The gunplay is terrible your guy has the recoil control of a toddler. the projectiles seem inconsistent and hard to judge if you are going to hit anything or not even at closer ranges. There is no explanation to the game you just get thrown in and have to know what the UI is trying to tell you my first game i made it to the top 20 but died to the electrical wall as it was closing in. (no i didnt know how to play becuase i dont watch streamers) there is no real way to familiarize yourself with the guns in the game without getting into a live match and its not a good idea to do so there unless you want to get focused down immediatly because shooting gives away your position very very easily... the game is a crap shoot did you get to a place first? if so camp and kill anyone that you can easily hear coming... did you not get someplace first? in that case walk into a building to be immediatly shot by a person who can hear you coming a mile away. or get hit by a shot in an open field with about 25 bushes that are roughly player size and at a distance player shaped and try to find who is shooting you... good luck with that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-14,0,0,271,True,Not Recommended,This game has the potential to be fun but too frequently the play area is enormous while the players remaining is few. If the play area responded to the amount of players remaining to keep the flow of the game play then the game would be much better. As it is now you will often have periods of time during a match where you don't see another player for 10 minutes at a time only to suddenly be killed by another player from an unknown location. Another major issue with the game is shooting around objects. Sometimes you will be on a staircase and a very thin railing will block 100% of your bullets while you still receive 100% of incoming bullets. At times it can be impossible to shoot out of windows or down from higher ledges with all of your bullets hitting whatever is near by. Meanwhile you are easily taken out by your target. I've had an experience where I was shooting over a barrel and 100% of my cross hair is over the barrel yet 100% of the shots went into the barrel. I know this to be true because I record my game play and review the footage to improve but in these situations the only improvement is to try and stay away from the game world. There is an in game indicator that sometimes appears to tell you that your shot will be blocked by an object but this is inconsistent and infrequent. These poor shooting mechanics are part of the madness that prevents this game from being great.When the formula works it is a lot of fun but you spend most of your time just chasing the dragon and opening doors.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,1193,False,Recommended,Despite the immature and whiny community PUBG is a really great game in so many ways which is why so many people are playing it. Paradoxically it is also the reason that so many people are whining about it and giving it bad reviews. People DO enjoy the game that's why they play it soo much so many hours each day. And because they play it so much they forget about what has already been fixed and improved. The game ofc has had it's fair share of bugs but to be fair many of them has been fixed and we've recieved not just one new map but two for free (!). Fortnite which ofc is PUBG's only real current contester has been out for just about as long as PUBG but still only has one single map. One map. In PUBG you have three and you have fourth map coming this winter! ... Sure the netcode isn't the greatest but they also recently improved that as well bumping the tickrate to 60hz. PUBG is a game very much in ongoing development but it also is a fantastic game. I haven't played a game this much ever in my life besides ofc. Counter Strike. (And yes I also rage in game when I get stuck and other bugs happen but the pleasurable and fun moments far outweigh the bad ones) I would absolutely recommend PUBG !,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-28,6,22,348,False,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is the first standalone game of the creator of the battle royale genre PLAYERUNKNOWN.Battle royale is a extreme survival gamemode that drops players into a wide open area together with around 100 other players. It is all about to kill or to be killed with only one chance to win. The area shrinks over time and players are forced to fight each other if they dont want to die by the environment. At the end there can be only one last man standing.The concept of the game is inspired by the book/movie ""Battle Royale"". Playerunknown first created a mod for Arma 2 later followed by a mod for Arma 3. Also he helped to implement the battle royale mode into H1Z1.In BATTLEGROUNDS you fight on an island to be the last man standing. At the beginning of the match you jump out of a airplane and it is up to you where you are going to land with your parachute.Besides of the solo mode you have also the ability to play in duo or squad mode.You can switch between third person and first person view. Third person lets you peek around corners over walls etc. I personally like the ability to have both views others do not like the third person view at all. Therefore you can choose to play either first person only or standard.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS has a great amount of different weapons and attachements. You can play currently on 3 different maps.BATTLEGROUNDS is using the steam inventory system for skins which you can unlock by opening crates some crates are free to open and for others you have to buy a key.The skins were some good addition for some people especially people who purchased the deluxe edition. Those skins (coat bandana boots pants and a shirt) had a few months ago a value of 1500+ Dollars all together.Unfortunately you can not trade skins anymore you can only sell or buy them on the Steam Market.The only negative aspect from my point of view in terms of the gameplay is that the servers even now so many months later are still laggy pretty often and the game still has performance issues even for those with good hardware.So if you have some hardware good enough for PUBG and would love to learn the thrill of fighting to be the last out of 100 you should definitely buy this game.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group http //steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section guideshttp //steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel https //www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also read the whole review and then comment or upvote or downvote dont white knight for these people they dont care. Also this is an opinion and I am going to put down facts about gameplay as it stands. &gt Pros&lt Fun for a few hours with friends at best gunplay seems alright but there are a lot of cons that make it infuriating. Its not DAYS Its not H1Z1&lt Cons&gt (Long List) Unoptimized. I know that a lot of people will say ""oh but its in early access"" and ""oh its new"" yeah I get all that but come on now this game is being sold for 30 dollars? Thats a little alarming dont you think? For how poorly this game runs on decent systems for what you get is ALARMING or should be to the average consumer. Also the game was in beta before the early access release they knew about the optimization issues before release dont kid yourself if you believe otherwise.My Specs i7 4790K at 4.3GHZ Gigabyte 970 16 GB Of Corsair Vengeance Ram 240 GB Samsung SSD 117mbps Download Speed 12Mbps Upload SpeedWith all this I have issues and most games dont give me issues except this game and ARK..... Lag.You will be lagging a lot lag in the lobby lag when you are parachuting from the sky lag when you are opening doors picking up guns and ammo and last but cetainly not least LAG WHEN YOU SHOOT or MELEE... Melee.Total wreck ive tried killing someone via melee ..... its usually ends with you dying which brings me to my next point. Hitboxes.Seriously is the hitbox actually on the persons body or is it somewhere that i cant seem to aim..... idk ive tried melee seems like i can never hit the other person. Shooting can be wonky as well clearly aiming at them shoot miss shoot miss ok aim not at them ........ success! Yeah thats not what i want when i shoot a gun at the other person shooting at me. Cars.Why are they always drifting why is it if im almost stopped i run myself or teamate over while jumping out? You can jump away from the car did anyone think of that? Controlling cars feels like driving a rally car through mud except sometimes im driving on the road in game and i should have perfect control but oh well. Parachuting.The intial part is fine free falling fast the last 300 feet is miserable fix this its horrible let me fall to my death so i can at least parachute to the ground quicky and die instead of being shot by the guy whos parachute deployed after mine even though we were both at the limit for it. All in all the game is FARRRRRR from done and this will probably be like another H1Z1 title or DAYZ except all you do is parachute in and die instead of survive and die. Or if you do make it without getting shot by aimbot cheaters or killed by exiting your own vehicle it turns into a camp fest whoever gets the center sets up shop near a hill and proceeds to pick the others who are outside of the cirlce off. 5/10 Not worth 30 Dollars to me at all.

My theory is that this ""Loot"" Fix update is a cover up for any optimization patches to come as they realise how their game is and nothing can be done to help it. As my experience with the game continues I slowly gain more frustrated on how t the game is and how ing people in those highlight videos are getting kills and having smooth when i know many people who can't have a decent game without all this half pile of moments on where you just want to hang yourself.

2017-07-12,1,3,136,True,Not Recommended,"Congratulations on the 278 000th ""Early Access"" game this year. Whether they like to admit it or not the game is clearly ridden with bugs and errors that were not fully buffed out before release. In all honesty the game is good in and of itself the idea is cool and fun I actually enjoy it on the very rare occasion that there isnt some sort of graphical error ruining my view bug keeping me from moving/looking/aiming or just general lag that happens LITERALLY anytime Im in combat. That last one really gets to me considering a shooter like this relies on your ability to react quickly and aim well. I could say this about so many other games but if more time was taken to more thoroughly buff out all the silly little glitches and errors rather than doing what literally every other game company in the world has done lately and just say ""Meh well we worked on it long enough lets just release it."" Ill likely keep playing it in the hopes that one day the game will be clean and finished but I can pretty much 100% guarantee thats not gonna happen and this will be yet another ""Early Access"" game where the devs will just take the money and run. But hey maybe this will be ""the one"" theres always hope I guess. I really hope it is its not inherently a bad game they shoulda just spent more time on it. I would 100% reccomend it should they ever fix it not a bad game. Just a broken one.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,0,0,84,False,Not Recommended,Update 5/18/2018 Cool new deathmatch mode but it makes you see bigger issues of the game. It appears there are many hackers reported even my own teammates for doing it. Still you can't find where you're being shot from. When shooting at players that are down it seems like you're unable to hit their head. It's just a poorly made game overall. All previous problems still exist.Problems with the game. It takes a while to actually start playing the game. Queues are fast but the game startup isn t. You get thrown in a lobby where you have to wait for the match to begin. Afterwards you go on an airplane and wait until you can jump down near the location you want to get to. Then you have to wait as you re falling to the ground while moving to the location you want to get to. You then have to use your parachute and once again wait until you reach the ground. Before you reach the ground the animation of you being in the parachute slows before you land which is even more time consuming awkward and annoying. With this you ve just wasted about 5 15 minutes and the game didn t even start yet.Don t forget you still have to search for weapons and items and before you could even do that chances are someone already got a gun near you and has killed you making you restart all over again in this annoying process. It all feels like just a waste of time. I hesitate playing the game a lot because of this wasted time knowing it has to be done in order to get into the action. I personally rather just be spawned randomly around the map so I can get right into the action. While the culling is a crappy game it at least did startup correctly. For having mediocre graphics this game takes a massive toll on your computer. There are many shooters that have far better graphics and run much smoother than this game. Terrible optimization hasn t improved much since release. Melee weapons are meaningless. That is usually the big problem with battle royales. Guns are supposed to be difficult to find melee weapons are supposed to be abundant. Otherwise melee weapons will continue to be useless aside from sneaking up to someone and knocking them out which currently doesn t work very well at all. Camping is highly in favor in this game. Making it pretty boring and not a very action orientated. Most of the time you re found hiding and waiting for someone to show up. There is very poor weapon balance throughout. Many weapons are overall better than other weapons. So you just throw out what you don t want and keep the best that you find. For example melee weapons and pistols are only good in the beginning of the game and after a few minutes become completely useless. In fact they can even be useless in the beginning of the game as well as soon as any other weapon is found.Makes you wonder what the purpose of all these weapons and attachments are for. Also because they re implemented in the game it just stresses your computer for absolutely no reason. A battle royale is about working with what you have but chances are very high that you will find an assault rifle soon enough. You start to realize that scavenging is only about finding attachments for your assault rifle or sniper rifle. You will have trouble knowing where you re being shot at from. It s mostly from not being able to determine the difference between what s in front of you and what s behind you. I m just speculating but I believe it s because shots behind you are not muffled as they re supposed to be from the way an ear is designed. In a game where you die very easily and camping is highly favored this is a huge issue. Maybe people with surround sound speakers and headsets don t have this issue but those who don t have surround sound will have problems which will wrack up unnecessary deaths. At the very least until it s fixed we should have some indicators of where we re being shot from. Game revolves around sound an awful lot. This makes the game unplayable for me due to having a noisy house. I also don t enjoy using a headset. Hiding in the blue is just an overall stupid concept. What should be a thing that pushes people to fight is being used to push people to go out in the open and be shot by others who are healing and sniping in the blue. Smart but unfair and terrible for gameplay. Game has also been proven to have hackers. Game developers have openly accepted modifications to shaders. Another words if you re going to play this competitive game get a mod that modifies your shaders or good luck finding people and being at a disadvantage. This is extremely unusual for a competitive game. If they said this prior to my purchase I would have quickly refunded. For a game that encourages camping players don t give off a breathing sound unless you re running. If we at least had a way of hearing someone inside of a house without actually seeing them first this could improve gameplay a whole lot. Unfortunately it s still whoever camps wins. The controls are complete trash. Right click and right click hold give two different aims. So basically you have three different types of aiming regular aim right click and then right click hold. It's completely unnecessary and unrealistic. You either use a scope or you don't. Not sure what s the purpose of the in between one that s got me killed numerous of times. It also can't be changed. You'd at the very least think that right click hold would be the zoomed in aim nope. Terrible controls for a shooting game and goes completely against the normal controls of a regular shooter. Weapon functionality appears completely unrealistically broken. You shoot like your character has parkinson's. Several of times when near a person using your assault rifle goes completely whacked out. Your cursor gets enlarged and your shots go out of control. I mean if the person is right front of me cursor is on the player and the gun shoots all the way to the bottom right of him. I mean seriously?This game is just another battle royale game that you want to love but still lacks plenty of potential and it is unclear what will come out of the game. Right now it just feels like a very lacking shooter that wastes your time unlike all the others. It s also not very realistic nor is it very action orientated. Tons of hype very little to offer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-30,1,4,134,True,Recommended,Now...Is this game good? Yes yes it is.I played Arma3 and DayZ. I'm not a stranger to battle royale games so when a friend bought me this I went into it expecting much of the same. I even waited a week before I even bothered installing it.Boy do I wish I'd given it a shot earlier.The game is all around fun. It's quick intense gameplay that keeps you on your toes 24/7. You never know when a guy with a shotgun is gonna come bashing through your front door while you wait for the limit line to reach you so you can move on.GAMEPLAYGameplay is pretty straight forward. You jump out of an airplane to choose your own spawn point. This is the make or break moment as it's far more likely to die early on if you drop in a frequently dropped in zone where like 30 people are on a 1 sq mile block with 3 houses of loot in it. Things get hairy and 29/30 are most likely going to die in that place. In this game getting kills is not the Priority name of the game. Survival is. Staying alive until you're the last man standing is the ultimate goal so it's important to differentiate between fights worth picking and to just stay low and let the convoy of friends pass you by rather than hope you can pick them off one by one without them seeing you. You'll find progressively better gear as the battleground shrinks in on itself and sometimes if you're lucky you'll drop in a place that's smack dab where the game is gonna end leaving you with a playground full of epic loot that'll leave you stacked and ready before anyone else.There are 3 versions of the game(Not counting custom) which are solo duo and squad(4). GRAPHICSGraphics are not exactly something to cheer about. They're 'adequate' but definitely could be a lot better. Due to it being an early access game sadly this also means that there are bugs and texture glitches relatively often but unless you literally get PTSD attacks or something from seeing slightly faulty graphics and serrated edges on building corners from time to time it won't bother you at all.PROS A mediocre community(Why is this a pro you might ask? Because voice chat is entirely optional and there is no such thing as text chatlog) Intense fast paced combat that'll have you sweating bullets for hours. Fair hit boxes and no wall clipping(Can't shoot through walls in certain situations etc.) Outrageously fun with friends. Goes up at least 5 stars extra if played with friends! Smooth clear voice chat built into the game(And of course there's perimeter conversation as well) No game breaking bugs that I've seen thus far. Highly customizable weapons and clothing for a personal 'build'. MASSIVE map with up to 100 players in it. Low price ($30) for a really damned good game! Fast and simple entrance to games. The longest I've ever waited from queue to joining was 3 seconds. Over 5 million copies sold and an extremely active game with an average of 280 000 people playing on the regular and over 450 000 at peak hours(Source Steam Charts)CONS Poor sub standard graphics Infrequent but catastrophic server connection losses Very rude and obnoxious community(Well at least it seems that way. I guess the trolls and idiots spamming slurping noises are more vocal and active than the more serious and mature gamer) Developer promised no microtransactions till the game is done which was honestly a pure 24 karat s*** nugget of lies. Loot is RNG based. (You might land at a building with no weapons in it at all while the guy next door comes over to say hello neighbor with an AK47 a pump action shotgun and a level 2 police vest.)FINAL WORDLike I said above is the game good? Yes yes it is but it has some definite issues which is not really the game itself that's the problem but the slightly unscrupulous developers. Go down the negative(and even some of the positive) reviews and you'll see the lies coming from the devs mentioned over and over and over again specifically the whole lie about microtransactions not happening till after the game was finished and released. The devs also claim that they want to use the money from the microtransactions to fund an Esports event for the game except the game revenue that they earned on it is so high they could easily fund a massive esports event to rival Riot Games' League of Legends championships with the utmost ease(An estimated $100mi was earned on the game so far).I recommend the GAME itself definitely but if the devs do not clean up their act and stop spewing lies to try and convince people to buy their game with empty promises? I'm going to rapidly change this review to a negative.It's so unfortunate too. The game is simply astonishingly fantastic.And one last thing before I go,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,"It has great promise with its interesting premise charming community and amazing graphics but the sound is lackluster and confusing the movement mechanics are ""swimmy"" and the aiming mechanic is nausiating. Despite all of its promise and EA I give it a firm thumbs down. I explain a lot more in detail belowGRAPHICS It is in EA so the FPS drops are to be expected and dont bother me too much. With the quality settings set low it runs pretty smooth. The graphics are pretty nice the island is huuuge! If you don't have a top of the line Graphics Card I'm afraid you'll be disappointed with the game should you expect anything great out of the FPS. I didn't myself and I find the graphics and FPS drops satisfactory. Overall with EA status I give the graphics a 8/10!SOUND The sound is pretty disappointing for me. I wear headphones with Virtual Surround and it is very hard for me to tell where other players are despite hearing their footsteps. Their footsteps are also very quiet compared to other games. Playing games like rainbow 6 and battlefield i may be spoiled though.When you're in the ""lobby"" which is like some parking lot with a broken plane and other buildings and what not with 100 players before the game starts I instantly am welcomed with a horrible sound from several guns being fired. The sound is akin to someone pressing mute/unmute rapidly and I find myself running away from people that are shooting so I cant be bothered from the noise.Given the EA status I give the sound a 3/10GAMEPLAY When we start the game in a big plane most of the time I hear stuff like ""CHINA NUMBA ONE"" and ""SHUT UP F##GOT"" etc and sometimes that makes me chuckle and I don't mind the silly juvenile jokes as they are the norm in multiplayer games anyway. I am disappointed that there is no way to type though as that would be great for asking other players questions instead of having to fight to talk over other people who are playing out silly antics.Once we finally jump out the game atmosphere changes drastically. Now its time to land somewhere near a building and grab some guns and ammo armor etc. This part is somewhat fun. The rush of not knowing what you'll find is real and the fear of running into another more armed player is exhillerating. The constant push to move as the gameplay map shrinks also is an awesome mechanic that I welcome very much.In this context I give the gameplay a solid 8/10 Unfortunately the rest of the game mechanics which I delve into more detail below are so bad so terrible in fact that I can't recommend this game!!MELEE COMBAT This is where the game really starts to fall apart on itself It's aweful. I mean god aweful. You have no reach at all and you have to aim higher than the player to hit them in the face. The whole thing takes a lot of practice and the way your player moves is almost dizzying. More on that later. But the whole fact that I have to be touching my oponent before any of my punches will connect is very annoying. Often times I'm fighting someone who has figured out how to handle this glitchy behaviour and kills me. Other times I get lucky and down the other guy. Overall the melee combat experience is a 1/10 I mean its god aweful. Player doesnt punch where you aim and you have to be practicly touching them to even connect a punch yet you can be much further away and pick up items fine. This really needs fixed.. huge thumbs down here.Melee combat in this game gets the well desrved score of 1/10MOVEMENT Aside from vehicle movement which is quite good the player movement is so bad that I have to give this entire game a huge thumbs down. Any redeeming quality such as the charming community and interesting game designs all pail in comparison to what is one of the most disasterous gameplay mechanics ever designed to date. It is so bad that I cannot fathom why this game is popular.The ""loose"" movement in this game is terrible. If I move forward and then release the move key my player spends 300ms or so still moving. The inertia is very disorienting and not like any other games I've played. It feels as though I'm controlling a humanoid robot that takes half a second or so to receive commands. It feels almost ""Swimmy"" like I'm controlling a drunk character that doesn't have very good balance. And it is this ""loose"" bumbling movement that has given me the resolve to post this review in the first place and not recommend it. I strongly recommend you do not touch it. If you want to spent your time trying to figure out how to time your movements as your clunky legs still move when you let go of the controls then this game is for you.Overall movement score? 1/10AIMING Just as bad as movement the aiming in this game is incredibally frustrating. I find myself fighting my character's breathing and position a whole hell of a lot. Again this mechanic is very unintuitive and not seen in any other game I've played. If you are moving with your gun out your aim just goes around almost in circles as you move around. You can't aim and move at the same time without a lot of practice and sure enough once you master the frustrating swimmy movements and nausiating aim mechanics you'll suffer for it playing any other game as you have to relearn how to play a game with proper controls.I cannot recommend this game as it is. It has a lot of promise but until the movement and aim is fixed I'm never playing again. I still cant believe it is this popular. I guess that is only thanks to streamers...Overall aiming score? 1/10OVERALLOverall I give this game a 4/10 just 2 points shy of giving it a thumbs up and recommending it.

Most of the time I played in a 4 man squad I am killed by my own team just to steal my guns. I recomend using no guns at all you may increase your survival rates... My team does not understand there is a blue circle coming to get us and they need to move away from it to avoid death. They prefer camping and all the health rather than run to the center of the map...after 2 hours I haven't seem what happens if I survive the battle!Thanks 9GAG!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-08,0,0,930,False,Recommended,so...Positives Playerunkowns Battlegrounds is one of the best games I have every played. It is so entertaining and addicting. I would strongly recommend this game. It has plenty of content and thousands of hours of replayability. The cosmetic items are a great awesome and fun way to customize your character. This game also has very good gunplay and movement. You can use the vaulting mechanics or you can use the faster method of crouch jumping (my prefered method). The guns have realistic bullet physics including drop off and travel time. PUBG also includes vehicles like trucks motorcycles dune buggys and sedans. The driving is great and yes you can do backflips on the bikes. PUBG also has a decent community of mostly mature people (you wont always be instatly finished when you are downed). Negative You may run into hackers with things like aimbot or wallhacks. Some hackers may have totally rediculous hacks such as invisibility or flying. Out of the almost 500 hours I have played (including early alpha and after) I have ran into about two hackers so the hacking issue isnt that rediculous as you may have heard. Hit registration is always questionable if you peak for .1 second on your screen you might peak for almost .5 seconds on the enemys screen. also you may unload an entire magazine into a guy then when you watch the kill cam you are just standing there leaning like an idiot and not even shooting. This brings me to the spectator mode/kill cam oh my god is it horrible it basiclly makes everyone look like they have aimbot because it doesnt show fluid motions so don't report everyone. it may look like they aren't even aiming at you when you are shooting but they probably were on their screen. I do highly recomend this game especially if you have friends that already play it. It is so much fun to play with friends and on your own. I hope you enjoy PUBG and purchase the game the Devs are relativly active they like to add content and they want to fix the bugs in the game they have a small dev team. wish you lots of chicken dinners.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,117,True,Recommended,So I would say I have experience in other MOBAs and compared to these (DotA2 LoL) PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a very good game. The mechanics are so different to all the others some may consider the graphics very nice although I personally do not I can see the appeal some people won't and some people will. That's how the cookie crumbles with this style. I like the character roster but from a f2p standpoint I sense this game will be a bit dry to play The 5 avalible characters at least for this week of writing this review are kind of boring. 2 I enjoy playing but then there is 'punch guy' 'obligatory turret man'and 'minotaur' who I find to be extremely boring characters. This will however change when the cycle of weekly (i assume weekly) characters change. Although I do believe the starter pack is extremely reasonable as you unlock 8 heroes (or whatever). In conclusion from a f2p standpoint I think this game may get stale over time as it is hard to get coins quick but otherwise I love the mechanics and overall feel of the combat system of the game and believe it has great potential. Only other criticism is that I think the launcher is very frustrating as you have to have steam open to play it as it is installed on steam and it confuses me a bit (although I am stupid).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's a new game it's something you're probably interested in and it's not half bad! I'm enjoying myself so much. ') The characters are fun the invasion modes are fun co op is fun (I don't think story co op is a thing but you can basically explore the map and do mini missions or just hang out there's quite a bit to do though it is indeed seamless).Pros Great Audio Great Dialogue Great gameplay mechanics Great animations (those freakin' parkour animations man!) Great story (so far) Very fun (subjective but heck I'm sure the 99% of WD2 consumers would agree!) Fast travelling.. MMMMM YES MY BEAUTIFUL FAST TRAVEL FRIEND! &lt 3 A male black character that DOESN'T get seen as a crook when he walks around but rather a stud (in the eyes of civillians since they're very friendly 'n stuff!)CONS There's just ""master volume"" settings for audio? You can't turn down either SFX Voice or music specifically.. not that I've seen anyway. But heck I could be blind. Prooooooooobably not though. So yeah no specific audio volume settings &gt c Although the world itself is very live (there's a lot going on and it's LIT AF) along with there being a ton of stuff to do personally I think there's not enough dialogue with the main crew unless you're interacting with an OP or they let you know about a new OP like no random chats here n there.. but that's just me I guess to each &amp their own. Some people would like more dialogue among the crew outside of ops others might not. This is more of a PERSONAL CON. )All in all a solid 10/10 it's ok",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,86,True,Not Recommended,So far i am disapointed but i am hoping the things that are wrong get fixed. Of my top 5 annoyances getting randomly head shot in a vehicle is one of them. Doen't matter if you a zigging and zagging with no apparent pattern and i have done it to people myself but shooting someone in the head while they are in a car is super easy and completely unintentional. Number two of my grievences when you parachute in people will follow you in to your location just to beat you to death with their fists or to beat you to the first weapon and kill you. This is realistic to me but kinda puts you on tilt after you wait for que up and die the first 2 min of the game. My third grievence is the opening phase where you wait a whole minute for people to join the game WASTE OF TIME this phase should be on the initial plane fly over this way people are not wasting loading time and get into the game faster. 4th grievence game rewards non existant. The game rewards you with a randomly generate item from a chest. The chest scale up in price but the loot does not. My first chest has a shirt pants leg holster and cap in it for 500 points. My second chest had a dirty brown sleeveless shirt and thats it for 900 points. For 2100 points i got a pair of white pants and for 3400 points i got a pair of white cammo pants. Now when does the loot start getting good? My final grievance against the game is the perimiter that shrinks ever so slowly at first then insainly quick. Granted i know this propells the game forward but at the final 5 min of the game each second the perimiter takes 1/3 of your health where as the first time the perimiter shrinks it takes 1/100 of your health per tick so something needs to be done clearly. Their are several smaller thing that annoy me but i can cope with those as opposed to the aformentioned ones. In it's current state i would not reccomend the game for people who get frustrated over things that cost you the game and make the game seem to punish you for playing but if these things get fixxed then i would whole heartidly reccomend the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-03,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,"This is just a bad game. Should not have been allowed to release as version 1.0.First off the collapsing boundary. I get it you need a mechanism to force the action. But to start collapsing it just 5 minutes into the game AND make it move so fast you can't keep up with it running at top speed IN ADDITION TO not making the player aware of where its going to be COLLAPSING TO when he/she is in the freakin airplane and can still avoid starting out 50 miles outside of the collapsing boundary? WTF. This is just bad design.Issue #2 not nearly enough Asian servers. The result is that 80% of the players on the North American servers don't even speak English which defeats the purpose of the Duo/Squad modes of the game.Issue #3 sloppy loot distribution scheme. Half the time there will be 4 backpacks in the same location but then no combat vest. Or there will be 3 combat vests but no backpack and no weapon better than a machete. If you're only going to give the player 5 minutes to lott before he/she has to ""MOVE"" then you have to do better than this guys.Issue #4 too many scopes lying around. 4 out of 5 times I get killed by someone I can't even see while running just to keep up with the collapsing boundary.Issue #5 lackluster controller support. Come on guys this is 2018 not 1998. Why do I have to hold down the X button to reload my gun and why can't I peek around corners. There's 10 buttons on today's controllers plenty to assign all of the essential character actions. There's also more than a few minor bugs in the game that make it frustrating to play like glitching vehicles. If it was just these bugs that plagued the game I wouldn't have a problem recommending it but combined with all of the other flaws this game is just a recipe for you punching a hole in the wall. Yet another example of a Steam game that has a good idea behind it but because the developers are in over their heads and evidently never play their own game to test out the gameplay mechanics it just turns into a mess.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Instead of improving performance Blueballs decided to devote all of their time on creating a desert map that no one likes and a vault mechanic to stop people from using a crouch jump bug. game even developers Great Job Blueballs,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-18,0,0,440,True,Not Recommended,I've played this game for awhile and it's so dumb. For starters you jump like a flacid It's like you don't want to jump. And your jump is like your jumping from the shore to a large rock in the river so you can avoid getting wet. You also have no clue where you're getting shot from. The sound on this game is crap and it's the only way you can tell where you're getting shot from. I mean if you're getting shot you should at least be able to known THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE BULLET. Idk I guess they expect when you take a bullet to your back you don't know where it came from.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-31,0,0,78,True,Not Recommended,Haven't been able to play since the last 2 updatesGTX1070 16gbRa no reason i should lag every game and constantly get put back. Please for the love of god start refunding. Your Game is rampant with Hackers It's all over Youtube clear as day to see. Good idea/Poorly executed. Seriously if you can't Atleast make this game somewhat payable you need to consider refunds.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-11,0,0,550,True,Recommended,So Ive had a plethora of errors since release of the game the main issue being the game will not open. The bug I seem to have is the game will not open I see that it says running so I checked task manager and Battle Eye Launcher opens in the background but soon closes and Im back to step one. So After a ton of troubleshooting to no avail. I eventually gave up. I waited a few hours and decided to try my luck one more time and I got one step further. This time Battle Eye launcher loads and I can see the window......... Please help,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-08,0,0,107,True,Not Recommended,I really enjoy this game BUT that is only because I was able to play it on a friends computer that could actually run it. I have a fairly old gaming PC that can run most games and was not able to get over 20 FPS while playing this game making it completely unplayable. This game NEEDS to be optimized ASAP. That being said make sure you have a very good gaming PC if you're going to buy this or I would recommend waiting until the game is developed further. Great concept and I can see this becoming a great game. Early access but needs a LOT of work. Thumbs down until I can actually run this game on very low settings... Hopefully can change it to thumbs up soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That server. Is PUBG hire Ubisoft's server or sth?)anyway for honestly you spawn at a plane crush site(aka lobby) and after few seconds you jumper into a map which I think is ctrl+c from GOOGLE map(maybe). and you have to choose a place to start your game. If you choose some popular place you will see many parachues like not kidding)and later you go down you have to find a ing gun. And if you unluckily encountered an enemy and you don't have weapon.

The game can get really buggy and glitchy at times but keep in mind this game is titled as an ""Early Access"" game so just wait and see the developers fix bugs and optimize the game for the better bright future for that game indeed!! EDIT After patch 1.0(PUBG is officialy out of the beta) I must say I enjoy the game a hundred times more than I did before. They improved performance the game runs very smooth now and you don't need a beast to run it anymore. I got 50% more fps than I had before the patch lots of bug fixes as was expected.

2017-09-26,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand PUBG. The gameplay is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the circles will go over a typical player's head. There's also PU's capitalistic outlook which is deftly woven into his microtransactions his personal philosophy draws heavily from Electronic Arts literature for instance. The fans understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these games to realise that they re not just epic they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PUBG truly ARE idiots of course they wouldn t appreciate for instance the humour in PU's existential catchphrase The Ultimate Life and Death Fight which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Brendan Green's genius wit unfolds itself on their PC screens. What fools.. how I pity them. And yes by the way i DO have a Chicken Dinner tattoo. And no you cannot see it. It s for the ladies eyes only and even then they have to demonstrate that they re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-05,0,0,225,True,Recommended,Player Unknown Battlegrounds is really fun if you have friends to play with. If you don't its enjoy able either way. Pros Monthy updates with tons of bug fixes and new features. Lots of weapons and more being added Playing with friends is really enjoyable. Action threw out the entire game Hours of gameplay with endless rounds.Cons Game breaking glitches where your car goes flying. People leave the game prior of it starting to you don't get into more fights People afk so the game becomes less enjoyable. If you get anything other then first you get no recognition for what you did basically wasting your time with no reward. Game devs ban inoccent people for acusations of stream sniping. (Some people intentionally streamsnipe and im fine with ban)PubG is full of action and is a really fun game solo or with friends. The only bad things about the game is when people afk or leave prior to the game starting. It sucks the action and fun out of the game when less people are in the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-17,0,0,20,True,Recommended,"Review After playing over 10hours of the game I could definetly recommend this game for everyone especially for people who like competetive online games . It's definetly worth your while and it's even more fun if you play with your friends . I would give this game an 8 /10 it would've easily been a 9/10 if the online lag issues were properly handled .Introduction PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a multiplayer online battle royale video game developed and published by Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were developed by Brendan ""PlayerUnknown"" Greene for other games using the 2000 film Battle Royale for inspiration and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's world decreases in size over a match directing surviving players into tighter areas and forcing encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.Tips on playing the game Even after playing only 10hours of the game I could freely say that I've won a lotta times . 1.)First of all have a good gaming pc ( with atleast a gtx 750 ti as your GPU ) and also a good internet connection . And the second most important thing is finding good loot . This would easily determine 40% of all the time whether you could win or not .2.)Always try to find the military loot which are over level 3 . Watch this video to find the places where you could get some good military loot ( https //www.youtube.com/watch?v dV0LwJvmGhc ) .3.) You always gotta carry a medkit/firstaidkit and some bandages . This is extremely important because your are'nt bullet proof . Even if you have level 3 military loot you can be killed easily with a few shots .4.) I don't know if this is advisable or not but dont ever carry shotguns . I dont know if you like them but in my opinion shotguns are the worst you could find after handguns . Always carry yourself an assault rifle or a sniper rifle.5.) In duos dont stick with your mates in scarce locations where there are no buildings for loot .Go to a location like Po i where you could find enough loot for you and your mate . And always try to find an attachment like red dot sight or a holographic sight for your assault rifle. 6.) And finally be patient and don't force quit cuz you have'nt won the round Iam sure that you would win atleast one time or the other .",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-30,0,0,273,True,Not Recommended,If u purchase at a early release date u probably get least 1 kill every 3 deaths considering mostly not cheating. Now u earn instant death when enemies or rather cheaters have high tolerance damage even the likes u having least level 2 armor or even level 3 armor shotgun that takes me out with 1 single shot while i fired few memorieables on players whom not even wearing single layer on armor but requires least 3 shotgun at least 3 m apart to take them down considering SKS/SARS i have recalled least fired onto person without armor but takes more than 7 8 to bring them crawling but it was different case when i being taken down with 1 2 shots (with least level 2 armor) and mostly headshots u wonder if these players have upgraded either their percision eagle eye or simply using hacks to aid their percison even the likes am I used a cross bow(High damage with 1 shot onto head) which aimed for the head twice was expecting that send the player crawling the player just continue camping on top of a rock as if ANT just bitten him and caused him to move 1 inch from his position. I tried countless using X4 X 8 scopes with SARL/MKP4/SKS aiming for heads but even u see blood spilling out they are still moving around as if damage has limited impact. Those died under my hands are probably honest players but i do not consider them as rookies nor noobies when u make into final 13 but i not longer able to see such players since end of this week. Probably they have faced mine same dilamena. I happen to team up with 2 terminators JK21 &amp MasterPuppter nicksname and basically the whole street of a city being taken down with just 2 of them while I was basically doing as a sidekicks. U can't help to wonder with their equipped AKM it basically every1 is dead obstructing their path. With this I have concluded Delete the game. I spent so much nites doing research and end up mostly dead with 1 2 shots. Ridicious. I tot with unreal engine 4 that was involved in the developement there is low chance that the game was hacked. I guess I going back to Ghost Recon. Least hackers are banned.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you play you get a loot first playstyle oh I need a extended mag now I need a compensatoer opps now I need a stock and people are playing a lot less aggressively and leads to a lot of stail gameplay. Also I had most of my friends that I played with just say hey lets just camp in this room and they would only get a few kills every time they won because they did not want to fight anyone. Also I forgot this game was in my libary for a few weeks and did not touch it and if that happens with a game when people forgot they had it thats not good. Also don't even get me started on how GARBAGE the servers are and how they dont even try to fix them.

2017-04-06,0,0,11,True,Not Recommended,Not worth the price they are asking! It's basically being thought of as good because H1Z1 has become so bad. The circles speed mean unless you happen by chance to land in the right place or find a vehicle then it is just another lootting/running simulator. The sound clues are absolutely awful sound of guns from behind while the player is shooting from ahead of me to the left? Really? It maybe Alpha but c'mon that can't be difficult to fix! I've heard not one single footstep of approaching players even in the same building which means you get shot from nowhere with no warning! Server lag spikes are frequent where you can literally do nothing but wait for it to settle down. Really no skills needed all you have to do is camp a tree a building etc you wont ever see them they're mostly about three or four pixels on your screen they kill you because your too busy trying to beat that circle! Meanwhile the UI is just abysmal too much clutter in buildings means you have to use TAB to loot! If you buy it prepare yourself for disapointment it may look good on a Twitch stream played by people who do nothing else but it fails miserably to be even decent!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-18,1,1,475,True,Not Recommended,"At the current state the game is in right now I can't in good conscience recommend Battlegrounds to anyone. Yes the gun mechanics and the graphics are significantly better than H1Z1. But there's just so little weapon variety and the looting system is so horribly implemented that I've recently been finding it increasingly more difficult to find good gear even in the big cities. Also I don't know what code or algorithim is being used to determine weapon output damage for this game but it is complete and utter For example one match I was wearing a level 3 military vest and I heard another player outside my building. So I fixed my Uzi on the door I knew the player was going to come through and waited for him. Only for him to burst into the room and one shot me in chest with a shotgun. I thought ""well maybe he got a head shot on me"" but I looked in the kill feed and noticed that I wasn't shot in the head. Don't get me wrong this game has a lot of positive things going for it.

2017-05-20,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,This is probably the worst shooter game I've ever played for one extremely simple reason. They don't even try to teach you how to play. I'm not talking strategy I'm talking absolute lack of tutorial on the CONTROLS. The game doesn't utilize all the standards for controls yet fails to teach you how to even open your inventory. Instead you have to go digging through your control settings to figure out how to play which is not only not enjoyable but rediculous for a game that already costs you $30 in ALPHA. I could understand it if this was a $15 or $20 game in alpha but the fact they're charging half the cost of a full AAA title while still not even having hit Beta kills any excusable reason to not even include a tutorial to teach people the controls. Yes the game is similar to H1Z1 in style but if someone comes to this game without ever having played that then they will have absolutely no idea how to play or any way of learning. This is just a horrid mess that's liable to cause numerous refund requests from players who came in expecting to at the very least be able to play the game but can't even be shown the basic controls necessary to do so.4/10 would not recommend /at this time/.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,1,6,252,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. So what changed in the 1 year spent in early acces for this amazing game? Performance got sligtly better but the netcode issues became worse. Gunplay was somehow made even more worse than it was previously and to compensate for a boring empty map they made a literal sandbox with absolutely nothing in it. But atleast now that the game is totally finished and released we can get loot boxes30 euro early access game with minimal content no replay value and which brings nothing new to the table is somehow making waves when it even fails to fix the issues the mod had for arma 3.Combat is plagued by desync issues hitreq problems and poor weapon balance. Controls feel awful and the third person view feels like cheating when you can gain info without any risk for yourself. The map is boring and static. Add this to a boring gameplay loop that has far more potential than just picking the same up the exact same way every time at the same locations. If i'll find a ak every round why not just give one from the beginning? Melee as a way to fight is and broken. Performance is t you played arma 3 yourself how the can you make the same mistake? Audio is Even the art style and graphics are The game being ""better"" than h1z1 or dayz is not really anything to brag about. Both of those games are Is it fun ""coop"" game with friends?

What the do crates have to do with the gameplay? Why are you spending money on crates anyways. Fortnite does all of this too but has half the depth of gameplay as PUBG does.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's miles off being playable. If they continue to concentrate on new weapons vaulting etc rather than fixing the game itself a new game like Islands of Nyne will come alone and 'For Honor' the f*ck out of this game.

2017-03-26,0,0,253,True,Recommended,Diggin it. If they add another map and a mode with respawning it would really satisfy my Arma / Dayz cravings. Its already more fun though. Things just work better and theres a better quality of life and better pacing. Matchmaking is fast as hell and matches start quick. Runs fine on my machine its a new pc though so be wary if ya have an older one although by nature of the game itself you wanna run things lower anyway for advantage / less screen clutter.Guns work great although the melee weapons aren't useful I think they may as well let you equip one from the start just for visual aesthetics and I'm not a huge fan of the crossbow. Seems pretty useless but maybe theres someone out there doing work.Also had a shotgun fail to KO someone from about 2 meters with a squarely aimed chest shot so I haven't picked another of those up. Also the vehicles work well and are common enough to find reliably and unlike Arma you arent going to be disabled and possibly killed just because you ran over a small shrubbery.You get to create and customize a characters appearance to a nice degree. Hair face skin color gender etc. Beyond that there are several slots for cosmetics that you can start with like shirt boots hat jacket etc. Its a nice touch since none of those effect gameplay.All in all i'm very excited to see where this goes and even if it goes NO further than where it is now it still satisfies my open world loot / pvp survival itch moreso than many of the same genre games I have tried.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The connection to the servers is absolutely horrible my game wont load in textures until after I have been in the actual game for 5 minutes and if it's not bad enough the graphics have to be patched by a community made reshader mod to actually look halfway decent. I tried everything to fix it including custom PC optimization and every tutorial video i could find on how to fix the game. Nothing worked. I spent 30 dollars on a game I couldn't play and luckily got a refund. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Edit After release the game was (very poorly) optimized and i can now (barely) run this game on my PC. Half the time the game does not load in until i drop AFK and whenever i actually get to load in on time im plagued by frame drop and buildings that are slow to render.

Finally died in 6th place with first contact. 4th drop Bad luck land on wrong side of island and spend the rest of the life running to and dying before I reach zone.Most drops are somewhere in between these two. There are ways that your decisions effect the out come and at some point your skill does matter But getting to the point in which any of that will matter is based solidly on luck.The good stuff Graphics are good the world feels big combat can be vicerally pleasing.I did experience technical issues which is to be expected in a pre release but bug report is done outside the game and I dont care enough to jump through extra hoops to make a report of a known issue. Customization Because clothing is mixed in with the tactical that randomly spawns there is a good chance of picking it up. In games that I lasted longer than 5min I never looked the same.

2017-03-24,1,2,2,True,Not Recommended,Brought on release in very early access. This was a mistake.Game was hilariously unoptimised in terms of performance to the point where on lowest settings and with several .ini file tweaks it would still suffer from terrible fps drops and freezing which would render the game unplayable. My PC isn't the newest but it runs Arma 3 on good graphics settings with zero problems at all so why is this any different?Even stripped down to it's absolute ugliest (and believe me it got really ugly) the game still wouldn't work.Devs have promised that optimisation is highest on their list of priorities for the next several patches but that doesn't help me right now and I'm not going to hold on to the game with my fingers crossed hoping it becomes playable at a later date.I took my refund and moved on with my life. Might check back in later in development to see how it's progressed but I've learnt the lesson that the hype made me ignore the hard way that you should never pay full price for an Early Access game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Reason why it is addictive is because it has constant dopamine surge of picking up item that improves your chance of winning. The map is much bigger than other action game and you die very quick so you have to be more alert than other game and when you die everything is lost so its like dark souls it abuses the concept of ""flow"" means you forget about your surrounding and have to be 100% in present with the game in other word it is captivating your attention you don't have time for your self talk like what you are actually doing is fun or not.

2017-03-30,0,0,104,True,Not Recommended,The concept of this game is great but this one in particular is very poorly executed. There are a few MAJOR elements that need to be fixed in this game before it is truly playable. Here are just a few #1) I would say a good 70% of the time i'm being shot at i cant even tell where the bullets are coming from. which leads to #2) the sound is AWFUL. you could be in a 5 story building and it sounds like every footstep is in the same room as you.#3) no real reward for getting kills promotes people to camp even more which is exactly what they do. #4) fix the pregame sound also sounds like a bunch of farts.#5) movement is clunky cant reload while opening doors and a lot of lag during early game and while picking items up a delay.#6) way too much RNG in the looting also constantly getting screwed over with loot.#7) melee is abysmal These are just a few.. the game needs a lot of work but can be great if the developers dont just take their money and run... for now its NOT recommended though,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-25,0,0,154,False,Not Recommended,"In the games current state it is an utter disaster. The amount of bugs plaguing this game is honestly astounding. I know it's ""in pre release"" state and that is why I am doing this Pre Release review. I've walked through ""open"" doors today and looted stuff inside the room. Then I suddenly rubberbanded back outside with the loot. I've loaded over 40 rounds into a 5 ammo clip just repeatedly putting ammo into the clip. My guy just wouldn't stop shoving more bullets into the gun. I've had walls disappear being able to see through buildings and see everyone/everything that is within.I've shot people dozens of times and not got a single hit marker and then they fly across the screen and spin in circles and noscope me. Doors take 2+ seconds to open. Same for looting items and getting into vehicles. Client freezing after almost every match. Have to open up Task Manager and kill the process.Just riding along on the motorcycle and I suddenly shot into space and started flipping around all crazy like. I pumped a kid in the guts with a shotty and his body literally flew up into the atmosphere never to be seen again. I don't know if he even died or if he just took the shotty damage and then decided his people needed him.Being shot through walls. No ing explanation for this. I'm assuming that others get the ""no more walls"" bug and it allows them to shoot through it and they are able to reproduce this bug and abuse it.The movement in this game is also atrociously awful. It's like the ice levels on Mario. You just kinda slip and slide around and need to ""pick up speed"" to get moving. It's the weirdest thing ever. You also cannot climb anything. Even to get over an ankle high fence you need a 20 meter running start to jump over it. You can't hop in through windows there is no cover system you can only lean slightly to the left/right just a tiny tiny bit. Movement in this game is criminally bad.If you're ok with getting a massive headache from bugs lag desync and terrible netcode go ahead and pick the game up and give it a try. It's a fun game. Otherwise I advise you to wait a few months.This game is buggier than a Louisiana swamp. It is not anywhere near ready for being ""released.""

Their has been alot of accusations to say Bluehole is only in it for the money thats why they added crates and a New ""Event Pass"". But this is Not true It's harder than you think to pay for and find devs for games they do try to stay on top of the problems. FPS issues is not actualy Thier fault Its more just The engine itself trying to run a game with 100 people in so you can expect that from most BR's. People may ask why Not fortnite...simple just look at the graphics and detail in fortnite.Pubg Overall is a fun experiance and has come along way iw ould somwhat call it a NEW game from when 1.0 was released the only major issues with the games are Desync FPS (for lower end pc's) And probably the most annoying one of all (Which a PUBG Dev has told me will be fixed fairly soon anyway) Limb shot in hands and arms mainly doing about %10 of the damage which a normal shot would do making it so you have to hit them avg of 9 times in the hand to kill sooo... just aim for the head. There a lot of negative reviews on here but i am almost certain that at least %60 are from people who have got killed then raged about it with a bad review. This game has alot more to come and updates have a vast amount of content so much i get thrilled when they update the game. The new ""sanhok"" map is very good too and is for players who want a quick game or just something differant .

Performance while not unplayable is very poor especially on the current recommended requirements.Server performance is also very flaky which adds to the poor client end performance.Sure if you have a 4690k and a 1080ti then you'll get better performance however you will still observe massive frame drops.The game and gameplay are really good however and surprisingly addictive however with only one map and a handful of weapons the experience does get repetitive fast.I will revise my review once the game has left eary access (if it ever does as is the fate with many early access games) however for now I wouldn't recommend it to the average consume who's scrolling through steam.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I just don't understand that the game is still in such a poor state. The devs have made a ridiculous amount of money yet have done jack with it. Optimize the game before investing in esports for crying out loud who would take a broken game like this seriously in a competitive environment anyways.. These devs also lack any kind of creativity it seems because I dont think I have ever seen an uglier main menu in my life let alone the boring assets and map design. There is only 1 map after all this time how is this even possible? It is obvious that this game is just an easy cashgrab banking in on the battle royale hype there is absolutely zero passion involved in this project. The devs have probably gone jackin' it in San Diego by now..The game would actually be decent if it was optimized and if they added content but instead this is just another case of false promises and wasted potential.Lets not forget to mention the insane amount of players being banned for supposedly stream sniping which is just ludicrous.DO NOT SUPPORT THESE DEVS!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,209,True,Not Recommended,Really wanted the game to at least show some promise/potential in comparison to H1Z1. There is NO comparison this game needs so much work. Weapon placement it takes 20 mins to find a M16 or AK. Trying to land takes an insane amount of time pick up animation is unnecissary audio is down right terrible. No directional hit indicator so when you get shot you have no idea which way to hide or where to take cover. Only positive thing i have to say is the bullet speed in comparison to H1. Wish i loved the game and maybe they will patch it up to make it more playable but its garbage. Dont waste 30$ on it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,141,True,Not Recommended,Attention!!!! buy this game the only reason why I'm putting this game as a non recommended game is due the fact the it has some graphical and fps issues plus there are a couple other small bugs but they don't affect the game at all. your still gunner have fun everyone who plays this has fun its an amazing game that meets the expectation on what the community wanted in a ''Battle Royal'' game and who better to do it then the people that created the mod for armatruly the best game of 2017 but sadly unplayable for me I have a 1050 ti and barely get 30 fps in the game while the menu gives me 170 fps and my default is playing in high yet i play it on very low with OC and cant even run it over 45 at times.please buy it and give it time to fix the graphical and fps issues I mean its just came out like a mouth ago and its in early access but the game is phenomenal and fun to play with friends and even in solo games i experiance so much fun something i find quite rare. hope you buy the game and enjoy as much as I do. &lt 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is rough especially for someone who is bad at FPS games but that dificulty is what makes it fun.

2017-04-05,0,0,96,True,Not Recommended,I heard about this game yesterday from a friend IRL but after playing it I've been extremely disappointed.Since the weapons are guns that kill in 1 3 hits everyone just hides and the first person to see another player will win. If you actually want to get to the end of the match you're better off just waiting around the outside and hiding until the circle gets very small so 90% of the match is just doing literally nothing. And then you die to someone you didn't even see shooting you half the time. It feels like this game might as well be a 16 player deathmatch in a tiny map because that's the only time anything interesting really happens and at least that way I don't have to spend 20 minutes waiting for a circle to shrink every game I play.Maybe it gets better eventually. Right now I wouldn't really recommend it.Oh yeah I forgot about the fact that it is terribly optimized. Lots of lag and desync. Also memory leaks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Ofcourse it will run better on full release but please stop with stupid things like i got banned from a streamer this game is full of bugs. Lol my friend is playing with 25 30 fps but he cant stop because this game is crazy good.I have no problems running it.Even if i had i would buy decent parts for my rig to be able to play it.

If you are highly competitive and want to spend time outsmarting or outgunning others then yes otherwise stay far away. There are alot of issues with the game itself that needs to be worked out and the high price should have increased the development not stopped it.* The game offers fast games different playstyles work (I am top 1000 on Eu or was)* Various bugs can ruin a 20 25 min game * Servers are slow and lag is to expected at times* What you can and cannot wallbang is not logical at all and while aiming you might find yourself shooting at some pixel/wall/tiny mound you don't see* Lots of cheatersNow you might think I don't like the game I do like it alot however these things are some of the things you have to deal with on a daily basis if you play. The game is not close to a finished product (I hope) so don't expect it.

2017-08-12,1,2,649,True,Not Recommended,The game is pretty good but it requires a NASA pc to play with decent graphics. It is on early access so I suppose they will optimise it before release. I have to say though.. The game is FULL OF BUGS that will hopefully get fixed soon.My main concern is that Greene became too greedy and let the community down with the recent paid crates. The community embraced this game by giving it an insane amount of purchases even before release and Greene spat on their face with something that is well known that everyone hates.

2017-08-08,0,0,340,True,Not Recommended,"This game was lots of fun when you would join and people would scream ""CHINA NUMBA ONE"" and all sorts of racial epithets. You could join a game and immediately team kill. Friends and I would regularly lure the odd man out into a bathroom close the door and beat him to death with our fists taunting him all the while.My most memorable match was convincing our sole remaining squad mate that I was a racist hillbilly. He begrudgingly drove across half the map to pick me up in a buggy putting his own welfare in jeopardy. As a thank you for picking me up I shot him in the back of the head with my 1911 and called him a n***** several times and drove off with his loot. I went on to win that game with 8 kills crawling into the final zone and getting into a firefight with a squad of two guys hiding behind a giant rock.In its newest iteration the game has become very sanitary. There are ""Rules of Conduct"" along with a report feature. Whenever games implement ""report"" features they invariably get used by big crybaby to report everyone and anything that hurts their fee fees. Ask my about how I lost a beta LoL account last year with $1k in skins etc. for talking to kids who generally talked to me.The moral of the story is as games get popular and as they get more press coverage (like PUBG has) they start to go down this road of sterility (the only exception to this rule is CS). I joined several PUBG games today and NO one talked in the lobby. There wasn't just an absence of hate speech and trolling there was an absence of anything. And this is likely going to remain the state of things as people are afraid to lose access to their account if they offend someone.The only person who did talk in my squad was a living cliche of a Reddit/Tumblr numale spouting all sorts of ""dank memes"". And now no one can tell that guy to STFU.There was also the introduction of paid content which broke a promise to the early access customers who supported this game. It's also likely to distract the devs from polishing the game and if any of the paid content is camouflage it will become pay to win (take it from someone who has only played this game in first person clothing color is HUGE).They also made it so you can't go first person in the plane or during parachuting which was a strange and frustrating change for people who play first person.If you were looking for that small squad ARMA III battle royale game with a wild west player base you missed the boat. It's still a fun game in some ways but the soul and color of the game has been snuffed out.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-05,2,3,647,True,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Hello guys please read the following review to get the best possible understanding of what you are getting into.TLDR Avoid this game as authors seem to have abandoned the game.Grade 3 / FORTNITEPros Game is super fun and addictive creative and will have every match different.Graphics are decent a bit outdated but good enough to be a pro.Weapon modifications are quite well done and similar to the real stuff.Developers look like they are trying hard to make this better game and updates are weekly or bi weekly.Map is well designed and interesting just lacks more foliage and trees.Cons Cheating is easily achieved as all important things are client sided and I will list some of them god mode infinite ammo rapid fire position of your and other players and so on.Audio is of quite bad quality which includes weapon sounds rain steps and so on.Game is crashing a lot I'd say about 2 3 times per 4 hour session of gaming.Servers are laggy due to poor coding and no kernel optimization they are using the Amazon crap.EDIT 19 / June / 2017DEVELOPERS HAVE ABANDONED THE GAME!When I posted in discussion why is there no update like promised I received a ban from forums!Proof is here http //prntscr.com/flj8m9Please stay away from this shovelware scam!!!EDIT #2 19 / June / 2017 / 23 47I have shared the truth I found on other reviews in the format of my edit above and developers of this scamware are threatening people about deleting their reviews unless they delete my comment. This is complete proof and my investigation has confirmed they abandon the game now.Proof http //prntscr.com/flr94pEDIT #3 16 / August / 2017 / 12 24The latest update brought micro transactions in this early access game and broke it at the same time.Yes that is true they spent 1 month of early access time to create irelevant 50 skins for your character. WOW THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED!!Also the servers are now inconsistent for aiming / shooting accross the board while before US servers were acceptable to play on. This is result of some ""optimizations"" in the last patch.Now lets be completely clear and honest about their patch notes system. They write a note once a week with changes listed. Now some of the changes the ones that are described in a way that you can test them out are correct and true BUT some of the notes claiming to be optimizations and various bug fixes ARE FAKE. YES THEY ARE POSTING FAKE PATCH NOTES.That's about it for now I'll keep tracking this garbage even though its fun to play but remember its people and players who make it fun not the game itself.BREAKING NEWS In the following article they announced they are stopping to release updates weekly which clearly means they are abandoning the game but try to sugar coat it for us http //steamcommunity.com/app/578080/discussions/7/1471968797464289324/If you take a look at my previous review updates and posts on their forums you will see I predicted this almost 2 months ago and proven again this game is only cash grabbing hole.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,352,True,Not Recommended,Game was not ready for release. Should have been left to bake for another 6 9 months. Poor optimization poor physics vehicles are terribly designed for today's gaming standards. Lag makes the game unplayable at the best of times and grants other players the ability to teleport around bullets. Scarcity of weapons is intentional? Weak excuse to cover up the fact that there is an unecessary amount useless gun attachments filling item spawn locations. Shooting mechanics are terribly clunky. Game is janky at best. For the price I am severely disappointed even if it does comes with the dreaded Early Access tag. At this point the Early Access tag is just a poor excuse for a company to release and cash in on a poorly made game. They hide behind the Early Access explanation in order to cover their asses in case the general gaming public don't like the game. Don't listen to the streamers they are dishonest because they are desperate for viewers and subscriptions.I will revisit the game and if it has been improved in the 6 9 months that I shelve it for I will take another look and update my review because it does have some potential.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Played 43 minutes of Player Unknown's Battlegrounds before I put in a refund request.I know it's Day 1 but the things I dislike are mostly game breaking.1. Price PointWay too high for a Free For All with a few bells and whistles. This is a $14.99 game MAX not $29.99.2. Lag/ConnectivityThe lag and connectivity issues are mind blowing for the minimum requirements which my rig is light years over.3. Poor GraphicsReiterating its day one but jeesh man. i7 5820 + GTX 980 ti + Ultra and the graphics look like engine default settings. Rendering issues as well.4. Hit Detection.It feels like a crap shoot during combat.4. Action DelayYou die rather quickly then you have to sit around some skirmish lobby area where everyone is punching shooting (if you hit the tables for guns quickly) and yelling at each other. Then you get air dropped into the zone. Takes really long imo to get back into the action. I would rather just spawn on the map somewhere.5. Muting PlayersCouldn't seem to find out how to do this and trust me...you'll want to.6. Controller SupportTried using my wireless Xbox 360 controller and it was very janky. Tried shutting it off but some prompt came up on my screen that forced me to keep the controller &lt ON&gt even if I wanted to use the keyboard &amp mouse.7. Transitioning to 1PPTransitioning to First Person is rather shempy. I like to combat in 1PP and its very poorly written imo.8. Weapon DistributionReally not a fan of picking up weapons. You get people in the same area on the air drop and it's a race to get armed. I'll find guns with the wrong mags. I would rather have classes and focus on the action not racing to grab gear. Gear drops could still be implemented but not like this.9. Fight ZonesWhy? We have an 8x8 km map that the fight area shrinks really quickly so why even let someone drop on the map edge they'll never make it to the combat zone in time. Blegh!10. VehiclesSome guy drove up to me and I beat him up but it wouldn't let me kill him...he just faded out. Guess he was logging out...didn't get the kill. Tried getting in the vehicle when I was getting shot at and it wouldn't let me get in. (I know some of these things are growing pains and maybe it's worth it if you're into this sort of developmental experience.I do enjoy Free For All but I think a big issue for me is I'm just sick and tired of Early Access games especially the unpolished variety. I want something finished not bugged the funk out and ready to go with a good to decent experience out of the box.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-30,1,2,342,True,Recommended,"I would like to state that even though I only recently reached 100 hours playing this game I feel like I have seen enough of what the game offers to review it. This is nothing but my humble opinion so don't be offended by it. PUBG has recently been reviewed bombed and it is getting bad reputation for all the wrong reasons. I feel like the game and its developers deserve their fair shake of both critisism and praise but they only seem to be getting hate from people who are not aware of the facts. In this review I will address several issues and give my honest opinion of the game.Streamers getting people banned There are countless people being mislead by the bogus complaints of people getting banned for stream sniping even though they did nothing wrong. Let me tell you right now that this is utter . Somebody who streams doesn't have the ability to ban others. Ban's are issued by the game admins/mods after a report has been processed. This means that somebody who gets banned has been found guilty of doing this. You won't find admins drinking beer and going on a banning spree for no reason. They find evidence that the offender has broken the rules and he pays the price. How do they find evidence? Its simple really as this game is being played by 1.5 million people daily Stream snipers need to join and quit ALOT of lobbies in order to find the streamer and it all happens while everyone is at the Spawn Island. Once they locate the streamer they follow him and kill him causing the streamer problems. Why is it such a big deal? Well this doesn't happen once or twice a day you know... It happens for the majority of the stream making the game unplayable for them and their stream's not so entertaining to watch. They are also customers who paid the game so that they can enjoy it themselves and it is not their fault some is acting like a moron to get some ""streaming time"". So after reading this you still don't feel bad for them and think people should get banned for this? No problem I will explain how getting stream sniped feels like. Its the same this as playing a game against an opponent with wallhacks. If you think hacking is a bannable offense then you shouldn't have a problem with people who stream snipe getting temporary bans.Negative Reviews from banned people I see alot of people bombing the game because they got banned for the reason above and apparently they are innocent and the bad admin banned them for no reason. M8 sit the f down I have 100+ hours and I haven't SEEN a streamer's name on my ing death log let alone kill one and get banned for it so would you guys like to explain how the you managed to get banned with 10 20 hours? I know how YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY GUILTY and are mad because you got caught. Nobody stole your money you got a temp ban for being a so don't give the game a negative review based on that because it only makes you look like an . This is a huge problem because those reviews scare potential buyers and its not like the reviews are based on facts it is just smoke coming out from people who are salty. Apart from scaring potential buyers this has spread so much that even people who haven't been banned are leaving bad reviews on the game because of what they read from people who are banned and angry. I want people to know that nobody will randomly ban you for stream sniping and that we must all do our best to resist and resent those who try to intimidate us from enjoying the game. Reading people's comments and seeing how they are truly worried that they might get banned for no reason makes me very sad and quite angry. This has to stop.Good things about the game This game is the best representation of a proper battle royal game by far. The thought and care that has been put into it is amazing for an early access game and this is one of the early access titles I have hope with and I strongly feel it has a chance to exit Early Access successful and complete. There is nothing like playing a squad game with your friends as it is a very enjoyable experience to cooperate with others in order to get that chicken dinner. Solo gameplay is also enjoyable and it makes long range sniping engagements very very satisfying as people don't get knocked out making headshots so much fun!!! The Development Plan for this game also makes sense as they are trying to get the game bug free and out of early access before they start putting a ton of new things. It is a solid plan and the Dev's really look like they know what they are doing.Bad things that dev's need to work on Well as with all Early Access games this one has it's flaws as well. I think that we should be more understanding with server related issues because its an EARLY ACCESS GAME with almost 2 million active players (I think it peaks at 1.7 maybe???) and I can't find the heart to blame them for it. Besides its not even that bad lol just take a look at Rainbow Six Siege servers because that is just horrible. Atleast on PUBG after you connect on the EU server you don't experience lag during the round you are playing. So what the lobby has issues boo hoo hoo deal with it. It should be addressed but I disagree with people who think that dev's are being cheap by not hiring more people on the team and other things like not throwing money at the problem. It just doesn't work like that. Just because they made some buck doesn't mean they should go on a hiring spree to fix all their problems. All in all I would like to see improvements on this topic at the developers discretion. Another topic from what I hear is that our chinese friends are watching ads to play the game that they paid for and that is just unacceptable. PUBG has an obligation to be ad free since they charge 30 euros for it as well as adequate server hosting for the chinese who do make a good portion of the playerbase of this game. Finally the last thing I would like to see on this game is better physics and more fluid animations to make moving alot more smooth.Do I recommend this game? Well if you generally like salt simulators like Rust and DayZ believe in aliens think the earth is flat break your monitor while playing FIFA punch your brother in the face for beating you in Call of Duty divorce your wife because she broke the PS4 and then took the kids I hereby strongly recommend this game for you dear sir.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Inconsistant damage across all guns bad hit box detection as ive been completly in cover yet still died from the other side of the cover (shot through walls basically).The concept for the game is fantastic its a really good idea but in its current state I wouldnt recommend it to anybody just because it doesnt work like its supposed to and before the early access brigade turns up I am aware its early access but the issues ive encountered across several patches have made the game pretty much unplayable for me.So if you like a lot of stress then sure go ahead and get this game otherwise wait until either bargain bucket or its actually finished.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The banning issues are pretty dumb and they ban players to promote streamers and i find that disgusting. but however i'm here to tell what i personally think about the game.PUBG is a pretty solid game but it has its bugs and players who use them to their advantage. when i was fighting a guys inside a warehouse he could see my arm sticking through the wall and could kill me from the other side of the wall. this is just one of many examples. I do love the game i like and do not like the develepores at some point. Hoewer the game is pretty good and i see a lot of potential in the game. I would recommend this game but do not use bugs to your advantage or you will get a pretty solid ban.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-04,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. So I played this game for a couple of hours and this is what I found The game is glitchy as hell and for an asking price of 27 for an Early Access game that is just ridiculous.The shooting mechanism for this game is odd. I still don't know if there is bulletdrop etc because I never seem to be able to hit anything. And I play FPS a lot so it isn't because I am bad. Lots of people have played this for a while now and probably have a better understanding of the mechanism but I don't see why this game needs it to be so complex.I had this game on low settings because my PC isn't exactly new anymore and I was getting about 15 20fps. This is bad optimisation. I have played games like miscreated that had this problem and they fixed it. So it can be fixed but right now it doesn't come close to the 27 asking price.It has a lot of potential but it is way too buggy for them to be asking so much money from people for it. It's close to a finished product price for a very unfinished game. I will keep playing this game and follow it's updates but right now I can't recommend it in its current state. But I'm sure that in a few months it will be in a much more playable format and I can change this review,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would strongly suggest not buying this product! Out of my friend group of about 15 friends ALL of us experiance CONSTANT crashes everyday some not letting us play for hours. Constant lag/glitchy servers and the company has done little to fix it. The game has been released for over 2 months now and there are still TONS of people having problems. It dosent help that the game is so demanding of RAM but ontop of that is just overal not taken care of the way it should be when backed by such a huge community! This is NOT a 30$ game and instead is a game fit to be a free to play! Even with my computers solid specs still constant crashes. For my frineds as well some of them even with new gaming computers. On top of the fact that the fixes for the constant crashes and Terrible servers are few to none The games reward system is lack luster to say at best! I wish instead of releasing a new map they made sure thier HUGE and GROWING community can play the game first.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,285,True,Not Recommended,This game as many will note is most comparable to h1z1 but in its current state can't be seen as a competator. The concept of the game is amazing the attachment and aiming system and shear variety of this game show great potential but it is currenlty let down by a few major flaws.Optimisation I have a 4690k at 4.4ghz and a 1070 ftw and on low I could only push max 100 fps somthing easily acheivable on other games such as bf1 and gta 5. Movement at the moment and this may be on purpose the movement mechanics are very clunky which gives the game a very slow feel to it and can leave you frustrated at time this may be intentional but some may not like itGlitches These will obviously be filled out in the future but there are few known glitches which cna leave the gameplay very frustrating such as getting stuck etc.Control scheme You can only have one key bind per command which would be far more usefull as two small details like hold to ADS rather than click aren't an option which can be very hard to adapt to after years of other FPS games. Furthermore things like trying to sprint out of crouch won't work you have to stand up first doubling the needed key presses to get out of trouble making it far more clunky again.Overall this game shows great potential but for the moment I had to refund it until it gets better in the future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-18,0,0,121,True,Not Recommended,The Creator of the game is a power tripping child. Throwing bans at some people while other people get away with breaking the rules. He focuses more on starting childish arguements on twitter with people who annoy him even when the other person has stopped replying and accepted it's pointless and childish he keeps going. All that aside I still don't reccomend the game. The second to second moments in the gunfights are so inconsistent. When you slow the footage down you see your ammo count go up and down while shooting. Sounds are all over the place. This game caters for coward tactic players and rewards them. The loot is so RNG to the point where you can search an entire house without finding a weapon but the person in the next house down is now fully kitted and coming for you. I have given the game more than a chance to see if I can adapt to it but the play style of the game is so sluggish and boring it is actually hard to have a good time on the game. If you like slower pace games where you basicly hide and wait it may be for you. But if you're after a fast paced action packed game save your money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,1,4,8,True,Not Recommended,"My PC can run GTA V in 4k easily above 60fps.. however this game is SO graphically advanced it runs 25 55fps. It also has an awesome feature that stucks the game in the menu after match is finished. I can imagine how hard is it to optimize these games when you release it in every platform.. oh wait this game isn't on PS4 or XBONE? Well there must be a good explanation why it's so poorly optimized. I love the Early Access games 'cause apparently it's an excuse to make poor games (and ppl will forgive the lags and bugs and crashing) and abandon them after they won't make any profit )People complain about poorly ported AAA games but I don't know if these early access ""indie"" titles are any better. Just play the ing ARMA mods 'cause they work as well if not better.The review itself is a satire of a poorly written AAA review. Don't take it too seriously. Also there is a seed of truth in there. The game is ok idea is good and I hope it'll be something great. But at the moment the fact is it isn't great. Maybe in a paper but not in game and that is what matters to me.I just want to warn possible buyers who are thinking of buying this game thatA it is a possibility that it runs very poorly no matter the caliber of your PCB that it is infact an early access game and there is NO guarantee that they will make the game work or any better that it is atm.C There is a lot of lagging and bugging and probably will be a long time from this day.This is ofc just my opinion and there is already lots of positive reviews so if you like the game there's no point of getting salty of this review just because it's not the same opinion you guys have. If you already bought the game and enjoy it then fine go ahead and do.. But if you haven't be warned 'cause there is a lot that can go wrong.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-08,0,0,66,True,Not Recommended,The *idea* of this game is great but not necessarily new. The execution is fairly poor. The main issues with the game center around the clunkiness of it all nothing is seemless about this game. Picking up loot is a joke half the time you'll pick stuff up half the time you'll inexplicably *not* pick up loot and have to drag the same items over into your inventory repeatedly and cross your fingers it actually ends up there. The netcode is probably the worst thing I've ever personally witnessed in any FPS game. You can be zeroed in on a target 100m away shoot slow bursts whatever but whether or not your bullets hit has more to do with luck than anything else. Shotguns might be the worst culprits. You can shoot a guy point blank 3 times in his chest without any bodyarmor on and he's still standing then in another instance you can do the same thing from 20 yards away and drop them from full health on the first shot.If you do decide to buy my recommendation would be to not take it too seriously because with the issues the game has it's less about being good and more about whether or not you're going to be the victim of some extremely poorly implemented netcode or weird glitches that get you killed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But it is not as advertised.As an early access game it's NOT worth $10 let alone $30. If you REALLY want to give it a go buy it try it refund it if you want.If you're someone like me who likes the idea enjoys the idea and wants it to grow. Don't buy unless you are sure.Yes not purchasing doesn't help the devs but refunding it hurts them even more because that shows.Wait pray and see if it gets better.

Maybe a little lag at the beginning of the game but it gets much better over time. Game registers your shot near perfectly just the desync makes you think you are ahead of the fight when truly it is a second delayed. Coming from H1z1 this is just a way better feel for people who enjoy First person shooters. Almost a call of duty style shooting without the nonsense kill streaks and perks.

Its an advantage for all yes but the ability to abuse is far too great! time and time again in solos you will die to people completely unseen untill the last possible second THEN BOOM he peeks pre fires and youre dead! its not a battle royal if you stand zero chance against camping abusive players. I dont ever see this game as a legit competetive game until there is FPV. it takes less skill to camp behind a rock and prefire from 3PP to get kills than it does to commit to fights and see who wins a straight up aim duel. its not drawing on tactics or skilled aim or the competetive nature if all people do is 3PP camp. Not worth my 30$ to be honest its far too rage enducing when you dont even get a chance to fight you will spend more in replacing mouse keyboards and monitors because of the 3PP abusive camp nature of solos in this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You WILL get killed by someone who was smiled upon by the luck gods who has a kar98 with an 8x sitting in a bush laughing at the poor s who were unlucky enough to have to sprint through open areas right into his sights.DONOTBUYTHISGAME(hopefully the devs will suddenly demonstrate that they have a brain or actually play their game and fix this)Just buy CoD if you want the same deathmatch that it is currently because at least CoD tries to do that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,1,5,7,True,Not Recommended,"Currently the most promising Battle Royale style game available still needs work though.Pros Weapon customization Looks 'decent' When it's good it's goodCons Poor gun play little skill involved (Though admittedly better than most other BR type games) Maybe a rare/one time bug but started randomly taking 1pt of damage every once in a while during a match. No I wasn't being shot especially because if I was I wouldn't only be losing 1 health each hit. No real reward for coming in first (You get a few more credits than normal but buying rewards crates gets exponentially more expensive while the reward money stays mostly the same.) No FOV slider locked at like 60 70 FOV (Unless you can modify the game's .cfg files haven't checked) Poorly optimized (Poor FPS without weird workarounds even on high end PC's) Inconsistent performance (Ties in with last point When it's good it's good but it chugs sometimes) Desync like a mofo (Happens at random can last up to 10 minutes) Hackers? (Maybe? I'll explain at the bottom of the review.) Controls/Interactions aren't always 100% sometimes you have to spam F to pick up something or get in a car. Damage model seems inconsistent (Sometimes I get 2 shot body shot by a UMP9 even with Lvl 2 Vest and Helm or watch a dude tank 6 7 shots from an AKM in Lvl 1 Armor could be tied to desync/netcode problems) Early AccessAlright so to explain my point about there potentially being hackers I use that term loosely because to be honest I can't tell 100%. To explain the sort of things I've experienced I've had people nearly 1 shot me with bear fists (Took over 80% of my HP in a single punch) Plus I've had times where I drop in from the plane not a single player drops in anywhere near me and then 5 seconds later someone's 10 ft away from me with an AKM and Armor. I've also had people run up on me out of nowhere without making a sound among other things. Now is that to say that everytime anything like this happened that it was a 'hacker' so to say? Not really but it's a lot of weird little inconsistency's and strange occurances that I can't quite explain besides just saying ""The game did something weird."" Y'know? Like in the case of players appearing right next me maybe it was just someone who dropped in late and chuted early or something then just drifted in near me without me noticing or maybe the game just didn't render them while they were dropping in I don't know. Then with taking inconsistent damage again maybe that was just some netcode thing like maybe on their end they hit me a few times but on my screen it only looked like one who knows. I'm just sharing some of the things I've experienced so take it with a grain of salt.As per the rest of my experience with the game I would say it's a lot like H1Z1 in terms of the gameplay loop where pretty much the best guns are going to be a 5.56 Assault rifle (Mostly the M416) and a 7.62 assault rifle (AKM) or if you're really lucky a high powered sniper rifle like an AWM. Basically the chances of you winning a game with anything other than the three mentioned guns are very low Similar to the way H1Z1's winning guns were the M16 AK and Sniper.Of course much like H1Z1 Third Person is available and broken although Unlike H1Z1 going first person and actually aiming are mostly your best bet for killing people with precision.So suffice to say I think PU BG does better in a lot of area's where most other games of the same genre fail miserably but that being said it's only marginally better and still needs a fair amount of work. That being said I still don't think it's worth the money just yet buuut it's not far off either to be fair.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-27,1,3,214,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a very difficult game for many reasons. One reason is some of the guns have odd cones of fire and can be very hard to control while other guns are borderline overpowered laser beams to a degree. Second reason the huge number of variables and scenarios that are presented to your throughout each round. Fighting a certain target or running away. Closing in or staying put. Fighting a target or group and mid fight end up having third group crawl up your Using your items you've picked up at the best times which scope to use when to bandage or even help a downed friendly and even being forced to leave him/her. There's so many things that can happen that this list could go on for pages. Third reason other players there's about 100 players in each round and you could run into 1 player... or well over 20 through out the whole match. Some people will SCREAM! and WHINE! about hackers...one thing they haven't hacked they're cheating. The cheaters are the players that you never saw and even then it's no gaurantee that you were killed by a cheater. There are many players in this game that are very good and just as many that haven't ever touched a FPS. It's all skill level and how you spend your time playing and weather you did or didn't spend time learning from your wins and loses will determine how well you'll do. Fourth reason the game is kind of clunky i don't like playing in first person because it's pretty bad but i like being able to aim down the sights in third person. Vehicles flipping do to weird terrain and crashing into something and then the vehicle glitching and blowing up and another endless list of dumb In the end... i've gotten my money out of the game by the hours i've spent playing it and i'm still playing. Fifth and final reason you. Like any game or even real life you have to want to win and figure out a plan to do so. If you don't practice and just expect to win you'll lose everytime. You have to apply yourself to the game and use a certain amount of tactic and skill to win and no matter how hard you try or how badly you want it you can still lose. There's no guartantee to this game. Just last night I played solo died in 2nd place with 12 kills. You're playing to win but you're also playing to have fun so enjoy the game and try your best.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,874,True,Recommended,People from Reddit are spamming negative reviews because they made an announcement regarding crate/keys. They are adding paid crates and paid keys but not until full release (Likely end of this year) for those who are uninformed.The system they're implementing in the same as CS GO and doesnt not provide any benefits to the purchaser. All skins are purely cosmetic. The game needs to have an income to continue support for updates dedicated servers and esports events. Games of this magnitude can't survive for years off inital sales. At the end of the day Bluehole is a buisness and needs to take more money out then they're putting in. If sales were to plummet so would support for the game.Performance updates make the game run better but I highly recommend having a graphics card and processor released in the last 2 years. Even then higher tier/more expensive might still be needed. I personally wouldn't go any lower than a GTX970 and 3.0Ghz without overclock.Gameplay is fantastic very little bugs.

2017-12-21,6,7,49,False,Recommended,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.But one hundred years later the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation America has given the Negro people a bad check a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty three is not an end but a beginning.

2017-07-15,0,0,81,True,Not Recommended,Walked with some buddies. Found a car. Got shot through the back of it 3 times. 10/10 Would do again.____10 hours in____Cons/Pet peeves *Movement and shooting mechanics ADS is toggle and unchangable. Movement speed is crippled. Hold to zoom is useless for spraying even at close range. Jumping is inconsistent. inclines and ledges can block jumps. Movement is clunky and unresponsive. You cannot run while reloading. (but you can spin your head beyond 360 degrees). You cannot run over small ledges. The camera jostles all over the place when proning towards a small ledge (i.e. balcony railing). The character cannot tuck his legs while jumping. Performance leaves quite a lot to be desired. (Frame drops are experienced with even only 10 players in my vicinity frame times are generally not the most consistent). Settings/options are lacking. (Typing in config sensitivity would help) The third person camera side cannot be switched directly. Bullet tracers are either not visible or too hard to see. (I don't know where my bullets landed or what the spread is like) (Tracers impact dust/smoke or any visual indicator would be nice). No practice mode to get a feel for the weapons. Numerous physics glitches (I expect these things to be more polished by full release) Parachuting feels awkward in the final moments before landing (not sure if intended). Sound is inconsistent. (Cars are practically silent beyond 40 50 metres directionality not as good as it can be. Certain elements are easily locatable while others sound like they are just panned to a certain ear). The red dot sight has a prominent glow that impairs the central vision. (my eyesight isn't that great). No first person only servers (AU) Server performance also drops (once every few games). Hit feedback is inconsistent. (Blood sometimes does not show even when people get clobbered by a crowbar).Pros New gamemode concept that is a refresher from the stale CoD series and Battlefield. Promotes teamwork and smart play. Players can either play aggressive or passive letting other squads engage each other etc. Diverse range of weapons including shotguns marksman rifles sniper rifles and assault rifles.*Desired features Hold to ads First person servers Practice mode Improved sound (More use of reverb could help with judging gunshot distance etc.)Overall an unpolished game that has a lot of potential.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-19,1,1,1427,True,Recommended,This game is simply amazing. It's the most fun I have had in a long time playing any kind of shooting game. It has already climbed to my 7th most played game on Steam in a short 3 months. It's intense and even after 240 hours every single kill feels rewarding and every firefight is adrenaline pumping action whether you are playing solo duo or squad. I can only imagine how much more fun this game will get and how many more hours I will continue to get out of it when other games modes come in such as 8 man squads 50v50 zombies and more as well as the First Person Only servers new maps new character customization and public modding. Runs well for Early Access. I don't have any problems at least. I get anywhere from 70 to 100 fps with everything on high. 970 GTX16gb rami7 3930I do play with a buddy that constantly crashes. He has more hours than me in the game though so despite his issues with crashing while playing some matches he obviously still has a lot of fun doing it all.

In addition more equipment should be put in as well as vehicles. Right now the only vehicles you can choose are motobike deca a beatup 4 door truck dune buggy. Yes there are boats but seriously who uses boats? Its a real shame.New issue crates are bugged as are the points. Also for a guy with 1080 ti i should not experience memory leaks but that is what im getting. Thsi devs dont know what there doing but you know thats Early access for youThis game is so unrealistic when it comes to weapons unloaded a sk12 and a m4 clip into a guy didnt die.

2017-03-26,1,4,2012,True,Not Recommended,Tons of desync Blocky movement Hideous weapon recoil Rewards camping Tries to be too realistic ARMA 3 cloneThe fact of the matter is that this game gets dull and it gets dull fast. It was thrilling at first just as any new/shiny thing usually is. But that quickly wears off once you experience the core mechanics of the game. If you're a hardcore ARMA player or miltiary simulation fanboy than this game might be for you. The game is very slow paced and unrewarding. 90% of the time you won't even know from which direction you're being shot from partly due to how poor the sound system is. Most players spend their time in buildings or on hills camping with scoped assault rifles or snipers. The game rewards camping. This is definitely not a skill based shooter. This is not going to be an copmpetitive title or an esport. I give it a month or two before the hype dies down and this game is forgotten.It's sad to see because so many of us wanted so much more from this game and it failed to deliver. Big time.I'm sure there will be many fanboys who try to discredit my review or outlook on the game by challenging my skill or rank. As of writing this review here are my rankings.

The game has major pop in loading issues and extremeley low fps for a GTX 1080 (20 25 on low). Every match i've played has had these problems. Anyone telling you they are playing with good fps or decent graphics are lying there asses off. Majority of players are playing on very low to low just to get a decent fps.All my time is spent playing with friends and family trying to get it to work properly. You can join a match and the buildings or textures will not load for at least 3 minutes this is especailly bad considering having a head start is crucial in this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Its no different from skins/cars on rocket league if you can't afford it then fine it doesnt matter anyway because it has no effect in game other than visuals and im not being funny but this game involves alot of stealthy tactics towards end game I don't think having a bright pink blazer or any of the other crazy vibrant gear you get from the paid for loot boxes will help in anyway what so ever if anything the paid for gear puts you at a disadvantage..

While I do not blame the developers for capitalizing on the thousands of people interested from the closed beta had it not been for the twitch.tv viewership success I do not believe they had planned this short of a turnaround time from closed beta to open release. Precedent has shown from indie game studios that they tend to stop updating / improving games once the cash show is over and the player base begins to stabilize.

Vehicle/Boat operation may kill you randomly. Graphics are subpar for todays generation. Large environment map with random open space between major cities. MUST CAMP IN ORDER TO WIN. Lags terribly at menu loading screen. Takes a toll on GPU/CPU game floads long pathways/algorithms pushing your GPU/CPU max performance all the time. FPS drops inconsistantly.

2017-04-25,12,2,20,True,Not Recommended,I cannot recommend whatever this game is supposed to be (recieved as a gift). When starting a new game you are placed in this crashed air plane zone while a count down timer runs out. After this you inexplicably dissapear and then have your view focussed rather disorientatingly on a flying air plane for absolutely no reason. After some indeterminate time your guy parachutes out of the plane and you can then have some control over whats happening but again nothing in the game explains what you are supposed to do.I landed in a quiet area near an airfield and found weapons no problem but no one was there. A message breifly appeared saying to go to a location in a minute or so which is marked on your corner map but no location is marked on the map so you cant figure out where you are supposed to go.A timer ticks down a 5 minute period after which a fast moving blue barrier sweeps past you much faster than your character can run and you start taking small but regular damage. Again this is for no explained reason in the game. I can only assume this is a terribly early build as either the run speed of characters needs to be increased or the blue forcefield barrier needs to be slowed down. Whilst it is observable that the barrier seems circular it moves so fast and is so massive that it's impossible to know where the centre (where presumably you dont have the life drained out of you) is.In my second play through after 30 seconds of being landed and without having found a weapon a character appeared around a corner and shot me dead in one bullet. This game makes no sense and is not fair if you can be killed without having found a weapon.This game is unplayable as there are no instructions as to what to do or why things happen you can be killed even if you havent had a chance to arm yourself and the blue barrier is clearly broken as it's too fast to out run. I do not recommend at present.ADDITIONAL There is only voice chat in the game which defaults to ON every game. You cannot type messages to players. So there is no way to ask people in game what you are supposed to do if you don't have a microphone and dont want to listen to lots of experience ruining voice chat which in every single game it has been implemented ruins the atmosphere if left on.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In summary you parachute into a russian nuclear wasteland and have to fight to be the last group/person alive. This concept sounds fun but the Island is so big and poorly optimized that you have to put ever setting on low unless you have a 1000$ pc. Also since the island is so big you have to spend 20 minutes trying to find people and end up getting shot buy someone you didn't even see. If want this hunger games style game just buy a COD game and play search and destroy. I guarantee you will have more fun than what you get from this game. 95% of the time you just do nothing I recomend just waiting a couple months for this game to become cheaper more optimized and gameplay wise more fun.

Kill my friend for the fun (the only fun that was had) of it. My other friend (actual friend who doesn't gift me bad games) then kills me. We all laugh. Hahahahahaha. Good friend then wins the whole game. We all laugh again. Hahahahaha part two. Load into a second game this time I take it serious. They all jump out of the plane I don't want to but the game makes me. I want to impact the ground and kill myself but the game wont let me. I loot a house find a shirt. Then a gun. Then another gun. Then another gun and a Red Bull. Then we find a motorcycle (it has a side cart this is the second best part of the game). I do a sick 360 flip on the bike but it kicks us out of the vehicle. Then a car runs me over. Bad friend picks me up. We drive away to another spot and find more guns. Then we drive away again. Bullets hit me on a bridge presumably fired from God or something.

2017-03-23,0,0,503,True,Recommended,"*REVIEW OF GAME AS OF 2 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY AROUND LAUNCH*If you are a fan of H1Z1 KOTK you'll love this EXCEPT (as of right now) the latency of this game is utterly bonkers due to launch hype. I read so much about how much better this will be with latency compared to H1Z1 and so far I'm not convinced (LIKE AT ALL!). I have internet speeds of about 150/MBPS down and 50 up. Since having this connection I have yet to play games where connection has been an issue on my end. THIS GAME NEEDS SOME OPTIMIZATIONS PATCHES AND MAJOR SERVER MAINTENCE! Now before you find yourself saying ""oh that must mean it sucks"" I would like to take time to clarify that NO it does NOT!In fact this is exactly as if Dayz + Arma made a baby and then that baby later had a baby with H1Z1 KOTK....this would be the end product. Its still a little clunky in controls compared to H1Z1 (which reminds me of arma/DayZ) GAMEPLAY Once again this is another thing that needs to be attended to....the rounds are epic in gameplay but framedrop is hideous as of right now. if you're into the idea of having a wide variety of guns and attatchments to give you the ultimate experince...well just go ahead and cough up the $30 rn.

2017-03-23,0,0,128,True,Recommended,my very first game in Battlegrounds i won a solo match. anyway this game is alot of fun. the weapons attachments are excellent. it makes the game so much more interesting. now im sure most people want to know how the game is running performance wise and so far for me everything is running smooth but there are some fps drops here and there and landing a little late with your parchute but nothing making the game unplayable. matchmaking ques are very fast audio seems to be ok for me also. if playerunknown keeps up with his game and he keeps optimizing it making it better and better and not worrying about skins like how daybreak does with their broken a** h1z1. so basically what im saying is if playerunknown and blue hole does the exact opposite of what daybreak is doing with their trash broken dying game Playerunknown's Battlegrounds will be a far superior game over H1Z1. i mean don't get me wrong BG still needs some work but in its current state im still having more fun in Playerunknowns BG. its crazy how much fun you can have when your bullets actually hit your target.....crazy right?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also get ready to experience every type of crash possible.(Edit) I'm not saying this game is bad it has a good concept and I like how it has made a more arcade vesion off the ARMA 3 mod it was based on it already has better gameplay mechanics than H1Z1 which looks to be its closest competitor.

I like the sounds though some people dont the FPS on the main is ok with a few tweaks yes it dips in large towns but its mainly playable if not 144hz super pc master race smooth.Im playing at 4k with a 1080 overclocked to 2100hz so i have the GPU grunt and being 4k 60fps is my limit lowest it drops is 40 45 in the towns not great but playable. (AA is off by the way i dont think you need it at 4k and it frees up the frames)some people dont like the price but ive had my fun for 27.99 in the first week alone and its only going to get better.First week is seeing some good patches (server &amp Client) and good communication from the Devs which has to be a good thing.Very much worth the money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My main points are Pretty solid for EA would reccomend purchasing now as it is a fully playable game just as when Kerbal Space Program was released. There are some issues with rubber banding and lag but I've only experienced that every few games Asia US and EU servers are already implemented Aussie servers coming soon,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Great great great. Three words that describe this game. Is it finished? Of course not but they do not claim that the game is finished so why would it be. It's not in it's full version yet there are still many updates to be released and bugs to be fixed of course. But so far so good the idea and the gameplay I thouroughly enjoy. I would definetely recommend this game! If your worried about not being able to run it there are adjustable settings in game and also other ways to change settings that will help you run your game better depending on your system of course. I use an ASUS gaming laptop (Republic of Gamers) and can easily play most games on high quality. I can handle games like Arma III without lag offline and online I can play with no lag with the graphics turned down a bit. As for this game what isn't a bug and is caused by actual lag I fixed by turning the graphics settings down a tad. Other than that I would say it was worth the $30 to me and if it seems like something you'd be interested in give it a shot and help them out as the more people who play offers more updates and helps the developers get closer to the release of the full version. Great game guys keep up the good work!!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,404,True,Recommended,This game has so much potential. Right now it is a good game but definitely has some issues that need to be worked out. So from what I understand the creator of this game was the one who originally developed the Day Z mod for arma and then licensed out the concept to the creators of H1Z1. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is best compared to these two games and currently is looking ready to take them out behind the barn and put them out of their misery.The guns in PUBG are much more varied than those of H1Z1 and when you fire they just feel better as well. The hit detection is much better and very rarely do you lose a fight where you had the jump on an enemy and it really feels like you win the fights you should and lose those you don't rather than playing a rng game where first person to get a random headshot wins.The customization of the guns is a really cool aspect and really lets you customize your loadout to deal with a great different number of situations you could end up in.The fact that you die if you jump out of a vehicle while at full speed is probably the most satisfying aspect of this game coming from the broken vehicle mechanics of H1Z1.There are issues with picking items up off the ground usually when you first parachute in where you are sitting there hitting the button to pick up the items and the animation is happening but the item doesn't appear in your inventory until the 4th or 5th time you bend down to pick it up.I personally have not had this issue but my friend who I duo with has had an issue multiple times where he will parachute in and as soon as he hits the ground his game locks up and ends up having to force quit.The devs in this game make me hopeful that unlike other Battle Royale games that have released into early access(looking at you H1Z1 King of the Kill) this game will continue to get better and better as time goes on. They are very upfront about what they're working on to better the game and show that they have an understanding of what needs to be improved and how the community is responding to the game.Right now there is an issue where not all CPU cores are being used. This can be fixed using the launch commands on steam. Use USEALLAVAILABLECORES sm4 d3d10 malloc systemCurrently this game gets a 7/10 from me but with optimization and a couple of minor fixes this could easily get a 9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Frame rate went back to like it was in early access hackers haven't gone anywhere sound bugs and desync are worse than ever their INTENDED changes to the game (i.e. the solid blue wall) have only made the gameplay worse. But hey guys you can buy streamer skins!With Blackout coming out in a week a game that's proven itself to be incredibly optimized I think it's safe to say PUBG is going to be just a meme by next year. I have nearly 1000 hours in PUBG ranked top 200 in multiple seasons.... downloaded it the 2nd day of early access. I'm not even a huge fan of the features in Blackout but I'm planning on leaving PUBG behind for it just because I know it's a game that will play well will have an active community and the developers will live up to the expectations of their players. I keep giving this game chances and I'm constantly disappointed.Too little too late. RIP,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bluehole isn't able to fix (or they don't want to fix) this so if you look for BR FPS than go for bo4 or BF .... there gonna be desync too but you wont die from 2 3 bullets.

2018-10-05,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,"This game has given me one of my most two sided opinions to any game I have ever played. It is such a mass of possibilites that keeps failing to show. Again I get some of this will be personal opinion but I cant help but feel bad even after a relatively good game.1. The Lag I have had SO many games become unplayable or go through a once every 3 minute lag that has gotten me killed or caused some vital shots to miss.I don't get this lag in most of my other online games. My internet has been good quality and I have even checks internet checks during lag spikes so it now feels to be poor server distribution. This becomes even more aggrevating due to issue 2.2. The Shooting I love the fact bullets actually kill people in this game. I have always disliked when games like COD or fortnite had people who could become bullet sponges. A pistol shot can still easily be fatal if the shooter takes his time. But this beneficial mechanic has a problem lag and luck can suddenly run and ruin the fun and skill. If you miss a single shot it means the other person can now easily win but many times it is down to a lag spike. Other bizarre issues of power balance have affected me that I can't understand. I have had a game stealthily getting behind someone and putting three shots of an SG12 into a lvl1 armour wearers back and had them panic turn and spray to one shot me with a ump45 despite a lvl 2 helmet. These events occur occasionally and make you feel like nothing you do will even let you win I have put half clips of 7.62 into people who seems to dance through despite blood splatters showing the hits. I often feel it is lag on both my and their parts making the shot appear successful on my end but missing on theirs and it is infuriating.3. The Map Design The many maps are nice and have good altering austetics but have a major issue. Put simply if you love to hid away and snipe (I amn't too keen) then this game is your answer. I have always liked snipers that are balanced in Battle Royale games but here they are just given so many advantages. Every map is wide open even areas of housing foliage forest and mountain are often very exposed and have long areas of line of sight. Anyone who get the snipers early on often cleans house. Most of the times when I end up in the last 15 my death is attributed to someone firing almost a full 20 clip SDS at me from a mile away and eventually getting enough hits to kill me. Nothing is more annoying then putting time into getting equipment fending off and killing other players in what amount to skilled duels only to die from someone a valley away wittling you away. Even if you get into cover they can just sit back and wait to kill you because the map is so open you will likely need to cover over an acre to get out of the line of sight. All battle royale have some luck to add fun and excitement but they should still rely mainly on skill. However the luck of finding a sniper + the power of the bullets + the openness of the map means no amount of skill of the other players part is likely to let them win against someone with a sniper. I have sometimes got a sniper with scope but stopped because I felt terrible as I put bullet after bullet into someone so far away they couldn't even see me and had as good as no cover. The game feels less Battle Royale and more ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and I don't play games just to be some lucky sniper's target. 4. The Attitude This isn't the games fault just a notable part of the community. The whole fun of Battle Royale is to try be the last man standing not COD around for kills no matter what. There are the lucky and annoying auto snipers mentioned before. There are a lot of people who follow you in on parachute just for the hope you dont get a gun first so they can get a skill less easy kill. There are many people who hid in buildings for half the game with an auto shotgun in pre set areas other players can see even if wary so anyone who walks in is almost always eviscerated regardless of effort. There are people who during the final game moments will remain camped in the blue and fire on you wildly with very little chance of killing me plus they areleft so deep into the blue they will inevitably die their only wish being to screw someone else over by giving away their position instead of trying to get out of the blue. These people are in most games but combined with the open maps and heavy hitting weapons of PUBG they add a layer of randomness that makes PUBG feel like the most skill free battle royale to play.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(Just in case).Put short the gameplay is slow. If you are commited enough to play a 40minute match maybe land see noone then eventually get shot in the face then go for it. Its a great game with strategic possibilites. And I do love it. CONCLUSION However it is 40dollars I recommend watching some gameplay before you buy it. And not buying it at all if you live in oceana and have survived the fallout.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's full of bugs and the optimization is even worse than the devs. I would recommend you this game if you don't mind low fps and dying because you couldn't pick up a weapon or get stuck.EDIT Also be prepared for some hard crashes because these ing idiots can't even make alt tabbing right.EDIT 2 Just don't buy this game. Don't give this greedy s more money. If you already have this game stop playing it.

2017-08-07,0,0,1778,False,Not Recommended,"I like the idea of this game its like the Arma 2 modz.What makes it a bit less fun is the way the area restriction works. You just die because your not in the zone and when you atleast survive up to the last minute of the restriction you just have to duel players within a small area.. that leaves players outside instant death.. I would suggest though atleast make it more dynamic for people who are a bit dodgy.. the bombing is nice but the whole moving shield like is just less fun.. why not make it like a mob or zombie horde that will storm that place after the zone.. that way players will have to battle all their remaining life fighting for something instead of die running. I like the idea of looting houses and remains.. this exactly what we enjoy over the time.. but the soonest you'll realize there is not much of a reward after the deathmatch. atleast a medal or trophy could be added into the players status may it something from your notable kill. ""Head of &lt player name&gt "" as a trophy as a result of headshots.. ""Ears of &lt player name&gt "" as a result of melee.. that would be more fun. I wouldnt mind the micro transactions as its a decision on the players side and it'll help the game development also. Overall I like this game. Just add more elements and sure it will dominate the genre. But to be honest this game will die eventually due to abundant cheaters out there.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-09,0,0,258,False,Not Recommended,EDIT 9/29/2018 I decided to re review this game as I feel as if I was unfair in how I reviewed it. And since I want to pursue a career as a video game reviewer I felt this was the right thing to do.So let's start from the beginning yes?TL DR.This game is good if you like semi realism and don't want the cartoony Fortnite style of games but rather the gritty military feel of a fairly decent shooter. However with how there are many bugs still in the game and a rather bad netcode the game doesn't hold a candle to the upcoming Call of Duty Black Ops 4's Blackout mode. Or even Fortnite for that matter.6.5/10.Now on to the full review.Gameplay.The game feels like a mix of old DayZ running simulator with the shooting of Arma and Battlefield combined. There are currently three maps in the game currently and I'll cover them soon but I'll just say that they're fairly huge. Looting feels much better than in the past as the bugginess is gone and replaced with fluidity. However all that looting will be gone in seconds if you don't mind your surroundings or get a gun quickly enough. There is some RnG in this game which makes things unpredictable and that's fine. However the problems start appearing as sounds will frequently not be detected and how the netcode is still a fairly big issue. You'll frequently be killed by a player you didn't hear behind you because too many soundfiles were executed and the game itself couldn't catch up. And with the netcode as bad as it is the playermodel hitbox has trouble keeping up with the actual model. Meaning that you will be shot and killed even if you thought you were secure behind some cover.The Maps.There are currently three maps in the game. One is hated by the majority of the community one is loved and the other is in between. Since its release into the main game Sanhok has been the community favorite as it's not a sleeper fest as Erangel and not as bland as Miramar. Since Sanhok is a 4x4km map compared to its counterparts who are 8x8km. Erangel is the more civilized map so to speak. More towns it's green and has pretty neato landmarks. But it got old to me. Miramar is in a desert large hills mountains and little cover. It feels as if it was made primarily to showoff the vaulting mechanics that came out with the map last year. Sanhok is a jungle based map. Being the smallest things are a little more cluttered and it gives more cover and vantage points. Which is a good thing it makes firefights fair when you exclude the netcode's glaring issue.The netcode Microtransactions and other things.The netcode is garbage I'll say that upfront. It also feels like the developers are more trying to keep the major streamers of the game in the game by giving them their own stuff in the game instead of listening to the community. Anything to monetise their game from within the game. I'm not saying that's a bad thing it's not. It's cool that they're doing this since it adds a connection to the game. However when that is prioritized over making the game better there's an issue. The cases are locked behind monetised keys similar to CSGO. However the chances of getting higher tier cosmetics are lower than the knives from CSGO. There are free cases but the loot from those are even harder to get. You're more likely to win the lottery than obtain a trenchcoat.Overall.The game is slowpaced the tournaments are boring to watch as everyone hides in bushes. But on the flipside the game can be fun with friends and can make some pretty memorable matches. Getting a Chicken Dinner in this game is something that I love even if I don't like the game much due to its flaws.However the nearby release of Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and its Blackout mode is most likely going to kill this game. Most of the major streamers of PUBG will switch over to Blackout making this game's sustenance be minimized dramatically. So I recommend this game if you dislike Call of Duty and don't mind playing a game that'll be forgotten like H1Z1. But I don't recommend this game in general. As Blackout is PUBG but on steroids. Better netcode better weapon variety better everything. So if I were you the reader I'd wait until Blackout on October 12 2018.My verdict on this game after it's long life 6.5/10.Good for a while but will die out after Oct 12.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

From the bad desync to slow molasses like gameplay with no creativity just forget PUBG there's better alternatives on the market now. One alternative I'd HIGHLY recommend that is FREE is Ring of Elysium available right here on Steam. Think of it as what PUBG should have been but much better. It's faster has a more dynamic and varied gameplay thanks to it's packs and the netcode is on point you won't pull your hair out wondering why your bullet didn't land where you shot it.

Graphics look excellent gameplay is fun and heart wrenching and the games are quick so you don't have to wait forever after you die to jump into a new game. Give it another year of development and this game will be golden.If you don't like Hunger Games/ Battle Royale style of gameplay then this is not for you. You'll die a lot (even if you're careful) and the other players are merciless.

2017-12-05,0,0,771,False,Not Recommended,Why PUBG and Blue Hole MUST DIE? It's easy! They make so much money ..but let me explain it first! My first review was a good one. I was so hyped and I made it when it was an early stage of the game. I can understand devs need time to fix problems and make it more playable. It was almost one year ago. But nothing changes after one year! Devs make hundreds of million dollars but still the game is unplayable I'm not talking about cheaters. I'm talking about the GAME. It's broken. Always a problem with connection always problem with the lobby always problem with something. Do devs fix this? No! They just sh__it on our heads over and over again because they not fixing it they just make more money with cases. I understand my comment will change nothing! But who will read it! Plz do not buy this game. Plz do not support the devs they are SCUM! Even all major streamers are quitting of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm very tired of dealing with not loading in games and now I'm completely unable to launch the game. No amount of forums or videos has helped. (no its not an issue with c++.) I'd recommend buying a game that doesn't cause so many problems.

There are studies that show that there is always at least 2 cheaters per game horrible and depressing constent creators that made their own carreer on this game will never give up on the game because it's their scource of money from streams etc...

2017-03-27,0,0,146,True,Recommended,Besides the optimization server side setbacks this is a phenomenal early access game. It's already worth every bit of money I spent on it and I do expect to see that investment pay off in terms of having a load of fun.Between H1Z1 and Arma 3 BR this game balances the two and makes said balance work quite well. My favorite part of the game is how the guns are designed pistols are actually useful and there is an actual variety of guns with non predictable spray pattern and bullet drop. This is what makes H1Z1 suck compared to this game. In H1Z1 it's a battle of who has the most ammo and bandages whereas in this game you have to play your bullets and medical supplies smart and be conservative with health. Running around and getting loads of kills isn't nearly as beneficial in this game thought and tactic are key elements to winning.Other great aspects are downing and attachments. Downs really help out in team modes instant one tapping is incredibly annoying in other games but here it's reduced quite a bit. Teamwork is now encourages.Attachments are a great addition third person play is not as reliable now (which is good hybrid play is always nice) Extended mags and fast reload are somewhat generic but still good to have. You'll rarely face opponenets wielding identical guns there's always something different.Only complaing is vehicles they're a bit drifty and out of control at times and are a bit annoying to listen to. A bit of easier control would be an insta fix for me.At the moment I'd recommend a buy but if you're unsure give it 3 6 months and then see I can foresee a lot of optimization and lag fixing. The developer knows what NOT TO DO with a BR game as well as what TO DO. PUGB is great and a great future is in store for the game. #RIPH1Z1,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-27,0,0,127,True,Recommended,Honestly this is the most fun I've had in a while. I recently bought H1Z1 to give it a try and it gave me a hunger for battle royale. Sadly H1Z1 did it horribly. This game blows it out of the water.Almost every kill feels tactical and precise. No jumping of out police cars and shooting here. The only thing needed is of course optimization which is what the team at Bluehole are working on. Great game and looking forward to the future ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-26,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,Server lag makes this game absolutely unplayable at the moment. Refunding until they spend a lot of time in improving this specific area. Clunky laggy rubberbanding like mad. I'm not sure what broke between alpha and Steam release but it's bad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-26,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I love the concept of this game and I will probably buy it (and keep it this time) in the future. That being said here's why I refunded this game Badly optimized This can be expected of any early access game but it runs like 20 25 on Very High 25 30 on High 40 45 on Medium and 50 60 on Low. And low looks like garbage especially paired with the many graphical errors this game has. Servers are pretty awful Rubber banding input lag and general connection issues plague this game. Yet again can be expected with early access but this really renders the game unplayable. The first two games I played I was kicked after about 10 minutes and then after about 5.As I said before the concept is AWESOME. Something I've always wanted yet sadly this game just doesn't quite do it. It has TONS of potential though and I plan on coming back to it after early access is over.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-26,0,0,271,True,Recommended,This game is amazing so far but remember it is early access so there is bugs but other than that it's great.

2017-03-26,0,0,575,True,Recommended,Impressed in this early access game. It is a lot of fun and it has so much up side. The customization is well done and the map is great.Definitely some issues with hit detection and that can get frustrating at times. Also spectating your buddy after you die needs some major work as he could be shooting a target on his screen but your screen shows something completely different. I would say you should defintely look into this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-26,0,0,66,True,Recommended,This game in its current state would clearly show that it is infact ''Early Access'' due to its unfished optimization and server sided lagg issues. However that doesn't change the fact that the base game in its current state is incredibly fun and immersive. Playerunkown's Battlegrounds has left a pretty good impression towards the majority of the players. I personally find the game a lot of fun immersive and rewarding. Incredibily tactical strategic and fair paced. The gun play seems incredibly realistic and somewhat hard but I personally had to get used to it when I just started playing. I've only encountered two bugs so far one of them was blood spatters on my screen appearing randomly as if I was getting hit by something but I wouldn't lose health. Insta death when you jump out of (slow) moving cars.I personally cannot wait until the game reaches its proper launch state cause the only things that are bugging me right now are the server sided registry and FPS dips issues that the game suffers from. Confirmed upcoming patches and features as revealed during the Twitch stream indicates that the game will only get better from here on out Player created mods E sports Ranking system and rewards for such Community made skins More...PROS Fast matchmaking Large variety of weapons attachments and vehicles Very balanced rewards/weapons/armor &amp vehicles wise Creative (free) cosmetic items Proper social support when it comes to playing with friends/squads Acceptable match lengthsCONS Mildly poor optimization Occasional server lag (US) FPS dips 35 100+ Reward chests costs double with each purchase (resets every Monday) I am fully aware as of their reasoning for the double costs per purchase of crates.

This is a very addicting game (Battle Royale Gamemode) compared to King of the kill and Arma 3's version. Me and a group of guys have been playing this for a few days straight never getting bored of it. There are optimization issues currently but that doesn't take away anything from the game for me. They say updates 2 times a month AND that the development will be completed in a matter of 6 9 months so I am very excited. Once this game is optimized it will be even better.

2017-03-26,0,0,53,True,Recommended,Honestly if you're into battle royale esque games then this is a must have. Currently the game is rather poorly optimized but can be remedied with various little fixes that improve performance. The combat is solid and all of the weapon have so much variety and the map is so large that each play has drastically different results. I recommend this game completely. I would say it is worth the price to support the devs for future improvements.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,196,True,Recommended,The gunplay in this game is unmatched by any other shooter. The optimization while I can get a solid 60fps most of the time on medium to high graphics on a 970 is sub par. There are large frame drops (not below 30) in the parts of the map with more assets. This is to be expected for an early access game however. Another issue I have is if you play with the foilage settings above very low you are at a severe disadvantage. I love how the foilage looks but I can't play with it on if I want to do well. Overall for an early access battleroyale the game is suprisingly stable and the gunplay is exceptional. This game has sucked this past weekend away from me and looks to take many more hours out of my life before I escape its clutches...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-09,0,0,245,True,Recommended,Sometimes i hate this game sometimes i love this game. BUT overall i would say this game is by far the best battle royale type game i have ever played below ill list some pros and cons for people who are on the fence.PROS1. Shooting is pretty smooth2. Updates are frequent ( they have a schedule posted for updates )3. No cash shop until release ( so ive been told ) so dont have to worry about devs sending all their attention to making skins rather than making / fixing issues ( im looking at you Daybreak )4. No car spam cars in this game are pretty terrible in terms of how ez they are to kill so ppl tend to not play it like h1z1.5. Hit Reg on shots is solid far more so than H1z1.6. Wide varity of guns! i hated in h1z1 how there are 4 total guns pretty much.7. Active devs who truely care about their game.Before i make this a novel on just the pros of the game i will go ahead and begin the cons list.Cons1. Can be slow placed if you're use to h1z1 this is most def a different play style sure you can get high kill games but its not a jump out of cars and start slaying people type of game2. Tend to get shot in the 3. Silencers are waaay to over powered4. No real hit indicators aside from sound ( why silencers are broken )5. Jumping out of a moving car ( even if going kinda slow ) will pretty much kill you6. Sometimes Desync is aids.7. The zone was made to screw over pretty much everyone but one lucky guy the rng way it moves can sometimes pull you 1 direction 4 5 times in a row with only like 1 minute to get to the next spot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Only played solo and duo so as of this review I can not state how good the squads plays out.However Solo is tactical and thrilling whereas Duo's can be fun or serious depending on your partner.

2018-09-07,0,0,834,False,Not Recommended,This game has gone downhill since januar 2018. It is amazing how much the speed damage and the variable timing of the blue zone/circle affects the gameplay. 1. Blue zone/killing circle moves too fast2. You can stay on the outside see in and shoot into the circle from the blue zone/killing circle until the very last circles3. The timing of the circle is variable by how many have died so there is no planning or timing possibilities. You can get ed just because 20 guys died in various gun fights4. Cheaters 5. Vehicles got nerfed. They are now slower than they used to be. Even your grandmothers Corolla can do more than 120 if you step on it6. Diving/swimming got nerfed to br&gt 7. Nades was funny/functional in that it moved the person being hit.. that is gone8. Nades do crazy damage now9. Nades can not flip a car/boat anymore. Due to the damage buff it simply explodes10. The circle does not move slower on the bigger map (miramar) which is obviously what it should do. You go on a big map to play longer.. it is not rocket science.11. They nerfed the silencer on the VSS. It is now like a normal ump/pistol in sound level 12. Helmets does not work. Everyone kills (cheaters?) in a single headshot it seems. Not just the sniper rifles which is ok13. No map selection anymore14. No fog or rain at all. Even as an map option/allowed situation15. They nerfed loot on Erangel. And they chanced parts of the map so it became more uniform/bland.16. Loot is everywhere on the Saigon map17. The game still runs poorly Map is not actually called Saigon..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sometimes there are buggs when going in to a house (black snow or something like that starts falling and messes with the view) orther times there is delay with the grabbing of items from the ground BUT those are not game beaking bugs and can NOT ruin your expirience !!!So overall I advise you to get the game yourself and try it out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt flour and cocoa powder stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8"" x 8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled yet delicious mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn t work here since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer making the brownies seem uncooked.)7.

2017-03-31,0,0,501,False,Not Recommended,I wrote a review on this game many months ago and I gave it a thumbs down mostly because of glitches lag and just overall gameplay. Battle Royale style games are the new shooter out there and really it's a game about gambling. You gamble on whether you can find a gun before an enemy can. You gamble on whether it's safe to move positions or it's best to stay put and hold down the fort. You even gamble with microtransactions can you get a rare item to sell or just more junk? I've played this game quite a bit and I think it's safe to say that this game really isn't about skill or tactics. It's about if you are lucky will you come up behind an enemy for an easy kill or will you place yourself in a excellent position where you don't need to move. Will you land and find a good gun or will you land and search 25 buildings and find nothing. It's a gamble!!Speaking of gambles this game is FULL of players camping in fact it's the way Battle Royale style games are played. Oh sure you can run and gun but it really doesn't do you any good if the very next building or location you go someone is hiding in a bathroom or staring at you from a second story window. Another gamble! This of course does not include the huge rise in hackers. That has a many people upset and I understand. Hackers and cheaters can ruin a game in seconds. BUT what can you expect when you create a competitive game with currency that is awarded to you for kills and surviving? AND THEN you allow that currency to be spent on things that can be sold on the Steam Market Place. MONEY is to be made! And the Chinese are great at taking advantage of that. So Bluehole may have created the best shooter game ever but they also created a game in which hackers have the green light to make money. So yes the reviews you've read recently do reflect the rampant out of control hacker issue. It's for sure the number 1 issue right now. I'm not exactly sure how they are going to fix it either. They've been banning thousand of people and hacking is still on the rise! If you are even considering shelling out the cash for this game hold up! Stop! This game has a lot of work left before I'd say Yes Shut up and take my money! The best thing to do right now is put this game on your wishlist and wait! Wait until it finally releases and is no longer in early access. If things haven't improved by then then I just saved you some money! You are welcome!

2018-06-21,0,0,228,False,Not Recommended,While the game itself proves to have everything a BR should have the structure around it makes it hard to enjoy the game. Constant fps stutters generally low fps fps drops lag and cheaters make it impossible to enjoy this game for a longer period of time without getting angry about it. Fortnite and Realm Royale might be fun but they dont provide the gunplay and just the overall FeelsGoodMan moment when you kill someone as in this game. Sadly most of the times any kill you get will be denied by someone lagging through and killing you or your 3 shotgun shots in his chest will not kill him ending up with you dying and being mad IRL.Dont waste your money on this game unless pubg decides to monumentally change the performance of their game which does not seem to be happening in the near future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-21,0,0,141,False,Not Recommended,You earn BP (the currency in the game) by playing the game. BP can then be used to buy loot crate which contain cosmetic items. This is not inherently bad since cosmetics do not enhance your odds to win. The problem is that you have a chance and in my experience its more times than not of getting a crate that must be unlocked with a key which costs real world money and cannot be bought with the in game currency. This is unbelievably gross and shows that the developers priorities money over making the game a better experience. Such practices are common for a free to play game but not a game that you pay for and expect a full experience from. After paying the upfront cost for the game the game then sells you that crates that you ve earned. Also keep in mind that even if you do get a crate what you get inside is random and you may get doubles of things you already own. Overall its just a stingy system from a stingy developer who are making a game for their love of money on not their love for games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,62,True,Recommended,I think this game is going to be great. Not saying that it is great right now is because it is early acces and just recently came out. The game it self feels like an Alpha version. I enjoyed playing this game but just some things aren't there quiet yet. Like the animations is pretty weird and awesome at the same time. I don't really understand the shooting mechanic at the moment either and also that it is pretty bad optimized is also annoying. But as i said i still enjoy it but i don't think i will be playing this game alot until it gets updated and some bugs fixed. But the dev made a really good job i must say and i like the way that you really want the communitys response to how the game should be build in the future. 6/10 (For the moment),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,68,True,Recommended,In its Early Access state I cannot recommend. You'd need a very strong PC to run this as smooth as butter.Pros 1. Fun to play with friends.2. Interesting concept.3. Rewarding when you kill enemies.4. Constant Updates by the Devs are great.5. Graphics have significantly improved well done to the devs for that. I now get aroudn 70 60 fps.Cons 1. Many things like the menu need more work but understandable in its current state.Edward (idLE)'s points (Thanks for the info Ed!) literally cannot assault someone camping on the second floor of a building. experienced players go to the northern part of the map where there's an underground bunker that has a ton of weapons/armour literally doezens of try hard groups in squad that usually have a 'captain' barking orders at their 'friends' literally no skill based matchmaking you could join a round with experts and it will be your first round after purchase. I can't think of anymore right now but this game really doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. I hope there's some genius out there making an even better battle royal arena simulator.At its current price no I do not recommend buying it.

2017-03-23,0,0,25,True,Recommended,The first match had me a little concered as with all new alpha or beta versions of games in development especially when said game is 39.99. To say the least though I was plesantly suprised the visuals were very crisp the idea of finding different attachements for different weapons was intense all the while gunshots are ringing through the streets. I would definitly recommend this game however I do have concerns about the servers when larger and larger groups start to jump into the game will the developers introduce ping locks where a player would be unable to fire their weapons when their ping rockets because if I play with friends in the same server but my ping is 108 compared to their 50 what will happen. So to wrap up I do really enjoy the game however I am concerned about how the developers will handle cheating and how they will attempt to sort through players with bad ping compared to people purposly forcing a laggy connection to win.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,605,False,Recommended,"Read this if you want honest stone cold factsThis review only will solely be about the people that leave negative reviews with these bs reasons (please read in a y tone) OMG there are so manyyy chinese hakers in this game OMG the developers made a DLC that really included only skins OMG the game is soooo badly optimized my awesome computer can only run this gammmme in 50 FPS OMG there are still so many buggggggggs that I dieNow lets get real pubg does still have a lot of problems but these problems are the only thing that these negative reviewers focus on but they drastically DRASTICALLY make readers feels that these things happen much more frequently then they actually do. I will talk about each ""point"" I listed above that negative reviews focus on.Some of these cry babies that leave negative reviews are just triggered when they had one ""alleged"" chinese hacker kill them and say that this happens every day. I have about 450 hours in this game and have met no more than 10 hackers in different games. That seems bad but lets do some math. My average survive time per game is about 15 minutes which means 15 minutes one game. Which means I can play 4 games per hour which finally means I have about 1800 games I have played all together since 450*4. But this doesn't take account the waiting time in lobbies and so on so lets remove 180 games because I feel that I spend 10% of my playtime in the main menu and lobbies.That is about 1620 games I have played which means I have only been killed by 10 hackers in the 1620 games. To put it in percentage 10 hackers in 1620 games is about 0.6% which means that 99.4% of my games were hacker free. Yes cheating is a problem in pubg since one hacker can ruin 99 players' games but there are hackers in every game and the bluehole devs are constantly battling issue.Some hate the new DLC which contains zero content and really only skins which you shouldn't get mad at since bluehole is a company like every other company that ONLY makes games to make money if this wasn't true then there wouldn't be many games to play. Also skins give you zero benifts in the game and only makes bluehole more money that they can use to make this game better with more content. It is literally a ing win win situation and some babies are ing crying. Some say the game is still badly optimized and after every major update it gets worse which is partially true I have a old gpu (760) which can still run modern games at about 80 FPS at medium graphics but It can only run pubg at 65 FPS at every graphical setting at VERY LOW (with some tips from videos too) which is quite bizzare. But in the new map update I get 5 10 FPS more which has been quite satisfying and helped me win my first game in the new map. This is a problem but it is getting better and the ones having the problem with optimization are really people with graphics cards like me or people who think they can run the game at Ultra with 100 fps.My last point is that so many of these negative reviews focus on how many bugs there are in the game. This was true last year but now you really never see bugs. The only ""bugs"" are the game's bad physics with vehicles really which are not ""bugs"" and sometimes weird gun animations that are actually funny. The only bugs that can be found now happen infrequently and are harmless.People who are angry are more likely to leave a negative review than people who love the game. I myself would never really review this game until I saw that the steam reviews tanked to 30% and I just want people that read these reviews to discredit off players that leave negative reviews with t reasons.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-03,0,0,767,False,Recommended,As someone who has played this game for 739 hours i would say its worth it. BUT the big thing with pubg is that it is a tryhard game if you go into a game your expected to tryhard and win with every possible matter which compared to other BR's who focuse more on the moneymaking part of the game Fortnite skins dances etc. When you have bought this game you have all the content for it and you can go ahead and play hours into hours depending on how tiltproof you are. The main point is that pubg is not really child friendly since it has a steeper learning curve than most BR's and you can't master it after 200h i was still a noob and it requires triple that amount to get consistent wins and to perform good. To conclude pubg is good for those who want to invest time into the game and want to be really tryhard sure there is bugs and hacker but there is both those things in every game avaliable no game is perfect.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(But then again this is to be expected this early in the EA. As long as they don't take too long to fix these it's ok)Still I believe it has great potential and even with all these issues it's already far better than its competitors.Worth a shot right now if you're really into the genre and have a good PC.

The game has some of the most thrilling and intense moments of anything I've played. Multiple weapons vehicles and styles of play allowing you to play the game how you want. Want to land with 20 people and gun it out you can do that. Want to land by yourself get looted up and pick people off in cover you can do that. One of the EA games that will actually be fully released no reason not to pick it up!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,148,True,Recommended,This game is great but poorely optimized. With a GTX1050Ti 16gb ram and a 4.2ghz CPU I can only play this at very low settings with 30 50fps depending where I am on the map. Comparitively I can play GTA V on high and keep a steady 60fps. It also screams a lack of v sync. Other than technical issues this game is very fun and I hope to see updates that will fix what I see wrong with the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-04,0,0,257,True,Recommended,i love the theme of this game. there is no storage or stash to carry on from the previous game. the only thing you can earn are clothes to look different. you drop from a plane (F) to eject (F) to open chute and hope you are not dropping with to many others right on top of you. find a weapon and ammo and shoot the nearest player before she or he kills you. now you see where the safe zone is on your map (M) a white circle. loot as much gear as you can find (vest and backpack) increase your storage. and head for the circle. if you are to far out you find a vehicle in a garage or on the side of the road and head for the circle. If you run to an area with a lot of people this can make you an easy target. house to house looting and killing the shotgun and the sub machine guns are best just pick up lots of ammo.out in the open the m16s and the ak assult rifle have longer range (alwasys better with a scope) and for really long range the sniper rifles. make sure you have good ammo for the trip. once the circle is very small back to sub machine gun vector or shotgun. (don't be bashful about using grenades and molitofs. waiting for the server improvements this month and i think we will have an awesome game. so many people have and are enjoying this game there is a very minimal time to wait for 100 players to join. a just a little practice time before the game on an island waiting for the plane.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is poorly optimized and thankfully I run the game smoothly at a low graphics settings. If you like a mix of ArmA and H1Z1 this is your game. Gun play is fantastic many guns and they all act and feel different from each other. I have extremely high hopes for this games future if the developer sticks on working with the game. He has already acknowledged the optimization issues and said that an EST time of a small fix (and more to come) to be April 14 2017 but we shall see how consistent him and his team is. The game is fun and hope it has a long life span. Despite the poor optimization I have no complaints. Try it out!

Don't kid yourself and think that they will give you servers where you live. There is a huge disadvantage having high ping and you won't have a very high chance of surviving late into the game.

2017-04-06,0,0,1614,True,Recommended,Very similar to other Battle Royale games for obvious reasons. A slightly cleaned up version of H1Z1. In my opinion its faster paced than H1Z1 at the beginning. You cant rip up clothes and make bandages a lot less inventory management. You just quickloot what you need and leave the rest. Clothing fast equips on pickup etc. What does this mean to you? You can get into the fight A LOT faster! Compared to other similar titles (H1Z1 DayZ Warz etc...) its a lot quicker to get ingame during connection/ server searching. H1Z1 took over a year to make joining a game quick and painless. Because the game is new there seems to be a lot less hacking/exploiting. Overall you can go from the homescreen to fire fight in less than 5 mins.*** My one grief is the jumping. *** If I could give this game one hard criticism its that jumping over textures or just gaining the proper amount of momentum to navigate terrain is incredibly painful and its caused me to die several times.8/10. Nothing new about it but a polished version of what we've come to love in these deathmatch/battle royale shooters. Jumping needs a fix but otherwise gameplay is great. Perhaps a better ingame graph with stats on items/attachments so players can make a more educated selection but these are available through third party sources online.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-06,0,0,41,True,Recommended,I was sceptical at first when buying this game but i have played for about 10 hours and it is really fun despite its flaws. It is definitely a great battle royal game can could use some improvement. The guns shoot well and feel good sometimes the aim is off though which can cause problems because getting in close is not usually an option. You start by jumping out of an airplane onto a giant map and immediately feel the pressure of survival. I havent gotten more than 4 kills in a game yet but those kills feels grea. All in all I'd give this game a 9/10. One thing to beware though is the toxic community im new to PC coming from console and i dont understand why people even have mics on this game all they do is SCREAM things they heard on youtube and play soundboards! Honestly for me this is the biggest drawback for PC.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,0,0,56,True,Recommended,It sucks to see that the reviews for this game are not as they should and that's because people are complaining about the optimization. It's true though the optimization is not good but i feel that people should be writing reviews about gameplay and not about how their $2000 computer can't run this game at 90 fps at all times. I feel that while I play this game I feel more tense VS H1Z1. This game is a lot slower paced and you won't be searching for fights like H1Z1 players do you will actually find yourself trying to stay unnoticed by enemy players and this game does require strategy. One of my favorite things that this game is that as a newer player you can make it to very high ranks. I made it to third place on my 5th game and I still did not know what I was doing half the time I went with the flow. Overall I think this game is fantastic and it will beat H1Z1 anyday for me. Once they get this game fully optimized I will be confident that this will be a excellent game. All the players will come and protest that they perfer it over PUBG but it is all about preference. If you like fast paced games and want to get into the battle royale genre play H1Z1. If you like to take things a little slower and maybe you like Arma games or the DayZ mod and you like to think about what will be the best plan of attack PUBG is the way to go.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Frustrating laggy and unresponsive. Getting killed by laggy players from who knows where who are practically ivounerable (i guess because of their ping) is happening all the time. Almost every game you die behind a wall for unknown reason. Replays are absolutely useless. People shoot to the air in spots where i have never been and i die ( if they aimed at a spot where i was running from i would understand that there might be some dellay but i got killed by a player that was aiming 2 meters to the left of me and i was comming from the right. I've never been in a position that he shot at). People get hit in the head by Kar98 and live. Even on replay my aim is on point but this trash game is just so out of sunc that it doesnot count theese hits. PRO TIP Do yourself a favor and dont watch replays.But when the game works and bullets actually fly where you aim and ppl actually get hit when you shoot them its pretty ok. 1/10 for tragic networking,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,263,True,Recommended,Great game and most importantly easy to play.I was sick of mods making groups passwords launchers and generally anything that meant I couldn't get involved in the the first minute. I was a staunch advocate of A3 KotH but even that feels put on a shelf right now. Couple of gripes with the weapons I'm either a very bad shot or I'm firing into a sponge but you can't have your cake AND eat it during 'Early Access'.Could be better optimised and does have some of those cringeworthy animations of the horrid DZSA but it's been a pleasure so far overall. Audio is accurate in game but trashed in spectator mode but maybe that's intentional to stop collusion?!Technically you will need a higher end PC to play it without issue. But there are tweaks and guides to help those with lower end systems. Expensive at 27 GBP but cheaper than a night in the pub!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Concept is interesting. VERY poorly optimized to the point where driving vehicule can lag down to very very low fps. I also wasnt to crazy about the flow of the game where you have to move to get in the circle but you almost have to camp to kill people or otherwise you get killed without even knowing where from. In the 8 or so games I played 3 times only I knew who killed me. and two times was only because we parachuted on the same exact spot and they got a gun before I did. Rest of the time is WTF just happened..At least have a replay to show who killed you and where he was for the last 5 10 secs....this would not only give satisfaction in understanding what killed you but also help you learn the game by perhaps seeing what others have success doing. As it is a loss feels mostly unrewarding as you do not really learn anything from it. Anyways its fun enough but I did ask a refund and will keep on my wishlist for later if it gets optimized.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-31,0,0,362,False,Recommended,This game used to awesome. It was a nice place away from all the little kids who play Fortnite and the community was pretty cool (aside from the occasional talking and loud pregame lobbies).This game is going downhill fast though. It started with the introduction of loot crates. You used to just earn the loot crate with in game curreny/purchase and then open it immediately. Then they slowly replaced each loot box behind a pay wall. Then they introduced weapon skins you could buy and sell on the community market. Now they have released an Event Pass which is unbelievably similar to Fortnite's Battle Pass with the tier progression unlocking a different mainly cosmetic reward.The game itself is still fun but if Blue Balls keeps adding this crap in it's just gonna be another royale game in the shadow of Fortnite.Edit This game has gotten a tad better with the introduction of a new map but the microtransactions still need to be halted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,18,True,Recommended,I'm not normally a big fan of early access/survival type games but this game does something right. It's tense fairly well optimized for what it does and has solid mechanics for early access. Latency can be an issue sometimes but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the game. Playing at 1440p with a GTX 1070 and getting between 40 60 FPS rarely drops below 40 and never under 35. My issue with survival type games is the amount of time it takes to enjoy them battle royale is the perfect mix. It's slow but fast paced if that makes sense I can jump in a match before work and quit with no issues. I'm a huge fan of Arma and you can certainly see the inspiration this game takes from that. It doesn't feel like a cheap knockoff rather a refined version of a fun game type. Can't wait to see this game's development over time and look forward to many hours of fun. If this is what we get at the beginning stages of EA it can only go from good to better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,294,True,Recommended,Good game. Better gunplay than Arma 3 mod by far. Games are quick so its not incredibly dismaying if you die early on. Wish customization was more implemented than it is i.e. gun skins vehicle skins maybe even tattoos. Still pretty fun its optimized like a better DayZ so its laggy even on a borderline supercomputer (1070 and 4690k 28gb RAM) but still playable (lowest I get on ultra is 30ish and 60 max as expected).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-06,0,0,1189,True,Recommended,Wow what a game. I rarely find a game that gives me an adrenaline rush like this (see alien isolation). I've always been a fan of horror or RPG games that put your survival at stake. This game takes this to another level with a realistic MMO PvP fest.PUBG could become that itch that I'll never be able to stratch if they fix their netcode. I never want to have another experience where you run behind cover and think you're OK but the server didn't update so you're actually dead. Of course this is an EA game so if your dont want to be frustrated don't shell out the cash. Wait 6 months for the full game (their promise not mine). I can only hope this game is as popular/revolutionary in the future compared to what they've achieved now.To whomever reads this 7/10 current experience. We'll see where it ends up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-06,0,0,74,True,Recommended,It is what it is.....This is the better version of DayZ and exactly what it should have been. The gameplay is great and the lessening of zones forces players not to camp. It is a Early Access meaning it will be buggy and it does freeze. For me it freezes about 20% of the time and can get annoying. There are some frame rate drops here and there but again its Early access.....Expect thatGame itself is very exciting and quite fun. There is not much more than surviving 100 people game and hope to see more extras and goodies that we can add on. $30 is a bit steep but is fun enough.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-21,0,0,818,False,Not Recommended,I would recommend the game if they didn't turn the good map into a 1 in a million hit rate and didnt make the vehicles impossible to drive the game was good I would have recommened it but all you do now is run around a desert for 15 minutes with no action then get shot in the back of the head. That is the majority of the experence. This is solved by putting the orginal map back in rotation because it is smaller so the oppurtunity for engangment outside of early game is good and if you get shot at there are trees and things to take cover in and have the chance to fire back.I think they fixed the hacker problem but made the most fun part of the game (vehicles) suck they used to be good for traveling and sheilds and running people over now they are a coffin on wheels with vassaline for tires really only good for involentary suicide and accedentally running over your team mates.way to up an enjoyable experence.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So I splurged on this game gave the developers 30 dollars and was greeted by an unrelenting slew of technical problems and crashing that makes it almost impossible to play this game without getting a brain tumor. Seriously I have technichally ""finished"" a single game in my almost 3 hours playing this game only because I fell to my death after crashing into a cliff on the way down. My specs go far and beyond the minimum requirement. Everything is fine. Every other game runs with ease. But Battlegrounds just isn't finished at this point.The developers need to step up their ****. Seriously. 'Cause I can understand a game this broken when it's in early access but if this goes live and it's still this cluster****ed it will fizzle and die. I am not the only one having these problems. Each and every one of the three people I know who bought this game have been crashing and crashing and crashing again. What's more the developers of this game don't care. The forums have about 100 000 people trying to fix their game and 2 trying to help them. It's madness. Do not buy this game yet. Wait then buy.

2017-06-08,0,0,31,True,Recommended,I don't review a lot of games but I feel compelled to review PUBG. The gameplay loop is incredible. Unlike other online shooters (ahem CS) where you get killed and have to wait until the round ends and start over PUBG gets you right back into another game withiin a few minutes. Whatever happens in the session you were just playing in is of no concern to you because you're right back in the action more or less immediately playing a fresh game.While you're playing nearly all of your senses are engaged. You're listening for footsteps and distant gunfire. You're paying attention to the direction those sounds are coming from. You're peeking around corners. You're holding down ALT and looking behind you while you're running looking for enemies. You enter buildings ASSUMING there's someone in there already waiting to ambush you. Even with this heightened level of vigilance you still jump out of your chair when you get shot and you didn't expect it. The game does need a few improvments. Opening and closing doors can be clunky. As can getting into and out of vehicles. There are times where a 2 foot fence can slow you down when you should be able to get over it with ease. Worst of all players with poor graphics cards or those who are willing to drop their graphics quality actually have an advantage by turning down the setting for foliage. I think we all want the game to look it's best and having to turn down a graphics setting for a tactical advantage seems pretty flawed.Problems notwithstanding if you like online shooters you should be playing this game. It is pure elegance in simplicity. Pavlov would have been proud of PLAYERUKNOWN. The minute you get an electric shock from being killed you get another food pellet by getting back in the game in less time than it takes you to run to the bathroom and back.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-16,0,0,470,False,Not Recommended,Let me list in short the reasons why as a UK player at least you should not put up with this game.Servers are trash. You will never ever get the reponse times when looting the reg when shooting that US players do on their servers because as per usual UK players are forced to play on garbage servers on mainland Europe with horrible tick rates.The graphics even at max settings look bitty and unpolished the recently added sharpen feature makes me feel like it's peeling a layer off of my retinas.The Miramar map is absolute garbage.The Sanhok map is ok but nothing will beat the original map.The looting is horrible. Open 10 buildings find 10 shotguns 3 SMGS and 7 pistols somehow miraculously always encounter somebody else who landed on top of a Kar98k with a 4x Scope despite your permanently terrible luck.The mobile version of this game is astonishingly better at all of the above apart from the same garbage maps.

There are so many gameplay stories shared among friends and as a squad. The quick time to kill looting sandbox MMO aspects and stellar gunplay make this game a must have. There is an amount of suspense at all times which I haven't felt replicated in a game for me in a long time. One moment you are running through a town SEAL Team Six style to next taking a road trip halfway across the map engaging in vehicle to vehicle gun fights to next laying prone in a field of high grass lobbing frags afraid to stand up because there are 12 left alive in a very small area. The sheer amount of excitement when you chicken dinner demonstrates how special winning matches become. Currently at 100ish hours played I've won 7 squad and 2 duos. Each one a special moment.

Bluehole doesn't have the server capacity nor the developer capacity to compete with companies like Epic when it comes to crafting a polished product. Yes we were aware that Alpha ended in 4th quarter of 2017 and we realize that there are going to be some growing pains involved but it gets ridiculous when loot crates and skins take precedence over bug fixing and snuffing out cheaters.

I hopped on after months of not playing hoping for a change.....but no. Still broken...as always. The network is not well optimized even for folks that have decent connection the network causes too much delay so other player always get the upper hand. Second this game is a hayday for hackers can't even enjoy the game because ol single shot freddy shoots you through a mountain from across the map facing the opposite diretion you are. Third when you do get shot at you have no idea what direction it comes from so it makes acquiring a target harder than my d*** in a strip club. Just total crap. Make a different mode bluehole.

2017-04-15,0,0,209,True,Recommended,My first Battle Royale type game. It's excellent! The game is relatively simple in concept and raw content amount but it's full of tension and utilizes game mechanics superbly. It's what a game should be. It's simple but addicting and fun.My complaints are rather standard. Playing on one map(albeight a huge one) can get repeatitive. The game periodically stutters and hitches even on a PC with a powerful CPU and a rather strong GPU. It is a VRAM hog and I feel like it would use over 4GB of VRAM if I had a GPU with more. In general it doesn't run as well as you'd expect it to. 60ish FPS with a mix of ultra/high/medium looks good enough. Also getting into cars and opening doors or anything that involves the F key is a struggle. It's slow and unresponsive. Other than that excellent.

2017-04-15,0,0,19,True,Recommended,I do recommned this game just not for me. Love the concept the ease of getting into rounds the fact that rounds are relatively short (relative) and the way the game generates tension. Lots of people are having a blast with P Battlegrounds so there's a nice big population right now. The deal breaker for me is how quickly they funnel everyone into a single killzone during a round. I mean I get it...if not the rounds would last way too long and that's not what this game is about. But at the same time that's not fun for me and is really altogether immersion breaking. If there was a little more time to explore to scout and to strategize I could enjoy this game much more. But again that's not what the game is about and I don't fault the devs for what it is. Anyway refunded but that doesn't mean I don't think it's great at being what it is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I enjoyed the game design behind DayZ and BR for ARMA yet never purchased it because of the poor engine optimization.Bought H1Z1 a year after release but uninstalled it in summer of 2015 because of the obvious bad hitreg.As a CSGO player and Pc FPS gamer since 1999 this game is the first game to properly mesh the features associated with ARMA with constant developer support tactics of CSGO and the ease of finding a BR match like H1Z1.Game has a obvious high skill ceiling. Newcomer FPS players will struggle. Arcade FPS players will need to adjust their playstyle to be more tactical while learning spray/recoil patterns. CSGO and ARMA players will need the least amount of adjustment.Edit Since early access release the game has had struggle after struggle to retain basic server side performance we experienced in closed beta. In its current state this game isnt worth the money.Game is approaching one month since being released in early access on Steam. Entire month has been the developers bug chasing releasing patches to fix said bugs then causing worse bugs in the process.Their ETA to full release is September'sh. Game will probably be ready for full release in March of 2018 that will take another year or two of further development to be in good condition. SOmething that will be extended further for once the Pc version is fully released they begin work on their console release.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-29,0,0,156,False,Not Recommended,Although the game is probably the best battle royale it has some really bad flaws. The game has a really bad tick rate at the beginning of matches. Which means fewer game state updates. Which makes the start of any match hit or miss. This game uses common game engine design practices when it comes to view distance. Less detailed lower polys further away. More detail closer up. Which means when you think you are behind cover you aren't and still get shot. The exact opposite is true directional sound. Locating enemies is easier further away than it is up close. Up close it is all mono. If you do get some directional que 50% of the time the gunshot from the right sounds like it came from the left. The sounds you make versus the sounds you hear. You are louder to enemies than you are to yourself. So you have no real idea that you have even been detected. Walking across a floor sounds like you have tap shoes on. A 500 lb fat man would make less noise under the same situation. Gun play. They are trying to go for some realism with the guns. Which really just makes some guns pointless to even have in this game at all. The ARs are way too inaccurate for thier real world counter parts and SMGS are way to accurate.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-27,0,0,290,True,Recommended,OK. Finally leaving a review after playing for about 3 days.First off if you like the literal heart pounding adrenaline rush that you experience in H1Z1 DayZ etc then you will enjoy this game. I don't think you can directly compare vanilla DayZ to any battle royale game but the the adrenaline rush I get is essentially the same.I was a fan of King of the Kill for the first several months it was out but I got bored with it. I'm honestly not sure what PUBG has that KotK doesn't but there is something unique about this game. I've never played Arma but I know a lot of people say there are similarities. If I had to guess at what makes this game special I would say that it has to do with the fact that you really have to create your own strategies for how you respond to different situations in game. When I first started playing I sucked. I still suck pretty bad but I'm getting better. I'm getting better because I keep playing it and I keep getting killed. But every time I get pinned down and flanked smoked out of a house with a molotov and shotgunned in the face pop up from prone to take a clean shot just to have another prone player to my side headshot me I learn... And as I learn I slowly get better. If $30 won't break your bank then you should try this game. It runs better (for me) than DayZ and H1Z1 on their best days. It has a great selection of weapons and gear the vehicles are great and the map has incredible character.Also if you have freinds you can play with this game is awesome. Solo games are way different than co op but they are both very fun.I just won my first solo game (though it isn't showing it in my stats for some reason). I look forward to hopefully winning more in the future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Play get points buy a crate with points only to still be locked which requires you to PURCHASE a key for $2.50. BTW this is after grinding points for a solid 2 or 3 hours to get your first crate (Unless you win). Oh and now after an update they want you to BUY a PASS for additional mission rewards?! WTF PUBG?!

Pretty much what this means is that moment in a game where you feel like you were in cover ot ran around a corner and two seconds later you still somehow die from the other guy because on his screen he could apparently still see you. Also this game has horrible damage and is inconsistant for the guns.

2017-05-04,0,0,133,True,Recommended,I have never seen an early access game with so much momentum towards being a fully released game. It caters to slow and fast paced gameplay depending on when and where you drop on the map. The gunplay is satisfying with lots of gun variety and attachments to compliment them. I feel that at times especially at the beginning of every game the game can feel choppy when trying to pick up items but it smooths out as the game goes on. The sound is probably where I feel the game faulters if there are too many sounds going on from the airstrikes and gunfire going on everything starts to sound choppy the plane noise at the start is way too loud. The dev's have addressed the extremely loud lobby noise which is great but gunshots in the lobby can still sound choppy. Great game worth investing early access but I really do recommend playing with people that you know because between solo and duo gameplay feels like two different games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-28,0,0,1066,True,Recommended,Haven't had a game get the blood rushing and the heart racing like this in quite some time. Your Battlefields and COD could learn a lot from this. I dont recommend Early Release games ever but i will with PUBG. ITs just fun Gives you plenty of options to suit your style from Stealth to the finish boxing match starts or snipe your way to a chicken Dinner. Developers seem to be making the game their way and not pandering to the very vocal usual crowd of Nit pickers which is a very pleasant change. Pro Awesome heart racing fun Looks pretty damn good as well.Cons Has bugs typical of a early release (Getting weekly AND monthly big updates so not a big thing).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,354,True,Recommended,Great game very much like H1Z1 King of the Kill so if you love that game I would recomment getting this one.The weapons are excelent and rather accurate.The idea that you start of on a lobby island to then spawn in a plane and parachute down to the location you choose on the planes path (which is randomized each match) is a great addition rather than the simple random spawn of KotK.Graphics are great I have found there ahs been some issues regarding lag i.e. I was trying to enter a jeep whilst my team mate was in a buggy and I just couldnt get into it on my screen it drove off by itself... don't know whats going on there lolAnyways at it's pressent state I would give this game a solid 7/10 I see this game only getting better and that score raising over time.To get some gameplay footage check out my youtube )https //www.youtube.com/channel/UCrACsHijNazq5Spj56nZ7hA,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,44,True,Recommended,PUBG is a Battle Royale game much like H1Z1 but I wouldn't compare the two they play quite differently to me. H1 is fast paced while this game plays a bit slower. As of right now the game's performance is very bad which is to be expected from an early access game. The movement is also very clunky as of now. Along with the servers lagging very bad I don't think the game has east coast US servers which H1Z1 doesn't either. But I like how the game plays and I would recommend the game. Is it better than H1Z1? To me yes and no. It really is down to your preference of what type of gameplay you like.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-28,0,0,376,True,Recommended,This is my first of these types of games and I love it. The gunplay is so solid and well made though I don't know how any others could compare. Its very intense when you're trapped in a house by a player thats running around outside with an AKM and throwing grenades through the windows and you only have a 1911 with a measly 3 rounds left. Coming out victorious in a situation like that makes you feel a level of accomplishment no other shooter can. Personally I don't think they even need to add or really change anything. Just polish the game and optimize it and I would be happy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I was skeptical of this game when it first came out I said ""Oh another Battle Royale game for Twitch's massive armies of trolls can throw their underwear clad bodies at you and show off their ability to turn the gain all the way up on their microphones. After picking this game up on a late night spending spree in the Steam store I cannot tell you how wrong I was. The game is so simplistic and fun on a primal bloodthirsty level. Every instance in the game from the moment you jump out of the plane to the moment you are inevitably stopped cold by some bozo's 12 gauge is more tense than half of these self proclaimed ""survival horror games"" can do as a genre in 10 years. Not to forget Mr. PlayerUnknown himself who offers frequent and useful updates and we all know how lazy developers can ruin an early access title. It's nice to see a game with a nice foundation finally flourish both comercially and spiritually.

2017-06-26,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,I want to love this game and one day I feel certain that I will. But not yet. I KNOW it's early access. But the developers seem to be concentrating on new content and the upcoming Xbox One launch rather than optimizing what they've already got. I cannot recommend the game in it's current state and unfortunately they are making the optimization process harder for themselves the longer this continues. In short there seems to be a strange set of priorities in the development of this game. Which is a pity because it could and should be spectacular. It's a real shame when this much potential awesomeness is falling short. On the other hand if you have a high end PC you should be able to get a decent frame rate. Maybe. And I doubt that'll clear up the glitches. But a quick look around Twitch shows that the game can be played and looks great! It just needs a fair bit of work to make it accessible to more gamers.

2017-04-27,0,0,87,True,Recommended,Ok So lets try to help people make up their mind shall we?You are obviously here cause uve seen streams or youtube videos of pubg right?Let me clear sth for u out.Unless you are president trump on his whitehouse pc or a nasa engineer your game wont be as smooth as those streamers or utubers.You will probably be like me.Be like john u will play with 45 fps your game will lag AF when u fall down from the airplane u will have to play on all low (so game wont be smooth and pretty) and hope for player uknown to keep updating the game(which he does) and give you a very nice perfomance patch.But lets talk about cons and pros.Pros You actually have a LOT of ways to win/play the game which i think is really good since u dont have to be the badass 500 fps guy killing 50 people to win.I actually won so many games by just playing the zone right and killing when its necessary so theres a way to win even if ur not a crazy fps player.The guns are spray patterned so theres a huge difference between even the pistols.Loot system makes it fair and random for all people.Love the scopes make you have to take decisions.Lots of vehicles.Cons Its a living HELL if you got an avarage or bad pc.You wanna play but u cant its like bein teased from mia khalifa.Still a lot of hackers .You may get DCed randomly.You may freeze in game for 2 sec at the worst possible momment.You cant mute people 90% of the times the game starts and you wait for ur fall from the plane people are screaming in their mics so u will probably get deaf soon.No deathcam.Would i reccomend it? Yes. Would i to a normal pc yet?NOOOOOOOOOOOO...Dont buy it if u got a normal pc YET you will end up addicted to a game you cant play.just wait for optimal perfomance and then GET IT and become the next battle royal king.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-29,0,0,164,True,Recommended,"Instead of writing a review I'll tell you one of my experiences with this game. I found a pistol an assault rifle 4x scope and a stun grenade with some ammo before making my way to one of the farms north of my position. I saw four people land there earlier during my parachute drop. As I approached the farm a car parked outside. When the driver stepped out I took a moment. ""Do I shoot him?"" I was well hidden in the field so I decided to stay unnoticed for a little longer. I crawled my way slowly towards the farm but when I was next to the pathway another car drove passed the farm and was going straight my direction nearly running me over! Luckily he didn't notice me or decided to leave me be. As I got closer I saw the driver from earlier who was sneaking about enter the farmhouse. After a few gunshots it went quiet. Someone was inside.When I snuck around the farm house I checked the player counter. ""58 left."" I am going to be in the last 10 I told myself as I too entered the building. Ground floor was clear I moved as quietly as possible since you can hear everything in this game which is amazing. I heard some movement upstairs and grabbed my pistol before switching to my stun grenade. Seven shots before reload better make them count. Once I positioned myself below the stairway I threw my stun grenade up onto the second floor went for cover and after the initial explosion I sprinted upwards. There I was greeted by a shower of bullets but my stun grenade worked he missed! I quickly aimed for his head and after a few good pistol shots he was down...I won. Time to reload and check his equipme ""Better luck next time!"" Was the message I read seconds later after I was shot from behind pumped by a shotgun. 50 players left.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I seem to be getting used to the K/M set up and have put 30 hours in.Super tense gameplay made it into a few top 5's and many top 10's. Don't go into this expecting a fast paced action shooter. It's slow and methodical which is why I like it so much.Frequent patches and Dev updates are greatly appreciated too many EA games just get thrown out to die and it's nice to see a Dev stand by their work for once.Excellent game in EA.

2017-07-10,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,So this game is great. It's the coolest shooting in pretty much any game I've played the sound of gunfights around you is amazing and the ambiance is so stressfull it's a blast.And I can get over the various bug and glitches which honnestly don't happen so often. I can get over their constant push for cosmetics and lack for progression without further investment.But the sad thing is that firefight are few and far in between. In the meantime you only have a sub par looting system and okaaay movement system. The most of the time in you game will be spent working with these and they really don't do justice to the game.So that's mostly my issue. Most of your time is spent playing an empty and boring looting game. There is nothing interesting to do not much objectives to go after.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-21,0,0,87,True,Recommended,"Let's cut to the chase Do I recommend this game? Yes. But not in its current state.This game is incredible and the most fun I've had in any form of shooter in a good 7 years. But is a task to run. My PC isn't half bad (specs in Bio) and I struggle to run this on the lowest settings. Now I know it's early access and the devs update this game often which is amazing. I commend you for that P.U )But if you have a PC similar or less powerful to mine don't purchase the game just yet. Wait it out a little longer until a few little performance hiccups are sorted.The gameplay itself is slow to begin with. Around 99 people are dropped into this massive map almost as big as Arma 3's ALTIS map. You're ALL unarmed and must scavenge for Arms and Armor in nearby buildings and run to the PLayer Zone which is a zone the players must play in and shrinks every 2 4 minutes. This zone is bordered by a blue wall of lighting and if caught in it you slowly take damage that will increase over time the longer you're in there. The last player alive wins the game so a safe ""out of sight out of mind"" playstyle is highly recommended as the weapons kick like mules on full auto making single fire and bolt action your best bet at hitting anyone that isn't close enough to unzip your trousers.There are also Carepackages that can drop randomly during the match usually containing stockpiles of ammo rare 8x and 15x Scopes and even weaponry that can't be found through normal means such as a M249 which acn really give you the edge in a prolonged firefight.So to finish this I say buy this game. But only if you have a good PC. I myself struggle for 50 80fps with constant microstutters and no V Sync is present in this current build. PUBG is an incredible game by the original creator of the Battle Royale and cares deeply about making this game as good as he can. The only thing I will say is wait a little longer for the very few performance hiccups to get sorted )EDIT After the recent update the game is allot more stable. I now get a good 70 100 fps with extremely rare drops ) If you have a similar rig to mine I now recommend picking this game up!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's got so so much potential. For the love of all that it good though you gotta show me where the hell I get killed from. Playing this game so carefuly just to have yourslef shot down and have no idea where from is absolutely soul crushing. You heard the shots were close but you looked around everywhere before you moved and saw no one. I get that it could provide an advantage if you were playing with friends and maybe you could tell them where they were. If you are in a squad though and a shots are fired your team will be able to respond to the audio so its not really putting anyone at a disadvantage.

2017-04-29,0,0,832,True,Recommended,"Pretty fun game. I think the genre is ""battle royale"" and I've never played a game like it before. I kind of wish there were more modes or perhaps smaller maps or something but this is an early access game and it still feels pretty good to play in it's current build. The develeopers keep pushing out bug fixes and updates to balance and whatnot so that is always a good sign. Hopefully they find a way to get rid of the running grind because I find it absolutely atrocious. You will undoubtably spend more time running in this game than you will fighting other people or probably even looking for items to use. So beware of that I guess.However for $30 I think I would wait to a bit more things come out before picking this up.

Instantly queue up for another game no loss and instant fun again.The devs are CONSTANTLY updating and watching the game and hearing what we have to say. For an early access game this is BY FAR one of the best there is out there.FPS and optomization are constantly being fixed and even thought its barely been out its come VERY VERY far.There is still a bit to go for patches and the devs have been keeping their promises with that.10/10 I highly recommend this game for everyone.

2017-06-18,0,0,128,True,Recommended,I typically don't review games but I feel this might be worth my time.The concept is great the idea is there but the main gameplay mechanics are not fluid at all.Firstly the gravity in the game is very awkward. You dont jump high enough for it to be low grav but you definitely don't fall fast enough for it to be regular gravity. The gravity of the game makes all the mechanics feel extremely sluggish. The core mechanics shooting and walking are far from perfect depending on your system you can/can't see people that other players might be able to see. Looking down the side is still extremely buggy especially if you are indoors prone or against an object such as a rock or tree.The friends/players menu is completely broken people will be online when they're not stuck in parties or you simply cannot invite people for not explainable reason. Lastly please add a dedicated grenade button no one will use grenades until you can toss one without losing your gun for several seconds. That being said the game is still playable and fun if you're in a co op setting with friends. Can't wait to see the final version of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-18,0,0,282,True,Not Recommended,I've been playing this game since shortly after it was released on Steam. The game always had its problems but they weren't game breaking and besides it's early access. It was still very playable and extremely fun.That being said it's actually comical how broken this game is in it's current state. Virtually every time I attempt to play the game now it gives me a new error that almost always reslts in me just exiting the game. It's kind of impressive how difficult it is to actually play a game without some new error popping up ruining the experience. I'm not being hyperbolic. Literally EVERY game I try to play it crashes for some random reason. And no it's not just me. I play with a friend and he suffers the literal exact same issues. Yes I do have the proper PC specs to play the game.Not to mention the sound errors. I set my mic to always mute and apply the changes. Doesn't matter everyone around me can hear me. The microphone settings change every time I relaunch the game. It's incredibly frustrating because it completely gives your position away. Combine that with the ever present desync intermittent rubberbanding embarrassingly inaccurate ballistic damage profiles and you have a game that is basically a scam at this point. I don't know how they can accept people's money in good conscience with a game this laughably broken in so many distinct ways.When it does work it's a fun game. But that's basically never. Please fix your broken game. The fact that they're working on new maps rather than fixing the basic mechanics of this game sounds like a cruel joke but it's true. Until the game is actually playable don't buy it. It'll only bring you frustration.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-18,0,0,138,True,Recommended,This game is basically H1Z1 made harder to run but with a lot more to it. It's a lot more realistic however it still contains glitches and bugs. The fighting aspect is way more advanced than H1Z1 and I love how they included attachments in this game. Looting can be inconsistent but it has a lot of teamwork involved. This game is a great game to play with friends and will live up to what it is made out to be. Without a doubt I recommend this game to anyone who likes H1Z1 but also to anyone looking for a multiplayer shooter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,5,True,Recommended,"I played it a bit and thouroughly enjoyed it and inted to continue playing.The sound in the game is great. You can hear gunfire and vehicles at reasonable distances and tell where they're coming from. The gunplay with the weapons hasn't presented any problems and the variety of the weapons is good for what this is and where it's at. I can't speak for the models or textures as I have to play on very low settings for now but hopefully soon I'll be able to get a good look at things. It's a fun game model delivered in a way that's easy to enjoy.However I just have a few things.1 I would really appreciate if after you died it at least pointed the camera at who killed you if even for a moment. It's pretty frustrating to survive until the very end be prone in a bush looking for people and then a few snaps and you're dead and no way to verify and say ""oh that's where he was"". At least in solo games. I can understand how that could be bad in duo and squad.2. I sincerely hope the currency system in the game does not turn into microtransactions.3.

2017-04-29,0,0,574,True,Recommended,I love this game. It can be very fustrating at times with loot spawns not always giving loot. Or not having time to loot because you got to push to the circle. But this game scraches an itch that Battlefield COD and even Arma cant quite reach. The no respawn quick pace of the game (but it can also take a slow pace if you dont need to push the circle) trying to reach a gun before the guy next to you does just fills me with adrenaline every time. Have about 40 hrs into it at the time of this writing and I cant get enough.

2018-06-20,0,0,205,False,Not Recommended,This game started out great and back when i started playing I would have given it a 10/10. I'm going to start with the pros since I feel I owe the game that. Great Replayability Every match runs different some games you drop and get all lvl 3 gear and great guns other games you spend the whole game fleeing and seraching for any sort of assault rifle. Some people don't like this aspect but it forces you to be creative and adapt which I find quite enjoyable. Looks good The graphics and the maps themselves look nice Contantly working to update their anti cheatNow we move onto the cons. The game was originally about and for the players. The game had loot crates but these were for looks only ( The way loot crates shout be ). spend in game points to get crates and open them for freen half the loot crates now require keys to open and keys must be purchased. 26mb update every day but never fix anything ( We are constantly getting updates in the game but the real issues are never fixed. China is not region locked This causes so many issues and I cannot count the number of times I had poor connection because of their lack of region locks. game frequently desyncs you will be shot around cornners through walls and other impossible ways. when you die your bullets stop doing damage. if you are killed/downed in the time that you bullet has left you gun and travels to your target the bullet no longer does damage. this causes numerous issues when in cobat and you are downed and then your bullet hits the guy adn he should also be downed but instead they now get to kill you. They promised new maps and take months to put them out. They do not meet their own set deadlines.At this point in time I would not suggest this game for anyone. THe company has lost sight of the originaly game they created and are now more concerened with trying to sue other compnaies and games for coppying them even though all their ideas are stolen as well. If the company can get back on track and start focusing on the game and the community again I feel that this game can thrive and grow expenentailly but at the current rate of things I wouldn't be supprised to see this game completely dead within the next 2 years.

If Bluehole had focused on fixing the problems with the game like cheaters and the chinese community in general things may have turned out better but instead Bluehole felt like sueing their competetor Epic games because for the reason ""We are worried that fortnite may be trying to replicate the feeling that PUBG is known for"" which is an absolute bull reason.

Sure it is not well optimized but I am content playing with low graphics on my current system as this game has not only spawned a host of other great games but it executed well in the beginning all things considered. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT THOUGH IS EVENT MODES. I love the 8 player mode and grouping up with a bunch of friends and not being so limited by party size but for some reason PUBG Corp keeps deciding to do a Deathmatch mode. Don't they realize that if we wanted deathmatch we would play Battlefield Call of Duty or some other AAA title? The shooting mechanics and graphics are fine but when you compare it to Battlefield... It's just not as good. The hardcore team work focused unique game mode is what makes this game awesome.BRING BACK 8 PLAYER EVENT MODE! THROW AWAY DEATHMATCH!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-27,0,0,165,True,Recommended,Honestly this game is fantastic. For a game in Beta I've never had such a great experience. Rust has been in ALPHA for years and years and here you have a game that came out in March that's in Beta and shoots Rust off the charts. As much as I love Rust being a loyal player with over 460 hours I do think this game is amazing. You may think that these two games are nothing alike yet they share a similar concept the PvP aspect of listening is VERY Rust like. The community on this game just like any other PvP adult survival game has a community. But no matter because if you have friends to play with you have something to laugh at.You should 100% get this game. It requires some basic PvP experience though and it goes without saying that you need to play with someone. Solo is brutal and though it may be fun it get's boring if you don't have friends to play with. Once you do you're in for a treat.Good luck sickle slice and crack people!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-19,0,0,389,True,Recommended,I usually don't recommend Early Access titles as they have left a bad taste in my mouth (ARK Survival Evolved) especially. But the team behind PlayerUnknown's Battleground has delivered what I personally consider a remarkable product for an Early Access game.PROS + Dev team constantly keeps the community updated+ Weekly updates focused on bug fixing and optimization+ Monthly updates that include new features weapons and/or game modes+ Graphics are visually stunning for a Battle Royale game+ A whole lot of fun to play with friendsCONS Game has a tendency to lag on it's own after playing for a few hours and needs to have a full restart in order to run smoothly again. Some delay between performing an action and the game actually noticing the event triggerIn conclusion I highly recommend that anyone interested should acquire PUBG while it is in early access and work with others to help create an amazing final product. The price is also most likely going to go up when the game leaves Early Access anyways so best to buy it when it's expected to be lower.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-05,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,"*Go down to my quick edit first instead of reading this review. My opinion has changed overall.*I have almost 24 hours in this game and loved every second of it but the issue of hackers is a big one. In the past 3 5 hours I've already had to report 4 people because of suspicion of hacking. These people aren't just your typical ""good at the game "" these are the people that have numbers and letters as their name e.g. 01480 wlk1995 06020wea etc. Wlk1995 was a hacker that nailed my friend and I with 15 shots each in 2 seconds with an SKS. For those that don't know an SKS is a sniper rifle that averages about 1.5 2 bullets per second. That's a huge difference of fire rate. I really wish I had recorded the footage but sadly couldn't because my hard drive is out of space. This huge issue aside PUBG is a great game and its core mechanics are phenomenol but because it's still in Early Access all of it is still subject to change. As of the current state that I'm writing this review I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is into the Battle Royale genre. What I love the most about this game is that I feel compelled to queue into any game mode whether that be solo duo or squad. I love the weather change and I love the fog weather (I know I have a much different opinion compared to the majority). I still don't think that the prices of lootcrates should double every purchase though. Instead they should be a flat rate but still retain the same weekly cycle for which crate you get. In all honesty this is the game that H1Z1 should have been but still have their ""arcade y"" feel to it.If you don't have a PC that can run this game yet then I recommend saving up for one if you can. This is definitely one of the first games that you should test run your new rig with because of how empowered you'll feel when you get in a match.I won't lie if you're not familiar with Arma H1Z1 or those other big map/clunky mechanics games then this will be a new kick to your tastebuds. I can say that I recommend this game but with slightly gritted teeth. The only reason why I'm hesitant is because of the hackers that will show up every 3 5 games. You'll struggle you'll rage you'll quit but when you get it down you'll have fun. Good luck Tenno.EDIT I no longer recommend this game because Bluehole has made microtransactions and cosmetics as their main goal instead of fixing the core issues of the game. Such as optimization net code server issues etc. I personally think that the game is DYING (not dead) and the steam charts reflects this perfectly. Until Bluehole can give their consumers the game that they deserve I think this game is a pass. You may as well enjoy many other Battle Royale games out on the market right now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-24,0,0,261,False,Recommended,This game is good. There is definelty high points and low points to this game like how when you kill pople and win with your strategic plaining and advanced thinking. And really the only Low points to this game is just not finding people and most of all the D synk! That is really the only thing that really needs to be perfected before this game is ready for new maps guns and vehiclas. I love this game! I have no problem with the things that are added but then agen I would rather see a more polished game. I like the gameplay. I like all of it. just little things make this game either unplayable or just dificault. Now I had this game back when if you had a 8X and a Kar98 you win the game becuase of how rare the 8X was. Witch is what i feel like drove away many players. But now if you get your hands on a Kar98 and a 8x its nothing.

2017-07-24,0,0,237,True,Not Recommended,best skydiving simulator 2017 gotypart where you land into hordes of people with miltary gear was an interesting twist.Its a solid game however.Legit cons though 1. Latency.There seems to be a major trend with people going to higher ping servers to take advantage of the netcode. I am one of them.While I have a lot of fun on my local servers that for me is a compeditive but survival enviroment but nothing makes you feel like rambo more than going onto another regions servers and legit running wild though the streets with handguns and shotguns and taking down people with level 3 armor and the such.If you ever think that you just can't pull off the impossible stuff you see in streams and videos even though you're a decent gamer chances are that's likely the case.Unfortunately what this means is even having a decent connection to your local servers might be putting you at a disadvantage. I really hope they sort out the netcode issue or maybe even a max ping system.2. Hackers. All games have hackers and while there are some occasions where they can run rampant in other games in this game the minute you have one you have a very small chance of getting anywhere. That said hackers get banned relatively quickly the only problem is the game is so cheap its quite possible just as Dr Disrespect demonstrated to ban evade.3. Dev team starting to really show cracks.First off the head dev seems to be going on regular banning spree's of dr disrespect for team killing and people complaining on the forums about hackers and other things. I personally have not experienced it however there are a few threads out there with legitamate claims and more than adequte proof that its going on Also I've had friends that used the Reddit and the Pubg forums to ask questions and have learned they are a place to quickly get banned if you have a anything that borders on a complaint.4. Sudden decision for monitization This game has apparently sold 5m copies at an average of 29.99 a copy. needless to say that's over 150 million in just a few months. Shorter time than the years it took Star Citizen took to get its 150+ million. However they need to put some crates out because you know we gotta pay their way to go to gamescon? What. They have a TINY dev team their expenditures on everything but servers would be horribly low yet even though they made big promises about not doing anything like this until after release here we are about a week off paying out money for a lot of empty promises.5. At this point more promises than substance Remember though its early access.They have promised already a new map a vaulting and climbing system a zombie mode availablity on consoles and wait for it ipads? wtf? Also none of this stuff has actually arrived they just say that they are going to be doing it next patch and then nothing actually comes of it. There's a lot of intentional misinformation and hype being pumped up about the game. We're on the fast track to a bad situation. Only buy if you enjoy watching the world burn. I sinscerely hope I am wrong and the years of experience I have seeing this stuff happen is about to be shown up because I legitimately at this core love this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-09,0,0,101,True,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS This game called ""PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS"" is a very good game it's like ARMA H1Z1(without the moneygrabbing) and DayZ.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a quite laggy game but that is normal as this game is very new.GamePlay Alot of People like so called meme's. this game has alot of players and it is full of fun do you not like to play as 1 but with a squad? CLICK SQUAD! and you get matched up with 4 randoms (unless u already got 4) the graphics are ""good"" not the best but it looks alot like H1Z1 this game is not that ""buggy"" but sometimes you find a little bug (1/1000 unless you are looking for them).Optimazations/How does it run? To run this game on ultra u need quite alot of power i currently am running everything at ultra on a GTX 1070 and a I5 4670K overclocked to 4.4Ghz.i get around 55 62 fps average (depends on were you are).Players... Most players here are memers and as you know can be a little toxic (not toxic like LOL but a memers toxic)The players are great most of the time your squad has a mic and makes play how2win but u end up dying in the redzone driving in your car.Conclusion I would highly recommend buying this game if you like H1Z1/ARMA/RUST/DAYZ Also Please support the dev's by buying the game trough steam (not the gray market) and u can also try the game for up to 2 hours (Steam Refound policy).i highly recommend buying this game! i in my opinion rate it 8/10 1 sometimes the game crashes 1 needs more optimazation like RUST (i get 80 144 fps on ultra average",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-08,0,0,89,True,Recommended,This game is FANTASTIC! Brilliant game idea design and execution. There is a slight learning curve as you have to decide what playstyle YOU prefer and learn to play it. Do you jump asap? do you wait until you are forced to eject? will you rush the high loot areas and hunt other players? Or do you get TF away from everyone else and sneak your way to the final four? My personal favorite is exploring and finding areas that few know about and fewer visit. It's up to you! The game can be frustrating at first but once you start progressively reaching higher places it becomes a delightful expreince. Still having trouble after your first few hours of gameplay? Get some friends and squad up! playing with a group is what some players need to excel!

The gameplay is amazing and with a mountain of updates coming its way I can say PUBG can survive the ""I bought this early access game and forgot about it when it came out"" ordeal. so should you buy this game?

2017-05-12,0,0,92,True,Recommended,I'm going to recommend this game even though it still has some problems in the current state.You will need a medium to high end GFX card if you really want to enjoy it. Do not expect a reasonable experience on a low end GPU. I have a GeForce GTX 750 Ti which is barely middle class if at all and the game is actually too laggy and too slow even on low settings. I guess a 1050 (or comparable AMD card) is necessary for a good experience.Other than that crashes are frequent and sometimes you will desync from the server which will make it pretty much unplayable. These are issues that I expect to be resolved while the game matures.The game itself is fun if you can tolerate long periods of grinding camping and looting with not much action followed by a sudden death (usually) or triumph (rarely). There are plenty of streamers to watch on Twitch in order to find out if this type of game is your thing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-12,0,0,40,True,Recommended,This is the first time I have written a review for any game so take it for what it is worth.The main reason why I am writing this review is to say how awesome this game is. Keep in mind that it is early access so there is some work that needs to be done but as it is right now its a great game.I was a little hesitant to get into DayZ or H1Z1 just because of all the negativity revolved around those games which was unfortunate because survival PvP games are my favorite. I haven't played many simply because people who play them typically ruin the game and it was hard to find out that leveled the playing field but still made it intense and fun enough to play. I personally do not use any cheating software and I have no idea how to get or have any desire to but I feel like this game does have some cheaters in it which is very disapointing.Besides that the game is really fun. With it only having one game mode I keep finding myself going back for more but I can only play 2 or 3 rounds every time just because you invest so much each time you play which I love!! You really have to think during the game and try to anticipate the other players moves. I saw a guy block one of the bridges to cross with vehicles and I was impressed that people come up with in game strategies to gain an upper hand. If you use outside sources to cheat then I wish your PC will spontaneously combust cause you ruin it for everyone else you low life.Over all the game is a great platform that levels the playing field for all players and its up to how skilled you are and some times how lucky you can get. I haven't played the game multiple times and each time there is a different out come or I go a different path. I highly recommend this game and this is why I wrote this review because I felt that I had an obligation to testify to the greatness and simplisty of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not only is the season pass more expensive the developers continue to push locked crates on its players while similtaneously ignoring the community demands to improve on any of the major issues the game has. When PUBG came out it was only popular because it was the first of its kind. There are so many better options out there heck even Totally Accurate Battlegrounds which is a parody of this exact game is better optimised. On top of that TABG has developer feedback something that PUBG sorely lacks.

2018-06-06,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,I learned about this game long before it became popular. I used to play DayZ BR back in the day so when this game was announced I was immediately interested.Once I found out it was releasing to early access I was hesitant. I made the mistake of buying DayZ Standalone Rust Reign Of Kings and countless others on early access. All of which left a bad taste in my mouth. I waited for about a year before buying this game because I figured they would have added a bunch of new content in that time frame.What they actually did was added lootboxes and gimmicky cosmetic stuff. They did add new guns and two new maps but the only map that feels different is the newest one because it's much smaller than the others. The new weapons just change the meta everytime and it practically makes all existing weapons completely non viable. Nevermind them taking the time to finish the game polish bugs and genuinely exciting new content or anything that tangibly adds value to the game. They like most developers decided to go the greedy route and try and milk more money out of this game. The cherry on top of this is they decided to sue Epic Games because Fortnite is doing VERY well despite being a free to play game. I've only played 4 hours of this game but I feel like I've done everything it has to offer. Drop here either die or kill someone run around for a while and either win a match or lose. I don't feel incentivized to win because it's not exciting to win. This game is very luck based too it's not like other BR or survival type games. DayZ mod for example. You spawn on the map and pretty much any rifle you find can be viable. Theres obviously weapons that are way better but you could kill a fully geared player if you're smart. In this game the only time you can really kill with terrible weapons is if they have nothing.Finally the community of this game is toxic. Toxicity exists in all communities but it's especially bad in this one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I loved playing it with my friends I loved the sheer pvp battle royale mechanic and I loved how it could get my heart racing. I hate writing a negative review for it but I'm truly hoping that it will help bluehole see just how off it's customers are. I have not been able to enjoy this game since the release of sanhok which in my humble opinion is when the game went from a slow downhill spiral to a complete jump off a ledge. Just to list off a few examples of why I am giving this game a bad review.Let's start off with the overall bugginess It is laggy I experience desync on a fairly decent rig running on good internet especially when running with friends. I usually have to quit my first match due to it freezing to the point of running what i would approximate around a quarter of a frame per second. Even when I try my graphics on the lowest settings I'm still lucky to achieve a stable 30FPS. Not to mention not being able to connect to the servers that are ""too busy"" despite PUBG running the lowest number of players it's seen in a while. Next let's talk about the devs There are so many cheaters in this game and bluehole refuses to fix it despite the fixes being seemingly simple. Bluehole launched a ""Fix PUBG"" campaign around 2 months ago. What a ing joke. It has only gotten worse. The final nail in the coffin that really solidified my opinion.... Loot Boxes.

Optimization broken promises senseless and dumb content and many more things I'm sure the creators are exhausted of hearing about.

I heard about fix PUBG and thought maybe I could try it again for old time's sake but once as the game crashes and even fails to start on my high end gaming computer I am once again disappointed by the outcome of this game and no progress. Maybe one day the games that are released will be actually finished and perfect. I used to remember when the price that one paid for a game was worth it.

However the problem is the game rarely goes well. Theres numerous reasons as to why this is the case. When BlueBalls does do a decent patch where things are relatively stable it doesn't take too long for them to it up and make everything Other basic glitches that have been around since May of last year are still there such as the forced down push when jumping from crate to crate. Desync is still a major thing ranging from a minor annoyance to complete ery thats utterly game breaking at times. I may not know how game development works in detail but for a game that made over 600 million in sales while in early access for these issues to still exist seems to me to be completely ridiculous. As if to spit on your face after already kicking your repeatedly while you're down blueballs then decides to start pushing their t crate system hard. I have 37 crates that I cant open because it costs 2.50 per key to open them. Because its random I cant even use BP to buy the free crates. What kind of utter lunacy and t is this? I get a chance to get some skin that I cant even see because I only play first person mode. I recently bought rocket league and then bought a bunch of skins. I see one I like eh whats 2 bucks and I buy it. Why not do that blue balls? Positives Can be great fun with friends.Firefights can be very intense.Getting that chicken dinner is so satisfying.Game actually looks pretty good. Negatives DESYNC. DESYNC. DESYNC. My biggest complaint. Lootboxes Cancer. The zone is often times straight crap. If you're on the out edge when it decides to close youre often times ed. Have fun running for 2 min to get into the zone manage to heal and then have it close on you again and leave you in the dust as it travels again to the corner. Then when you finally make it in using your 8 first aid kits someone camping the zone line will kill you. No trading. As in bullet trading. If your bullet is midflight and you die your bullet does no damage. How and why is this a thing? The slowest rolling vehicle is a highly trained ninja assassin that will one shot you. The recent change to helmets and headshot damage is ridiculous. A level 1 helmet is destroyed with one shot. A level 2 helmet is destroyed with 2 shots. And youre dead as well. I understand headshots hurt. They should be rewarded. But so often you die from 70% hp because someone got a lucky headshot while spraying you. This didnt seem to be an issue until about a month or two ago. All of a sudden everyone and their moms are landing headshots. Im not sure if the hitbox changed or what. Either way dying from 70% hp to 1 shot while you have a level 2 helmet on is ridiculous. The audio is horrendous. Someone will be about 25 feet away from you and their footsteps sound like their about to grab your shoulder. Cant judge position for because of it. After playing the new map I cant go back to the old ones due to the low amount of loot. This is supposed to be a battle royale yet it feels like for so much of the game all your doing is looting so you can actually heal up after a fight. The game isnt supposed to be a post apocalyptic survivor where all youre doing is scrounging for basic necessities yet thats what it feels like far too often. Also make sure your pc is top of the line if you want any sort of decent of fps.In conclusion this is a fun game if youre willing to put up with all the t that BlueBalls is putting out. It is however rather frustrating and still broken. Dont let the lack of the early access banner fool you this is still early access quality imo. Personally Im hoping for the Black Ops Battle Royale to put this game into its well deserved grave. Maybe then BlueBalls will manage to get its head out of its and do some major fixes instead of adding more t skins we dont want or need.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-07,0,0,593,True,Recommended,This is one of my favorite games. It takes everything good about Battle Royale type games and concentrates them into a single game with frequent updates. The physics are great the visuals are great the sounds are great. My only significant complaints are regarding content. I wish there were more game modes than just those regarding team size or singles (you can chose to play as a 1 2 or 4 man squad). If there were some different game modes or other goals in game (like a more plausible reward system as the current one is too demanding and very under rewarding) then the game would be a lot better. My only other complaint is about freezing in game which even with my beefy system tends to happen a little more often than I'd like. It's not game breaking and it doesn't happen all the time but if the performance can be a little more polished by official release time that would be great. The start menu also needs to be fixed as the game essentially reboots after almost every match.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is my first kind of battle royal style game and although I need a lot more practice I am loving this game. The learning curve for a n00b like me is quite steep but it certainly doesn't stop me enjoying it. There are some bugs etc but it's EA so I would expect some issues.

My ONLY gripe with it is the performance. I cant seem to run it past 30 50 FPS despite PC specs however Its still a ing amazing game. The idea of it is really generic but its executed so well. Its the same map every time and the same weapons but the map is so large and theres such a large skill disparity that no two matches will ever play alike. Every single choice you make matters and plays a huge part in everything you do. All of the items you get from crates are strictly cosmetic. Theres no P2W at all.

2017-06-25,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Despite thte amount of praise for this game along with the reminder's that it is early access I would NOT recommend this game. It is FULL of bugs. The sound issues are endless. The FPS is inconsistent even on a good rig. It is laggy. It reminds me of Second Life with the glitchy movement and clunkiness of gameplay. Even if by some chance you get it to work for you and you encounter someone expect hit detection issues. You spend 10 minutes gathering gear and traveling only to encounter bad hit detection once you come across someone. Game over. If you have never actually played a good game before then sure this game might be ok for you. The standards are clearly set very low for those that praise the game. Don't buy the hype. The developers will be the same as the other games that promise improvements but never deliver. AND as of right now 3 months since it's early access release it is still as buggy as it was since release. Save your money until they bother to work out the infinite amount of bugs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,1364,True,Recommended,Addictive! Adrenaline rush every game even after countless rounds! Can't wait to see the further development of pubg. It is going in a good direction at the moment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-25,0,0,76,True,Recommended,So to start with Ill cover all 3 game modes as Ive played each one for a decent period and have a good amount of kills in each mode.Single Basically your typical battle royal but it feels complex as you dont have a team or partner with you to help in guinfights.It is challenging and really fun.Playing this by yourself is a good way to sharpen your skills.Duos In this you have to not worry about yourself but your friend too.You are twice as deadly now and you also can both help eachother in finding gear.But when you are shot or hurt you get downed which can give you a second shot.Teams This is hard and you will die most likley.Strategy is key and if one person is careless then you may kick the bucket much earlier than youd like to.Essentially its like every battle royale but has more features.The zone is cool and I like how close it can get.The range in this game is good as there are hotspots all over the map but you can still get good gear in houses.The attachments can give you a very unfair advantage like the suppressor.Overall its really fun and expands upon the battle royale scene more so than say H1Z1 or Arma.A general summary is that its fun with friends but gets more complex.Id give it a 10/10 for a battle royale and a 8/10 for a normal game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-25,0,0,394,True,Recommended,This game is a life eater. DO NOT PLAY IF YOU NEED TO SLEEP EVERYDAY!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-25,0,0,400,True,Recommended,When a person first buys this game and you play a couple matches you will truly learn what fear is when you hide in a room and listen as the sound of footsteps and opening doors comes ever closer. You spray your gun and just watch as all your bullets miss due to both fear and lack of aim skills. You eventually die and step away from your computer to breathe as your heartrate slows down. Those were my first 10 (or so) rounds in solo. I've played alot of games in my life (Halo Series COD Battlefield LoL Dota CS etc) and this game has beaten all of them for me in terms of inducing heart rate. (Except maybe the first time around i played Halo 1 and had to drive the warthog off the Halo ring with a time limit I was 4 and it scared the out of me.) Once you get past the fear and heart attack inducing games you start to realize how incredibly this game plays for both fast paced and slow paced players. Fast paced players can easily have the option to jump into high combat start zones and slow paced players can head to the edge of the map. Once you get past the looting stage of things decision making and correct management of meds/zone control are what decides the good players and the bad players. If you are a fast paced player head to the zone immediately and try to kill people coming into it. If you are a slow paced player decide your correct moment of entering the zone and the angle of entrance. In the end proper management of the zone is what will decide your fate of winning or not. Duo's and Squads Holy The things that happen in this game for both duos and squads is something that every group of friends has to experience. You will truly be amazed by how fun and tactical this game is if you have even just 1 person to play with. The playstyle of solo's and duos/squads is vastly different and it can lead to some incredible matches. TL DR I paid $30 for this game. And it may be more enjoyable than any game i ve ever played. Honestly with the amount of time and joy i've gotten from this game i would have paid $100 for it. It's truly that special.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-14,0,0,367,True,Not Recommended,This game has some of the worst bullet registration in the entire sphere of online shooters. The netcode cannot handle simple registry with guns that are encoded to do certain damage values. Multiple times stronger guns such as snipers fail to do more damage and register that damage than a simple rifle or SMG. You might as well not value loot and just enjoy being a random idiot running around because you are more likely to obtain more kills. This game really has not done anything to revolutionize the deathmatch / king of the hill / last man standing gameplay and has only created increasingly more bugs weaker netcode and larger amounts of people that take advantage of said horrible coding. Honestly if your system is worse you are likely to get aided by the awful coding and networking. While I understand there are limitations I would have thought that offering this game at a premium price and having such large amounts of sales would have at least driven the devs to attempt to fix these problems instead of throwing more useless features that do not take into account the mountain of awfulness that they are continuing to ship out.

Don't even bother shooting at anything but the head you either one hit kill your enemy or he one hit kills you.5 out of 10 times your gun will fire plastic pellets that bounce off of the enemy and do no damage 9 out of 10 of the times your opponend will one shot kill you through several walls. There is no poing in single firing just hold down the left mouse button and hope that the desync hits your enemy while he's behind cover it works for me. Every action takes 2 5 seconds making simple things like going through a doorway a gamble will my guy get stuck in a rock? will my guy hit the wall and take 15 seconds to change direction?

2017-11-22,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Update as of 27/08/2018 I'm a part of the Australian playerbase for PUBG and I regret to report that the active player base on our servers (OCE) is struggling at this time. Additional maps and modes along with a general drop in player numbers has significantly increased match making times especially during off peak hours. Many Australian players will recommend that you play on other international servers but I do not see this as an ideal solution due to the decreased network performance from playing on oversea servers. I'm going to leave this review positive as it is more of a meta problem with our playerbase rather than an actual issue with the game but I would not recommend any Australian's purchase the game if they wish to play on Oceania servers.A One Hundred Player 'Last man standing' First and Third Person shooter in which you are dropped onto a large map to gather weapons ammo armour and other supplies in order to survive against your competition.

The game is very rewarding and extremely damning at the same time.. Dying after you've found full loot will crush your soul... but getting a chicken dinner will make you feel like a god!

2017-06-18,0,0,391,True,Recommended,(Check the Hours)So in the beginning I would of considered this game done even months ago. It was already at a better point than Day Z was. With That Being Said It's gotten WORSE Since Initial EARLY ACCESS. Updates that constantly go backwards With the Following Constant crashing between me and all the people i play with for NUMEROUS different reasons ALL THE F'N Time. Clipping Issues Reward Boxes Not Showing Up Lobby Disconnects Leaderboard Issues BACKWARD PROGRESS since the release date.(I play Solo Due and Squad and by far Squad is the most troublesome because you have 3 4 people with seperate issues trying to start at the same time Such a Time and NIGHT WASTER)I own a ps4 (I know I'll get hate From all the kids who can afford 1 System so they defend the ONE their mommy built em) but one thing I love about Sony Online is that they dont let early access garbage onto thier store. For this particular reason. This game particularly delayed and microsft ate it up for early access on their non exclusive console. No End Date in site and With A Update System that seems to be regressing id either pass or wait for another Survival Clone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-04,0,0,164,True,Recommended,Played it for 15 hours. The idea is good nice graphics beautiful atmosphere. I like this game. Actually this is the first game I have bought in ages. BUT only 40 FPS max (on very low settings) on my PC makes it almost Impossible to play!!! Currently live in China and play on Asian servers. The servers are laggy a bit. Developers should pay attention to that. BTW my PC is pretty powerful not the top gear but still must be enough to play on medium settings.My PC i7 5700 CPU 2.7GHz (8 cores)16 GB of RAM DDR4Nvidia GTX 950M 2GBAdditionally installed pretty good cooling and ventilation system. I really hope the developers will optimize the FPS problems soon. Cuz I've tried to change the video card setting for this game and still can not higher than 40 FPS. I would understand it if I put everything on High or Ultras but change setting to very low and still get such a low perfomance is pretty sad to see...Anyway I recommend this game because its gameplay is catchy. Will be awaiting for everything to be fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-18,0,0,10,True,Recommended,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds interesting in that it requires a good amount of time to sink into it. Like you'll spend nearly 30 minutes in the game in one match sometimes without finding a single other guy. It can be really fun at times especially when you run into a guy and end up having a shootout while running in between buildings and stuff like that. Other times you'll get really annoyed getting realy good gear just to get sniped in the back from some rando that's across the map.If you're into the hunger games style royale type of gameplay this game is a definite recommendation. It takes elements from many of those games and combines it into (mostly) the best version at least in my opinion. However if you're not a fan of that type of game you will most likely HATE this.Overall there are some really good elements as well a good amount of ""meh"" elements that make this game a mixed bag. I would reccomend at least trying the game out or trying a free competitor before you buy but if you end up enjoying it you'll get a LOT of fun out of it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-05,0,0,712,True,Recommended,"PUBG's trailer might make the came a little more dramatic as it is but do remember this is still early access.The graphics are gritty which fits the game typeThe gunplay feels good on the most part with the exception of pistols perhaps being a little too ineffectiveThe zone not toxic gas this time is mysterious and is quite fair the first ones you can manage through without much issue.And the current Map is okay but there's a lot flatland so being without a vehicle at times and having to run across an open field is riskyThis is a tacticool shooter so standing still to fire your gun is best for accuracy compared to side side stepping &gt stop &gt shoot ofc something like CS which... doesn't work for the most part in PUBG.But some meh sidesIt's early access the netcode needs some finishing touches tick rate and such serverside issues exists so laggy players will hit you even though you ran behind cover. So high ping players around corners are still a nightmare.The weapon variety is a bit low but it's mostly because there's a lack of specialised guns Currently there's only one DMR No ""insane"" shotgun SPAS 12 to excell at destroying cover or cars.Some iron sights are really bad the AKM being a prime example of something you want a sight on asp and pistols in general.My number one question is how we're not able to throw attachments to make noise or how shooting a gasoline can doesn't cause it explode / start a fire.Fire also isn't as effective as you'd think by being on fire you'd expect the enemy unable to aim rapidly losing health and die but instead it's something similar just do a weak area denial with a damage over time effect.And Smoke is clientside of all things.... a huge demerit for smoke grenade usageAll in all the basics are here and it makes for quite a good game the one more mentality is addictive for solo play and squad play is some of the most fun I've had in ages.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

""1st person only"" mode can make the game more ""fair"" and intense! would like to play it. more optimization needed. i'm setting the graphics to ultra low like everyone else to see people hiding in the grass/bush to enjoy the game more beautifully would only be a disadvantage to yourself.

2017-05-18,0,0,1098,True,Recommended,Love the game! Very addicting. My one problem is the sniper ish category and the Shotguns. If youre going for realism with one hit headshots or one hit shotgun the balance feels off when you put 15 SMG bullets or 10 AR bullets into the person who gets you one shot with a shotgun.The armor also feels pretty arbitrary. I have never noticed a difference of damage taken with armor. I have gotten one hit headshot with lvl 1 &amp 2 helmet as well as no helmet. I have been 1/2 shot with a shotgun with a lvl 1&amp 2 Vest. Just would like more consistency or reason for picking up/using items. If you watch the kill feed the top 10 almost always consists of people with Kar98 AWM and SKS. This makes lasting to the end feel a little more like RNG than skill. Anyways still love the game... just wish these things could be addressed soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Changing my review to reflect that.The game itself as I said is a lot of fun and with Microsoft backing them now I hope for some more great features and additions in the future. ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter seeing multiple people playing this game online I gave it a go. I wish I had waited. I have yet to have a match load at all let alone even get to play. I can get to the starting island with seconds left on the countdown and to the plane. On the way down to the main game island I freeze up all the time and get ""lag detected"" constantly on a 115Mbps download / 25 Mbps upload line. If I do get to the ground it looks like I'm in a gingerbread land all the buildings look like they were drawn with watercolors and I cannot see doors vs walls. I've read online how to tweak settings and such with no luck at all.I do realize this is in early access but something has to be up for me to have such a poor experience. Then you see that Microsoft is wrapped up rights to the Xbox One for this game. MS better put some big time help into this or it'll never be released.Once (if) they get the issues worked out I'll give it another try. For now time to uninstall. (",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-14,0,0,384,True,Recommended,Pros Amazing game that will get you addicted. Lots of thinking goes into how you actually win the game. Weapon sounds feels great in game Game physics will make you burst out laughing at times. Big map with lots of places to loot at You have to manually upgrade your weapon by attachments you find in game. Shotgun headshots with 100m distance with choke attachment Separate ques for solo/duo/squad Game developers seems to care about making the game good enough in the future.Cons Servers are too laggy for some (like me). I get frame stutters all the time even though I run good end graphics card + cpu. The developers have reported problems in their core engine which causes this. Game crash at times Force field circle is ridiculous. It's meant to force people to fight and not camp in every corner of the map. What it's actually doing is killing people who don't have cars to get to the new circle (if u get unlucky RNG spawn of the circle). And its sometimes moving WAY too fast it's like moving 5x faster than you could possibly run. So you sometimes have to use up all your meds just to heal up the field dmg in these situations. Some have sound problems. Like my friend who can only hear someone shooting if he is looking at the person. 3rd person is a nice idea but is a bit too overpowered and unfair. You can literally see someone run up to you in 3rd person while they have 0 idea that you are sitting behind cover and just 1 shot them with shotgun before they have time to react.Basically if you can't take dying to stupid which you can't do anything about this game isn't for you. If you can take it at times then you will have lots of fun. (Say if you are unlucky someone will just shoot you down from way afar with a sniper lag as i mentioned crashes random glitches if you are unlucky).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-24,0,0,469,True,Recommended,Coming from H1Z1 I had my worries about this game. Played almost 7 hours straight yesterday and so far I love this game. The graphics the feel being able to equip sights to your guns and all the other attachments its just a complete 180 from KotK. I played a few solos learned the hard way that vehicles will actually kill you if they hit you unlike h1z1 where the vehicle roadkill's are random. Being able to pick where you jump and deploy your parachute is a nice feature. Although the very last 100 feet or so could be faster. Joined into a squad as a solo player and a guy from a group of 3 (matt1812) betrayed me so I guess you still can't get away from that. Got to use a large different group of weapons each feeling unique in its own way. Not having to worry about the whole get shot take cover vehicle rolls up full speed and then get shotgunned to the face is nice. The only big I found and it seems other have too is the launch one where you don't see your character. But all in all I love what I'm experiencing. Should it be $30? Atm I don't believe so but I don't regret paying it EDIT 05/14 so many people have bought this game with no work on servers its unplayable now due to lag and Desync. 5 games in a row killed behind walls. take what you want from it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

NEVER have I seen a more unstable glitchy game EVER!!The positive is the game is fun and great concept when it works but be prepared for endless crashes and memoryerrors various glitches. Many things need reviewed and fixed such as ability to vault walls etc..I think game could be great if the programmers put to fixing it and I have my hopes up!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But after the 1.0 update i started to get borred in my opinion. The gameplay seemed very dull to me but the biggest thing that made me stop playing was the amount of hackers there were after the 1.0 update it was just crazy. PUBG over the time fixed optimization which is a plus for me. But even if the optimization is good it dosent help the gameplay and overpowered guns.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In this game you can make better social contact with your friends also upgrade your teamwork!

2018-07-04,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,The performance is pretty good doesn't budge from 60fps (vsync) and the graphics look really nice kind of like Far Cry.The sound effects are brilliant I was near a tree and someone hit the tree while trying to shoot me and I could actually hear the bullets hitting the wood! Great attention to detail.I would say the gameplay is very ARMA like and if that's your thing then I absolutely recommened you get this game 100% but I unfortunately hate ARMA and didn't really like PUBG either It was just no fun and too much frustration.I'm not sure exactly how many matches I've played so far maybe 10 15 and I've not found a single sniper rifle yet but I did find an M16 a few times and that's the best gun i've found so far.I died too many times without ever feeling like I accomplished anything. It's not a very fun game (not for me at least) and I found myself either getting killed by players or getting killed by the blue restriction circle thing.I will give it a few more tries but I can't see my opinions drastically changing anytime soon.I would like to give the game a middle rating but ya know what steam's like they haven't figured out how to program that in yet so I will have to give a thumbs down.TLDR Dying simulator 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes the game has its issues yes there is a LOT that still needs to be done.. But you will get your money worth out of this game. Youll spend $50 on a couple games of laser tag but if you play this for even 6 hours youve gotten your money worth. Tho I expect if you make it 6 hours youll be hooked. Great game that does need work but a whole of fun how it is in its current state too.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-07,0,0,267,False,Recommended,Putting asaide that Fornite is doing a WAY better job rewarding players with interesting cosmetics that are PERMANTE. Battlegrounds is still a pretty intense experience. However to say this game is King of the Battle Royale genre is quickly becoming a joke. If the Devs wish for this game to continue for the forseeable future they will have to REWORK their loot box system immensely. Either remove the inital cost of the game or make your cosmetics worth it because right now their cosmetics are terrible!So if you care nothing for progression just get in quickly and kill stuff this game does the job well.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But there's currently one hold back. There are so many non english speaking players on the NA EU and OS servers that it has ruined a lot of the fun. It is difficult to find a random squad who can remotely understand you and the general game chatter has significantly decreased.Also thanks to the new killcams and replays it's easy to see how many non NA located players are using hacks.These few setbacks are ruining the core of what makes this game so amazing.Until this problem is solved I must give this a ""Not Recommended"" status to show the developers I care about these issues. Yet I will continue to play and encourage my friends to buy this game. If these problems aren't solved soon I can garuntee I will become fed up sooner rather than later.
