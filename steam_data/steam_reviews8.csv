2016-09-09,0,0,184,False,Recommended,I decided to come try this game again because it really is fun. So far all the server issues that used to plague me are gone. I am happy to play and recommend Rocket League once again. Original Review from early 2016 I played this game for over 70 hours just wonderfully. Then after some update in late 2015 it became unplayable for me. Constant disconnects and rubber banding plague every match I've tried since then and I've tried many hours as my time played shows. I have tried every method I could find to remedy but nothing has worked even tried a different ISP and couple differents routers (even though I play many other online games without any problems). The problems lie with the game and poor servers as many many people can attest. Once the game is playable for me once again and this won't be a negative review.P.S. Microtransaction BS is BS and should be handled like BS flushed away and forgotten.,Rocket League®

2018-07-08,0,0,1169,False,Recommended,One of the best game I have ever played. I will never stop loving to play this as it's challenging and forces you get better every single time you play. The only way to dislike this game is to play mindlessly hoping to eventually get better and complaining about it being laggy or teammates being awful. I will agree that the servers are not always perfect and sometimes the balls clip but in the end if you're skilled enough and actively trying to be better you will have a lot of fun. I will also agree that whom you play with is important but as long as you don't do too many mistakes and take the opportunities that you're presented with you'll do just fine most of the time.,Rocket League®

You will have moments of pure elation at your increasing skill and then other moments when you hate your own stupid mistakes. Just keep going and keep learning!A few tips for you Positioning and strategy are as important as ball skills. Don't ragequit because the matchmaking will penalise you. Disable moronic voice chat. If you want fun then play on the casual servers and if you want a challenge then play on the competitive servers (ranked).SUMMARY *Very* addictive fun and you don't need to like either soccer or cars!,Rocket League®

In today's gaming universe I can rarely say that about any game but for Rocket League it holds true.

2018-08-12,0,0,980,False,Recommended,"What started out in 2015 as a frustrating unique and amusing way to waste time on PS4 would eventually lead me to buying and modding a nice PC rig to play this game seriously. Playing this game you'll find yourself going through phases. SunlessKhan on youtube has a great video about this titled ""every rocket league player."" Very accurate. You'll start out having loads of fun as you laugh at yourself trying to get a grip on the mechanics. Then you'll move on to a bit of frustration once you feel as though you should be playing better but you're getting smashed by people flying through the air.

2016-09-04,0,0,480,False,Recommended,I only have about 20 hours of gameplay at the moment for this game but I have enjoyed every moment of it.From figuring out the first few flips to making simple goals and finally pulling off some simplistic air goals (nothing feels better than that). One thing I feel so far about this game is that it is simple to grasp yet there is a very high skill level if you're willing to keep trying new crazy moves and work on your accuracy as well as teamwork. Teamwork may not seem too important until you start getting closer to the elite division matches you learn very quickly that it is not always about scoring a goal but also setting up your teammates to score.In any case I highly suggest trying this game out even at the $20 price tag and especially if it ever goes on sale.One extra note concerning the cross play aspect between the PC and the Playstation. You can get into randomized matches with either type players however you can only intentionally get into a private match with a friend that is on a different system at the moment (e.g. if you're on the PC and your friend is on a Playstation you must create a match and they must join you). Additionally through this method you cannot play the typical ranked/unranked online matches only against other friends or computers.*Edit If you cannot stand games that Give you the cold sweats Cause you to RageButtClench Force you to panic Periodically disallows blinking Gives way too much sense of accomplishment...you may want to avoid this game**Edit I now have a little over 97 hours of gameplay and still feel the same way about this game. The matches now have become far more difficult since my friends and I have been ranking up but it makes it all the more fun. After a certain point you truly do have to rely on everyone on your team to know how to Make contact with the ball in the air Play as goalie Be an aggressive striker Work as a team many goals come from passing to a teammate***Edit (188 Hours)What? You still have not tried this game yet?,Rocket League®

2017-02-22,0,0,389,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a fun and unique game where you play soccer but with a TWIST... you play with CARS! In Rocket League you can play ranked or unranked which is a ranking system from the highest rank to the lowest rank. You can get items to customize your car and even get different types of cars such as a boost wheels topper(hat) and many different skins and for the items you dont want you can trade with other players to get something better or if you have 5 of the same type of item ( Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Import Body Exotic And of course mystery decal) then you can trade it in for one item of a higher rarity. But beware of scammers! You can also train in the exhibiton or go there just for some fun! You can also buy crates which is a random item which could possibly be a mystery decal. And it's under 20$!!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone that like soccer or cars or BOTH and even if you dont like those 2 things it's still a really good game and i highly recommend you check it out NOW!!!,Rocket League®

2018-07-15,0,0,56,False,Recommended,I bought this game for the 3rd birthday sale mainly due to the fact that my friends recomended it and that it is a pouplar game on twitch. I didnt expect for this game to instantly become one of my favorites but i was way wrong. This is one of the best games i have ever played! if you are new and bad (like i was) rocket leauges matchmaking will accually put you with people of your skill level unlike SOME GAMES who claim they do. I have owned this game for four days now and i already have 14 hours in it. For a comparrison I have owned CS GO for 2 years play it regurally and i only have 15 hours invested in this game.

Casual or Harcore player both can play this game You can always improve in this game ALWAYS (Even pros does) Esport tournaments (everybody can join) Super friendly for new comers HUD and control are easy to learn but not to master. Great to play with friends!!!! Any Controllers can be used on PC Trading cosmetics Private matches/Mini Tournaments Very Good matchmaking in ranked 99% of the time I've played in ranks it's against people of the same skill level as I. Any other game modes it's against random ranks. Good season rewards Not P2W the best car overall is a free one. Great community in generalCons There's maybe a ton of extra game modes but you won't play 20 games back to back of one game mode. (Becomes boring in my opinion) Repetitive it's not the same actions or the same decisions that you are making over and over but the gameplay is always the same. Microtransactions Rocket league didn't have them in the first year that i've played. It was a very good year but since they launch it I feel they put all their efforts on cosmetics and events around them.. they still do provide new content but it's just new game modes and like I said before most of the time after 5 games you are going back to normal mode. They do give 5 free keys every events for players that plays the game in that period that item that you unlock cannot be trade with other players because you got it for free. Sometimes it can be hard to play in other regions. (Pings/Packet loss/ETC) People didn't had problems before some patches ago. Since you play cross platform it's weird when a Ps4 or Xbox can get only 30 FPS but PC is uncapped. That's the main reason why I enjoy playing more on PC then PS4. (I see the difference) Bad rewards overall beside the season rewards and the free keys the game doesn't give you meaning or nice rewards. Maybe I have a lot of cons but the game is very very good I would suggest it to anyone. Everybody can play it and it's just a very fun game. I'm gonna have plenty more hours on it!Hope this rewiew was helpfull ),Rocket League®

2017-02-09,0,0,77,False,Recommended,So before I begin I would like to note that I am not big on competitive games that rely on the community/playerbase. I'm not into LOL/OW/Smite etc. I think Rocket League is the only game I could see myself playing in tournaments or something. Gameplay is super addicting you have cars (vans monster trucks yeah) that are VERY fast and there's boosters everywhere for more speed. It's a strange combination of racing and soccer (and hockey basketball). RL added some power ups (I forget the actual term used) that have put a new spin on the game but you can chose to play with the power ups/buffs off if you desire. Oh I almost forgot the most important thing explosions! Lots and lots of explosions.,Rocket League®

2017-02-10,0,0,852,False,Recommended,My score is 9.9 out of 10. Nearly perfect game and I waste about 3 to 5 hours of my life every weekday on it. Hard to master easy to learn and play most parts of the game. It's a casually played game but at the same time exciting. Nothing like a MOBA where a teammate can easily make a mistake. It's hard to make mistakes on this game playing standard 3 vs 3 and you can almost mess around. Hardly any s to play with on multiplayer. No forced DLCs to enjoy the game. no pay to win crap. Willing to buy a 2nd copy for Nintendo Switch if it releases (Rocket League on the go bye bye to life).

2017-02-11,0,0,1896,False,Recommended,With a little over 400 hours into this game I figured i'd review it. For those who have this on your wishlist or have simply just been on the fence about this game I have one thing to say BUY IT. There are numerous reviews that will go more in depth on the pros and cons of this game but I simply say BUY IT. This isnt one of those games you put on the wishlist till a big sale comes this is a game that is priced right and done right. Honestly I dont need to elaborate much more as there are plenty of reviews that hit the pro and cons of this game. At its face this game is very easy to pickup and enjoy. However you'll soon realize that its much more complex than it seems. It takes many hours to become skilled and a lot of trial and error in the training modes to figure out how you like your controls camera ect ect. Trust me once you play it you'll understnad why soo many fellow gamers have recommended this game. 10/10 would buy the delorian again.,Rocket League®

2016-12-17,0,0,16,False,Recommended,Psyonix have done a great job creating a game which combines vehicles and sport to deliver a unique and extremely entertaining experience.Visually I was impressed with the game. The diverse playing fields and the customisation options for your car give the game its own visual style. The use of strong vibrant colours generates a pleasant atmosphere. With the customisation feature players have so many choices to make regarding the style of their cars from the wheels decals flags and hats.The game controls are quick to learn and master. With that said though it is difficult to hit the ball at the perfect time or dribble across the playing field but that's the best thing about Rocket League the difficulty of having complete control of the ball using a car creates so much tension. Players hopelessly boost drift and jump to gain control of the ball. It's often hilarious to watch opposing teams and teammates miss the ball and ram into each other to gain possession. Everyone's lack of ability is what makes it so rewarding when you finally do score by timing your jump perfectly or hitting the ball at the right angle. Half the time I scored its because I unintentionally hit the ball at an opposing team player and he/she shoots an own goal. The game is genuinely intense and it's the first time in a while where a game has made me move and jump in my seat.I like Rocket League. Its such a satisfying game. After a few hours however I began to lose my motivation in the matches. The game starts to repeat itself which is expected as it is a sports game but I feel that other gameplay features could be incoorperated to keep the ball rolling (pun not intended). I don't think the game is in my favourite games of all time but it is definitley an enjoyable experience and a must play.7//10,Rocket League®

2018-09-07,0,0,426,False,Recommended,I would definitely recommend this game to others its a lot of fun however you get some users that are flat out bullies and so cruel i can see why some gamers take their lives. I know there is a report button you can report them but you cannot provide the discussion or nasty words those players have written in the chat. I think rocket league players should be able to have access to a phone number or better an email address where the good players can copy and paste what these nasty bullies are writing to others during the game as it ruins the game but thinking of others out there with mental health concerns it can also ruin other players self esteem or confidence and it could seriously be a game changer for the recieving end of the bullying. The reporting process needs to entail alot my detail about how they are bullying because if other players are encouraging and writing you should kill yourself I am not ok with reading this or recieving this in any way. This is another form of bullying that contributes to the high suicide rate of young people. THIS IS NOT OK and should not be tolerated.,Rocket League®

2018-09-02,0,0,218,False,Recommended,"I have had this game for a good month or two and every day I have played for at least 30 minutes. This game has everything! I bought the game for free when they had the game on a sale for a special weekend or something like that. It was for three days. I played it for maybe two days totaling all the hours. So at the end I was like ""I have to get this."" So I bought it for $20 (or $30 I can't remember). IT WAS WORTH IT!Now if the developers (Psyonic Inc.) ever see this review if it's okay I'd like to suggest just a couple new things to add in the game. There could be more customization options when we create a local season when playing with the AI. I'd like to be able to Customize the players Customize the players' names Customize the players' attributes (might collide with setting the difficulty again just suggesting new things to do) Increase difficulty (It goes from Rookie &gt Pro &gt All Star. All Star has become easy for me now. Maybe something like Rookie &gt Pro &gt All Star &gt Legend &gt Hall of Fame just another suggestion) Customize the teams (option to change all the team names to fit a possible theme maybe likewise with the player names and attributes) Customize the team logos (option for custom logos draw or upload) Customize the season length (more options instead of the normal every 9 weeks again only a suggestion) Customize the cars themselves (MAYBE up to y'all!) There could be more customization options with creating an exhibition game (same as above but without the season length) SIDE NOTE You don't have to add everything in this list at the same time in the same update. You don't have to even put in all these things I'm just suggesting but it would be nice to have with this game since I know of other games that have those options. If these options were implemented with this game as awesome as it is this game could be Fortnite. I like Fortnite but I play this more than I do Fortnite.",Rocket League®

2016-04-27,0,0,532,False,Recommended,"It's an unfortunate situation with online multiplayer games no matter how well balanced or fun the mechanics are in a game you can't stop the community from turning it into a dump. Rocket League is the epitome of this. It's simple polished and when you have the right circumstances it can be extremely exciting. Then when you factor in the monkey like behaviour of most people it becomes much less enjoyable. If you have a group of friends you can party up with it won't be as much of a problem but if you don't always have someone on call to join you here's what you can expect. Near constant ragequitting due to Psyonix doing approximately NOTHING to punish ragequitters (read trash) even 10 months since the game's release even in ranked matches Being frequently and forcibly placed into in progress matches (usually on the losing side) due to said ragequitters If you are placed into a losing match and you are able to turn it in your favor the enemy team will spend the remainder of the match trying to hit you instead of the ball Players with a veteran rank (dozens of hours) that somehow don't understand the basics of the game who will also ragequit Players on your team who deliberately try to lose in ranked matches and then trashtalk you The disgusting childish attitude of steam forum users if you have a problemOn a side note the main menu has a flashing ""DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT"" button that looks different from the others right at the top.

How is it so often that coming in for a shot on goal the ball isnt where it is actually rendered on my screen and i clip through it and this is with a ping that never goes above 20 so it is not my connection. The worst of it is that I'm not the best at this game so i like to play casual and everytime some exits or joins the game in progress it turns into a damn slide show!! This never used to happen maybe a very slight hitch occasionally but the game becomes unplayable for 3 to 4 seconds anytime someone comes or goes.

2018-07-23,0,0,583,False,Recommended,"__07/23/2018__ 8/10 The Perfect 5 Minute FixRocket League is a wonderfully creative and enjoyable mashup of fast cars and oversized soccer. I truly enjoy everything rocket league is with the exception of a few minor annoyances. If you I need to get a quick gaming fix in to kill some time or blow off some steam Rocket League is my go to game in my library. Its fast paced requires skill and frequently rewards the player in the form of cosmetic items. The implimentation of seasons has been a breathe of fresh air ever since the game was first released and the number of holiday events in the game keep players busy earning swag to show off and/or trade to other players.Rocket League isn't by any means perfect... but almost. The microtransactions are out of hand and most all of the ""cool"" skins and effects are locked behind crate key purchases which dont really tier down in price if you want to buy in bulk. Another annoyance I have with the game is the cross platform system in which they have adopted. Many times PC players get stuck with consol players which can make it difficult to communicate with one another. This leads to poor coordination and frustrating losses the higher you climb in the rankings. To prevent this I hope they impliment and option in the future where a player can check a box that will allow them to opt out of cross platform matchmaking and just play with the playerbase on their platform. Yes this seems counter productive to implimenting cross platform servers in the first place but in ranked matchmaking players can become toxic when team synergy is lacking and can create an unpleasent experience for those trying to climb the ladder.Again Rocket League though not perfect is a great casual quick fix game that anyone can pick up and enjoy. It's in my opinion a must in any gamers library.",Rocket League®
2018-07-23,0,0,817,False,Recommended,Game is really solid other than the fact that you pay $20 and can still make in game purchases for more cars and other cosmetices. Lots of maps and 4 game modes with 5 variations of soccar to play. Community is hugely involved in trading but to me isnt worth the time or money. The community can become toxic but it'snot something that you want to come to know yourself or friends as. I give it a solid 9/10 with 1 because of crates and keys.,Rocket League®

2016-04-25,0,0,7,False,Recommended,This is a great game but the problem is matchmaking you may go up against a party of players in unranked and you will lose. Unless you have friends in a party in unranked games you wont enjoy yourself that much. Finding ranked games is semi hard but at least you dont have to play against a party of players you can play in solo matchmaking games in ranked,Rocket League®

2017-01-13,0,0,981,False,Recommended,First off i will say that i have 400 hours on record. And i will say that i am just the slightest bit addicted to this game. Second off i wanna say a thank you to psyonix (which i never thought of doing) but here it goes. Thank you thank the devs for making your dlcs so amazingly cheap and offordable. 5 bucks for 2 cars boosts and rims AND toppers AND flags? UNHEARD OF in the gaming industry. Thats like buying a semitruck (a brand new Kenowrth one at that) for 20 000 dollars instead of the casual half a million dollars they are marked at initally. So yeah Thanks Psyonix. I dont mean that in any other way other than litteraly not sarcastic (get new servers tho they kinda suck... My granda could run faster than they can process where the ball is) but i will say this.I really ing enjoy how people buy keys. 20 at a time. I have done this so therefore i can laugh at it but sometimes its HILARIOUS to the point where i am rolling on the ground laughing and my family thinks im insane. You see these videos out there titled 150 CARES OPENING!! OMG!!! so i log onto my fake youtube acc to see whats up. Well... It turs out the maker of the video bought. BOUGHT. 150 dollars worth of in game content at one time. ROFL.Thank you again for caring about the people who play the game. I never really liked or disliked neo tokyo but i will say that its annoying P But yee Thx for makin da gam boi and makin it possible (pronounce it with the most spanish accent posiible) aaaaaanyways this im out,Rocket League®

The game started as a chill laid back game to play late at night. The more I play the more I was enjoying it and wanted to get better. The last time I played a comp season before season 8 was back in like season 3. I finished season 8 in Plat 2. Now in Season 9 I'm Diamond 1. It's been really fun to watch myself get better and make progression on a competitive game! The game can fun like I said. It can cause a lot of rage too as the game sucks sometimes. Aside from toxic teammates oppents and toxic text chat which you can mute all of this btw it's a really fun game. Really fun with friends I enjoy solo q'ing.

2018-06-05,0,0,289,False,Not Recommended,To preface I love this game. It's one of my favorites. But for new players I need to warn you that you better have a good internet connection.Unless you live in a country with impeccable ISP's (thanks Ajit Pai _ ) or you're an intern that can plug directly into Psyonix's server stacks you're going to get latency variation problems the likes of which never seen before. It was perfectly fine before the Spring Fever update but someone decided to mess with the server stability and now I'm averaging between 120 200(!) ping in ranked. Try kicking a soccer ball that has the ability to teleport on a whim and is also noncorporeal. That's what it's like at least for me. Discussion forum posts can also back me up.Community is okay ish but please Psyonix. Fix your servers. It's bad. Really bad.,Rocket League®

However this game is so fun to play and I can't stop. It makes you feel like a badass even when you're doing nothing right. The nice thing about playing it online is that everyone's terrible just by virtue of how chaotic it is so nobody really gets an advantage beyond luck. And there's no hokey skill trees or progression to alienate new players. All in all the best multiplayer game I own right now.,Rocket League®

2016-01-26,0,0,629,False,Recommended,After 20 years of hardcore gaming from Atari to the console wars to PC somehow this game has became my most played non MMORPG of all time..... in just 3 months.There are 3 major elements that make this game incredible Purely fun simple gameplay 10/10You will have a hard time finding a game that extracts so much fun from such simple concepts. The physics engine is the real hero but also the seemingly infinite combinations of the basic maneuvers (jump rocket boost and dodge) turn the game into a constant struggle between what your mind wants to do and what you are able to get your car to do. And nothing is more rewarding than finally getting your car to finally make that acrobatic flying backwards aerial off the wall goal. When you're not playing like a graceless flying monkey you can play like its a demolition derby by harassing defenders ruining opponents shots and 'sploding annoying goalies. The beauty of Rocket League is that while winning is fun failing is just as fun. Unbelievably Steep Skill Curve with an Unreachable Ceiling 10/10In an odd way the appeal of this game incredibly similar to the appeal of the game of Golf you are constantly enjoying yourself while constantly trying to get better. You will go through dozens of 'phases' of improvement from first learning aerials to learning aerial dodges &amp power shots to learning dribbling and wall shots and backwards aerials and air rolls and goalie skills and pro passes ... and on and on it goes! Rocket League has one of the most rewarding skill curves of any game I have ever played.If you are someone that likes to simply play around and have fun you can have endless fun playing RL ... yet at the same time if you are someone that likes to challenge yourself and chase perfection by constantly honing your skill vs. competition RL can provide endless challenges too. It's quite rare for a game to so seamlessly mesh both possibilities.Competitive Progression 6/10If simply mastering a skill or having mindless fun aren't enough and you need an actual goal to chase or a way to represent your progress then Rocket League's ranked system is fairly good at doing so. While the matchmaking system has its flaws teammates can frustrate and the rewards/achievements are completely trivial ... it still does provide a reasonable representation of your progress. But don't expect anything more than bragging rights &amp fame for tireless efforts because this game is not interested in providing any 'rewards' that aren't decorative. And don't expect to be chasing any rare items or skins or cars because virtually all of them can be accumulated with ease fairly quickly (sans DLC only variations). The game is very strict with it's approach to balance to the point that you will never gain any item or object to make your car better from day one until the very last game of RL you play you will have the exact same tools to play the game that you will ever have.But DO expect a competitive game platform that is perfectly suited to spawn a serious e sports community.,Rocket League®

But that should not stop you from playing this game with colourful and cartoony graphics a satisfying feel and a competitive edge. Not very hard to learn extremely hard to master. Skins are also quite a big part of the game (if you want it to be) allthough I am never in favor of microtransactions. The community in the lower ranks can be quite toxic and unfriendly but a simple mute should fix that. I do recommend searching someone to play with be it on the various fora steam acqaintances or someone you meet in game it is much easier to develop your skill and rank up when doing so with someone whom you play with regularly.

2015-07-08,0,0,133,False,Recommended,I wish I could rate this game out of ten rather than a yes no scenario because this game is barely recommendable. I like the concept of the original game this is based on. So unique and its good to have an updated verision of this game. But this game has issues. They added an extra difficulty level which is appreciated. They changed car mechanics which I prefer the manouverability of the original game. Bot mechanics havent changed bar the increased difficulty level. And online matchmaking has been non existent upon release which I find unbelievable considering that the original game had some serious match making issues. I feel this game has had such little effort put into it considering there has been a previous release of essentially the same game that has been out for 7 years. I would have expected more.,Rocket League®

Sometimes I would get one or two but in the next match everyone would play. Now it seems as if all I get are AFK players. This severly ruins the game as it makes it not fun anymore. I really hope Psyonix can fix this and make it so you don't get matched up with AFK players anymore. If they are able to fix it it would make the game fun to play again.,Rocket League®

2016-09-07,0,0,909,False,Not Recommended,"don't get into that game really it's highly addictive 'cause it has a really good gameplay (skill dependant high reward for good actions and well simply lot of fun) but is plagued by the WORST MATCHMAKING EVER unbalanced teams not always but half of the time with 30.000 active players (140.000 total) it's in itself an achievement. no sanctions against toxic players meaning it's full of these. you often get matched in already started games cause someone left that said game but eh didn't they wonder if people are leaving it may not be a spontaneous idea that poped into the guy's mind? maybe he left cause he had a flamer team? or cause he got matched with too strong/too weak mates/ennemies? if you're a solo Q player you often get matched vs 3 men premades giving a real advantage in this game. then when you leave a game for whatever reason (pick one or several above) and you start Qing again you're often getting matched in the exact same game you just left at this point it's some genious mind. oh and you can make as many threads as you want on their forum they just don't give a fcck really Dstarted out as an indie studio with passionate devs ended up like EA or zenimax.some people that have all answers to every single problem over the globe will tell ya ""stop cry just play ranked solves all of those issues you jerk!"" but well i need a fair amount of casual matches to warm up before i get to ranked and very often i leave rocket league before i can even get to the ranked play phase.so yeah the price is not that big and actually it's still worth it but you're probably gonna get addicted and get really really disappointed once you'll reach a certain skill level and take the game quite seriously (what you will do just by playing) cause of that matchmaking which is honestly the worst i ever saw and cause of those devs that won't moove their fat aass for everything else than skin boxes. ( &lt salt detected )today i've spent 30 minutes trying to get into a real match the game didn't allowed me to play only once in a correct match only joining in already started matches that your team is loosing by far i don't play this. quite amazing though spent 30 minutes on the game and i couldn't play those guys are geniusesPS sorry for bad english!

This game is good for short as well as long gaming session. You can never get bored in rocket league as there are so many modes available offline . And if you want a challenging experience you can always play all these modes in online competition as well as tournaments against real players . Another thing is this game can run on any PC and anyone can learn to pull off cool shots . And you can always play in game training or courses created by other players . You can even create your own training courses and upload them for others to use . This is the best game on steam in my opinion !!,Rocket League®

2015-11-10,0,0,402,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a fantastic game which has nailed game design philosophy of elegance via simplicity. The game is easy to hop into as a beginner but has a skill ceiling so high you'll be tweaking your play as long as you stick with it. Drive around in your rocket powered car on a soccer pitch competing in 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 matches both online and off. With matches lasting 5 minutes it's an easy game to hop into when you don't have a huge amount of time to sink into a game but it's so good you'll have trouble only playing one match. It features 1v1 2v2 and 3v3 (solo queue and party queue) matches for the ranked ladder. These modes give a sense of progression as you rank up from unranked to bronse 1 3 silver 1 3 gold 1 3 and the godly platinum tier. Just as you think you've started to master the game and you climb higher in rankings you play someone who does things you've never seen before and they wipe the floor with you truely a humbling experience. There is always room to improve. It's not all about competition though. The game offers 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 unranked modes as well as a newly added mutator mode which puts you into an unranked game with crazy and fun modifications like slo mo low gravity increased boost strength cube ball and more. This game has something to offer both casual and competive players and with the fun gameplay and quick matches it's a no brainer. I've gotten well more than my $20 worth out of it.,Rocket League®

Unfortuately the game is tedious driving back and forth after a ball feels like bashing my head against a wall. It was fun for the first few weeks now it is repetitive.Major changes need to take place to keep the game fun I don't see that happening. For starters 4v4 on this small of an arena is unplayable. Second stacking defenders creates terrible stalemates. Rules need to be in place that limit the amount of defenders same reason way soccer hockey basketball have rules for it.Netcode is the worst I've seen the ball teleports changes directions cars teleport and I have 100/100MB fiber connection.In short the game needs more game modes some different rules stable netcode or else it will disappear soon.,Rocket League®

2016-03-06,0,0,48,False,Recommended,"Super fun game if you view it as a party game or something just to kill time. Don't get sucked in too hard on rankings and you have a ton of fun with it. Also highly recommend coming up with your own terminology for moves you pull off in the game as it makes commentary with friends extremely fun. Try using ""boop"" when you set someone up ""cheeky horn corp"" when you try a sick aerial ""cheeky king lou"" when you get a nice bicycle kick a ""folly floater"" for a long slow shot across the field a ""lazy susan"" for a slow goal ""spicy susan"" for a fast goal and a ""tositios mild slasa susan"" for a medium speed goal. Also when you over commit for a goal and the opponents end up scoring because no one is back playing goal make sure to call it a ""Shaboobadoopy."" Trust me it's a ton of fun.",Rocket League®

2018-01-22,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"Very addicting and very fun! And the community of players whether their veteran or just new rookie to the game everyone is just very friendly and encouraging even if you accidentally score on your own team. It happens and it's such a breath of fresh air after dealing with the toxic communities of LOL DOTA2 PUBG FORTNITE and all the in between games where the littles mistake gets you reported and banned. You run into a couple bad sports who get mad and leave the game and there is no pentalties for leaving a game and abandoning people but it's very rare you end up dealing with people who degrease you for making mistakes and some will offer to teach you a few tricks to help you catch on quicker. I give this game 9 out of 10 start only because there are no penalties or suspensions for those rare people who get mad and abandon their team leaving the game. Other then that I have no negative words to say about this fun and addictive game where you find yourself saying ""one more match before I go to bed"" over and over as much as you would binging episode after episode of Netflix",Rocket League®

2015-11-16,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Really enjoyed Rocket League! Lots of unlockables to get. Scoring is rewarding. Especially in 3v3. I would recommend using a controller for this game. I started out on my keyboard but grabbed a Xbox 360 controller to see if I liked it better. It was hard making the adjustment from keyboard to mouse but it is definitely worth the effort to learn. I was able to control my car much more effectively and it made aerials easier as well. Have yet to played ranked but intend to once I get a little more practice with the controller. I rate this game a 7/10. The game is good but can get repetitive. I usually binge and then have to take a break for a few days.,Rocket League®

But beware of the toxicity of some players sometimes their just the worst and it can be really frustrating even in just one game of RL. But you'll get used to it as you get better at doing aerials and you get that timing down on when to jump where to hit the ball where to position yourself before hitting the ball looking out for teammates and just play the passing game at that point it'll just get even more fast paced and even more fun.

2017-03-19,0,0,1079,False,Recommended,Easily one of the most addicting games I've played. Every match is 5 minutes (plus OT and people watching the replays) and the skill cap is very high so you are always improving. Psyonix is amazing with updates the only DLC are car packs and Psy has seasonal updates along with new game modes occasionally. They added the crate and key system which funds the tournaments while giving us a shot at some really cool visual upgrades to our cars. 90% of the things in crates is worth wanting (the other 10% are the low tier decals that I wouldn't want but that's subjective). There is a great amount of cars and an insane amount of custimization so you'll always find the car that suits you. The online community can be toxic at times but you have the option to mute and report so that's not a big deal. Just play your heart out!Overall a beautiful game by an amazing group of developers. They listen to what the community says and the constant fight to get into a higher rank in comp along with the steady increase in the number of people who are good at the game will have you clawing for more game time.,Rocket League®

2015-11-19,0,0,174,False,Recommended,"You don't own Rocket League? Do you only have an Xbox and parents who don't love you? That's what all your friends who play Rocket League are saying about you. The Psy guys definitely got the formula right on this one. Even when you start playing and suck so bad it hurts you can't stop. And even when you get so good you could juggle the ball like a hippie hopping a hacky sack you still are not as good as the Mt Dew doping 12 yea olds that are handily eating your lunch and you STILL can't get enough. It's dead simple to understand and only gets better when you find yourself on a team of people who know how to play and coordinate. Always fast paced and the matches are typically quick so the ADHD part of you can enjoy and say every 5 minutes ""Maybe just one more"". The visuals sound and music are all perfect. Playing with a controller or keyboard works just fine and there's barely a learning curve. The mutators were a fun inclusion but introduce so many new variables you might find yourself quickly frustrated or overwhelmed especially if the setup just doesn't work well. Try a few mutator matches and you'll see what I mean. My only gripe is that PC peeps can't find their PS4 pals in vise versa. Granted the multiplayer system is very streamlined and getting into a match takes no effort. But it would be nice to somehow get my friends in Hawaii in for marathon matches. And if you like to collect things like Pokemon there's plenty of DLC and bits to buy or find to keep your brain entertained. If you're a fan of Hockey Soccer Basketball Volleyball Rollerjam Cars Games Fun Life or Paul Reiser you need Rocket League.",Rocket League®

2016-12-08,0,0,86,False,Recommended,I started this game after losing consecutive matches to CS GO. For the starters like me I need approximately 20 hours to get used to the physics used in this game. This game is really good in terms of community and physics. Although a controller is recommended for PC users as well I managed to win some matches using a keyboard and mouse. This game is recommended for people who needed a break from FPS games. Another thing I like is that this game is not pay to win which most AAA games implanted micro transactions just for that.Gameplay 8/10Very unique gameplay as it uses a racing car to play 'soccer' in a field. Really liked the idea playing this game however some skills such as aerial hits requires quite some time to practice. Overall not a bad game for its price. Community 7/10I met less toxic people in this game probably in 1/15 matches. Most players I met uses a console to play this game. Performance 9/10Very good performance even on my low spec Nvidia laptop. Amazingly optimized for an Unreal Engine game compared to PUBG. Servers 7/10Servers are actually pretty good and optimised in general I have generally no complains except for servers located in Japan where lag is unbearable at times.,Rocket League®

2018-01-27,0,0,41,False,Recommended,I played this for about 1 and a half years on PS4 and the switch to PC wasn t as painful as i expected.I didn t get to keep any of my items etc. which kind of is a bummer. But i can definetly let that slide. My PC is pretty mediocre atm (GTX 560 1GB FX 6100) and i get solid 160Fps on low med settings. I didn t expect such nice framerates this game runs incredibly well.I plugged in my PS4 controller and changed a few keybinds fine tuned the GFX and Camera and i was ready to go. I would recommend a controller but i have a friend of mine who plays on keyboard and mouse and he is doing completely fine. It s mostly what you re used to that matters.This is still one of my favorite games ever. It s a fairly simple concept but the skill ceiling is incredibly tall. There are air dribbles air drags fakes and that s just a few of the things your rocket powered car can do.There is so much you can do in this game there are so many ways to play and customize.And also you have the steam workshop which is constantly getting more content.You can find racetracks huge half pipes and even a literal toilet.I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys driving games but want s something new.This this is a breath of fresh air.,Rocket League®

It's been a long time since I played any sort of sports game..However today I saw the game on sale and thought to myself Fu** it and bought it. Suddenly three hours later I was hooked. Fun and enjoyable and I definitely recommend it. Competitive yet casual fun. It's the perfect combination,Rocket League®
2016-03-01,0,0,112,False,Recommended,"Before I had purchased the game I had known very little about the game itself except for what everyone says ""It's soccer with cars"" but I had no idea it was this competitive. This game is damn near perfect in every aspect and is extremely fun. The one thing that shocked me the most was the soundtrack though as this game has by FAR the best soundtrack out of 99% of the games out there. The game servers are also EXTREMELY well established with servers all over the world. All of my hours on this game have been from yesterday night and today alone!

RL DLC's aren't pay to win and for most part only contribute to aesthetics. So as long as I keep enjoying the game I'll keep buying the DLC's to keep the development funded.

Where new players will have great fun in learning the elemental controls and hitting the ball where it hurts more advanced players will want to start testing the merits of flying. Having conquered these at an elementary level the fun starts for real. There's really no limit to the amount of idiotic tenuously difficult flying actions you can perform.

It's tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the controls down it's fairly simple. I've heard mixed debates over Keyboard or Controler gameplay and to be honest I find keyboard gameplay rather easy to learn. The only downside is that it seems the games can be weighted towards one color over the other. For instance if you have 4 players in one match Orange can beat Blue 10 1. If the same 4 players rematch Blue could win 7 2. Most of it is player skill Match Making is pretty good about putting similarly skilled players together. Other than that it's a blast!

2015-07-16,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Let me tell you a story.A few days ago I stared a season. Each day I would play one match of this season. My team were Dinomoon. With Tex and Merlin at my side there wasn't anything we couldn't accompish. And we were winning games. We won 9 1 4 0 and other numbers. Then came the final the championship game. Dinomoob vs Dragons. We scored twice during the first 2 1/2 minutes. Then the Dragons pulled two back. Down to the wire. It came to extra time. We battered at the doors of Dragon castle but they just wouldn't let us in. They even attacked at us a fair bit. For 10 minutes we attacked then alas the Imp managed to get a shot in defelected off Tex. We lost. 3 2. I was heartbroken I was destroyed.I ing love this game. No other game has given me the excitement and nerve of attempting to beat a bunch of computers at what essentially is car football. I swear at one point it was 4 in the morning and I sat in my underpants eating doritos and trying to beat some stupid pirates. They're not even real people! Why do I care? I care because me Tex and Merlin are a team. We're the best around. We're Dinomoon.And Online play is pretty fun too.,Rocket League®
2015-07-16,0,0,102,False,Recommended,A game the allows you to jump in and straight away have fun but has lots of room to learn tricks and better ways to get the ball. Played for 6hrs the first time I tried it (oops).Also brings out the inner football shouter in youDEFENCEThe customisation is great fun as well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Doesn't make you grind to get items you just unlock one after every match win or lose. Quite easy to get 100% on achievements if that's what you like.Great fun and highly addictive.

2016-12-07,0,0,1411,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket League is my go to game to play at any given time. Even more so when friends are available to play. Gameplay is amazing. It's well optimized so that even PCs closer to the mid lower end can still run the game smoothly. Just don't expect to be great at the game right off the start. Only thing I've really had an issue with aside from queueing for comp 2v2s and getting matched against people with 300+ ping. Quite annoying. But other than that their servers can ocassionally be iffy but generally settle down after a short period of time.,Rocket League®
2016-12-07,0,0,527,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!All in all i'd completely recommend this game to anyone whether you're a casual player or very competitive!,Rocket League®

2015-12-02,0,0,46,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a very fast paced competitive game that one will not understand just how fun it is until they have played it. I have explained it to friends and they thought ""oh that sounds cool"" but when we did local play (yes you can do that what game does that now a days) we were yelling and screaming in excitement because Rocket League provides what one could call something like an adrenaline rush because you feel you must hurry and get the ball before others so that you can score a point before they do. I often found myself giving the controller a death grip which hurt my hands. There are a ton of things to unlock for your cars. I'm like 25 hours in and I'm a pretty good player and I'm still unlocking things. They even make holiday unlockables. Around Halloween you could have a candy corn trail instead of a normal rocket trail and all sorts of other things. Psyonix has done an outstanding job with this game and it's definitely paying off. This game is in the league of competitveness as Super Smash Bros and Call of Duty. I'm burnt out on Call of Duty too but both of those games are MLG and Rocket League has already become one.

2015-12-02,0,0,863,False,Recommended,The game is a perfect time killer. Although it has one major issue MATCHMAKING.As a SEMI PRO ranked player I often get teamed with 2 absolute beginners or somebody who borrowed the game and is playing for the first time but as someone else using someone else's account and that someone often being ranked PRO or EXPERT. When in such a team I do play as good as I can but still lose by 5+ goals thus losing rank points and thus losing patience and the will to play further. I'm not saying that I am super good I already said I am SEMI PRO. But I can score goals defend and move well around the court even make nice assists when teammates know how to position themselves and play. An even bigger problem is that leaving this kind of game bans you for 15 minutes because you didn't finish it. What you put me in a team of noobs against a team of veterans and then expect me to wait until the game ends so they can pound me 21 2 or so? .. makes no sense.. I paid for the game and I want to play it it's not fair to ban people for being mad at your lousy matchmaking alhorithm.. If I find a teammate useless I would like to vote to kick him out. If you still need to allow people to leave you should at least ensure that the remaining team has a chance. But don't just let people leave the game when they want to and watch the remainder get pounded! I also played bunch of games with people who are as good as I am with some great players and in mixed teams rarely lost a game even those that I did lose I lost by 1 or 2 goals. Not 10. So to summarize...Gameplay 9/10Matchmaking 3/10Multi player fairness 5/10Graphics 7/10 (but don't need to be better)Menus 9/10General rules 8/10Physics 9/10 Overall 7.1/10,Rocket League®

2015-12-02,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,Pro Fun game if you like playing against nothing but AI.Cons Everything.Matchmaking is atrocious and seems to give a flying f*** about putting players of similar skill together.Rank system is utterly ridiculous. You can win 9 games then lose 1 and end up at a lower rank than when you started.Game play. Have a player drop out mid game (due to lag or any other reason)? You're now playing with unbalanced teams. The game doesn't give any kind of handicap doesn't limit the other team to one less spawn or anything at all.The devs clearly give not one steaming sh!t about balanced play. The ONLY reason this game has anybody left playing is because they managed to get Valve to include it with Steam Controller purchases.,Rocket League®

And with recent addition of Mutators it's even more fun! If I had to give any negative points to it is that there's no punishment to players that leave simply because the other team is doing better or even just scores 1 goal. It also doesn't seem to really take advantage of the Mutators settings in the public que only having less than 5 different possible settings that could appear.

So I added the game to my wishlist and waited for a discount. Then there was a discount and I bouthg it with 14$. after I played it a while I understood that this game worth 20$ and I recommend it to anyone! Even though you dont like soccer or cars it is still good!really fun to play with friends BUT most of the people are quite annoying swearing a lot and pushing you while playing so you can't get or hit the ball.The idea of the game is also brilliant and the maps are cool!,Rocket League®
2016-12-09,0,0,516,False,Recommended,Great game for fun with friends. If you have a competitive side there is competitive modes in the game. I personally believe it is worth the 20 dollars. But if you pass up this game while it's on sale you are insane. The game deffinetly has a skill curb and requires some practice but once you become better than some people or get in the average skill level this game is great. If you are avoidin this game because it has keys and crates then I want you to know there is no steam market only in game trading AND you can chose to hide the keys and crates.

2015-07-18,0,0,1018,False,Recommended,"What I like to call the perfect ""break"" gameWhat I mean by the break game is that this game to me is a perfect escape from when you need a break from more serious games. Just lost a game of Dota or League and need to clear your head? This game will do it. This game is just pure instant fun that sucks you in every single match. it has all the fun and competition of gaming without the serious tone and attmosphere of other games.My only cons at this point are not really cons but more of what I would like to see become available in the game. I would like steam to support workshop for this game to create custom vehicle decals ad possibly even custom maps with obstabcles?

I loved this game 4 years ago when I got it but the game has gone downhill.First off you pay $20 for a game and then you have to keep paying for the game. If they want microtransactions they shouldn't charge for the game upfront. Since the things you buy can actually influence the game (car models) it's basically pay to win now.Also their insistence on making everything competitive has ruined the game. My favorite random game mode is now competitive only so I either have to compete or not play. The competition is so toxic. Literally league of legends has a better player base than this garbage.So this game is utterly garbage now. It was worth the money but I want RL2014 back not this current trash.,Rocket League®

You destroy someone just to get a quadruple bounce into your net 3 F***** times in a row. I F***** hate this F****** game. It's not once that I had a streak of 10 games in a row where monkey team mates either troll of FF after 15 seconds. I wish I'm exaggerating.5th EDIT Losing 5 10 games in a row isn't rare same with wins. Perform well or bad it's RNG what decides. You lead 2 0 last 35s enemy scores 3 goals that even they cannot explain how that got in and this happens nearly every day.3 random guys matched with 3 premade team is a nonsense this happens nearly every game.Final Edit this game will never get my positive review not in a hundred years.Frustrations and imbalance is present in every game.",Rocket League®

2018-06-30,0,0,1053,False,Recommended,I haven't had a game get a grip on my balls like this in awhile. After over 800 hours I feel compelled to write a review for my bottom . It's soccer with rocket cars. Extremely easy to pick up very very difficult to master. At the base level its fun to around like you're 6 years old in his first year of peewee soccer. You find new skins cars tires hats antennas boost styles goal explosions and chances to get ones that track stats or are painted a different color. They have random cosmetics drop in crates the keys are $1 each or can be traded for. Yes it would be nice to be able to just outright purchase the cosmetics you want but if you're used to player driven barter style economies (eg Guild Wars 1 TF2 etc) then it's nothing insane. You have 0 in game advantages for opening crates and the base game is easily worth the regular price let alone a sale. As you learn to not suck so bad you'll start to be exposed to the more advanced mechanics. Half flips aerial shots wall shots wavedashing dribbling flicking will break multiple controllers trying to even accomplish. There are basic practice minigames that let you hone the simple skills. Players can create their own practice maps to cover the more advanced mechanics and allow things to change over time while maintaining updated practices. The matches are 5 minutes. Goal replays and kickoff timer add a few seconds however a tie game will go into indefinite overtime. It's great for sneaking a match or two if you only have intermittent downtimes but can still steal hours of your life at a go. If you get bored of the 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 soccer matches you can play one of the other game modes basketball hockey dropshot or rumble. Private matches can be set up with a ton of mutators so you could play basketball with powerups and infinite boost. The world is your oyster.Overall I literally love rocket car soccer. 10/10,Rocket League®

2018-09-27,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games that is so hard not to love. There doesn't need to be a real drawnout love letter for the game it's simple it controls well and it's fun and could run on basically any machine too (on lowest settings) I read complaints about last years update adding essentially loot crates and keys and things. But I personally don't see a problem with it since it doesn't at all effect the gameplay experience you'd have to be pretty stupid to think a game is ruined because it has some paid cosmetics considering it doesn't at all effect the gameplay. Anyhoo I can't say anything competetively since this isn't a game I play with any kind of competetive attitude just a fun super cool game with jet powered RC cars playing soccer or basketball depending on the game mode. It's cheap it provides an enormous amount of entertainment and runs very well totally reccomend getting it if you have friends that play everything is better with friends D,Rocket League®

2016-01-02,0,0,612,False,Recommended,Have played this game for months on PS4 and am now diving into the PC version due to a few annoying issues with the PS4 version (which I won't bother getting into here). I'll give a brief rundown of a few pros and cons of this great game.Pros Addictive Fun Gameplay This game is simply a blast to play. It is one of those games that you'll tell yourself you'll play for an hour and then 6 hours later it's 3am and you're still going. The game controls really well the physics are mostly very good and it's a game that you feel you can constantly improve at and get just a little better and play a little smarter as you learn it which keeps you motivated. Beautiful Graphics Other than a few small missteps this is an impressive looking game particularly the backgrounds of the various stadiums. Great Soundtrack The music in the menu screens is just phenomenal there's nary a weak track to be found. I'll sometimes loiter in the menus longer than I should just because I don't want to stop listening to the music.Cons Ranking System is Terrible This is the one big flaw with the game. It's just a horrible attempt at a ranking system that honestly defies logic. Basically you gain and lose the same ranking points at game 1 as you do at game 10 000 which makes zero sense in a ranking system. Your ranking should fluctuate heavily in your first 50 or so games before slowly settling into a zone and the points you get from each match declining as your ranking gains more weight. Instead you have to grind your way up the rankings from the very beginning gaining a meager 6 8 points for your first win when you should be gaining 100+. Community Elements Are Lacking In Game There are no online teams or any kind of online leagues or tournaments in the game which is a huge disappointment (you can play a season mode offline). There isn't even any kind of in game friend system or easy way to invite a player to a party you're forced to use PS4/Steam's features to get a player into your group. Game Can be Humbling This is a game that can make you feel like a complete dolt at times as you inexplicably whiff on a ball you were sure you had lined up.Would definitely recommend this game to just about anybody even those who don't typically like sports or team games as it's so unique and entertaining that it deserves a look.,Rocket League®

I would however like to see more unique arena areas similar to what i saw in supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars as the different styles of maps made a huge difference when swapping through levels.

A cute game with a seemingly easy to learn jumping and going faster mechanic. Most of your matches will be spent not learning but having fun learning these two things. A rare occurence nowadays since in most games tutorials are their own thing. Psyonix made sure that advancement in skill and fun are seemless here. Try it.

2015-10-02,0,0,845,False,Recommended,Rocket leauge is a great competitive game. Matchmaking is quick for the most part and the ping is good if you are looking for matches in your area. The customization is good and isn't all too hard to unlock everything. There are tires cars paints antennas hats. All of the cars tires (etc) have been thought through and made fantastically so there isn't one car that everyone likes while the others are poorly designed. The game is really easy to play with friends and to have a good time and mess around or can be very competitive with ranked. Even though the game may seem repetitive to some players the more you play and the better you get the more fun you will have. I would highly reccomend this game. $20.00 might be asking a little to some people but i say that it is a fair price. In my opinion you should only buy this game if you want to endulge many hours into it.But I feel like it is a must buy sometime down the road for everyone.,Rocket League®

They where legit hitting it... Into the ING GOAL!! Other than the AI being as dope as . Its a good game. i still enjoy it though as you dont have to win to get a prize (new modification to your car).

2017-10-08,0,0,607,False,Not Recommended,I have had a lot of fun playing this game overall but I just found out that the ranking system intentonally creates win/loss streaks by pairing you up with other players who are either trending up or down. This seems very dishonest to me and I regret the importance I placed on percieved perfomance in ranked matches.,Rocket League®
2018-05-15,0,0,125,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an addictive game once a player learns how to control the cars. It's fun and can be fairly relaxing when playing in career mode (depends on the player based on how you play in multiplayer games).

2017-08-30,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,Played it since the release and it has a really steep learning curve. Once you get the controls it's quite some fun if you get to play with/against equal teams. I want to give it a thumbs up but matchmaking is pretty much non existent which results in completely ed up ranked games and tons of leavers in normal games.Edit 24.03.18 Community is still cancer. Matchmaking still sucks.Edit 07.09.18 Community a tad less cancer(still too much) and instead of giving us nice rewards for still playing we get to pay more for a bunch of useless locked behind another paywall,Rocket League®
2016-04-23,0,0,183,False,Recommended,If you have some good Matches its fun and with a good team its even better.As always in such PvP arena games...I don't know how good or bad matchmaking is but it seems that singleplayer or 2 player teams always have a massive disadvantage cause they often get beginners and lowskill Soloplayers in their team and get matched against premade teams. Even if you have a good team the matchmaking rips it apart and takes good teammembers from your team to the enemy team after one match.Events are fun and you get some things for your cars or something.Also many games there are too many unskilled players or trolls just jumping around stupily and disturbing more then they help. So even if you shoot 2 4 Goals on your own you get even more goals against your team cause some players are too confused with thier steering and just go for the ball like lemmings or bots skip the ball to the enemy or shoot owngoals.So in the end most of the time you have to watch for your own random teammembers that they don't ruin the game and this is extreme annoying after a couple of games even if you win.After so many games I can only partly recommend this game cause it is no fun at all if you see that you can win a game nearly alone cause the enemy is weak and just one unskilled player can ruin it all. And this is happening in 6 of 10 games. Or you get matched as soloplayer in 0 6 games with one minute left. But the rest of the games it is fun buy it in sale.,Rocket League®

2015-12-06,0,0,217,False,Recommended,It's car soccer (or football whatever floats your boat).Some people take this inherently silly game way too seriously but it's a fun game. Fun with friends fun alone. It gets intense at times but at 5 minutes long the games never have a chance to get so heated that it makes you truly steamed.You'll also routinely impress yourself with something you did half purposely half accidentally. Gameplay The gameplay is reliably pretty good and since the addition of mutators (alternate game modes with things such as a ball that's a cube) the game has a lot more variety. There's offline play if you can't do online but with some practice you might find that the bots aren't actually all that good except for the occasional impossible shot they'll make. 9.5/10Graphics/Visual Experience Unique to say the least. A good looking game without needing to be too showy. They're not trying to blow your mind with god rays and bloom and individually animated blades of grass but everything has a unified feel and looks like they really paid attention when making the game. 8.5/10Sound The sound effects are good and you'll quickly learn what each unique sound tells you about what's happening when your camera is pointing the other way. The directional sound is good enough that I can routinely dodge people trying to rear end me by listening to their engine. On top of all this the soundtrack is absolutely sublime. 10/10Replayability Somehow the gimmick of car soccer on only cosmetically different stages has some surprising life in it. This simple game doesn't get old nearly as fast as you'd expect. 9/10How it Runs Very well. Considering how simple the game is I'd be disappointed if it were poorly optimized at all.,Rocket League®

2015-11-19,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,"Pro side + Incredibly addictive and fun for a while.+ High skill cap.Con Side Fun only for a short while because the gameplay is actually incredibly shallow as well. No support for anything it seems except keyboard and XBOX controller. I can't get any of my Logitech or Thrust devices to work and I am not alone. There are mapping tools out there that have been suggested but also only work for a few of us. No friggin proper camera!No kidding this game has no proper camera! While mouse free look is standard in just about every single 3rd person view game on PC the developers of this game decided to skip this basic feature and just make it random whether you see anything or not. There are rumors it was to prevent advantages of PC players over console players since the game is cross platform. You can lock your camera on the ball getting your camera blocked by walls or losing sight of the goal other players or your own car while the camera is zoomed in on the ball in mid air or while driving along walls or you can lock the camera on your car losing sight of everything but your car again.Of course there is the camera swivel feature which is about as useful as the other camera features. You can't control the swivel degree you simply throw your head around in one direction and try to identify whatever just whizzed by on your screen because even if you stopped the swivel from going almost all the way to the rear it snapped back to the front view instantly. If you want to keep your eye on something to your side for longer than a split second you need to twitch the camera into that direction giving you some kind of epileptic vision which coincidentally is exactly the same effect you get when you try to use the swivel with your mouse movements. People quit nonstop. Whether it is connection related or intentional quitting you often feel like playing with and against a line of players. Every 20 seconds its ""next please!"". No proper chat support. Right only people on the PC version can write in/read the chat. The people playing on consoles are restricted to chat commands and unfortunately they seem to enjoy it a lot. Probably an incredibly high tech feature on consoles they love it SO much that many console players will spam the hell out of the chat commands. Together with the beep that comes with the command it gets annoying and is unblock able. You are only able to block people in voice chat. Lack of customization. Cars all have the same stats according to the developers' official statements but slightly different hit boxes. If I could tinker with my car tuning it with more than just a handful of visuals (and hats! wtf!) the fun would last a lot longer.Verdict Fun game but shallow and lacking the most basic features of ANY game namely Proper camera proper chat proper peripheral support.Not worth 20 bucks IMHO unless maybe you are a console player and got used to all the ridiculously low tech features anyway.",Rocket League®

2015-09-09,0,0,29,False,Recommended,EDIT They appear to have fixed the problem I was complaining about. As of January 1 2016 the online gameplay was fluid and smooth. Truly an enjoyable experience. This is one of (if not the) best competitive automobile soccer games on the market (a huge library to be sure.)The single player experience unfortunately is the same as below but with the improved servers who wants to play single player?Do NOT buy this game until they fix the servers. The lag makes this game unplayable online. Everyone rubberbands all over the court. I had a game where the ball just appeared in our net.If you decide to play this game offline with ai teammates you should also be prepared for disappointment. On rookie difficulty a toddler could destroy the ai 10 0. One step up to pro and it seems like you are playing against 7 players when it is truly 4 v4.I had a season where I lost 4 games 0 1. all 4 goals were scored by my ai teammates (out of 9 games.)I cannot believe a certain angry gamer gave this solid 4 game a 9 out of 10 with a badass seal of approval.,Rocket League®

2016-03-08,0,0,224,False,Recommended,One of the best games I've ever played aside from Zombie Army Trilogy Counter Strike Global Offensive and The Binding of Isaac. I enjoy playing this game with a few friends and kicking back. It's a bit of a challenge. You'll need a goal keeper and the others to go out on the field and play. At times the goal keeper will need to move from goal long enough to block the other teams goal or to help out a bit but not for very long.,Rocket League®

While playing it makes you yell at the game ""Yeah!!"" due to the amount of excitement it ramps up as the opposite side of the team always gives a 100 percent effort to scoring as well. Challenging and can be addictive with the right people. Controller is recommended.

2016-12-25,0,0,130,False,Recommended,About or over 100 hours and this game is still fun! (I played 2 months after release on PS4) I never liked playing Sports games because they never interested me but this is the only one that does. It has improved by so much from all the updates I missed out on (stopped playing for about 5 6 months on PS4) and I can tell the devs are working their best on this game. So far all maps and new gamemode updates are free Car DLC is not a must own You do not need a Middle End PC to run over atleast 55 FPS (I have a GTX 750 Ti and runs at a constant 60+ FPS and max is 125 FPS on Max Settings) Community isn't that cancer.. about a 3.5/10 cancer level I do recommend this game for anyone no matter what types of game you play(if you dont like competitive play dont play Ranked) Well optimized NOT a pay to win gameThe only thing i can think of thats bad is the Keyboard/Mouse bindings(Unless youre able to learn them fast)I personally use my PS4 controller.10/10,Rocket League®

When I began it took a good long while to acclimate to the controls and in general the physics of the game but I feel that I came along quite well.Undoubtedly this game is the best game I have ever purchased on Steam and I plan on playing for many years to come. If you have any sort of doubt about purchasing it dispel them becuase it was worth every penny. The few times you come across a toxic player do nothing to dull the wonderful experience that can be shared with other considerate and fantastic players. Co op is fantastic as well and my vocal chords have strengthened because of all of the screaming we've done....All in all a fantastic game. Cheers Psyonix.,Rocket League®

Not worth it even during sales.tl dr If you don't think you'll be able to get good at this game then don't buy itEdit Even if you think you can get good don't buy it. It's trash regardless.

Not only that your entire body regulates the angle at which the ball is launched so it's actually more akin to playing as a single foot of a soccer player trying to hit the ball just right. There's a lot of the tactical depth of a regular soccer game with an execution challenge layered on top. Awesome.,Rocket League®

2016-12-27,0,0,284,False,Recommended,"In my opinion one of the best games I've played over the past few months and if you like the idea of RC Cars combined with footbal/soccer it is definitely worth the 20 bucks.Rocket League has a great learning curve combined with a simple ""easy to play hard to master"" playstyle.Personally there are just a few downsides being a laptop player there are some maps which give me a FPS drop (for example Aquadome in which i play with 40 45 FPS rather than the usual 60) but with a decent PC you won't have that problem. The second downside apllies mostly to casual games where you find all those salty players who leave at the very instant when the other team scores a 1 2 or a 0 1.Overall it is a brilliant game with great gameplay mechanics and a mostly very nice community.",Rocket League®

I love the training excercises and single player modes you can do to train up as much as you want for online play. They recently introduced player made training exercises too which is a real plus for training on moves that were hard to consistently practice before hand.Only dislike I have is the lotto system they have for opening crates which you need to buy keys to open.

I have 31 hours under my belt of this game and im already a level 21 Pro its super fun i did all that in just a week!! its not hard to get good it definently took some getting used to but with enough of time and many bad games lol you will get better. I highly recommend using a controller as it is much easier than mouse and keyboard.VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV Read Below VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVOne problem I realised was that when i first got the game it was super laggy and it was not internet lag so if you are expirencing this here is an easy way to fix it. Simply go to your options and go to Video Settings switch all the settings that say Quality or High Quality to High Performance or Performance then uncheck the box that says Motion Blur at the very bottom now this last thing might not be necessary but go into a game and if you still lag then turn of High Quality Shaders at the very top of the check boxes.Other than that this game is excellent and by far my favorite game ever made I would recommend this to a friend or just a random person. It is so well made and is amazing and awesome! Hope this review helped thank you for reading it!,Rocket League®

2015-07-24,0,0,50,False,Recommended,I first played this game on the PS4 as it was free. Once I played a few matches and saw some of my friends had it on Steam I glady gave them my money and bought for the PC.What can you say aboutt his game? Fast frantic easy to pick up hard to master and get the timing down for lob shots and floating balls! Lots of options to customize your car and winning something after every match really makes you want to play one more to get the cool item! My only con is the lag sometimes on the servers as I only pick US East or West and while there are plenty of players online most of the time it is never a full game. The AI players in a MP match are brutal and usually the best player and just destroying everybody. I really hope they come out with maybe a different game type more cars more items and stages. I would gladly pay another 5 bucks for a DLC pack. Pick this game up you won't be disappointed!,Rocket League®

2016-05-14,0,0,290,False,Recommended,"Imma be realistic and try not to make out the game too well Pros Training Training training training This game has brought a new level and dimension of training You dont just go around hitting the ball Or doing some dumb task for points Proffisional players still use the training because it is very very realistic and gives great scenarios depending on the diffeculty of your chosen level so if you are new or a great rocketeer the training is a nice destination to head. There is no wait You dont wait for no games No loading screens No players (for more than 15 seconds if some jerk left the match before start) No waiting for dlc to buy even . You can just head on to the great training have a match with bots see the garage SOOOO may things you can do to spend that 1 minute match making Started from the bottom now it is here This game started as ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars! ""which was an indie game for PS3 made by a very talented person The game had its own fourm for all the players to talk and mengle And it had many good changes from that small game #Thank_Psyonix The Game is not controlled by any company or any one other than the developers . so dont expect some thing like tencent from that other league to come in and make you buy dumb stuff Customization If you wanna game you probably read that there are more than 1 BILLION diffrent ways to make your car well that is with out the new updates the dlcs and the epic stuff each car has . i would say no less than 1.4 Billion. Not Pay To Win No matter what some one told you Lets say you baught the batmobile It is no diffrent than a Battle Car that is free I dont remeber what it is called but there is a video of some one doing the math for every dlc car So the DLC is all just more customization Quick chat . You dont have to waste time typing There is quick chat which allows you to say stuff like Thanks! . Take the shot. Wow! OMG! ! #$ . The Players You rarely see a douch that says ""wow you suck "" or ""you should uninstall"" the game is just too fun for that i Guarentee that you will laugh so hard while playing it because of the derpy stuff that keeps happening Mute and report function God i wish more games had that You can even mute all players with 1 button. Not repetetive if you feel it is then there are sooo many modes you can play Still feeling that You have mutator setting to setup mini games and even prank some friends in a private matchCons The game Does not punish People hard enough if you leave any match it is a 15 min ban . with a loss ofc the player/s that are in your team will have a huge disadvantage and lose their match and maybe their rank even after leaving 4 times in a row it is still 15 min ban . The AI is not that good to be honest you can read it like the palm of your hand While i was level 8 i won a 1v1 vs an allstar bot becauase he was so easy to read at that time i didnt even know you could walk on the wall and jump. Ranked is open to every one So smurfs and newbies that think they got it will jump into ranked no problemo Trolling is super easy Like Really really easy . You cant change some DLC cars At the time of writing this there is only the time machine in back to the future and the batmobile that you cant change any thing about them except for color Which kinda sucks This is a small one but i think it is worth mentioning In the training you dont see the ball until like 3 seconds In the launcher trainings that makes it very hard to predict the ball so some times you have to memorize the training which isnt that realistec In my opinion the acheivments in this game are bad i didnt feel that i have acheived much with 32 Cant add friends Or party with console players .Final Rating 8.7/10 Should fix some stuffalso this game has alot of dlcs LOLyou should buy this if you are the guy that is competitve and wants to have fun",Rocket League®

2015-11-26,0,0,1855,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a very enjoyable and addicting game that can consume all of your time in what seems like just a few minutes. It's high action feel combined with the teamwork aspect makes it a great game to play with friends. There are so many play styles made possible by Rocket League's manuevering controls. It's as addicting as CSGO but takes about 1/12 the time to play a competitive game. It is easy to pick up but complicated enough to give challenges to players of all skill levels. The well created ranking system gives you motivation to get better. It makes for a great time with friends filled with lots of laughs.,Rocket League®

2015-11-27,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Oh perfectly wonderful...Let's start with game length it's short so there's no huge commitment time wise but it's long enough to get a bit invested in your team winning and notice who's on the enemy team. Then there's teams. You can get into a party with your buddies and keep going but the moment one of you has to leave that doesn't interrupt the others from continuing. Or if you accidentally get into a game without a party member when you leave the game you don't just automatically leave the party too. Then there's the actual gameplay pure genius. the physics are fun. Driving on walls is fun. Blowing people up is fun. Play this game if you like to have fun. The practice arena is nice for noobs to hone some of their skills and learn more about the mechanics of the game. It's missing something as far as challenge goes but it's hard to really go there with anything practice for video games. True practice comes from the arena. It really isn't optimal for a mouse and keyboard but hopefully the controller coming in... eventually... will change things for me. Anyway it's a great game for just hanging out having fun being indecent human beings and enjoying a good explosion or two.,Rocket League®

I would really like if keys could be acheived through playing the game.Secondly bots and afk people are not easily kicked. Sometimes I have to play a whole 5 minute game of ranked just so that I do not rank down even though it is an easy and time consuming win. Playing against these bots and afk people are somewhat common in ranked solo games.Other than these two things Rocket League is a really addicting and well made game. Please do not take these things into account too harshly when considering buying this game.Hope this helps. ),Rocket League®

2015-08-23,0,0,28,False,Recommended,I love this game well worth it's money. It's very fun and different. Most games like this get boring but this game doesn't very easily. I am having some problems. I take my computer over to a friends house and want to show them my stuff but they don't have internet and I'm in offline mode. I'm logged into my steam account but I'm player two not my profile so all my things are gone. So I thought it wasn't too much a problem but when I close the game and do something else and return to the game I have to start all over making the game pointless to play offline. Anyone else have/has this problem if you know how to fix this can you message me please. the kids were kind of sad all the stuff they unlocked was gone and the 3 hours they spent were for nothing. Another problem I'm having is split screen. i know it can but for some reason it won't. I believe I need two X box controllers or another controller all together but shouldn't I be able to play with my keyboard and mouse while the other player gets my controller? Any advice about this?But these little problems are mostly personal this doesn't take away from the game in anyway. It's still an amzing game and kids really really love it. Not sure if it's only me but losing the stuff bugs me didn't so much the kids but did to me. Other then those little problems I have nothing against this game. I love it and glad I bought it and I don't really buy games so that is saying a lot. I hope someone can help me with these little problems if so thank you if not enjoy this epic game.,Rocket League®

2016-12-29,0,0,113,False,Recommended,Rocket League brings fun soccer games but it's not for everyoneAs the header clearly states this is a very fun game on making soccer with speeding cars. The controls are fairly easy to learn on what moves you have to make during a fast paced match and you need to know when and where to do them. There are two camera angles you can play the game one is focused on the ball and the other is focused behind your car. Most of the time you will likely use the ball cam. Switching between these two camera angles will become necessary in a match depending on the situation.The soundtrack is good if you like upbeat electronic music some of them you might be interested in listening to outside of this game if you wish. Gameplay is solid and people will have fun playing this game no matter what your skill level is. I recommend playing this game either with friends or with other random people. My only complaint is that the gameplay can become repetitive if you do not 'spice' things up if you will. There are other modes of variety to offer but the core gameplay is still the same and the repetitive gameplay can turn some people off.If you think you want to buy this game or not I made a simple fan made trailer summarizing the game. It is a bit dated since I released this back in July 21st 2016 when it was up to date at the time. But the core gameplay is still the same. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 8aQxDEZl0RcThe DLC for the premium vehicles offered here is unnecessary and you don't have to get them to enjoy this game. Personally I didn't feel a very significant difference in gameplay when driving the DLC cars compared to the normal cars that everyone can get. Overall the game is fun with good gameplay if you like soccer car action in a videogame.8/10,Rocket League®
2016-12-29,0,0,72,False,Recommended,I absolutely love this game since it combines two of my favorite things cars and soccer.If you love either you will love this game. It is a very non demanding game that is very very easy to learn and get used to. One thing I would recommend is having your favorite controller ready to play with this game since the keyboard and mouse can be very hard to use.I love this game's customizability and the ingame items that you can buy such as dlc cars and keys are very well priced. Rocket league is a great essential game to have if you have a laptop and controller you can carry around and play games on. Overall this game would get a 9/10 from me.,Rocket League®
2015-10-09,0,0,1477,False,Recommended,Since I bought this game back in July I ve played Rocket League almost every day and I m still loving every second of it. The game is so simple so elegant in its design that regardless of your skill level it s easy to just dive in and have a great time whether you re playing it competitively or just for fun. It possesses that hard to define and often intangible quality that all the best games possess excellent game feel. That empowering sense of control where even the smallest actions you can perform feel good to do in and of themselves every significant one rewards you with satisfying visual and aural feedback. It all culminates to give you this this profoundly visceral experience where every barely missed goal every epic save every daring aerial manoeuvre it all inspires the kind of nail biting tension that has you on the edge of your seat inhaling sharply through clenched teeth.As it stands Rocket League is my multiplayer game of the year and it would take something absolutely mind blowing to dethrone it at this point. Kudos to all the men and women at Psyonix who helped to make this game a reality!,Rocket League®

Flawless mechanics Fluid control scheme (however i did change the drift button on my 360 pad to LB instead of X) Endless replayability each game feels unique in its playthrough (that is online) Endless customisation for the vehicles with new cosmetic items coming out regularly (couple of times a month on average) Offline gameplay will become boring fast i imagine most people do season just for the achievement anything other than 1v1 on ranked when you are playing solo can be potentially frustrating as there are bad apples in every community (or apples with pitiful motor skills) but its not hard to find a group or partner over all the community is quite friendly compared to most pc games As you can see from my playtime the snappy 5 minute games are hard to walk away from especially if you are winning,Rocket League®

Well you won t need any of those because all you need is a good connection and a controller. Welcome to Rocket League where as a starter it will be a struggle for you to get out of lower ranks due to smurfs. You will be flexed on with high end items and use a voice chat which sounds like the voice chat from 2000 s Valve games. Not to mention that if you live in Asia you will never find a game to play and you ll have to play on NA or EU servers where the ping is higher than the population in Asia.

I have 2500 hours in the game and I am not stopping any time soon. It's easy to get into the game and start learning the basics. You can join in matches and play with others at your skill.

The practice sessions are extremely helpful and the learning curve is concorded quickly and gives you are real sense of accomplishment when you celebrate your first goal by ripping off your Dorito covered shirt.

2015-10-13,0,0,168,False,Recommended,This game is absolute madness! In a good way.Pros Decent selection of options to customize your vehicle (more unlock as you play). Suspense filled matches as the timer decreases and both teams are on par with each other. Easy pre set chat options to help communicate with your team. Lots of fun especially with friends! Ranked play for thrill seekers. Nice selection of music tracks to listen to while in the menu. Graphics and gameplay are well done.Cons No clear distinction between vehicles in terms of hit boxes. I would suggest having hit boxes shown in a practice setting so players can find a vehicle that suits their play style (there really shouldn't be much difference as all the cars go the same speed but their hit boxes may skew the angles at which the ball rebounds). If you are playing a ranked match and your teammates decide to leave they won't be replaced. This basically means the opposing team will have an unfair advantage and automatically win the match and you will lose rank points just for getting paired up with toxic players. No anti gravity space mode where the real madness ensues. Can't drive upside down at the top of the stadium and drop down to scare people.,Rocket League®

2015-12-26,0,0,14,False,Recommended,"A highly polished version of Supersonic Rocket Powered Battle Cars First ImpressionsI debated getting this game for a long time as I had already played SRPBC on the PS3 to death.That game was insanely difficult due to horrible camera angles and lack of polish but once you mastered it is was a lot of fun with friends!Fast forward to the 2015 holiday sale where I saw the hype after 6 months was not dying down. For the price and for the nostalgia I decided to get it (as with most games on the sale... is this what they call ""hoarding""?).I am happy to see that this is pretty much the same game but with very clean cameras and it runs like butter on my 4 year old system on maximum settings.ProsHighly polished version of a game that was insanely fun but never got much coverage.Customizability letting you give your car a personalized touch though I'm not sure I like the microtransactions part.New modes and content being added to the game give this replayability.Matchmaking is very populated taking mere seconds to find you a match.ConsPeople rage quit matches after 1 lost goal. On 2v2 this is particularly annoying as you end up playing with AI vs a strong duo due to people wanting easy wins.I will update this review as I play more. For now my first impressions are very high regarding this game. My only regret is not buying this half a year ago.Also very important to note play this game with a controller. If you do not own one this might not be enjoyable for you.",Rocket League®

Now I love this game and when everything goes great is is one hell of a game those last min it moments where your down 5 to 0 and you make that epic come back those are great moments and you will truly remember them (also there is one more type of person there called the quiters they will either just leave the game if the other team scores 3 point and you guys have zero or even worse they try to make your team just give up and forfit.)

Flags etc. I can also wave my own country flag attached to my car. I love it!16/07/2018 If you are in India and are getting above 100 ping on all servers then turn your router ON and OFF. Do it a couple times till you get lower pings. This is a issue on your ISPs side assigning you to a zone in their network which just gives high pings all over accross most game you will ever play on the internet. I know this becuase I have had many times where I had low pings in the 60s as well for the same in game region. Go try it.,Rocket League®

It is also one of those games where it is very easy to pick up and play but is very difficult to master. I have over 50 hours in the game and I am just starting to make those incredible aerial hits you see in the videos. I have actually jumped out of my seat in exhilaration of an amazing play.

I don't think I will continue playing this game if it goes on like this. Literally all my friends have uninstalled it for good. Instead of your crates and idiotic chat ban system dear Psyonix do something about your disgusting community rating your game ""for ages 3 and above"" earns you a lot of money but it's gonna be us veteran gamers who'll play this game years after it stops being popular not those kids that you exclusively cater to.

The low time commitment (all matches are 5 minutes) is a huge deal for gamers who've grown up to find themselves without the spare time that we wish we had. The competitive potential for this game is limitless. It was just born and it's already getting tournaments.Get in on the ground floor now Rocket League's gonna be around for a while.,Rocket League®

2015-08-27,0,0,448,False,Recommended,"A great game that elegantly represents the idea ""easy to pick up difficult to master""The game shines in it's simple clean execution of a soccer game where the players are cars. There isn't a ton of information to wrap your head around. Pick a vehicle throw some decor on it if you want and hit the field.The bots are pretty good to newcomers although seasoned players will need to turn to online play to feel a real challenge. Even so you can work on your trickier shots in trainings seasons and exhibitions in order to feel more competitive in online play.The graphics are exactly what you'd want good enough to be pleasing but clearly not the focus of the game. The color palette is fun and energetic and the particle effects make you excited about scoring goals boosting around and demolishing the opposition.The sound is expertly crafted to provide enough atmosphere to feel immersed but not so much that it draws your attention from the real focus working as a team to score goals.Overall I'd say this is one of those games that everyone should have in their library eventually. It appeals to casual and hardcore gamers and the 5 minute match length means it's something you can pick up and put back down with ease. Well maybe not put down with ease. This game will definitely give you that ""one more game..."" itch and boy does scratching it feel good.",Rocket League®

Nice about you can play split screen if you have 1keyboard/controller and 1 controller. The rank system are done nicely. I like the physics in this game and how you manage to litterally fly with the ball marking an goal. You can pimp your car with an infinit of possiblytis. A lot of games like dropshot ruble hoops.Now come the contras **CONTRAS You can't trade or add player cross platform but only your platform. Is not so optimized they can do so much more with the engines. You can't choose the map on what you want to play on online They don't have the Market selling/buying things like wheels m. decals etc... You need to add an player to trade with him.You can't give him a trade link...*** After that i think i can recommend this game.,Rocket League®

2016-11-29,0,0,396,False,Recommended,"The story starts with that strange game called Supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars some years ago and I was wandering what a title that is? It sound like not one but two game trying hard to get your attention.Then I tried.It was like learning to go on bike all over again you can feel it. And meanwhile you are struggling around to control the car the way you want you have to hit that big ball to score just like in football.It had one of the most complex control scheme of the games I played and after awhile after you play online games against others and stumble on a skilled player (they were very few back then) and see them flying and striking a score meanwhile you are trying to understand where you are before you realize you are now watching the replay of the goal after that and then some. After all the shame you have felt for being ""bad"" you take all your faith you have in yourself and with the ball floating way way up in the air you jump hit the boost after having tilted your car upwards and try to guide it where the ball will be in the next 0.5 seconds. Scared you see the oppent doing the samething. You have to be there first. Boost! You hear the virtual metallic clash and as the ball start going downwards but the trajectory is far off what you wanted. No time to even think that you could have done better and you see your teamate charging through the field with beams comin out of his wheels and hitting the ball at full speed and sending it right in the oppent's goal. The ball explode. Joy and brotherhood.A rush that hardly elsewhere you can feel.Oh yes now in Rocket League!So glad you have developed these games Psyonix.And here I think there is much more room then only multplayer for such a massive freedom of control of this funny cars!",Rocket League®

But I don't recommend it you people who get triggered in a second because this game already has to much of toxic players.,Rocket League®

2015-09-04,0,0,179,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is an exceptional implementation of physics in video games. It's an offshoot of the sport soccer where players control cars that kick a giant ball trying to score points by getting it into a goal. The premise sounds simple enough but the clever implementation of physics and a high skill ceiling to abuse them transforms an idea that may sound novel and slightly unweildy to an experience that is both exhilerating and addicting. GAMEPLAY &amp PHYSICS Momentum and angles are everything. You need the momentum to kick the big floaty bouncy ball across the pitch and into your opponents' goal but you have to hit it at the right angle to get it in. Considering this you're controlling a car so you can go fast but can't turn on a dime so the game gives you some unique tools to utilize. You can jump for one thing and pressing the jump button again without pressing a direction on your keypad/control stick makes you double jump but if you mash a direction when you press the jump button while in the air your car will flip and move in that direction giving you an important amount of air control. This is how players ""kick"" the ball and the feeling of rushing down the field jumping and flipping into the ball so it gets in the goal is nothing short of satisfying. Another important tool is the boost gauge which is the one finite resource you have. Boosting at max speed gives you a monstrous amount of momentum and provided you hit the ball at the right angle it's a shot that is very difficult for the opposing team to defend because the ball is moving so fast. Also if you collide with another player at max speed you can destroy their car in a glorious explosion giving you a precious few seconds of advantage while they respawn. Using boost is the highest risk as you lose control the faster you go and you need to conserve it to overtake opponents when they have control of the ball. It can be refilled by moving over glowing spots dotted on the field and it's important to strategize your movement across the field to cover those spots when you're running low. Combining these tools and learning to properly use them is the key to getting good at this game and their deceptively simple implementation gives it an easy to play hard to master aspect that is instantly approachable to all typse of players.PERFORMANCE &amp CONTROLLERS This game is absurdly well optimized and though my GPU is fairly old (AMD HD 7850) it ran at a smooth 60 FPS from the very first time I booted up the game. The only thing I needed to change in the options menu was to tick the Borderless Window option. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you use a controller. It's a third person driving game and as far as precision goes a keyboard is sub optimal. There are no sever issues or connection issues that I've encountered it's as simple as clicking ""play online"" selecting a game mode and waiting for a few minutes. You can even customize your car and mess with options while in a party with friends. *cough*CS GO*cough*AESTHETICS &amp CUSTOMIZATION On this last topic I have to say what really makes me happy is that there are no tangible gameplay advantages you can get through unlockables. All of them are cosmetic so you can drive a stinkin' big van and it's just as effective as the sleek sports car your friend is using. You can also add decals different looking wheels change your paint job (sadly restricted to different hues of red/blue for the 2 teams) accessories for your car's antenna different particles that come out of your car's afterburner when you boost and even hats. You earn them after every round win or lose. There is DLC for cosmetics but no microtransactions. CONCLUSION As far as taking a real life sport and imbuing it with the kind of creativity you can only get from video games Rocket League is to Soccer what Mario Kart is to NASCAR. A competitive game as fun as it is whimsical. But what Rocket League has over Mario Kart and its ilk is that it levels the playing field for everybody where the only thing that can get you to the top is pure skill. I highly recommend it.",Rocket League®

It can be played online or against bots although I highly recommend playing online because the bots are terrible teammates. Its skill based matchmaking works very well so if you aren't good or you're new to the game then you're set up against people that are in the same position but if you're good at the game it get very competitive.

2015-12-24,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Easy for anyone to pickup straight away. The semi random nature of the physics of the game make it a joy to play. It is very emersive and has a massive grin factor. The visuals a perfect and keep you focused on the game. Has lots of collectables and game types/modes for variation and the online multiplayer nature of the game is seemless. I generally can't stand playing online with real people but here it is absolutely fantastic and gives Rocket League its X factor.Is it worth 10? CompletelyIs it worth 20? Yes definatelyIs it worth 30 . . . I would have just walked on by but after playing it Still Yes!!!This is one of those games you can have a quick 10 minutes on if you wish to get the feel good factor or get long term enjoyment out of it.

Great game for stimulating your competition vein. Sometimes the community can be a bit ""unpolite"" specially in one on one duels. I've found as many trolls as nice people. It doesn't matter much but beware of the SALT.Overall this game is a solid 8.0 out of 10.0 right now.

I find this game to be more laid back and chill put on some music and party up with your friends. I would recommend this game to anyone if you like video games racing video games soccer games sport games or even just wanna try something new.

I highly suggest purchasing the DLC with the customizable cars and different flags/decals that come with it if you are looking to play the game for a while and have new content!In short This game is fun and simple and is really easy to play once you get the controls down!

2015-07-23,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Probably the most fun I have had in a while. It's a simple premise that makes out to be great fun. It's just so crazy in concept that it is golden in practice. The tutorial section does very well to introduce all the tips and tricks for newcoming players to basically put them on the same base a regular player.I have to say the best part about this game is that it rewards you for playing the game by giving you more customizable parts ranging from cars decals wheels and oddly hats. It gives you all of that for simply playing instead of having to use microtransactions. The only complaint I have is that the decals are specific to each car so if you unlock a cool skull decal for one car it won't work for the other. But that is only a minor issue.The gameplay is awesome and a blast to play with friends. If you've seen the youtubers play this just imagine how fun it is when you are behind the wheel.,Rocket League®

You can customize your favorite car with new wheels paint job turbo colors and a lot more!!!

2015-11-25,0,0,949,False,Recommended,"""Yo man check out this game!""... they said.""lol silly football with cars""... I thought.So I eventually got the game and guess what it's one of the most surprising titles I've played for a long time. The graphics are very polished the game runs great. Matches are short and it takes you 20s from starting the game until being ingame. It's even possible to play without sound.The matchmaking lets you choose between standard and ranked matches for 1v1 2v2 3v3 etc. It's great together with friends. The crossplatform play works well and really helps the game's population.If your friends bug you to get this game you probably should. The game is actually easy to learn but hard to master (Kronovi anyone?).",Rocket League®

2015-10-15,0,0,1390,False,Recommended,The best multiplayer game to come out in years. The short 5 minute matches are intense fun and addictive. I can never play just one. There is also a very pleasing natural progression of skill for those who stick with it. Operating the vehicle becomes second nature. Moves that were hard at first become no brainers. Tricks that seemed impossible become doable and then become all the time occurances.It's also one of the ultimate online team games. 2v2 and 3v3 have globally ranked boards to climb with 1 or 2 friends. Team familiarity and communication become a must as rank rises and the competition gets stiffer but just as the skill naturally increases over time so too does the team work as everyone finds a way to mesh their own unique style of play together into a cohesive whole. And after all experiencing the joy of that last second buzzer beater to end a hard fought match is best with buddies to share it with.Do I recommend this game? Yes. Absolutely a must own. (I also recommend investing in a controller to play it but it's not required.)If you are at all intrigued watch some online pro teams play on youtube. It's great stuff.,Rocket League®

One I'd love to see in the future is cross platform parties.

The rank system is well put together the queue time is rather quick and the controls are seamless. I do however recommend that you use a controller to play this game seeing as the keyboard makes it much more difficult to accurately control the vehicle.Buy it if it is $25 or less,Rocket League®

2017-07-21,0,0,699,False,Recommended,Well it's been almost 2 years since I started playing this I have to admit it's a good game(but I'm still noob asf). You guys sure have passed through this moment when you want to play games but you can't find any good game to play to spend your time. This game can get rid of that I guess because no matter how long you play this game you will never get tired. Also you can do amazing things in rocket league such as flying around scoring goals freestyles learning techniques to trick your opponents...At the first I got attracted by its playstyle because football(soccer)+flying cars with boost looked so cool. It is what every boy likes I guess.It is hard at the start to controll the car and the ball but after 1 or 2 months of practise I'm sure that people can do it perfectly fine (the aerial and freestyle part you have to practise more tho).Unfortunately there are always haters and toxic players but that's not the point to not buy this game.Well JUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Rocket League®

2015-09-24,0,0,119,False,Not Recommended,when the game first came out it was a great game but once they updated the physics it went south real quick wish you guys didnt mess with the physics or the game would have been one of the best games ever. went from a 9/10 to a 5/10 bc now the ball takes the worst bounces that shouldnt happen and then speed up and slow down in the worst weays possibles and you can just nip the ball oh so slightly and it will go halfway accross the map but then you hit it head on at full speed and it doesnt go anywhere like whats up with that? Now why does the ball go backwards even tho you hit the ball last or if the ball doesnt hit anyone else like tht screws a whole game up when its a t bug that never happened before the first major update.... i give the game a 5/10 now since the release and just maybe it will get better after the horrible update that ruined this amazing game. so do i recomend this game? yes and no go back to the drawwing boards and fix everything you screwed up on and maybe ill come back and try it out after the next main update,Rocket League®

2015-09-24,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Well... what can I say its football with cars!Rocket league is honestly a very fun gam even if your not big in to cars or football like me!There really isn't much to say on Rocket league as its a fairly simplistic game.There are two teams ranging from 1v1 matches 2v2 matches 3v3 matches and 4v4 matches.Each team tries to hit the ball into the oppositions goal as you would expect.However there are some extra game mechanics introduced with rocket league to mix up the games flow.I wont go into detail on them all however I will talk about some.Tricks Whilst playing you are taught to use a variety of tricks and stunts to help you get ahead of somebody or to hit the ball into the goal. There are many combos you can try out to see what tactic works best for you. You are taught these in the training coarse.Boosters Boosters are the name I've given to the little speed boost you achieve in game. Throughout the match you will achieve energy for extra speed that can be activated at any time. What this does is it basically acts like rocket boosters (hence the name of the game) that increase your speed while driving OR if you use it in the air you can begin flying for a very limited time allowing you to pull off some epic shots mid air!There are many other mechanics such as wall riding jumping (and double jumping) which you can see for yourself on youtube or in the game.Pros Incredible gameplay.Fast pacedHectic games (especially in 4v4)SPLITSCREEN so when your friends come over you can all play together and pull off some great shots! Supports up to for people.Extremely well optimized. (As you would think)Suprisingly decent graphics (when on max settings 1080p)Anybody new or expert can acheive incredible goals and saves. If your picking up this game for the first time its almost a guarantee that you will pull off tons of awesome shots during your time playing this.Car customizationCons Slightly pricey at $20 USD but I promise it is worth every penny.Matchmaking is a little rough at this point in time for most people for me personally its been very good with minor delays here and there.Final verdict 9/10The problems people have been experiencing with connections hasn't affected me to badly and the gameplay during the matches is just awesome (especially when with friends!)The seems to suffer from very little problems (aside from other peoples matchmaking experiences) and the gameplay is just plain ridiculous and fun to play with your friends.,Rocket League®

2015-09-25,0,0,28,False,Recommended,Where do I even begin with this. Rocket league is a fantastic game that runs well on most pcs. the game itself is very fun and addictive yet intuitive and simple. the game is frustrating at first because of janky controls but you do get used to them and they become amazing over time. the online support is amazing and it perfectly puts people into skill groups so you don't fight a mlg pro on your first time playing. The game is awesome to play with friends and is a great game over all but I do think that it could use some different maps and perhaps even some more gamemodes.

2017-03-07,0,0,570,False,Not Recommended,Possibly one of my favorite games honestlyFor a casual player this game is perfect for the competitive not so much.Recently Psyonix has given more time and appreciation into making new crates and new customization options for your cars (to put them in crates and make more money) and have been paying less and less attention into fixing common issues rubber banding FPS drops on highly capable systems and general server lag with internet also capable of handling the game. It's always been a good game at it's core but as long as Psyonix stays on this path of caring less about their playerbase and more about the money it will succumb into the same path Valve was once brought down. Simply using people for their money saying they will fix these common problems and still no light has been shed on these same problems. Still terrible network lag still FPS drops rubber banding customization bugs at times random crashes servers dropping out at random times and new updates coming in late (albeit that may be subject to a Steam issue too.)Yes I will continue to play this game. But as far as this goes I'm not happy about their ways. I'd probably get a refund if I still could. Overall has a lot of issues. It acts like it's an early access game but then acts confident in other ways. I've always been passionate for the game but it seems some of these things will never change as it comes to the kinds of people that develop these competitive type games. Same thing happened to CS GO TF2 Payday 2 and Call of Duty (an obvious choice).Don't buy if you're looking for a competitive game to settle your debts. It sucks in that way.If you're looking to just have a bit of fun in unranked gameplay BUY! Now. It's great. Otherwise don't.,Rocket League®

2017-07-13,0,0,491,False,Recommended,Rocket League invents a new sport of its own using driving and ball physics. + The core mechanics are flawless. Controls are smooth and hitting the ball feels rewarding. And it's difficult requiring precise timing and spatial awareness. Beyond the robust foundation the game may not be for everyone. It relies on matchmaking which won't always give you a good time. And it's severely skill based so when the initial wonder of flying cars wears off you'll need to find motivation to practice and improve your skills to experience any new gameplay.9 / 10 DRIVING GAME.,Rocket League®

2015-10-20,0,0,198,False,Recommended,Rocket League the relaunched version of the well known SARPBC game is the follow up and improved (imo) version of it's older brother. The game is simple you have multiple amounts (1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4) of players that battle eachother with rocketpowered toy cars and try to get the ball in the opponent's goal. Sounds pretty simple and that's Rocket League's strength.. AT FIRST.You start out with equal ranked players unless you have more experienced players in your party and you start the basics. Jumping Double Jumping Defending Trying to ACTUALLY hit that ball without looking like a 'noob' etc.The more matches you play the more experienced players you encounter (granted there's high level players who are at the game too) the more awesome goals you'll see happening.Hovering Learning how to play with your team.. That's the harder part.You can design your own cars with the unlockable stickers/decals/styles/hats/trails/.. and that's fine. You can choose how you look in this game but there's some actual restrictions (you'll find out).Do I recommend this game? Yes!Is it unplayable without controller? For me it is..Do you need to buy DLC for it? Not really it's all about your personal choice. Stadiums are free.Is it better on PC or PS4? For me it's the same since I play with a PS4 controller but typing goes faster on PC.. That's it.Hope you have fun with it the game is worth the money either way!,Rocket League®

After allmost 500h of gameplay I still don't know how to do some amazing wall tricks or even play properly. On one side we have a good game fun to play. I can't tell much about graphics cuz I play on PC with low med settings. But nothing is gold ( as my current rank ) because community is going toxic. Report button is there just to send chat logs and it does nothing. In the last 4 5 months after one patch this game become a glitch fest for me and my friend. 70% of the games I lose are because ball slips over my car or it went through it. Opponent cars are sometimes faster than my car for no reason. Most of You will say it is about ""skill"" and I acknowledge that but when the game wants You to loose You will lose. This glitches bugs or whatever You shall call strange movements of a ball could be because of slow internet I accept that but when everybody ( not everybody cares ) can see that I doubt so.

The devs really care about their creation and that's pretty evident in how they are continually updating it. A game about car football doesn't take itself seriously thankfully so it's full of quirky things like crossover cosmetics and celebrations. Splitscreen in any modern game is such a nice thing to see also. Well worth the relatively low cost.,Rocket League®

Throwing my car into another one with boost active just creates a huge pleasure explosion when I see the words ""Demolition"" pop up at the top of my screen. Even though points aren't rewarded for that it's still fun as hell.Pros Fast paced exciting gameplay.Match making is really good.Servers have great connection.When I connect to New York servers I'm finally getting players from around that area and not from Asia or something.Easy to run doesn't need a powerful computer to get 60fps.GRAPHICS ARE FANTASTIC FOR A LOW PC REQUIREMENT GAME.Cons Although it is good sometimes matchmaking has trouble finding players of your skill level so you can be left with a rookie against two masters (this happens frequently).Boost drains like incredibly fast.Small amount of bugs. Ex. clipping out of the arena floating in the air for the rest of the game even after goals are scored.This game is very good for its price of only $20 personally I could see this game getting bumped up to $40 or even $60 when it becomes an eSports game. Hopefully that doesn't happen but in my eyes that's how much this game is worth.This game is a hell of a lot of fun to play with one buddy two buddies and even three buddies. Or you can leave them all behind and go play a 1v1 or you can get randomized but that's not really the point of this game. The point is to bring all of your friends together to form a big team as this is what makes the game fun.The game is a solid 8/10.

2015-07-13,0,0,14,False,Recommended,Rocket League honestly one of the most addictive games I have come across in a while it's something that finally brings something different to the table other than FPS's. You've got soccer/football (what ever it is in your country) race cars and bots that aren't complete aids. Not to mention that the Graphics of this game are amazing even if you don't have a super strong pc you can still handle on playing the game. I'd give that game a 8/10 rating from my experience. So I am just going to throw in a little tally chart.Pros+ Amazing graphics + Good flow + Customization + Cars + Explosions + Soccer Cons None 24/7 servers Yeah that's all I can think of,Rocket League®

2015-07-10,0,0,277,False,Recommended,I've always found the greatest love in the smaller games. Super Hexagon is one of my favorite games of all time. Hand of Fate is my go to Dungeon Crawler. This game is the top of a list I didn't know I had. It has been a very VERY long time since a game has literally invoked knee jerk reactions from me.And this occurs nearly everytime I just go to hit the ball.Rocket League will invoke an andrenaline surge very few games will pull off. You will spasm shiver jump and make ridiculous noises numerous times per game.The game is simple you and up to 3 other people on your team compete against another team to put the ball in the other's net. You do so by reaching ludcious speeds well timed jumps and occassionally flying.The only unlocks are cosmetic and you get one unlock per completed match chosen randomly. There is no performance enhancement except skill.This game is fast and it will take a lot of time before you start figuring out the timing of jumps and when you should hang back as a goalie.My one and only complaint is that the game leaves much of the phsyics instruction for you to figure out. The tutorials and practices really just put balls in the air for you to it. It does nothing to teach you the finer points of actually hitting a moving ball in play.For $20 which is perhaps a tad steep given the content this game offers tons of replayabilty with a sense of focus excitement and the side effect of unintended exercise from when you finally hit the ball at breakneck speed while in the air flipping forward and rocket the ball across the field and into the net causing you to jump three feet up and slam your knees into the desk.,Rocket League®

2015-07-12,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Edit It's been about 18 hours now. I still love the game but the crashes are occuring more and more frequently it feels like. If it keeps at the current pace with crashes I think I may have to change my recommendation for this game. Hopefully within a week they fix these issues.Edit Also adding to the top of my review that this game has split screen local co op! That right there is an awesome feature to consider buying the game. So if you have 2 PC controllers you could play with your friends or significant other in the same room on the same desktop!While I love this game there are still some bugs. The ones I have seen in my first 4 hours are items not counting what they should (time goals etc) and I have had consistent crashes to desktop when loading the garage. The positive side is at least these bugs aren't directly impacting my games but it is an impact on the gaming experience.The awesome part about this game is that it has the competitive fun feeling I remember from playing Unreal Tournaments capture the flag but of course this is a different format. The unreal engine has to be one of my favorite engines for games like these. It is beautiful clear and it gets the job done. The hitboxes do need some fine tuning but overall it is a very polished experience during the game. I have had almost no issues with lag or dropped FPS (I am choosing to search for games on my part of the US). I am recommending this game and hopefully some friends decide to get it. If you do hit me up!Edit About 10 hours into the game now. I have had a couple games with lag but it isn't that many compared to how much I have played. A couple of things I would like is more customization options. Mainly I want to be able to have different flags and headgear for each team. For instance if I am red I wouldn't mind having the fire truck helmet but when I am blue I would maybe want something else. Also it would be nice if there was an option so that the flags and helmets follow the color scheme of your car and I don't think it should be mandatory but like I said an option. As far as multiplayer is concerned a lot of people rage quit early on but it is kind of funny because the AI that takes over for them actually does better. There was a game where it was 0 3 we were losing. My teamates rage quit and I stayed with my bot buddies and ended up winning 7 4. This could be a problem because I shouldn't have been able to win but I guess people are still getting used to the game so bots may be better than the average player for the first month or so. Also there should be a penalty for those who consistently rage quit. Other competitive online games have solutions for this and I think rocket league should look at other games to see what has worked better than what hasn't.,Rocket League®

Drive your rocket fueled car to victory using any manuevers you can only dream of in 5 minute rounds and if it comes to it overtime.the game is very rewarding as you win items and crates constantly just by playing.

2017-03-19,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a multiplayer game of angles and timing. The only difference here is that you use a car to hit a ball. Playing for a long time doesn't guarantee you becoming skilled but you'll have a solid base and hopefully don't repeat the same mistakes you made when you first started playing it. Most people will let you know about it using chat commands sarcastically or call you whatever swear words you can think of. I don't want people to be put off by this cos it's something you can expect from any multiplayer game but since the teams are smaller than in FPS games you get a bigger whiff of the hatred thrown in your direction and the guilt from making a mistake is higher cos most games are 2v2 or 3v3. Therefore your teammates also have a lower tolerance for mistakes so get used to losing a teammate when you mess up even with them risking a time penalty in competitive mode. 1v3 or 2v3 matches can build character or completely throw you off your game but that's all that Rocket League has ever been a game of skill not a cutesy football game with cars.Recently they added a custom training mode which was long overdue cos personally I lack the imagination to grow as a player so I need these new tutorials to get a sense of how all these tricks work and there's a lot of them. A few hundred hours ago I thought once I master aerials I will be set but consistently executing well timed aerials is the bare minimum of Rocket League and I can't even manage that most of the time. I swear I'm still making the same mistakes I made when I first started cos one thing I'm so used to using ball cam that I'm often missing shots on the ground and in the air as well. In a way I've painted myself to a corner and I'm stuck in a limbo of ascending and descending between Prospect I and II in Solo Standard. I've actually regressed in my playstyle and stopped taking risks which freezes your judgement and makes you prone to even more mistakes. No matter how much hatred or disappointment is expressed at your expense never forget that the real goal here is to have fun.All this depressing stuff aside Rocket League is incredibly fun otherwise I wouldn't still be playing it. You always want to get better at it. If it weren't for the incredibly responsive and accurate controls this would not have been the success that it is. Being focused enough to anticipate every move the trajectory of the ball and to perfectly time your shot is the entire game.,Rocket League®

2015-11-04,0,0,99,False,Recommended,This game has stolen my soul or at least my free time.Some recommendations for those starting out make sure to take some time playing the exhibition games against bots. Once you get the basic mechanics down take some time to slow down and plan your moves and shots more carefully. Chasing the ball everywhere is a sure fire way to lose a match.In the standard 3v3 match be aware of the roles that typically need to be played someone to center the ball someone to strike the goal and someone to stay back and defend. Ideally players rotate through these roles as the game ebbs and flows but sometimes it's better to stick back there in the goal and defend if no one else will.The subreddit is pretty active and a great place to get tips.Enjoy!,Rocket League®

2015-08-15,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,Fun enough if you have a full team of PCs but the AI is complete garbage. On more than one occasion I have seen them actually run the ball straight into their own goal. They also quite often knocked the ball away from the opposing goal. In addition the game is not as in depth as i though it would be going in. I had hoped that the different cars would have different attributes but all that changes between them is the hitbox. The devs have straight up said that though. I wish I had waited for it to go on sale and I should have done a bit more research before buying it this just wasn't what I expected.,Rocket League®
2015-08-16,0,0,93,False,Recommended,I highly recommend this game why? Graphics artstyle and gameplay is great.

2018-01-04,0,0,940,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a game that is easy to pick up and hard to master. The fun in the game comes from the never ending drive to get better and the ability to play with or against friends. Optional paid cosmetics also allow players a reward for playing online and helps establish a trading economy that the developers are very mindful of.

2016-05-08,0,0,16,False,Recommended,Lauded for its intuitive controls balanced play and pick up and play multiplayer in every which way (be it online or split screen lan) the simple concept of car soccer has never been so appealing. The developers are big now but a happy community has always been their #1 priority. A controller is recommended to prevent carpal tunnel. This is a phenomenal game to play at all ages and appeals to every genre. I've detested racing games or anything related to a sport but after enough peer pressure and I've already sunk a respectable amount of hours into it. It works as a pick up and play because of its short time spans in each game 5 minutes. You can play up to 4 cars a side and it now has hockey and basketball types. Worthwhile content is free but you pay extra for cosmetic cars and decals. Matchmaking is fast and the competitive rank up system is a nice touch to keep you interested in playing from time to time. A note for people starting out I'll add that this is one of those games that can be rewarding or horribly punishing when you first start. You'll feel like you're aimlessly chasing dipping dodging and diving around this ball. You could score on your net or hit a field long goal because you hit it a certain way. Don't be so hard on yourself and know that half of the game is predicting where the ball is going to be so you can hit it.When it's on sale or if a friend thinks you'd like it pick it up. You'll surprise yourself just like I did.,Rocket League®

2017-07-09,0,0,204,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of the best games ever in my opinion. It combines 2 completely different concepts cars and soccer and fuses them together in a fiery explosion of goal scoring insane plays unbelievable freestyle aerials (which I can't say I can do... YET!) and just an amazing game all together. I love the whole entire system of customization which ranges from car bodies to rocket boosts to goal explosions. The soundtrack is top notch best of any game I've played. The recent addition of some insane pumping beats from Monstercat get me hyped for some soccar everytime I launch the game. There is many different gamemodes from classic Soccar to slippery Hockey dunking Hoops sophisticated Dropshot and powerup packed Rumble. There is also a competitive ranked season for more serious players which is satisfying when you win but can make you salty if your team isn't exactly on point hehe. It is also entertaining to watch the streams of the Rocket League Chsmpionship Series on Twitch an organized Esports event where the pros go head to head competing for a large prize pool of money. All in all Rocket League is a supremely fun game which I highly reccomend. I seriously hope that you reading this reveiw will invest 20 bucks for a game that will give you hours of clutch plays amazing overtime wins and addmittedly some rage along the way! (There's the ups and the downs eh?) I extremely reccomend!!!,Rocket League®
2015-11-29,0,0,227,False,Recommended,Wow this game exceeded my expectations. I was expecting a car game where you drive around and hit balls into goals. I got that but I also thought that it would be really boring and would be a game trend that fades away quickly. That's one reason I was hesitating to buy this. I waited until it was $13.99 on sale and I bought it. The graphics are AMAZING for an indie game the gameplay (even the singleplayer which I play a lot) is very smooth and fun to play. So far the community that I've met is very friendly and are never poor sports. I really like all the customization options you have and that you can have antennas that are video game and company based (VAULT BOY WOOT). As a child I used to play a lot of racing games like Project Gotham Racing for the 1st Xbox and I can just tell that if I were a kid (not a squid) I would love this game even more than I do now. (NOTE I recommend playing with a controller because it's much easier to play with. I use the Xbox One controller when I play. Oh and the keys are all able to be remapped.) This is the first review where I've actually written over 6 sentences. I rate this game 10/10.July 4th (2016) Edit Okay I'm coming back late July 4th to revise my review. I now have 54 hours and I have become addicted to this game again. I've learned the ways of double jumping and predicting people's actions and I'm now practicing aerials. I'm level 27 and I can say that this game is still very fun when you get competitive at it. Now I am not the best level 27 but it's still fun to play. Also playing this game with friends is very fun (WHEN THEY PLAY WITH YOU) and it can be very funny at times and very very salty. You may say things you don't mean too... (like I'M NEVER PLAYING COMPETITIVE WITH YOU AGAIN YOU SCORED TWICE ON OUR OWN GOAL!) It's all fun.I do really recommend this game but remember it's easy to start playing but very VERY hard to master.July 9 (2017) Edit I'm an expert (lvl 40) now and I have 206 hours. This game is good. That is all.,Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,40,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an awesome game for messing around or for competitiveness with friends. The GoodsAddictive and astoundingly enjoyableController support (going to talk about this a little bit more later within the review)HATS!!! (TF2 lovers like myself will buy for the hats alone)Online and private matches/matchmakingCustomization is phenomenalGraphics are pretty awesome and doesn't take all that much to run.Even though I've only had this game less than three days I thoroughly enjoy practicing with my friends and joining in lobbies with random players as well! Customization is detailed and gives your car an original look. I have an outdated WIndows XP and I can run this at 60 100fps+ 95% of the timeThe BadsAI can be a little bit dysfunctional and qwerky even at higher leveled botsThe party function tends to not work. Even though it's not a particularly big part of the game it can be annoyingKeyboard layout and handling is very strangeI played a round of Unfair (1v2 and the bots are incredibly difficult) and would sometimes not even try to block a goal when they're near or at the goal. The party function doesn't break too often but I've seen it happen a couple times and it's purely annoying. Keyboards are almost not viable for play because the turning is very loose and frustrating. Other than that this game is a precious jewel.Overall I would rate this at 8.5/10 great game,Rocket League®

You will need some time to get used to the controls and using the ball cam as often as possible (and still be able to drive properly because the camera stays on the ball all time and controls get reverted fast.)Extremely competitive game with a really good ""easy to learn hard to master"" mindset.Oh and you get tons of hats.",Rocket League®

2015-07-24,0,0,795,False,Recommended,"+Amazing game! It's simple enough that anyone can pick up the basic mechanics quickly yet has a high enough skill cap to keep you coming back for more serious competitive gameplay. It's so addicting that I find myself watch streams of the better players when I'm not playing. I am not a big gamer so that's quite unusual for me. I do wish there was more choices for customization that won't need to be bought as DLC. I feel there aren't enough dare I say ""girly"" or ""cute"" customization options. I want my car to be cute dammit! +I have a 6 year old laptop with w7 duo core at 2.5gh 6g's ram gtx260m and can run the game at 60 fps on medium low settings.I'd recommend to everyone even if you don't like sports or sports video games.

2015-09-02,0,0,3403,False,Recommended,I love it but it only plays a maximum of 2 or 3 games before shutting off my whole computer (usually only half of a game). I have a 1200W Coolmax Power supply and 2 Nvidia GXE 760's so I think it would be an issue with the game since it runs games like GTAV online with no lag on highest settings.

2015-07-19,0,0,5,False,Recommended,This is a very fun game to play. The mechanics are easy to learn but take some time to master. It seems easy just get the ball in the goal but physics always has its own ideas and thwarts you more than your actual opponents. I enjoyed it immensly even though I had bouts of frustration as my teammates were about as intelligent as a melon.,Rocket League®
2015-07-19,0,0,16,False,Recommended,Extremely addictive game with some of the most pure skill based play you could imagine. This game is the type of game where you can easily pick up the basics and jump into some matches and have loads of fun. At the same time the skill ceiling is extremely high because of how precise the physics are. learning to truly control the ball and the car at the same time is quite difficult but extremely rewarding once mastered. Im not a car guy nor am i a sports guy but i do really enjoy playing well executed video games.

2015-07-19,0,0,12,False,Recommended,The most enjoyment I've had from a game in a very long time! This game is honestly perfect. It's cheap. It's highly enjoyable and the gameplay is great. The devs seems to have wanted to produce a game that s a throwback to the early days of gaming. Before hyper realistic graphics and storylines was anywhere. This game is just FUN. It s not moving it s not emotional it s not realistic (obviously) it s just a bloody good time that you can spend hours of time playing. Rocket League has both an easy and a steep learning curve. It takes all of 2 minutes so get the basics but actually becoming proficient learning the timings using the boost efficiently operating the two camera angles take time and there s a hell of a lot to be learnt. I also highly recommend this game to people who mostly play 1 game over and over (Dota CSGO BF4 Arma3 etc). It s a fantastic game to just play for an hour between scrims or to chill out over after a long sessions. It feels like a wonderful break from other games. In terms of how the guns runs? Perfection. Controller support is great. Options menu is great. Game runs superb and will do on even old systems (Phenoum X2 XFX5770 4GB). Overall this game is a steal at 15. For those thinking I ll just wait for a sale.. don t bother with that. You will not regret spending 15 for this game.,Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,54,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a car divegrass simulatorIt's pretty good overall. The gameplay is tight matches last about 5 10 minutes each.There are local split screen multiplayer modes which is a rare thing to see on PC so that's good.Cosmetic items in game (car types wheels hats rocket trails) are completely free and unlocked by playing the game. No microtransactions here.You can choose which server (or servers) to use to find online games. Oceana Europe NA west and NA east. The multiplayer menu is easy to navigate and game modes are easy to choose.The only real downside is that the game requires a controller to really play properly.

2017-07-04,0,0,124,False,Recommended,"I was pondering whether or not to give this a positive review as I came directly from three ranked games. More on that later.So the game is really fun to play with your friends and can prove to be a real thrill when the match goes really well. Sometimes you just feel that the ball don't go wherever you want it to go but that can be due to a large number of factors. Just fall back and have a go at it again or signal your teammates to try and cover up. So the game have great potential for a fun time. Although there are certain negative points worth mentioning.Firstly the positives + Great fun+ Great map architecture+ In game soundtrack which you can turn off should you want to (just lower the volume of it).+ A load of different cars each with their own unique appearance free to customize.+ Car customization you can choose the decals team based color ""color"" material wheels antenna boost trail and last but not least the ""hat"". + Easy to start.+ Hard to master.+ Cross compatibility with PS4 (no Xbox One that I know of as of yet).+/ Large skill gap that can be found within the same match. So for the negatives and here is the reason for the first sentence Hugely toxic community. Get used to report people and/or muting them and get used to be called an idiot or noob. This sucks but there is not much that can be done from our side more than reporting them. THIS IS NOT ONLY WITHIN YOUR TEAM THE ENEMIES WILL CALL YOU THAT AS WELL. There are of course moments when you get a nice match when no one will be toxic. The ranking system could use a rework as you can be matched against a player of much higher skill than what you are. Bottom line Yes you should buy this game and play with your friends. That way you get nice players on your team at least.",Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,37,False,Recommended,"Put several hundred hours in the PS3 predecessor. The gameplay is identical and I'm very happy about that. They've added league play (which you probably figured out by the name) a new training system and lots of customizable accessories that work similar to Strange items in TF2 tracking this or that stat. And it's very very pretty. The AI seems to be a bit smarter in some ways and a bit worse in others I'm seeing more odd hits around the goal that wouldn't happen in SSARPBC. E.g. the AI will occasionally hit it in the wrong direction entirely on offense and there seem to be a higher number of own goals. If you're looking to go back to the PS3 style ball cam it's in options ""Hold Ball Camera"" if you don't like the toggle system.",Rocket League®

2015-07-22,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Needs a controller to play well. Otherwise you'll suck and ruin your teams experience. If you're rly good with computer controls go for it. Basically like 30 40 $ if u buy the game and a controller alongside it.Still fun. Simple plays that make you look pro.Only one game mode tho but you know it's soccer/football. I rate 7/10. Gets boring eventually since it's just one game mode but it's hecka fun anyhow.,Rocket League®
2015-07-22,0,0,46,False,Recommended,This Game is Awesome with a lot of depth BUT!!! It lacks content. Camera is horrible at times in both views only 3 maps Accessory are Terrible that you unlock. No progression no stats the game needs work. A lot of it! Destroying other cars seems to hurt you more than help you. once you get higher up in rank its non stop goalies which seems to make the game more boring to me than fun I wish there was a 5 second limit than you blew up if you camped in the goal so that everyone can run around not be forced to play goalie or simply add another mode. Which is another lack luster in the game only one mode but you can choose between 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4. A capture the flag could be so cool and ramps other crazy **** to the maps would be fun but maybe I'm all wrong maybe the game is meant to only be played on a flat surface with the same repetitive gameplay don't get me wrong I loved this game but after 29 hours i moved on.,Rocket League®

2016-05-15,0,0,113,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a multiplayer sports/driving game where you play 3v3 to try and score goals over 5 minutes of play. There are also options of 2v2 4v4 and other unconventional modes such as Hoops and asymmetric futbol maps.This game has a very high skill ceiling but is easily accessible to the pleb gamer like myself and a lot of nuance behind what is essentially a very simple premise score goals. When you screw up it's pretty obvious that it's your own fault and the game isn't unfair on that front. The music in menus are a very small part of the experience but is quite chill nonetheless.Psyonix also knows how to do good DLC. The entirety of it is purely aesthetic in nature and there are plenty of free updates so none of the playing content is locked behind a paywall. The packages are small morsel like bites of additional customisation for your car and as at 15/05/2016 I own 1 DLC currently.Speaking of customisation there are extensive options for paint jobs decals wheels antennae toppers boosts which helps keep the aesthetics of the game fresh.I am absolute at the game but it is fun in its own merit and would definitely recommend this game though it must be noted that the majority of my playtime has been with mates over Skype so YMMV.,Rocket League®

2015-12-08,0,0,240,False,Recommended,This game has taken over my life the past few months.

2017-06-23,0,0,101,False,Recommended,I have this game on my xbox and will get it on steam as soon as i can but this is one of the best games I've ever played. You start out as a noob who can barely control their car it is somewhat frustrating but scoring a goal is insanely fun. over a few weeks you may begin to get better at this game but have no idea how else you can get better. As you rank up you see people flying around and you look up on youtube how to do that. You begin practicing this now and you keep doing this with other skills. This is not a game where you can just be naturally good at it like cod or bf or madden etc... This game is basically a sport. You start out as one of the worst players ever but as you go on you gain experience and get better. Although this game does not look like soccer it plays much more like soccer than fifa or any other socceer games. YOU have to learn to control the ball. You cant just flick a stick to do a dribble move you have to put time and effort in practicing. This game does have one big big problem. The servers. Every other game it feels like I get this lag spike where I basically disconnect from the game for like 10 seconds then comeback this is not my wifi acting up I get 24 ping and in many other games have little to no connection issues. If not for this problem I truly believe that this game would have won game of the year especially considering it almost did even with these issues.,Rocket League®

2015-07-23,0,0,17,False,Recommended,I find this to be a fast paced game with good music and nice visuals. The control you have over the vehicle is pretty impressive but it is definitely one of those games where it is quick to pick up but difficult to truly master. As always there is more diversity in player skill when played online but even the AI does a decent job for practice. Vehicle customization can be aggrevating as not all things you unlock are available on all cars right away but it is always nice when you unlock something you can use. I wouldn't be surprised to see more customizations added as the game progresses. Overall very entertaining and worth the $20!,Rocket League®

2015-11-14,0,0,2045,False,Recommended,"""Playing Soccer with flying cars"" doesn't do it justice. Rocket League is an astoundingly enjoyable game that you just have to play to understand. It seems like trying to hit the ball accurately with a car would be difficult and frustrating but the controls are intuitive and can be picked up quickly. Rocket League has that amazing quality of being ""easy to learn but hard to master"".From your first match you'll start to pick up on the controls quickly and before long you'll find yourself flying through the air to spike the ball down into the opponents net.Matches are only 5 minutes so it's fast paced with very little time commitment meaning even if you only have 10min to play you can still squeeze a quick game or two of Rocket League in.It's got split screen multiplayer so it's great for playing on a TV with friends/family and it still has enough strategic/mechanical depth to give even the most serious eSports competitor a challenge.The developer (Psyonix) is great the game has only been out a few months and already they're adding significant new content as free patches as well as adding new cosmetic content available via reasonably priced DLC.Rocket League is probably my favorite game currently I've already spent over 150 hours enjoying it and I can't wait for the next 150 and beyond.Update I'm now comfortably past 300 hours in and the game is still just as enjoyable as it was if not moreso. Psyonix has added it's first non standard map mutators and a custom hockey game type that are all very fun. There's a patch set to come out in the next couple weeks that includes several new non standard maps as well as changes to the way ranked works and many new items and more. The size of the playerbase seems to have increased so seems most people agree with me that the game has only been getting better from an already stellar start.Update 2 Now 1200 hours in. Psyonix has continued to release new and interesting content like Hoops Rumble etc. The base game is still just as stellar as it was if anything they've made it smoother which I didn't realize was even possible. They added a ton of new car customization options and new maps and have put substantial time/money into developing an esports scene which continues to grow the game. Rocket League has taken a place in my game library of one of the sparingly few games that I pretty much never get tired of. Rarely does a day go by where I don't play at least a few matches even if I'm just goofing around in unranked. I don't think I'll ever have a bad thing to say about the game it's truly spectacular. The only negative thing I could say is like any competitive game the community can be toxic at times so if you're easily tilted consider playing with chat disabled.",Rocket League®

2015-08-09,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Massive props to the devs on this. A fairly good idea fleshed out with really great little touches and a real deep understanding on what players of this game want. 4 player split screen co op in 2015 is virtually unheard of. Most devs expect PC gamers (well most gamers really) to be sad little 13 year olds welded to their chairs not wanting to interact with others except online.This game caters to real people. It does not restrict how you play this game. In any way. It could have been free to play and been ruined (hope to good god this never happens) it could have been restrictive as to who plays (i.e online 1 player per pc) and been ruined.It's a fairly good idea for a game but it's the little touches that make this one of the best games I've played for quite some time. And I'm not a massive football fan (can't really stand it although I am getting quite into womens leagues...).Definitely recommended to all as above all else it's bloody good fun to play.

2015-07-24,0,0,7,False,Recommended,As someone who enjoyed watching some big name youtubers play this the only thing preventing me from purchasing immediately from the joy they had was the fact that I'm not a big cars games sort of person. But regardless Rocket League is one of the best soccer/football video games I've played in a dang long time.The car element to rocket league is arguably one of the more sensible choices to the game that helps to make for a skillfull yet enjoyable element. Having a FPS or TPS based human or overseeing eyeball in the sky commanding no name soccer AI is boring to me. But the car based physics and fly bys of Rocket League mix together two arguably unrelatable sports genre's and turn them into a almost inseperable bunch. Players gain boosts based on a grid based placement of boost pads across the field with super boosts placed at tactical and predictable locations that make for competative twinge some folks will love. The satisfaction of taking a full boost and keeping it going by hitting boost pad upon boost pad and then JUST making the jump to hit the ball in is literally one of the greatest satisfactions.Matchmaking is satisfactory lag and ping are not a huge problem with few exceptions as per the usual with any game against human beings. Gameplay may get repetative only because you will feel the need to play it again and again simply because of how inherently fun it is. Cars come with customization but get this it's unlocked completely in gameplay. This is amazing considering I wouldn't have thought any less of this game for charging pennies on the dollar for silly hats or new paint jobs for my little RC buddy.All in all this was definately worth the $20 tag. Even if you just have one friend we were able to play a couple matches of 1v1 (Which I dominated Haha!) and then went to public teams so we could still have fun without it being unfair. I don't see why someone without friends can't enjoy it either!,Rocket League®

No other game that I play makes me move around in my seat as much as this game. Maybe if I nick the controller up in the air my car will jump just a little higher. Totally makes me feel like a kid again. &lt 3On a more serious note this game feels increadible. Controlls are easy to understand and makes driving feel natural.

The car controls are really good and it's considering that it wouldn't take much for them to be fustrating has hell. Whatever people tell you you can play this game with mouse and keyboard it might be a bit harder to get use to but it's pretty similar once you get the hang of it. I recommend playing this game with friends if you can it's definetly better but still fun solo. Don't forget that you can splitscreen it's written on the steam page but it's not written inside the game (at least no clearly). In my opinion best sports game of 2015!,Rocket League®
2015-12-30,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Can only echo all the other good reviews. Very fun. Anyone who likes any of the following multiplayer arcadey games teamwork high skill ceiling fun/silly moments satisfying games should definitely pick this up.

2017-08-12,0,0,1549,False,Recommended,So from a te al standpoint Rocket League is a pretty decent game overall. The servers can be a little iffy at times and you may encounter some FPS drop on one of the arenas but it is a solid game. On the other hand the community is hit and miss. You will have some fun players who are chill and enjoy the game but you will also find a lot of players who are toxic and extremely serious. You will find plenty of griefers who will either self goal ram you or just flat out quit if you get scored on once. You will probably hear plenty of racial slurs and deal with lots of hate from players with small vocabularies as well if you make small mistakes even early on. The community is about as toxic as League of Legends and CSGO so that is a major downside. But you can simply disable chat and ignore them if you need to. So overall the game is pretty good but most of the playerbase is pretty bad.,Rocket League®

2017-08-13,0,0,944,False,Recommended,Although I have a fair number of games in my library I always gravitate towards one that keeps me sucked in for months if not years at a time. Since I downloaded Rocket League I can't remember the last time I wanted to play a game more than this one I have to force myself to even play Skyrim or Civ. It is unexpectedly satisfying to play a close game score an incredible goal or see myself (and hopefully my rank) improve over time. And as much as Psyonix is dogged for their matchmaking system they do a fantastic job in making the game fun for every level of play even bad plats like me. Why wouldn't you spend 20 dollars on this game? Talk about a (goal) steal.,Rocket League®

2017-03-15,0,0,962,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a great game. I like the fact that you have to communicate with your team members in order to be successful. Though I do wish that new players coming into the game were ranked accordingly and not having to be matched against high ranked players. For example I am a challenger elite and one of my buddies is new to the game. I wish the matchmaking could be balanced to where our opponents would be evenly matched for example I challenge elite versus a challenger elite and let's say a prospect which is a prospect one of each skill level. On each team rather than facing the matchmaking of the higher skill in the server for example if I was a rising star and my buddy was a prospect then our opponents would be rising stars. It's sometimes frustrating for the newer players because they have yet experienced the game enough to where they would be able to have a fighting chance. And make them not want to play out of frustration.,Rocket League®

2017-06-28,0,0,315,False,Recommended,Rocket League is the game that I go to whenever I am bored whenever I only have 10 minutes to play a game and whenever I just want to listen to music and chill out. The high paced action creates a game that is hard to put down and hard to stop picking back up. There are multitudes of aspects to the game even more than you would expect. You can battle competitively against other players trying to get the top rank you can set up unique gamemodes to play in private matches with your friends you can become an item collector and learn about the Rocket League economy and trade with other players in order to make your car the most luxurious vehicle out there or you can simply chill and play some simple laid back car soccer. However the online community can get pretty vulgar and unfriendly which is one of the few negatives of the game.With such a cheap price the game contains so much content and entertainment for anyone no matter what the age.,Rocket League®

There is a reason that this game has been on the top seller list for a month it is addicting. Every game is match based your existence while playing this game is to score as many goals in 5 minutes against the other team while simultaneously protecting your goal. There is a massive amount of skill involved but that should not deter new players as the mechanics are quite simple and easy to learn. I see this as a big e sports game in the future.

2015-07-27,0,0,44,False,Recommended,You are doing yourself a disservice by not owning this game already. Excellent graphics runs like a dream on High even on my laptop's GT765M with no overheating and looks amazing.The gameplay is very easy to grasp but seriously difficult to execute well. Practice makes perfect!The game is clearly optimised for controller users. I tried to play with a keyboard but found it impossibly difficult. Using a controller feels very natural and allows for much finer control.No microtransactions no pay to win just good old fashioned fun. I have not had this much fun playing a multiplayer game since Dystopia came out as a HL2 mod when I was in High School.,Rocket League®

Worth the money no doubt would pay higher if i had too. If you like basically any sports (Soccer Basketball Hockey Etc.) this is the game for you. So many awesome gametypes as well as unreal amounts of items to customize your car. The possibilites are endless. Would Reccomend to anyone. If i had to rate it out of 10 i would put 15.

Yea it's fun but you will always get matched up with people who doesn't know how to play even when you're a higher rank. I don't know why people say the community is toxic when literally NO ONE talks. It's rare to even see those text chat quotes. I guess it's fun if you have friends to play with but playing solo will make you frustrated. Don't jam the ""W"" key like I did I put so much force on that key because in this game you'll feel like you will have to jam the key to go full speed.

When you are in a match and a teammate leaves he is replaced by a lobotomized AI partner who only produces own goals. But its even worse in single player where your whole team is a bunch of lobotomized AI partner and don't give me any of this ""its supposed to be played in multiplayer"" BS.

I have played enough of this game to make a review that is true.So first off i would like to make a note So for those who dont know the history of this game and the devs here u go So back in 2008 Psyonix made a gun called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Batlle Cars"" This game wasnt really well known but was a really great game in its age. So Years go by and the players of SSARPBC were shrinking but those who stayed were just getting better and better. Now many years later... Psyonix brings a new game... the ""sequel"" of SSARPBC which is really the remake. Using todays tech to make a new one Now it is known as Rocket League. And it is now actully known and one of the best games on steam.So review time!Graphics The Graphics in this game are actully really good if ur computer can handle it of course.Audio This game has great music and the audio is just as fine.PlayTime This game can be played forever its match after match like tf2 or csgo PGameplay This game is way different then most games today and its what makes it so greatControls The Controls are fine tho u should use a controller if u canSideNote!!!!I LOVE THIS GAME",Rocket League®

As someone who has predominantly played Counter Strike and other FPS titles in the past Rocket League is a breath of fresh air. Games are short and exciting which is great for people who don't have the time to dedicate 60+ minutes for one match of another game. There's plenty of skill based mechanics to improve upon and the matchmaking system seems to do a decent enough job at matching you with people roughly around your own skill level.,Rocket League®

2015-07-13,0,0,24,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is simple in concept control and gameplay. Despite this it is one of the most engaging games I have ever played. While the game may be simple the skill cap on what you can do is insane. When you first start you will fumble around and miss shots left and right but every once in a while you get that perfect play. That perfect play sticks in your head and taunts you. ""You can do so much better"". And you always can.The game runs like a charm and could probably be managed on low end computers to run smoothly. It has cross platform multiplayer with the ps4 where it is free so the population is large enough to not be an issue for now.I can't think of a single negative of this game if you like a simple but engaging game you can dip a lot of time into as you get better and better.Plus who knows maybe it will go full eSports and become a popular competitive spectator sport.

2016-09-19,0,0,667,False,Recommended,This game is awesome it was much more fun than i expected and i have spent countless amount of time in this game. It has split screen which was one of the main reasons for me to buy this game. The team is slowly improving the game in every aspect. I used to have lag issues but they heard my voice and despite being not a lot of change in my ping they fixed it to make it competitively playable. The game even has a split screen online mode so you and your friend can team up with perfect sync. The graphics are also awesome and its hard to believe this is made by unreal engine 3.However one of the things i dont like about the game is that although they dont give an advantage over gameplay the standard cars look very bad compared to the DLCs and the ones awarded in crates.Overall i love the game definitely recommend buying it,Rocket League®

2015-09-27,0,0,213,False,Recommended,Best game I've played in a while Very simple Very addictive Easy to play but Hard to master. The Devs are doing a great job with this game new things are getting added overtime and the way they dish out DLC is a great essentially half paid half free. One edition I would like to see would be custom leagues for friends etc so we have the option to arrange tournaments etc.I only have one bad point and this would probably not bother most players but the single player game is terrible The computer AI is absolutely shocking. I played the single player game just to earn the achievements and it's basically you against the five AI/Bots! Yes that's right your own team mates WILL run the ball into your own goal from the half way line given the chance.To sum it up buy this game for multiplayer not for single player.8.5/10,Rocket League®

Its a very interesting take on a soccer game and it does it very well.Pros Great gameplay 'Simple but hard to master' kind of mechanics You can enact your soccer fantasies using an RC car like controls. (A point worth mentioning alone)Cons The match making can be a bit iffy. (I assume there is a skill level calculation of players because everytime we win a match my team gets matched with some effin pros who really know how to bend it like Beckham.) Expect a learning curve. Requires Teamwork. (Plebs consider this a con what to do) Server problems.

2017-08-05,0,0,1173,False,Recommended,Rocket League. Hmmm what's the best way to describe you. Fun yet infuriating. Fast yet slow. It's more of a sport than it is a video game. If you want to succeed and go far you need a good team and good communication skills. 3v3 and 2v2 are the main game modes for this game but I'm not here to focus on that. Let's talk about the weird game modes. Rumble. It's 3v3 with random powers that you can use to score goals with or mess up the other team. There are a lot more tactics and angle shots involved so it doesn't always go your way even when you have the right powers. Go ahead and give it a shot if you've never played it. It's really fun Dropshot. A better basket ball like game compared to hoops also combined with volleyball. The objective of the game is the break the floor open like your shooting at it and it'll open up revealing the goal. The more damage you do to the opposing teams floor the bigger the goal just remember that when you score a goal the floor will clear up next round. It's a very team based game. Gotta be passing to each other to charge the ball so it'll do more damage the the floor. Lots of aerials and wall shots to have an advantage at this game mode. Snow Day well. You're interesting. You have to change up your tactics in this 3v3 ice hockey type game mode. The puck acts different to a ball and you gotta block more shots by just being infront of the puck. A lot of redirections and wall runs to actively do well and score in this interesting game mode. Hoops. That's about all I have to say about that game mode. Not a fan of it. It's like basketball but in a bad way.This is the first review I've done in a while. Any pointers would be helpful ),Rocket League®

2015-10-27,0,0,25,False,Recommended,got it for free with the controller. i would like it to have censorship on the names... and chat... and automatically mute the mic's... its cool that there are so many people playing but its like driving in real life with people who know their cars are indestructible. everything in the multiplayer is so bitter and there isnt much to the game outside of that. its a well made game (barring that framerate cap) but the multiplayer has gone toxic just like every other game ive played online and im not a fan of that. i just have unreasonable expectations,Rocket League®

2016-12-11,0,0,39,False,Recommended,Overall Rocket league is a great game and provided me alot of good playtime.Pros It is very addictive but challengening and i found myself rage a few times.I love the custom cars you can make and adds some personality to your car. Its and amzing game that never loses its fun.The devs always add new content and the updates keep on coming.Cons No game is perfect and i feel that rocket league isn't an exception.The servers are unreliable and very laggy and in over games i don't have lag at all. At first i thought it was my computer lagging but it runs at 30fps.It sometimes gets repetitive and the inculsion of crates ruins the experience of it.The matching system needs work. Sometimes i am put with rookies and sometimes with pros.,Rocket League®

2016-12-11,0,0,234,False,Recommended,Rocket League is probably the best $20 (if it isn't on sale which it frequently is) you could ever spend. This game honestly never gets old and it's so easy to pick up and not put down for hours on end until you throw your gamepad through a wall in frustration with your teammates. Let's not forget the devs either. Hands down the best because they LISTEN TO THEIR COMMUNITY!

2016-12-11,0,0,696,False,Recommended,After spending a decent amount of time in game both on PC and PS4 I gotta say it's one of the best game I've ever played. If you like playing multiplayer games of mixed genre which can easily immerse you even if you don't play them multiple hours a day. Even if you don't exactly love this type of games. Well even if you don't like soccer nor racing games at all. The heck I'm talking about this game is for EVERYONE! Age or taste doesn't matter you should give it a shot at least. You can lay back and play casual games try out various modes even better if you got friend(s) to play with.You can teach it your daughter/son/brother/sister/father/neighbor WHOEVER and play against bots on splitscreen on Sunday afternoons.Or you can try to become one of the elite Rocket League players and work your way up to Champion tier whilst playing 7 hours a day and lose your job or skip school.The game's visuals mechanics controls physics basically everything is 10/10.Dev team is one of the best I've ever came across.And look at the price tag. There's plenty of games here that are 3 times the price and deliver less than Rocket League or don't deliver at all.,Rocket League®

I have never had a problem with this game nor have I ever found a glitch/bug. This game is amazingly polished and has loads of content. This game gets updated regularly with new content adding more hours of gameplay. There is also a competitive mode one of the best ranking systems and loads more of potential hours of playtime.This game isn't about having the best car it's about who has the best skill. To be skilled at the game you must practice ALOT. This is the racing sports game of CS GO.A rocket league DLC consists of new cars skins and decals. They are launched with every new map update. Best of all these maps are 100% free and are available to everyone. The DLC content is just for style and customization it doesn't make you any better. It makes you look better.In conclusin buy it.....,Rocket League®

2017-08-25,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Warning Before buying this game be aware you will spend your money on it.This game is great.I started out not really having fun and it reminded me of when I did real sports.People wouldn't explain them to me so the team would always hate me and not let me do anything.But it gets more fun as you get better. After the basic tutorial &amp a friend helping me practice I immediately loved this game.It's really fun there's an abundance of modes and here's where you'll spend your money There's so many DLC vehicles and cases. But the vehicles dont have to be purchased nor do the skins or cosmetics. There's random item drops which seem so far to get a little more sparse but more rare as you level up. But let's talk about the vehicles. They aren't $200 and they are not purely cosmetic. (*cough* tf2 *cough*) They actually go at different speeds have different turning radiuses grip and weights.I mean the online community isn't super terrible but teamwork could definitely be easier here considering it's a team game.This is worth the $20.,Rocket League®

2015-10-29,0,0,320,False,Recommended,"The good outweighs the bad it's just the bad has more detail. READ ON! BAD POINTS The matching server needs improvement. How the hell a rookie is expected to beat a veteran 1v1 is beyond me.. also how people are expected to play with 300+ ping is also beyond me.This is a 20 game+DLC that's more than happy to pit you against people you've no chance of beating and then ripping your ranks away from you.to make it playable make the matching a little more even and get the client to test the server (ping it) before joining so people don't have to play with the magical red ""DISCONNECTED!"" logo. all it takes is for the game to start matchmaking again if the server selected is unusable!Remember this is a high speed low drag game ping of more than 100 is undesired because you start seeing things like the ball and players glitching around. I have quite a few times been in a situation where I scored a really nice goal but it didn't count because I was lagged. I watched the ball go into the back of the net and then their team get a goal because what happend on the server is the ball was saved from me then planted in my goal. Nice going They score the goal I should have had. GOOD POINTS complaining asside it's a pretty simple game. Football in cars up to 4 a side (unless you're going for the ranked matches then it's up to 3 a side). There is no ""off side"" nor penalty for blowing up the enemy.. however you are rewarded with an explosion and the inability to see for a second or so.the cars have rockets attached for getting around at rapid pace killing the enemy and flying. Trust me I can't get the hang of that bit. I like my Delorean and to keep my wheels near the ground.Each public match is 5 minutes (add time for goal replays). Overtime is applicable if the scores are even at the end of the game. It truely is a thrash and go while you wait game.. and while the matching server does get it wrong sometimes it doesn't get it wrong all the time.The graphics are something else. Really really pretty though it is easy to disorient yourself.. so watch out!",Rocket League®

No other reason given no specific language they specified whatsoever not even an email. Just an in game pop op and the inability to play the game.I can't in good conscious recommend this game any longer. It goes beyond the overreaching of other games that will mute you and simply bans anyone that types something they don't like. Anyone who has played this game at all will know nearly every game has at least 1 or possibly 6 super toxic people talking crap. It's part of the game and trying to control people talking to each other is so pathetic and sad.The fact that any amount of effort is going into trying to bully people on the internet into saying only the words they want them to say is disgusting.,Rocket League®

2015-11-30,0,0,435,False,Recommended,"Do you like to play fun games?..Well I sure hope so that is the reason you are here after all. This is not a ""fun"" game in that sense it is an addictingly exhilarating game. The physics collision controls style and overall gameplay are bar none. The game has a polish to it that many games do not have nowadays. Even when it originally released the only major problems were that the servers were slightly malfunctioning. Because of the relatively short matches (5 minutes) the games are in a sense bite sized. Not too much not too little. It's not like a game of battlefield or COD where after 20 40 minutes a game is resolved leaving many gamers bored or tired. The short 5 minutes matches are packed with action and intensity. ONe thing I love about it is the something not mentioned in reviews I've read previosuly. The ability to comeback in any game regardless of the score is immense. Down 3 4 or even 5 goals? Doesn't matter step your game up and win. The game mechanics allow so much skill to be expressed that comebacks are nearly always possible. There is real quantifiable skill that is to be gained by getting good at this game. I'd say more but that would take all night to write it.Pros CheapGreat learning curveLots of fun with friendsLots of fun with yourselfCons Not freeRating 10/10Would buy again.Highly Highly recommend it.",Rocket League®

Pros Fun and addicting Easy on casual gamers Even more fun with friendsCons Ranking system is a bit finicky on some of my first games i have been matched up with pros and semi pros which was not fun for me or my rookie team mates Team mates are mostly AFK when i join a game Not very much car customization now before you go on and on about it im talking about chasis here there really isnt alot of choices when it comes to chasis when customising your own unique car. I feel like the devs could put out some more car types if they really wanted to.Overall Rocket league is one of my best games of this year with a few kinks that could be fixed up a bit i still love this game and i hope to get it some other time when I have the money to do so.,Rocket League®

2015-08-09,0,0,42,False,Recommended,"Buy this game.It's easy to play but it has TONS of room to perfect your playing and pull off some truly amazing stuff.As should be obvious by now it's soccer with rocket powered RC cars. Your cars have the ability to pull off jumps flips barrel rolls boost speed using rocket power and even fly. Flying effectively is the most difficult skill to master. However with practice it's possible to pull off something like driving up a wall flipping off and rocket flying into the ball scoring a goal.The AI opponents are terrible and the only reason to play offline games is to practice your skills so you can pull your weight in online matches with real players. The game also features training that focuses on various skills the game requires such as scoring goals and playing goalie. Each training has 3 different difficulty levels and they do effectively prepare you to take those skills onto the field if you spend time with them.To elaborate on the AI...I've played offline and seen one of my team mates literally drive the ball ALL THE WAY accross the field and shoot the ball into our own goal. This happens a lot. Honestly it's frustrating to play offline because it sometimes feels like the AI is programmed to just hit the ball as much as possible regardless of the concequences of the hit. You can be lined up for a perfect goal you close in and prepare to take your shot...and a ing AI team mate comes out of nowhere and hits the ball way the out into the middle of nowhere ruining a sure goal. AI playing goalie is a toss up. They'll either pull off the most t saves ever or just stand immobile in the goal and let the ball go in. Long story short the AI is the weakest part of this entire game.Customization is pretty nice though there aren't a whole lot of options for players who don't want to make their car look like a joke especially in the ""hat"" department. All customization is only for appearance and has little or no effect on your gameplay. The only choice that effects your game is which car you choose as each one has a different hit box and different angles to it. It is essential to take the shape of your car into account when lining up a shot especially at an angle.There aren't many problems with the online mode. There needs to be more of a match making system especially in un ranked modes. You could end up with a team mate who is pro caliber or you could get a day 1 noob who can't tell which goal he's supposed to shoot at (hint the one who's color is opposite your own dumbass). Before you play online I STRONGLY recommend playing offline seasons and doing training until you reach the point where you won't be a burden to whichever team you end up on. You'd be amazed how far ahead you'll be compared to the average player if you take this advice.I give it a 9/10Not the kind of game most people will be able to play for hours on end but you'll definitely get your money's worth if this concept interests you and you're willing to put in a little time getting good.",Rocket League®

The developers are very active in the community both on their own forums and on /r/rocketleague and are actively listening to suggestions and fixing reported issues.

I'm pretty sure you'll love that game. Only weakness is their dlc policy. Back in the days you got some paintings antennas wheels cars etc. in one pack for sth like 4 . I loved those.

2015-11-01,0,0,228,False,Recommended,"I rarely play sports or racing games but Rocket League is an excellent easy to learn &amp difficult to master arcade racing football (soccer) game! Post release updates and social media interaction show that the devs care about the players and eSports through by adding new content in the base game as well as DLC. Since there's plenty of praise for RL let me go some of the game's caveats ""Cross platform gameplay"" does NOT mean that you can join players in a party/private match that are on a different platform. It just means when you queue up for general online play you can get matched up with other PC and PS4 players. 1.05 update notes say ""There are no immediate plans to let you join players in a party on another platform"". Fields/levels are all functionally the same right now. Aside from plans for game Mutators I am not aware of plans to make certain fields have different terrain/features. A game controller gives higher turning precision control than a keyboard &amp mouse. Camera rotation cannot be controlled by mouse movement. Only two in game camera selections Fixed or Ball Cam. There's a dozen config camera related options in the pause menu though. May offer ""enough"" for handling griefers &amp leavers. 15 minute online ban for leaving a match has had a mixed reception by the community and right now there is no in game report system but that's coming. Rank Point system for competitive play can be confusing for points won/lost after a match especially in higher ranks. AI available when playing offline can be dumb sometimes and score on own goal when it rushes back to defend.",Rocket League®

Numerous requests have been made by thousands of Indian RL fans and multiple petitions signed but psyonix has given no response.It's a great game but if you're an Indian gamer don't bother.UPDATE improvements have been made average ping on asian servers is around 115 which is a hge improvement.",Rocket League®

2015-12-24,0,0,225,False,Recommended,HOLY F*** I HATE SPORTS BUT I LOVE THIS GAMEI can't explain why but my love of cars simulators and need for high octane arcade thrills somehow conjure up a massive love for this title. In the first week I played 25 hours and couldn't get enough. YOU PLAY SOCCER/FOOTBALL WITH CARS THAT FLY. It's literally the greatest. The controls are easy and the pace is perfect. Play 5 minutes or play 5 hours the flexibility is on you. Get bored playing by yourself? Ask your dorm neighbor to come over with his Xbox controller to get whooped. Get competitive with people who usually don't even like video games. It's super accessible as a first game to people who've never played on a PC before. If it gets too cumbersome for them you can modify the gameplay with the newest update. This game is absolutely perfect for a college dorm setup because the learning curve accompanies all. It will never stop being challenging and will never become too difficult to insure someone ragequits.,Rocket League®

The game includes cross play between another platforms.GAMEPLAY (10/10)I dont know what I must say except ""Fun!"" You just drive your rocket car and shoot the ball. Maybe this game can relieves your stress.GRAPHIC (9/10)This game has pretty graphic with low specs requirement.MULTIPLAYER (9/10)Has competitive mode to increase your skill with another players who have similar skills like DOTA2 has MMR.PRICE WORTH (10/10)You would never regret after purchased this game even you dont have any friend who play this.CONCLUSIONSugestion if you want play this game disable chat mute everyone because they all just bothering you.

2015-10-09,0,0,290,False,Not Recommended,After putting 262 hours into this game. I am finally ready to write a reviewThis game is absolutely HORRIBLE. Heres reasons why 1. No campaign. I wanted an epic story about the cars and maybe theres a villain who drives the Roadhog because that car looks like a rocket league mafia. But nope theres no campaign and no storyline how am I supposed to figure out how Dracos were made if theres no storyline?2. DLC Cost too much. 2 dollars for a car? What does it look like I live in dubai? No wayyyyyy too expensive. My allowence is only 25 cents a year.3. Too many white cis straight males. I don't want them here they're disguisting and we should kick them all out of rocket league4. My ping is constantly above 10. I think Psyhonix needs to buy premium server space in my garage. 5. No rockets why is it called ROCKET league. I wanna shoot rockets at people. In conclusion this is the worst game I have ever played in my life.,Rocket League®

Playing in only one server closest to you solves the problem but it increases queue times a lot. Also a lot of players are from PSN. Most of them are 12 year old kids who will rage and talk over chat. Matchmaking is worse than Dota or CounterStrike combined. Most of the times your teammates will ruin you.

2015-08-16,0,0,42,False,Recommended,So at first I wanted to do a silly/stupid review but this game for realz has no need to. You will have plenty of silly/stupid moments within that I don't have to even state it.I bought Rocket League because it seemed to be what everyone else was doing type of thing but seriously there is a reason. I've played all match types and even the single player and seriously have not had a dull moment. It's repetitive yes. But the fun in it comes from pulling off sweet moves you would expect from pro players in your FIRST MATCH. Yeah. it's one pof those games Easy to pick up but mastery comes within numerous hours. And even in those first 1 2 ...100 hours (You will probably play it that long trust me.) There is never a dull moment and even when you find a dull moment? It will have you coming back for more... Just in' buy it already. All your friends have it and for good reason. Do it like Nike.,Rocket League®

But with this kind of combination WELL DONE!For the DLC haters out there you don't need to buy it. You can be pro (which I am absolutly not) with the ""standard"" Pack. You can play all maps just a few customazition and ""special"" cars (which also only have looks not better specs) are not playable without DLC. So... LET'S ROCKET LEAGUE!Hint The Developers still making new things like Maps that are hilarious/awesome. You have playtime fun until...*wait for it*... just buy it and find out )",Rocket League®

2015-07-25,0,0,38,False,Recommended,I have more fun playing this game then any other game that I own on PC or console right now. I have a PS4 so I obviously got it on there for free so I played it for like 50 hours on there first. This game is amazing to play with friends or by yourself. My friends on PS4 are fun to play with but they are not very good at the game. I started to play by myself and actually had a lot of fun playing with better players. I figured I would get on my gaming PC so I can play without them knowing I am online playing! I have not regreted my decision. This game looks and plays fundamentally the same on PC as it does on PS4. However I do not know if it is in my head or not but I do think that the game plays substantially smoother on the PC. I know a lot of people were complaining about the servers to start out with however my experience has been very good on both the PC and PS4. There are some instances where you ping will be randomly high for no reason but it will fix itself by the next game most of the time. I would recommend this game to anyone regardless of the type of game you like to play. It is well worth the 20 dollars on PC. I know I will play the heck out of this game for months and maybe even years. I see this game becoming CS GO popular if it isn't already.,Rocket League®
2015-07-26,0,0,28,False,Recommended,I love this game,Rocket League®
2015-07-27,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Rocket LeagueHonestly I never knew such a simple concept could be so much fun. The very addictive gameplay could have you playing this for hours on end easily. You will lose track of time. The game is very simple and easy to learn but hard to master. With a full training mode you're able to work on advanced techniques and learning to control your car and the ball. The game may be easy to learn but depending on how much time you spend on learning new tricks with your car and learn how to control the ball better from other players you will see yourself rise above the average player.Playing this with friends is a blast. With up to 4v4 online PVP you and up to 3 friends can all battle it out against others. Teamwork is a must in this game.Cameras. The camerawork in this game is phenominal. Although you will mostly keep it on the ball cam (no homo) the game offers two variations of cameras. The ball cam which follows the ball everywhere it goes is smooth and nice to look at the camera was crucial to this game and they nailed it.FINAL SCORE 10/10 (No really this game is a full 10 out of 10. It's a must own. Why do you not have this game yet?) TL DR Buy the game,Rocket League®

2016-12-04,0,0,142,False,Recommended,Not the kind of game I usually find myself playing but Rocket League is a nice game to spent hours on.Lots of fun to play even more with friends and not that expensive considering the fact that gaming developers literally ask you to pay a great amount of your hard earned money for actual sh.it.The not so hardcore cartoonish graphics give it a funny tone and most importantly make it easy to run for your system.The game is updated on a regular basis with a lot of new levels and ways to play but also a lot of cosmetic stuff as well.Speaking of cosmetic stuff Rocket League contains many DLC packs that are purely for the looks and I find most of them to be fairly non expensive even though not necesserily worth it.Great all around experience definitely not gonna regret buiyng this.,Rocket League®

Its really fun to play with friends and solo. The best part about the game is that when you do something really cool you can say I did that not any computer controller character ME I did that! Totally went above and beyond my expectations. However if you have a slow computer like mine then aquadome which is one of the arenas that you can play in is extremely laggy.

2018-01-20,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Rocket League is just flat out fun and chances are you've never played anything quite like it. The premise is obvious Control a souped up RC car to try and knock the ball into the opposing teams goal. This is simple on paper but proves to be much more of a challenge in practice. Of course you get the hang of things and getting the ball moving in the right direction becomes easier as you play. The customization is pretty robust even if there is a significant lack of free car bodies. You might even get a flashback or two from the first few need for speed games with all the cosmetics you'll be playing with.I would absolutely recommend Rocket League to just about anyone. Even in a match where you lose you'll probably be having fun anyway so long as you don't take it too seriously. Both teams falling over backwards in a corner trying to get the ball towards or away from the goal is simultaneously the most frustrating and the funniest pile up you will ever be a part of. I don't know about you but the hilarious novelty of trying to play soccer with a car will never grow old.,Rocket League®

2017-09-13,0,0,552,False,Recommended,This game has been my life ever since it was released. I bought it initially on PS4 and proceeded to buy it again for PC. Love the game in it's entirety. No pay to win features friendly(ish) community and a constant craving to get better and get that 'Champion' title on ranked. You'll start off uncordinated and slow and eventually suprise the hell out of yourself when you're flying through the air hitting the trickiest shots at ridiculous angles. The only thing I would like to see is a profanity filter for the feint of heart instead of banning anyone who types a curse word that is a little overboard.,Rocket League®
2018-01-20,0,0,476,False,Recommended,"Back in 2016 I believe my group of friends was searching for a game we all could play together. Since none of us were Steam users back then you can understand that games like NFS and such which have integrated online party systems were not our best fit. As the time of couch co op was coming to a close one of us stumbled upon a funny little game Rocket League.""Dude you won't believe but you play football(soccer) with your cars you boost and all and most of all it has four way splitscreen gaming"" and that was it. We hooked up the game to our LCD and started playing only to fail effortlessly in performing even the simplest of tasks. We bumped into each other instead of actually hitting the ball kept boosting and flicking in hopes of getting something done while one of our friends actually got so irritated that he went back home. Rest of us kept on mashing buttons and so on only to eventually understand how sensitive are movements should be. ""GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL"" finally the sound of victory.We were told that if you're not playing online you're not really playing the game since players FLY in the air while playing matches and it was something alien to us. I went back to the game and starting boosting my car in random angles after a single jump and man I started flying all across the map.This damn game it awakened a whole new friendship within my friends circle and we'd all play the game together for hours understanding management practicing on our accuracy and so forth. Eventually we bought this game on Steam and man it was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my gaming world.I will quote Thanos for a bold and simple explanation of this game as an emotional journey.""In time you will know what it is like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right. Yet to fail all the same. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.""You will fall and keep falling until you hit the spot in this game. It is an excruciating journey and I would recommend you to try it out.Psyonix does a great job with the constant updates the community is really generous and matchmaking is also decent.Hit me up if you do buy the game I'll get you started on the basics or well I can be your first rocketeer friend.Rock on!",Rocket League®

My only complaint with Rocket League is that all you get is a bouncy car soccer game. There are no other modes. The game play is extremely straight forward. I feel this would be more appropriate as a mini game in GTA than a standalone game for 20 dollars. It's great and I certainly enjoy it. I just wish there was more to enjoy.

2016-11-15,0,0,1266,False,Recommended,+ really awesome gameplay addictive game gameplay wise 10/10. For the record I never played any game more than a month or two every time I just got bored eventually and had to lay the game off. This game? Bought it about a year or year and a half ago and did not have any hiatus longer than a day or two. + teaches you self control. After a time you understand you have to take a break after few lost games in a row. This game is about 70% about psyche its about how concentrated and how chill you are. The second you become frustrated and you lose concentration you lose the game. enormously stupid community of people. Seriously you have never met bigger number of a holes until you played rocket league. Community 2/10 meaning you meet about two fine people out of 10. The rest is not just mean. They are the biggest bunch of 12 y.o. spoiled brats laughing in your face constantly. aquadome map (needlessly detailed brings fps down)overall 9/10 because you can turn off the chat. If you are a nice person buy it. If you have high self esteem and if you are arogant go grow up an then when you behave properly buy the game and enjoy.,Rocket League®

2016-07-23,0,0,373,False,Not Recommended,good game but has serious issues. matchmaking is terribly unbalanced. 90% of the matches are stomps which makes players quit. because players quit all the time they get replaced with ai who actively shoot goals for the other team making the games even more one sided. the experience rankings show player skill pretty accurately. players have the option to hide it though which adds nothing while taking away from seeing if you are in a fair match or not. the camera is not bad but when the ball goes up in the air nothing is visible on the field. when the ball is in the air the camera should hold the ball at the top of the screen not the center. around the edges of the field your camera will constantly be in areas that completely cover the screen. you literally have to guess what is going on when this happens. charging for keys to open up crates isnt terrible but it is when you get an item (which usually isnt a crate) once every few hours. take into account that you can get items in crates for cars you do not own you can get duplicates of items in crates(which not everyone trades so this sucks) and crate items can only be combined with other items from the same crate to turn them into something else. overall rocket league is a good game but i cannot recommend it with the huge focus on dlc maps no one likes and competitive rocket league that no one watches instead of problems that have been in the game since the start.NEWEST UPDATE matchmaking has gotten significantly worse. ive played against multiple grand champions (im a veteran so im not a tenth as good as them). the teams are always stacked super heavy. it will be like master master expert vs veteran (me) semi pro pro. people try to talk about mmr and stuff it really doesnt matter. the experience rankings dictate who wins the game 95% of the time so can we just have matchmaking based on that? Just got out of a match where I was teamed up with two rookies against a team of master players. They made fun of the rookies on my team. This is the garbage that having such a cancerous matchmaking system creates.,Rocket League®

2015-08-01,0,0,57,False,Recommended,One of the dumbest ideas ever You're a car playing football.It is however a really fun and addicting game. While it initially may look like everything happens based on luck when you take time to actually learn the game and it's tricks you'll be surprised how much knowledge and skill is involved on many of the plays.It is compatible with a controller and has a nice tutorial for the newcomers. The cars have an easy handling and you can make some flashy plays even at low level.So far the community is pretty nice and you can communicate with the players via chat in game voice communication or with a dozen of fast accessible pre created phrases. Also the game has dedicated servers and it's really easy and fast to find and join a game as (for now) there are tons of people to play with.I actually think they should have gone for a F2P style and profit by selling cosmetics like TF2 or LoL though.Anyway either you're a newbie or a veteran you'll enjoy it and have tons of fun!

You play football matches against other cars in either a 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 match. They have also quite recently added a 2v2 mode where you play basketball instead of just football there is also a hockey mode for the hockey lovers of course.

2016-10-12,0,0,487,False,Recommended,"Hands down my favorite pick up and play title for the last few months. This game's design is tuned *just right* in so many areas to make things fun fast fair and balanced. Looking back on it I don't know if I would have ever bought this game had it not come with the Steam Controller. I'm so glad it did though.Game is always being updated with new content All purchases are completely cosmetic. Neat movie tie ins with some car skins. Great recent visual update. New stages and game play modes being added all the time. My (seriously) only complaint I wish that ranked matches were only ever held in the ""base"" soccer field meaning the ubiquitous rectangular prism. Like Final Destination in SSBM a vanilla map like that really puts everything in a skills based arena and gives a nice level playing ground. Introducing new maps into the rotation is annoying in my 450.0 hours of play time I have yet to meet a person who likes playing on the Mad Max field.",Rocket League®

This game takes the basics from the original and just improves massively over it. The controls are basic and easy to learn however due to the airial maneuvering and jumps able to be performed the skill ceiling is very high. The visual customisiation of the vehicles is highly rewarding and the season mode is a welcome addition.

Not word for word or anything I re phrased it to the best of my ability from my horrible memory but still... that statement couldn't be more true.

2016-08-06,0,0,39,False,Recommended,Rocket League is pure simple fun. Give it a try despite any preconceived notions you may have about soccer or racing videogames. This is one of those games that you end up playing for 2+ hours when you were looking to kill a few minutes. Customization aspect is there and there is a ranked mode. Devs are consistent with updates and exploring new unique gamemodes. However they have ignored a few glitches that really should have been hotfixed by now. Still the core gameplay is tight and it's sure to keep you occupied. Buy it especially if it's on sale.,Rocket League®

I recommend this game for anyone even if you're not a fan of sports.

2016-08-08,0,0,443,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a great multiplayer game. When first hearing of the game's concept you may be hesitant to believe that it is fun to play but it is! Playing soccer with crazy turbo boosting cars is insane. But this game has branched off from soccer as well. Now there is hockey and basketball to test your skills at too. The company behind this game is also incredible. Psyonix listens to the Rocket League community implementing necessary gameplay tweaks and is regularly adding new content. They have introduced new game modes cars and maps every couple of months which keeps players coming back. 9.5/10,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,1825,False,Recommended,I've played this game for hundreds of hours and still have yet to feel bored of the game. I received this game in a bundle with the steam link and it has dominated my gaming life since. All other games just don't seem as fun after playing this game. The skill cap is hard to reach and there's always more to perfect. The community on the other hand is not as good as the game. While I was in the lower two tiers of ranks almost everybody I played with had a superiority complex and had some of the most vulgar and rude language I've ever seen. I've received death threats for goals that shouldn't have happened and much more indecent things... As you rise to Rising Star and above you'll realize not everybody is a jerk and people acknowledge when they are wrong. Great game meh community if you don't plan to get too competitive. I would recommend it if you have the money to spare. Great game to play with friends.,Rocket League®

2016-10-18,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Every person I've shown this game to has loved it. Here's a number of reasons to give it a shot Dialed in physics. Super tight driving controls. Super tight FLYING controls (although hard to master). Quick fast gameplay and games (5 minute rounds by default). Numerous FREE updates and modes from the game devs. Tons of customization options for your vehicle (free and paid). The birth of numerous jaw dropping and hillarious moments that can only be created by rocket boosting cars around on a soccer field.Just give it a go on a friend's console and there's a 90% chance you'll be hooked.,Rocket League®

2016-10-18,0,0,2213,False,Recommended,"I 100% Recommend this game. I have 800 hours in Rocket league at this time and I can say for sure I have gotten everything I want in a competative sports game from it! Many people might not follow through and continue playing this game for a few reasons and I can tell you a few and how to get over them and play the game to it's fullest.Many people just abandon the game because they think they aren't good enough. When I was a noob i remember saying ""one day I want to do an aerial"" and every day before school i played for an hour every day after school i played for a few hours just practicing and eventually i reached where I am now doing aerial dribbles and passing more than I've ever seen before. Many people might also abandon the game because they don't have anyone to play with. I had that problem until I met someone named Alex and we've been playing together for a couple months now and it is so much fun communicating and playing as a team. So find people to play with it is very fun. Don't give up and if you're going to buy the game buy it and never give up. Practice practice practice practice. Trust me. Have fun!",Rocket League®

2015-08-01,0,0,234,False,Recommended,This is a very good game in my oppinion. Since I bought the game I Have played it to death. The graphics are good and I get smooth gameplay offline and on servers. I also only get the mimimum requirements met and as I said earlier still smooth and crisp. This may be the best soccer/football game I have ever played especially since the creators used cars insted of people. Some downsides are in multiplayer players dropout and that isn't fun for anyone. Controls are confusing and I had to change them. Overall I would reccomend this game to anybody that likes soccer/football or racing games. 9/10,Rocket League®

2017-08-27,0,0,525,False,Recommended,What can be said about Rocket league that has not already been said?First i would like to say that i am not a huge fan of e sport style games. Games Like DOTA CS GO and LOL are not really a great game to just go out and play the communities and players can be rather toxic and annoying when even playing casual games (overwatch goes without saying). However with rocket league an average gamer can pick up the game and actually have a good time playing with almost anyone while there are toxic members in ever facet of every game this one seems to be more easy to deal with and have less heads to worry about. While im all for some good jabs at opponents as most people can probably contest some people are just unbearable. (if i had a dollar for ever jack wad that told me to kys i could pay a few months rent in advance)The platform is spot on and it goes without saying that the game has become rather polished over the years leaving a clean and fun competitive environment to flex ones skills and improve.DLC is all cosmetic and some of the money they get form sales goes towards having more tournaments with larger cash pools. so its really refreshing to see this as opposed to PTW style DLC.If you game with a lot of friends i recommend this game it's fun and can really lead to some epic high energy matches. There is a learning curve to get over as far as getting better at the game and being able to preform high skilled maneuvers. But overall most of these skills are not impossible to lean and eventually become more proficient at.Finally i will say this if you do not like games that require time and patients to learn and possibly even master this or many other e sport titles may not be your cup of tea. But if you like physically grinding to become better and like rich competitive environments then rocket league is a solid buy.,Rocket League®

2018-02-17,0,0,717,False,Not Recommended,I love the game spent already XYZ hours playing it. Never played any other game for so long. And still... I DON'T RECOMMEND IT. Why? Because of the community.The game owners just don't care about the peoples behavior. You can't really play a normal competitive game without any problems. It happens so rarely that you can really play a normal 3 vs 3 game with strangers. It's barely possible. There are always jerks in one or the other team that decided to ff because it's already 0 1 people go afk just leave matches play against their teams troll insult other players etc. You win most of the matches because there are idiots in the opposite team and you lose most of the matches because there are idiots in your team. You can play the best match ever and still lose you can play like a noob and win because little kids in the other team are fighting with each other. It just doesn't matter. And of course reporting other players doesn't change anything.If you like to be frustrated than play it. It took too much time to understand that this game just make me furious. And I don't care if I win or lose the way it happens makes me crazy. DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. Peace out.,Rocket League®

2015-07-13,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Bought this game last night and completely worth the $20. The mechanics and feel of the game are solid. However if you are looking to just play single player I highly suggest that you not buy this game then. This game heavily works on Multiple experience and with friends! Even if your losing in a match it is still awesome to play!Pros Solid Mechanics Great simple concepts and control scheme (so that anyone can pick it up!) Great multiplayer servers (experienced very little lag) Skins and custom features for your car! REPLAY CAM! The moments when you score an epic goal just keeps you going!Some thoughts I would love for them to have a better system for assists. There are plenty of times where I had a assist between 3 people but it only registers the last two. The VOIP in game is kind of off can't tell who is talking or if it is only with your team or everyone in the match.

2016-06-25,0,0,17,False,Recommended,A very very good game! I purchased this mid 2014 I think and I found it decent however the thing that I couldn't stand was the lag on the online section on the game. This made it hard to play the game and it really put me off. This may be because of my wifi I must point out but it tends to be strong so I doubt it. And lets face it Rocket League wouldn't be as good without the online section of the game.However recently (well... a few months ago) the game started becoming as popular as it was maybe because of the 'free game days' on Xbox where you can try games out which it was featured in. So I decieded to go back and play it... well I never thought you could be so pleasently suprised with a video game! The lag was obviously fixed and various new maps and car decals were released.

I'm not a massive fan of anything related to footbal (imo it's just a bunch of overpaid fairies kicking a ball (and each other) around a feild for 90 minutes... BOOOORING!) and I must say...

2016-07-04,0,0,1089,False,Recommended,You get out of this game what you put in.Rocket League is not a sports game its a sport. You don't have player ratings or level up your shooting or unlock the best character. The only thing you can choose is your car and they all go the same speed.Well doesn't that make it boring there's no progression its just playing a soccer match over and over?HELL NO!You want a perfectly lobbed pass right in front of your teammate and over your defender? You don't hit Lt+A and your car just knows how to do it. You dribble the ball on top of your car and once the ball is the perfect angle over your car you pop that sucker over him then your teammate doesn't just hit B and he shoots he has to time the hit and know should I flip into it or will that make it go over? Maybe just a guiding bump.There are endless possibilities!You practice your own moves startegies and plays. The only thing they set you up with is the field and yet it can be infintely rewarding getting better and climbing through the league divisions.It's not a sports game. Its Rocket League.10/10 Would score own goal like it was a 5 year old soccer game again.,Rocket League®

I personally prefer playing with friends because it kills time and it can be fun and competitive suprisingly enough.

2016-06-27,0,0,9,False,Recommended,I think a lot of people see this game as just silly fun and while it is it also is good at being a soccer game itself. Most other sports games like Fifa or Madden have you in command of a team. You aren't actually playing the sport you're telling people in the game how to play. While that's all well and good it isn't really a game about that sport it's a game about you in command of a sports team. In Rocket League you're playing soccer. You are in complete control of one member of the team and only that member. You can work with your teammates on the fly but you are unable to take control of their vehicles. That's what makes this so good. You feel something when goals happen because it's directly related to what you as a player have done. You didn't tell some guy to run down the field with the ball to strike you actually DID that. Couple that with good sounds nice graphics and plenty of non payed for unlockables to keep you going and Rocket League becomes an amazing video game.

2016-01-21,0,0,845,False,Recommended,Rocket League is definately up there when it comes to great games. I would recomend this game to anyone. It is a game that is easy to learn and hard to master. It is a game i find myself riggling around in my chair trying to hit the ball. Screaming at my team mate for stealling my shot. Rage quiting because of my horrible internet. Death starring my computer for only being able to play it on virtually min settings and low resolusion and only getting 30 40 frames. (Nvidia 210) I am currently pestering my friends who dont already have the game to get the game. The support from physonic and the continuous updates keep players active. You start of as a rookie madly rushing towards the ball trying to hit it anyway you can. Semi pro You start to see a way of doing things you ocationally leave it for someone in a better position to hit. Able to perform some saves.Pro The person who starts closest to goal realises that he should stay back and defend at the kickoff after a goal and at the start of the game a minute number of people realise they can use boost while jumping and start doing small airials. People realise how to jump off the wall and hit the ball. Able to save goals well.Veteran Learn about / become better at airials. able to jump off a wall ad use boost to hit the ball.

2015-12-04,0,0,553,False,Not Recommended,Pros +Very fun gameplay especially with friends.Cons Filled to the brim with microtransaction crates ala Counter Strike Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. They're all cosmetic items such as new car models and paint finishes however these were previously stand alone DLC packs that didn't rely on gambling. The proceeds of the sales goes towards the prize pool for official Rocket League eSports events. While the gameplay itself is fun what isn't fun are the abysmal game servers. Even if you have a ping time in the 20 or 30s of milliseconds you'll still get rubberbanding. It seems that even with the massive amounts of cash generated from game sales and microtransactions Psyonix just can't afford good servers to handle the load of players even at non peak hours.,Rocket League®

2016-06-21,0,0,288,False,Recommended,In the past I was reluctant to purchase this game even though my friends all said it was great. I thought it would just be an arcade feeling game that would get old after about 10hrs of play. I couldn't be more wrong. Whether you play this game casually in small bursts or competitively with a team this game is an absolute blast. By far one of the happiest purchases I have in my library.The only negative I can really think of is that all the different car types you can choose from are not just aesthetic changes like they seem. Only recently did I discover they actually have different sized hitboxes and turning speeds. For casual players this shouldn't matter at all but for competitive players it's a bit of a downer. I love the look of some of the cars but they come out to be slightly worse than others. In a competitive environment it's never good to put yourself at a disadvantage no matter how small.,Rocket League®

When the game was released it wasn't clear it'd take off like that. However it did.In case it dies at any point in time though the bot support really stands out. On the higher skill levels they're challenging enough for casual players to make sure this game playable even if the multiplayer ends up dead.

2016-07-30,0,0,166,False,Recommended,I've just hit the big 5 0 in hours for Rocket League and that means it's a major hit for me. In the case of Rocket League it's simply because it's so fun that hardly a day goes by that I don't play at least a couple matches.The concept is simple enough cars + soccer but the execution is what really makes it. It's all about your own abilities as well as the situational awareness you and your teammates have. See a teammate setting up a shot? Lay back a few seconds and prepare to go for the goal. The opposing team just made a shot and your team has no one backfield? Better prepare to defend if no one else is. Is the opposing team's star player in front of you and looking at taking a shot? Might be time to boost into them for a demolition!As the examples above illustrate it's very much a game where both being smarter than always going for the ball as well as tactical skill will make a difference. To be sure being able to make those jump shots will play a considerable role and if you're facing a team with much better tactics it will be hard to win. But it's so gratifying to see your teammates take advantage of your setups as well and so frustrating when you're unable to score because the other team is sure to always have someone ready to defend on a second's notice.The controls also deserve a note since the game recommends a controller. I didn't buy the game until trying it on a free weekend due to that recommendation but thankfully the game works just fine with a keyboard + mouse. The precision on turns is not quite as good but you can still performs lots of sick moves without a controller and feel naturally in control of your car. I have a friend who's in the Challenger tier with keyboard + mouse so you don't need a controller to become pretty good. I did recently start using my XBox (original) controller in the game and that works well enough too especially after a couple input rebinds. As a PC gamer historically I'm still better with keyboard + mouse than controller but my tenative plan at this point is to switch to controller for soccer and stick with keyboard + mouse for the rather different hockey mode.Hockey Mode (Snow Day) deserves a mention of its own. This has become my favorite game mode and while the amount of games is about 98% soccer 1% basketball 1% hockey there's still more than enough hockey to find a game quickly in the U.S. East region even though it's the middle of summer. This mode plays with a puck that's less bouncy than the regular soccer ball and thus is much more a game about the edges of the field and angles of attack. After learning how to set up shots in that mode it's become the icing on the cake for me and I'd highly recommend giving it a try.Spec wise the game is not especially demanding. I typically play on a Radeon 6870 that's below the recommended specs but I can still run the game at 60 FPS steady with near max settings at 1920x1200. And it looks amazing. On my laptop with a Mobility Radeon 5870 and Windows XP (which isn't even officially supported but works) I have to turn the specs down but it's still plenty playable. At least as long as I'm on Ethernet mediocre wireless and high pings do have a noticeable negative impact on the game. So pack an Ethernet cord if you're playing it at a friend's place but as long as you have halfway decent graphics you'll probably be fine in that department.At this point I see no foreseeable end in sight to Rocket League being in my standard repertoire of games. I plan it at home. I play it with friends. There's soccer hockey Rocket Labs for a bit of variety in life. And I'm still learning new techniques that increase my skill but as importantly the number of maneouvers I have to play with in game. An excellent game and I'd definitely recommend picking it up.,Rocket League®

It is well worth the money and the DLC is very reasonably priced especially with the 2 car packs. Even though I only got the game last night I'm already considering getting the DLC this game is a MASTERPIECE. But with all things beautiful the internet kills it. But this time literally. The servers at the moment are terribly plagued with rubber banding. This effects the game A LOT when playing online. My ping is at a constant 20 40 yet I get pretty bad rubber banding. The worst thing is it's the console's fault. Ever since there was crossplay the servers went to s**t. If this carries on it may affect my score more than it does already.Anyway overall I give this game a 9/10 on it's own without the server problem and 7/10 with the server problem.Scoring System1 Terrible don't ever buy it2 Buy as a joke if 90% off and you don't want any friends3 Only buy for yourself if you hate yourself4 Buy when on 90% off for 10 30 mins of gameplay5 Decent amount of gameplay buy when on sale6 Buy for an above average experience7 Quite good game buy if you want a good experience8 Buy ASAP when on &gt 30% sale9 Buy even when on a minimal sale/no sale at all10 F**king masterpiece.

Definitely need to stick to whatever control method you are most used to (controller/keyboard) as I started trying to play this with a keyboard and struggled because I was not used to playing on one (plus it was a laptop keyboard) although I could see having much less trouble if I got used to it. Hooked up an Xbox One controller to my computer though and it improved my game significantly since that is what I am used to.

There's very little room for error and the camera controls aren't the best. Oftentimes I'll find myself wildly flying far past the ball after I flipped the opposite direction I moved the controller. Perhaps these issues are my fault but I digress. The online community is very toxic but if you play with friends that are competent at the game you'll have a good time.

2017-05-23,0,0,634,False,Recommended,Excellent gameGood graphics customisation replayability competitiveness and never ending perfectionism.This game allows you to customize your car using stickers colors hats trails explosions engine sound (although a part in each category is locked by a paywall or crates with keys system). It's using a ingame trading system with items such as crates skins car models etc. It's also insanely replayable and allows the player to constantly see himself improve as hours are invested. Learning new strategies and once impossible moves such as aerials prove themselves really satisfying once learned and applied perfectly.Now yes there's smurfs around... However when you think of it most games with ranking systems have this issue. It also has few minor issues with ranking and casual matchmaking which is generally close to perfect (sometimes had a couple of tight games with 1 0 on overtime!)Really good game should defenitely give it a try.,Rocket League®

I know I know I'm rocking an older dreamGear DGPS3 1394 (2010?)but the thing works with virtually every other program I've thrown at it. I read somewhere on Psyonix's forums that due to cost they decided to not include DirectInput. This means that you have to ""trick"" the computer into thinking you have an Xbox 360 controller that uses Xinput. I tried using Xbox360ce to no avail. Probably a solid title no big doubts there but I'm a little ticked Steam gets controller support happy when something so integral to that notion is left out.

2015-10-19,0,0,1178,False,Recommended,This is my favorite game in ages. The game is fun from the second you start playing and until now (way more than 200h on PS4 and PC combined) it just keeps getting more fun. The game is the perfect example of easy to learn and hard to master. You just keep learning more and more intricate ways to use the basic controls.

2016-09-12,0,0,1098,False,Recommended,One of the greatest games ever made. Seeing as I have over 600 hours on this game I thought I'd weigh in. Rocket League is a game that is similar to Counter Strike (in the competitive way). My thoughts? 600 hours in and I still suck I'm okay in this. I know how to do aerials and I can hit the ball decently but sometimes you see people that do amazing freestyle shots and you just want to be like them. That is why I want to keep playing this it's all about progression. And when you do get frustrated (trust me you will) you can easily quit the game after a couple of games because the games it self only takes less than 6ish minutes (unless you have a crazy overtime play). Buy this game support the devs they listen this game is a classic already. I love it I love the community. I love the saltiness it brings out in me and other players.

Only to find out later that all five of my so stated ""duplicates"" were gone from my Garage.I hope that this is either an early bug or that the explanation on your website is faulty because I was unprepared to lose five toppers that weren't actually duplicates just to get some cat ears I probably won't equip in the near future.Other than that.

2016-07-12,0,0,1083,False,Recommended,Rocket league is one of the best games I've ever played. Most people would disagree. There are of course some pros and cons to this game.

The game music is AMAZING.The car customizing is pretty cool. The physics is being improved.The game is fast paced. CONS The game is SO heavy on the graphics card and CPU. It may cause over heating could range from fps lags to complete shut down of your PC. IF you're not using a godlike pc of course.The match making could be a bit annoying in ranks.I get random ping lags in some servers.

Easy to learn incredibly difficult to master this game just packs a huge amount of great gameplay into a super simple easy to digest package. The matches are pretty short so if you find yourself on a bad team or dont like the players its easy to just finish out and hop into a new lobby. Playing with friends and learning to coordinate is a blast and the game is well supported with free updates and some awesome cosmetic DLC. Cant really think of a bad thing to say here the game just keeps getting better and better the longer it goes.,Rocket League®

2016-09-03,0,0,1061,False,Recommended,"I wanted to post this when I had way more time on this game so I knew pretty much all of the games features and basically ""how to play... well."" I'm still not there yet but I'm gonna post it now because why not? I play well and know most advanced mechanics and play styles and a bit of freestyle. OK I'll stop rambling on about how good I am when I'm clearly still a noob to this ""easy to learn hard to master"" game. So where to start? Well this game will make you rage a lot. To be honest the ranked pairing system still isn't where it needs to be. As an expert you may get paired with a legend maybe a pro. It may be a 9 0 game to you or maybe 0 9 to them. *Time doesn't mean skill* Okay so the gameplay. The controls are insanely smooth (unless you play with a keyboard and mouse but unlucky you if so) the bounces feel realistic and all the cars are slightly different with some slower to turn but a sleeker hitbox and some may have a very good turning circle but very robust large hitbox all better for a different play style. (eg. Dominus for attacking Octane for midfield and Merc for defence.) And on to graphics even though you shouldn't worry too much about those in a fast paced game are very pretty and have a great atmosphere. It feels like you're in a real stadium but instead of a normal football ground you're playing car football in a floating arena around a city or a park. The game is a huge huge jump from it's predecessor ""acrobatic rocket powered battle cars"". Which if you loved as child (or teenager) you will almost certainly love this if not more. The devolepers are always coming with new patches and updates and also have merchandise. (Which to be honest I bought a lot of c ) Overall it's a very challenging fun fast paced game I'm sure you will play for hundreds of hours on end.",Rocket League®

My favorite is the Portal Cake because Portal. But there is also a HUGE selection of little flags that can go on the back of your car. Countries game logos etc. Designing your car is just as fun as wrecking people with it. And scoring goals of course. 10/10.,Rocket League®

I originally got it for free on PS Plus when it first came out and instantly put over 100 or so hours into it. Rocket League is the very definition of ""easy to learn hard to master"". The game takes about 10 or so minutes to really learn the controls but there is so much more to learn. The game constantly revolves around skill and pure luck.

2016-07-18,0,0,426,False,Recommended,When I play an online game like a shooter against other players and someone kills me...well that doesn't happen. No one kills me. Because that would mean that all those people are better than me and that is not acceptable. Why would they lie like that. They are lying if they kill me. And that means I will have to kill...everyone...slowly...in real life. Someone...everyone will pay.That about sums up how my brain reacts to online PvP. But with Rocket League I can actually have fun and not feel pressured or (too) angry. I guess that has partially to do with the fact that players do not attack each other as much as they attack the goal. But it is also because the game just has a happy silly and easy to grasp gameplay. This game compares well to Insurgency. That may sound strange since Insurgency is an FPS but the energy and efficiency of both games are similar. You get into a match quite fast. Once the game is over new players are found if some players leave. The flow keeps going. The game's not too fast not too slow. On top of that the game looks great and runs smoothly. There are customization options and different game types. I frankly can't find a negative...Rocket Leage is quite possibly the most fun I've had with a computer.,Rocket League®

Absolutely the BEST GAME of 2015. I heard the servers were bad in the beginning but it is actually fine. I am getting into matches quickly and there are no timeouts or server crashes.

Still tons of players on the servers and still getting some great matches. I still have a problem with the matchmaking though. I'll have a few good runs where I'm matched with players with similar ranks and we have good competitive evenly matched games. But once that brief run is over I'm constantly getting matches with players several levels higher than me and those games just aren't fun. Three Experts two Masters. and little old Semi Pro me... not quite a fair fight. Sometimes they'll throw in another Semi Pro or Pro player but often times when that happens that player ends up on my team so the odds are even less in our favor.

This game opens up alot of oppritunity and allows you to buy the game and play. Once you pay any ingame purchases wont realy matter. Noothing you guy ingame helps you in beffinificial ways.

2015-09-30,0,0,498,False,Not Recommended,I love the idea of Rocket League but it is just broken. I feel the ranking system is unfair because when you are unranked you get paired up with people of a higher rank every fricking time. Most of the time the physics just don't make sense and need a lot of work and the ranking system is #/&lt !. If your teammate leaves the game or disconnects you should not be penilised. But you do. If you are outnumbered you would want to leave the game right? Well you can if you want to get absolutely ruined by the ranking system by div downing you and stopping you from matchmaking for 15 minutes. This is a stupid penilisation for wanting the game to be fair. So you have to slave it out and stay in which makes no sense and is stupid. If you are an angry person do not buy this. Actually if you are just a person don't buy this game it is not worth it. I despise this game with a passion.,Rocket League®

There are hundreds of custom items to make your car ""your own"" and it can be maddening just how many options there are. None of the cosmetic stuff affects game play at all but its fun to have a setup that no one has seen.If you're looking for a game that is fun easy to learn hard to master and has very high replay ability this is the game for you.

Soaring through the air hitting a ball with a car sounds weird but is incredibly entertaining. The customization is amazing. The Cars look great. The arenas look great. And in my roughly 250 hours of playing I am yet to encounter a glitch. My only criticism with the game would be the trading trading only affects the look of your car but besides that makes no difference to gameplay.

You'd boiled the spinach of life and found rich leafy textures appealing to your adult soul but in the back of your mind something shrieked to the marimba of uncertainty.Memories of a field adorned with the ruin of mechanical foes long past. A gently gliding exploder ball that denies you regardless of your choice in shirt/pants combos. An eternal foe revving a thousand cylinders of rage at you with amorous intentDelve deep into this battlefield of worlds and know that the yours is the hand of fate in this land of goals and broken dreams. Yours are the eyes that will see the goal before you and reach for it with beckoning fingers only to be swept away by the moustache tendrils of defeat. Time and time again you will witness the acrobatics of an elegant foe and dream of their demise by the wheels of your trusty neon steed. Yet as your eager dreams of glorious combat fade you are left with the bittersweet cinnamon of realization stuck to your molars. Was it combat you truly sought? Or only the elusive lechuga we all know to be the heartbeat of all things? The lechuga is a ephemeral concept my friend few can truly grasp it in scarred fingers and truly see it for its identity. Strife and struggle will make your heart weary to the world but do not let it seal your eyes to the truth of things. Be unafraid to flip your motor car repeatedly while boosting across this sanguine field of blood and bones. The field is your stage and you must be the true warrior to win all the fights upon it.

Just played a game where a guy spun on his top the whole match. While I laughed a lot his teammate was angry.In pub games teammates regularly leave and are replaced by bots. You are regularly thrown into matches where it is halfway done and the score sucks. In ranked games if a teammate leaves you're down a man. What fun when a 3v3 becomes 3v2. You can also start matches where not everyone loads and the game is then canceled (wait for match load wait for players wait for loaders nothing what fun!).No reporting no muting these are two really simple features for an online game so there is not a lot of variety or real polish. This game is worth maybe 5 bucks at most. Wait for it on sale. PS4 players get it free and that is a good deal because that is what it is really worth NOTHING.,Rocket League®

The game is entertaining fresh nothing about it is salt inducing cause there are no cheap strategy everything is skill based. And best of all each match is a 5 min adrenaline packed game.The only downside I mean the only single con about this game is the Unreliable Servers. I live in India and have to play on a 180 ping server of EU against players with 28 ping. Because other servers give me 250 to 400 ping.

With all the options and the addicting nature of the game plus the frequent updates it's unlikely you'll get bored.It's worth noting though that it will take some time to get good at the ""acrobatic"" aspect with jumping flipping and boosting although you can still win plenty of games without having to utilize those too much.If you have a laptop or an older PC you might get lag at the beginning of the match but most new PCs should run it fine.

2017-08-20,0,0,833,False,Recommended,"Rocket league is a great game. It has mixed football with flying cars whats not to like about it. For my review I am going to break it down into different segments and first will be....Gameplay it is an incredibly difficult game to play. However no matter how good or bad you are you are always able to have fun on this game. Theres plenty of different game modes like rumble or basketball (hoops) and its a simple idea that provides hours upon hours of fun. It is a game of skill though you cant just learn everything in a day different skills will require hard work and a lot of practice to perform like air dribbling which means (you guessed it) to dribble or carry the ball through the air with your car. Theres a lot of cars to try out each having their own benefit to use with different turning circles hitboxes etc... Theres an absolute tonne of stuff that goes into the mechanical side to the game which is your skillset but theres also the mentality that you need. In order to gain ranks and improve skill in team based gamemodes like 2v2s you need to learn rotation and when to attack and when not to attack. It is a really simple idea but with a very complex learning curve. I mean im about 800hrs in (with ps4 hours roughly included) and im only diamond rank 1 which is barely *good*. Each gamemode also has a different style of play like in solo you will typically be more passive but the more team mates you play with the more creative and assertive you can be. The gameplay I rate a 9/10. The only reason it isn't a 10/10 is because if you play solo the game can become very repetitive and boring for those who aren't competitive and the somewhat bad matchmaking system.Next is the cosmetic side to the game. This wasn't too great at the start of the game as there wasn't too many customisable options however with the new season just starting it has opened up a world of oppertunity to look majestic while putting opponents to shame. You can change colors. decals wheels toppers antennas goal explosions the wheel track your car has when it reaches *supersonic*. Everything has become customisable and im sure Psyonix is working on more stuff as we speak. Not as complex as the gameplay and no color sliders or anything but it is a decent customisation system they have made and will rate it an 8/10Finally my last topic is the community. The community like most games are terrible at the lower ranks you miss an easy ball you get spammed with ""what a save!"" constantly. However psyonix has listened to our complaints about this kind of behaviour in more extreme cases like swearing and just complete sh*t talk. Luckily enough many players are against the toxicity as you move towards the higher ranks so it gets better the more you do. However its usually not until you reach Platinum rank that the toxicity really takes a nose dive in consistency. For these reasons im giving the community a 7/10 because there are a lot of people willing to help others prosper in the game its just a small amount overall that are toxic. My overall rating is an 8/10 for this game. I have put a lot of hours into the game and have had a great experience and have even met some of my best friends on here. A great game to play overall with tonnes of fun. I wont go into trading because im pretty sure thats similar to most other games. Hope you found this helpful!",Rocket League®

2017-06-21,0,0,966,False,Recommended,I absolouty love rocket league. Great and amazing game. But i hate the ranking system online. Its kinda stupid and can take so many wins just to level up a division. I onces had to have 20 wins just to go to the next rank (silv2 silv3) i was kinda off by that. If rocket league can fix this I would be so happy.,Rocket League®

2015-09-17,0,0,1,False,Recommended,"I will call this game carball since we use cars to cick ball xD.Rocket League is a soccer game that is played by car and not by foot. Though the game is not all about ball but going crazy with the car and smashing each other and the ball of cause. And that is what i like about the game the fun is UNLIMITED.the MMO is fantastic the graphics is awesome and most of all you can split your screen into four places seeing each of your mates game while the tag along with you which means you can have up to 4 players playing with you on your machine which kids will love(get your siblings this game as thier birthday gift). the game can be played alone and still has the unlimited fun. the control is simple as ever although I would have prefer if they could make the car relocate its self to the ball direction when the ""Y"" button is pressed(on xbox controller) and not just show us where the ball is. in the end I will give Rocket League 9.8/10 and ofcause its worth buying at full price and I recomend you to buy it and play it because ROCKET LEAGUE IS AWESOMETACULAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Rocket League®

The skill gap from the world's best to casual friends who play at a party is both massive but also doesn't matter. Anyone can play this game and will have fun regardless of age and skill level. The DLC is purely cosmetic so there is no pay to win.There are a variety of game modes to play and so far the producers don't seem to take them away after a few weeks like in league of legends. The cross play between PS4 and PC creates a bigger scene around the game.The frequency of updates is not too fast nor too slow.The new steam workshop support adds an immense amount of undiscovered potential.There is no pressure to win unless you want to be competitive. There are plently of options for casual players players who like competition and those who want to be the world's best.The sole point of this game is to ""have fun"" which Psyonix seems to have mastered across all ages and skill levels.",Rocket League®

2016-10-23,0,0,422,False,Recommended,I don't like sports games. I don't particularly like soccer/football I mostly play single player story driven games. If they have a multiplayer mode I might take a peek but then retreat into SP territory again. Would I recommend Rocket League? yes.But. This game is nothing short of amazing. Having played a little over 200hrs now it's consistently the first thing that crosses my mind when contemplating what to play. Extremely fun and balanced gameplay that doesn't ever get boring different modes local splitscreen multiplayer even for online matches. Matchmaking is good Servers are generally reliable. There is no way to obtain items that give you an edge over other players everything you can buy or unlock is purely cosmetic except for the different car models which differ in the shape of their hitbox and their turning radius but those differences are marginal and mostly come down to personal preference. So the whole game comes down to your skill and the learning curve is huge. You get to grips with the controls quickly but you're constantly learning and making just slightly cooler moves each game and you have so much headroom for getting better.Conclusion I've bought a lot of the DLCs and quite some keys for the game and I'll continue doing so because I feel the 20 or so bucks you're paying for the base game just aren't adequate for all the fun and playtime I get out of this game. The developer is awesome and pushes out new free content on a regular basis. Oh and the contents of the DLCs and crates are sick and high quality as well.Tips Get a controller. It's definitely playable with KB+M but you have so much more control over your car with a gamepad. Remap your buttons. Put air roll and poweslide somewhere you can press them simultaneously with the boost button. The benefit won't show at first but it's going to be hugely helpful once you get better and start to do aerials.,Rocket League®

2016-07-10,0,0,1241,False,Not Recommended,"In recent patches this game has just gotten worse and worse the September and I think the May or June patch is what ruined it. Laggy servers which have only gotten worse and worse over time and especially the ""bug fixes"" regarding the collision detection which has now been made way over sensitive.Every time two players even slightly tap each other one or both of them will just go flying away to their home planet. Or when two players hit the ball at roughly the same time they will bounce off of each other 95% of the time. This happened before the recent patches maybe 40% of the time but now it's all the time these collisions seem like they come out of a Blues Brothers movie and it happens all the ****ing time.The amount of times you will just get launched into orbit over every god damn hit is just rage inducing. Couple that with dreadful lag because Psyonix just can't be bothered to have decent servers(because this wan't always a problem when the game first came out it got worse over time) Imagine someone hits the ball and it shoots off in a direction but then the ball changes direction as if the server just got it wrong and goes back and corrects its error which leaves the player completely juked. Or if someone almost hits the ball same deal the ball reacts as if it got hit and you see it happen for a quarter second then the ball teleports to its original course and behaves as if it was never hit because it technically wasn't it's like the Server shows you what would have happened then corrects it.It's maddening to the point where this once incredible game is completely ruined...I wish I could adequately describe the lag and the overly sensitive collision detection but I can't if you feel like wasting 20 of your hard earned dollars you can see for yourself.",Rocket League®

2016-04-29,0,0,221,False,Recommended,"This might very well be one of the best games I have ever played.I have to say something huge here I am normally a HUGE story game player. I have never truly enjoyed sports games before this one. But Rocket League is incredible.See instead of taking a boring normal premise like ""You are a soccer coach now! Direct your team to victory!"" You get tossed in as one of the players and told basic controls and how to play and are then told to go play other people. This game is incredibly simple to understand and play but hard to master. It has depth in all the right ways a progressions system that means absolutely nothing but serves as a tracker for how well you are doing customization for your cars but mot importantly depth in the gameplay. There is real strategy that you have to learn in this game that you can't learn by reading guides. You have to get a feel for it and really play to understand how the game works. Because of this it draws you in as a new player and keeps you interested as an experienced player. You want to keep getting better so you keep playing and learning how it all works. Finally getting that first aerial goal (even though it probably sucked and was super lucky) is incredibly gratifying because of the hours of work you put into it. Add to it the new experimental and hoops maps which have been added recently and there is even more to learn explore and play with. Now you can really find a niche in this game that suits you well.I can absolutely recommend this game it's amazing.",Rocket League®

2016-04-29,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I'm not going to lie I am awful at this game. Its fun though. To me that's what matters. The only problem I have is that I'm always unlucky and get connected to a server with bad ping but that isn't even the game's fault its mine. I believe this game has a lot of potential to change the gaming genre popularity. Right now shooters are the most popular back then it was platformers and RPGs. Rocket League might make racing games or sport games more popular in the future but that's just me. Very fun I'm just terrible at it.Also 5 bucks for DLC heck yea.,Rocket League®

2017-11-12,0,0,54,False,Recommended,It involves a car. A ball. And lots of teamwork. Teamwork is a big component in this game. I often play this game with my son and his friends and we have a blast. Which can also be frustrating (with young teenage boys when you just want to get a quick game in) waiting 30min. so they can do all their trades. This is quite a change from other games that I play. It s non stop go. For instance playing PUBG where you can go a whole game not seeing another player only to be shot in the back. We have done some custom matches which can be quite interesting. Changing in game gravity size of the ball amount of boost Guaranteed a few laughs with friends.I do have a few hours of game time but I go to long in between sessions to hone my skills. I haven t gotten the hang of aerial hits. Probably never will sad I do highly recommend this game to just have some fun mostly clean game play with friends.,Rocket League®

2017-11-20,0,0,111,False,Recommended,One of my all time favorite games about the gameplay itself it has great fisics and nice controls on keyboard and on most controlers of your choice. The game has a cosmetic sistem where u can earn hats paints ect... and the best part is u can get really cool ones just for playing the game. Personally im not a dedicated ranked player (i rarely play it) but i can say as a casual game is one of the best out there. A very good game design is that all cars are equal u get 0 advantage if you are using any car that the game gives or one that u can buy in the store. Overall if you are looking for a fun and easy to get into game defenetly recoment and for the price tag u get 101% of your moneys worth.,Rocket League®

Drive at the ball work with your team (the latter one seems to take some people longer than others to develop). It will take you hundreds of hours to actually begin mastering techniques required to be really good at the game. That said you will enjoy every match and every minute while building up your skill (assuming you learn to ignore the trolls and the few jerks who think the game revolves around them winning 24/7).

2016-06-24,0,0,74,False,Recommended,Rocket league...Rocket league...Rocket league...Age E 10+/ Everyone over 10This is the perfect game for gamers it's basically football with cars. You can also do basketball and hockey but this game is a must buy it's EPIC! For parents This is a fun joyful game Excellent for playing with others there is CO OP and online Multiplayer. Players have permission to type or talk with their voice. There aren't that many swearing people on rocket league but if your worried you can easily Mute people and you can change it so you can't hear anybody using there own voice. The game is Football with cars it is way different to EA's FIFA though In my opinion I enjoy this game and would recommend it to 7 years old. I say 7 because for people under the game is way to hard! They might find it boring quickly so it is a good present for a 7 year old I would also recommend it for 10 years old because the game is rated E 10+ Everyone over 10.I hope this helped you choose whether to purchase this or not.Sorry for grammar and spelling issues.Bye!,Rocket League®

2016-10-02,0,0,4,False,Recommended,"Bought this game after only seeing it on twitch here and there didn't know what to expect but that it looked fun. It's a BOAT LOAD OF FUN. It's easy to pick up and play but difficult to master your car because of how the mid air rocket boosting physics work. I've never used a controller at my PC but I'll have to pick one up for this game. The game even tells you it's highly beneficial and at first I was thinking ""yeah yeah "" but when you play you'll understand.The graphics are crisp sound effects are rewarding and you get cool cosmetics and different cars almost every match you play so there's always something new. They don't shove microtransactions in your face whatsoever either.I'm only about 3 hours in but already I'm glad I added this game to my collection. I've never really played sports games but this was the best way to do it. If you're looking for something new grab it now.",Rocket League®

You start off barely able to hit the ball and progressively work your way to flying through the air to land a ball. For anyone who wants to become an advanced player there are metagame tactics involved but these don't become necessary until you've mastered all the basics.

This game has the best fun per dollar ratio ever. Updates are free and occur regularly gameplay is fun quick and addictive. Five minute sessions are long enough to feel complete and quick enough to hook you into an all nighter playing over and over. Ths game is my go to when I want to relax or play competitively. Very much worth the purchase for you or a friend. People who care about people tell other people about Rocket League,Rocket League®
2016-03-17,0,0,869,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an example where a simple absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just one more match even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great goofy easy to learn and difficult to master action sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds.,Rocket League®

2016-10-03,0,0,1212,False,Recommended,I recommend it because you will have A LOT of fun in your first 200 hours playtime. And which game offers so many hours of fun for about 20 Euro/Dollar?It's all about the matchmakingIn normal games we always have to play against high tier players which have played like 1200+ hours and can hit the ball from any position perfectly. With an experience of about 500 hours (Legend Rank) it is truly possible to win for me and my mate but we have to play perfect as well. There is a BIG difference in skil between Legend Level 60 and Legend 69. The difference is about another 500 hours of playtime.We just can not believe that it became so rare to face players on the same level of experince as well as playing versus players below that level.I mean it is not such a big deal but should be definitely improved.Pro MatchmakingWe play a lot of ranked games in the All Star region (2vs2). In most cases we have to play good games versus players with the same experience. Contra MatchmakingNow I played Standard (3vs3) without a mate and won all 10 placement matches. I met Rookie players and many Semi Pro's there why? I get ranked into Prospect 3 D2 after winning all 10 placements. This makes no sense to me.In 2vs2 we were promoted to into Challenger 3 after also winning all 10 placement matches.That means I meet many beginners on Prospect in my own team as well as on the other side. And that in turn means I can not get a good winstreak to climb fast. Because I can not carry all the games where I get really bad players on my side.But I see this as a challange too. By time you forget how to play versus people who don't hit the easiest balls.tl dr What I want to say at all is that Psyonix should try to focus the matchmaking for placement matches and Normal games more on playtime or Level than on whatever they use now lol.Thanks for the game Psyonix and keep you great work going. Your Free and paid DLCs are always great!,Rocket League®

2015-08-02,0,0,56,False,Recommended,Pros Fun Fast paced at times Ranked play CustomizationCons Unfair matchmaking Unbalanced matches Lag even in nearby servers Match aborting bans Essential movements tedious to do on keyboard and when you done they disappoint Controller's basically a mustThis game was fun for a while and the tutorials were pretty good. But the specific tutorials such as the All Star Goalie I found were nearly impossible to complete and no tips were given on how to do them other than block goals. I got in a Ranked Doubles match. I'm a Novice and was paired against a Novice and a Semi pro. A second or so into the match my partner leaves leaving me defenseless and giving the opposing players a free win. There was no possible way of me coming back and the fact that someone of higher skill level was on the other team made it even harder. If you don't have a controller you might as well give up your hopes of being All Star rank. Other than that pretty good game.,Rocket League®

2015-09-05,0,0,26,False,Recommended,After 10 hours I'm ready to review. I don't play sports or racing games. From watching gameplay vids it looked like something that would be simple to play hard to master and I was right. My favorite part of this game is how casual it is. You don't spend hours in a lobby choosing levels etc. The matchmaker works fine in about 30 seconds. Also games only last about 6 7 minutes so you don't need a huge time commitment to play.Leavers can be a problem and they definitely need to add some type of penalty for leaving matches early. The other area for improvement is all levels look different but play the same. I'd add some death traps or obstacles that make you jump higher or snare you for a second..to give the game some variety since there really arent any weapons or anything other than just driving and jumping around.I'd recommend this game for players of all ages..go get it now!,Rocket League®
2015-09-05,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Rocket League one of the best if not THE best game on steam at the moment for only 15 you have a game with endless hours of play. Every match is different and unique to the last as you and your firends fly around the arena hitting bicycle kicks into the back of the net. This game is a gem and is perfect in every way from customizability to chaos mode. This game is definitley worth picking up and trying out I would recommend a friend and a controller at all times (Splitscreen Co op is compatible) 10/10,Rocket League®

My constructive critizizm would be for four player or even three player matches double the length of the arena and maybe half size width larger for the width then you have a complete game.

2015-07-18,0,0,1197,False,Recommended,Edit Changed to recommended because they fixed their game crashes and while it still lags a bit sometimes it is a major improvement.Get ready to be angrier at your teammates then the other team. The games come rapid fire and are almost always a lot of fun. The 13yo making sex noises on his mic every 10 games or so is annoying and to my knowledge there is no way to mute individual players but the games come and go so quick and you can easily find another lobby pretty quickly. The unlocks are all cosmetic which is great there is no grind to unlock better cars. If you have a couple other friends that have the game it can be an insane amount of fun. One of those games that ruins the next day because you are having too much fun to put it down and go to bed.The price tag seems a bit high for what it is but you will quickly forget how much you paid for it once you start playing. Original Review Really Really fun and addictive game. When it works.They weren't ready for all their players though if you can get the game to not crash then you are in for an unplayable lag fest. When they have fixed the constant (2 or 3 times a hour) crashes and increase their server capacity then the game is def worth your money.Because people assumed that i had a crappy computer which was the reason why i was crashing/complaining r9 280x i5 4th gen16gig ram,Rocket League®

Other games you really have to dedicate a good portion of your time to play. However in Rocket League you can just play a quick match of five minutes whenever you feel like playing. I convinced some of my friends to try Rocket League and they enjoyed it as well and they were hesitant at first because they said it wasn't their type of game. This game is like bumper cars and soccer in one.,Rocket League®
2015-08-07,0,0,57,False,Recommended,"Rocket League on PC/PS4 is a ton of fun and you really feel great when your playing really good.Rocket League is a rocket powered acrobatic stunt car soccer/Footie game that makes you want to bust out your old hot wheels/Micro Machines cars and play soccer/footie with them. The Ball you play with has a type of billards/geometry physics based kinetic motion to it. You really have to practice your shots in order to be like Paul Newman in The Hustler. It is more exciting than real soccer/Footie!side note It's really funny to see everyone go after the ball and dolphin flip and dolphin dive for the ball. it looks like they're all having a giant dolphin orgy at Sea World. but If I were you just stand back at laugh at them but don't participate in them because you'll look siily.Instead follow these great words In the words of the great hockey player Wayne Gretzky ""A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be."" This quote is a very great tip not only in hockey but also in Rocket League as well as in soccer/footie in general.

2017-07-22,0,0,150,False,Recommended,Tl drThe game is great fun the community is pretty bad I've played over 300 hours of this game and it's gone from my favorite game to my least favorite in 3 years.I have over 200 hours on PS4 and hit champion there so I know what I'm alking about. Rocket League remained my favorite game for the past two years but now that I've switched to PC and the community has settled to a more or less consistent range of players I'm kind of sick of it. In regards to competitive mode...2v2 should be renamed to 50/50 (in reference to your chances of finding a viable partner) 3v3 chat is almost always toxic the most popular tactic in 1v1 is to tilt you once you get behind making you play worse and 3v3(solo) is one of the worst ways to play the game. 2v2 has become pretty much standard amd smurfs make the usual runs considerably often. 7 times of 10 your partner will troll if you don't forfeit at 3 46 with a score of 0/2.The community...Half the time you'll run into people that just want to have fun or climb the rnaked ladder and the other half of the time you'll interact with the most insufferable members of the Rocket League playerbase. Death threats verbal abuse mic spamming in game trolling trade scams text spamming you name it. This is pretty exclusive to competitive however just be prepared. Why the community is the way it is...It is possible to report players in Rocket League for all the actions listed above however this rarely has any real bearing on their ability to play the game or not. To my knowledge there aren't any players that have been banned for repeat abuses of the communication systems trolling to cause their teammates to lose or scamming other players out of cosmetics from any in game report. There isn't a leaver buster type system in place that punishes players from leaving competitve games often. The only penalty I've seen is a 15 minute time out for any of the previously mentioned actions. In short there's no midigation for player behaviour and its all over the ladder. The game is good but most people you play with in competitive will be insufferable.,Rocket League®

2015-08-09,0,0,17,False,Recommended,Insanely fun. There is a lot of talk about the breakneck physics of this game ... it icludes driving up and around on fences but it is self consistent. The controls with an Xbox Once controller are great. The bot training (exhibition matches) is great for practice but it all comes alive when you play online. Six rocket propelled cars vying for a huge exploding soccer ball is just the most amazing chaos.Upgrades don't change the fundamentals of game play so it's all up to driving and flying skill.

They update constantly and you can either play a few matches for 30 mins or binge it for a day straight. Once you get the controls down it's fantastic and highly replayable.

2016-09-24,0,0,9,False,Recommended,Honestly this is a game i would not have pictured myself playing. I'm not one to play many sports games (i favor the more rpg style) and i don't have an obsession with cars but this game is very good. I first played this at my friend's house and it was great. I went home bought it and still really enjoy it. First of all the graphics are super good. The effects and different textures are very detailed and make playing Rocket League appealing to the eyes. I'm not sure how they look on lower settings but if you play on higher quality you can for sure see that effort was put into graphics not just gameplay. Focusing more on gameplay you'll start off pretty bad but as you progress and learn through the game you'll be pleasently surprised at the many tricks you can do once you learn controls. You can play non human characters train play online matches and even customize your car. To sum it up Rocket League is addictive and something you should definitely try.,Rocket League®

2016-01-02,0,0,39,False,Recommended,One of the best Multi player games out there.Pros Lack of hating and trolls easy to leave and match and be replaced Easy to earn cars hats trails and flags Great graphics to suit all pc's and laptops Great gameplay that isn't the same every match A good amount of pitches to learn Rank system Points given for saving clearing the ball shooting and assisting as well as scoring Not pay to winCons Ranks are in no way due to skill just that you have played for awhile Points given in a match don't count for holding the ball in the midfield and what counts as an assist could be improved The AL that join if a player leaves untill another joins are crap and tend to steal goalsOverall the other cons are to small to put its a well rounded game that is fun and has a great player base.Well worth you're time and money (once its NOT pay to win).My game of the year for 201510/10,Rocket League®

I had delayed looking into it for almost a year because I am generally skeptic of highly acclaimed games but when I finally took it and gave it a try I was shockingly impressed. It is ridiculously entertaining and it basically has unlimited replay value. There are things which could be improved of course but all in all I would give it a 9/10. Pros crazy cool concept ridiculously fun easy to jump into good tutorials nice variety of cars high variety of visual customization of cars cross platform split screen option (2 3 or 4 players) great background music.Cons can't change names of other players in split screen unclear car differences (stats) only three solo (offline) season difficulties (easy medium hard) VERY unclear and confusing ranking system some arenas have too many details/flashing lights/colors making it difficult to focus on the ball and opponents.,Rocket League®

The hype it got was wel deserved.Hopefully the final update on this. Because this now contradicts the previous review updates regarding linux I am happy to say that with the exception of my laptop this runs better than ever on linux I've not experienced any CPU bottlenecks and the game very rarely looks like it's about to freeze up.All in all a good game.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,2,False,Recommended,Very addictive and entertaining game. Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!All in all i'd completely recommend this game to anyone whether you're a casual player or very competitive!,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,481,False,Recommended,What can be said about Rocket League that hasn't been said already by tens of thousands of people all over the world? Rocket League is a flashy soccer style game with rocket cars that is fast paced technically challenging and psychologically emotionally and maybe even physically rewarding games out there. The competetive scene is active and involved with few seasons under it's belt at the time of this writing. This game seems to fulfill everything that I personally look for in a video game and it serves it up like hot lunch every time I play it. Rocket League is the best game that I ever took a chance on buying without knowing anything about it. Period.,Rocket League®

2017-11-24,0,0,16,False,Recommended,I find the game fun and to be something along the lines of a power trip you get to play sports like football/soccer and basketball with cars and those cars have rockets attached to them propelling them in the air. That sounds like a macho fantasy I had once after playing flatout 2 and watching the car football/soccer episode of top gear and now it's a game. I was full chub... oh right the review.THE GOOD Controls are good I mean really good to the point of being able to play decently (after a decent amount of practise) with the keyboard and mouse. I played it with a controller though as it feels more natural to steer the various cars. Cars. There are many of them and the only advantage each car offers is how they look for example a can will hit the ball differently than a wedge shaped sports car there's also customisation. Not need for speed carbon levels but you can change the wheels the many vanity items on the roof of your car primary and secondary colours and the wraps for each car so not so bad. Theres voice chat. Simple to learn game yet hard to master game controls.THE BAD This might just be me but whenever I got in a game while running a voice chatting app (skype discord or even curse) it would shoot my ping to wayyy over 200 commonly reaching 500? Basically unplayable levels. The A.I is pretty bad.OVERALLThe game is quite fun with various elements to keep it fresh but if you're playing it do so with a friend because it's much more fun to be able to blame someone you know because they missed the ball and let the other team score a point.,Rocket League®

I suck so bad my win percentage is 48% but it's like a drug every day I keep coming back for the next hit. The game is so fun and half of it's appeal is just the experience of gradually getting better as you're getting stomped by people better then yourself. Tight controls good appeal easy to pick up and play. Good stuff. Also (as of right now) minimal pay to win aspects all the DLC is nothing but aesthetics.

2016-01-14,0,0,81,False,Recommended,This is probably one fo the most unique and fun games I have ever played. I play this game almost every day and have quickly racked up a good amount of hours. To put that into perspective I have almost as much hours here than I do on Fallout 4 which I must admit isnt alot compared to others but still. I love this game and recommend it but it certainly isnt perfect. Pros. Nothing else like it Can be played for fun and goof off or be played seriously and you can actually win with either playstyle depending on how bad your opponents are Not a toxic community in the chat Fun customization of your cars You can clearly tell someones skill in this game and you can not hard carry a game as easily as in other games. You really do need teamwork. Crossplay with PS4. Not alot of games have crossplay.Cons Theres no report system. Theres not alot to report since the the community is not toxic but Ive played a couple ranked games where I've had teammates who drove in circles the entire game and when the ball gets close to our own goal they purposefuly hit in. Ive lost quite a bit of ranked points because of this. Keyboard controls suck. Controler is mandatory.,Rocket League®

2015-12-16,0,0,71,False,Not Recommended,"The game itself is pretty fun and challenging. It was a brilliant idea for a new game. However there are many issues that need to be resolved by Psyonix.1. There is a significant number of people in the community that are toxic as hell. Spamming ""What a save!"" and ""Great shot!"" gets very irritating especially when they are more often used to mock teamates than they are to actually be sincere. The number of people going AFK or quitting mid match is ridiculous. I was suprised to see that there isn't any way to report these players. Not a pleasant experience. In the end the game ends up being more aggravating than it is fun.2. Even with a ping of &lt 60 I have experienced lots of rubberbanding and lag. There seems to be no real reason for that.Both of these issues come from the developer Psyonix. I have played another online multiplayer game developed by them (Nosgoth) and it has the same issues. There is no way to report terrible teamates and server issues are rampant. I tried to start playing Rocket League again recently but quickly was reminded why I stopped playing in the first place. Good game/ bad server issues/ toxic community.I won't be playing again until I hear that they have made some improvements.",Rocket League®

2016-01-16,0,0,1261,False,Recommended,Rocket League looked sort of intriguing to me so I tried it. It's a simple idea it's basically just soccer with cars. Oh but you can also fly and double jump in any direction! Basically it's the coolest game and is currently my favorite to play right now.My favorite things are 1) it has a bots mode (seems like so few games do nowadays)2) the developer's seem really intelligent about doing dlc for example when they made a new map they gave it to all players for free which avoided separating their player base. But they do offer really cool dlc but it doesn't ruin it for those who don't buy it3) it's not just hitting a ball with a car. You can boost. You can boost up in the air and get the ball before everyone else getting a huge advantage! you can double jump and do a flip into the ball in any direction which adds for an immense amount of skill. Basically what I'm saying is that there are a lot of techniques to being good which makes it very fun to play.4) the sky is the limit for how good you can be (well more like the ceiling is the limit)5) it's freaking car soccer!!!!!There isn't really anything I don't like and nothing big I would suggest they fix. Certainly the more they add to the game the cooler it'll be but I am guessing the developers will keep doing just that anyway.,Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,342,False,Recommended,Rocket League is definitley the best Esports/Competitive game in my oppinion. This is because Rocket League is the most similar to real life sports and is more accesible for everyone. The game is easy to learn so anyone can enjoy but very difficult to master. The simiarities to soccer and the crazy unpredictable physics engine make the game almost as fun to watch as it is to play. Watching the RLCS is especially enjoyable as seeing crazy pro players pull off epic tricks is quite entertaining. If you're interested in a competitive sports game Rocket League should be your first choice. Its not a simulator like FIFA and there aren't as many try hards as in other competitive games. Rocket League is an awesome unique sports game that can be easygoing or very competitive. Its a great choice for anybody.,Rocket League®

This should provide a few hours of fun!"" That's where your wrong it's a game with an extrodinarily high skill cap it's easy to play very hard to master. It is constantly updated with things like new crates and maps that get you to come back. But I warn you now this game will introduce you to some very nice people in one match then turn that on its head and the next match you meet the most toxic player you have ever faced satisfying to beat? Yes. But the game with how much I love it has created a community that I sometimes hate to meet new people within it. Granted thats monsly on ranked but they sometimes find their way into free play.All that being said the toxic community can't keep me away from wanting to master all the moves and become the best Rocket League player. But you may be saying ""well this doesn't sound like a game for me! I can't do all those flips and rocket jumps I would never be able to do it!"" Well you person undermining yourself first I say get some confidence in your abilities second I say you will get better just practice and the skill will come and third I say fine then there is a whole other side to this game!

2016-11-27,0,0,79,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those rare titles that embodies everything a video game should be. Do you value gameplay? Rocket League's mechanics are tight enjoyable easy to pick up and difficult to master. You like pretty graphics? Check. You want customization? Deck out your car however you like with a smorgasbord of options. You want an enjoyable offline single player experience? Check out the season mode. Just want to relax and play a pickup game at your place with a few friends? Jump into a split screen exhibition match. Prefer online multiplayer? Then the real question is how many teammates do you want and do you want a casual or competitive experience? Want to watch replays of your best moments? Done. Like having new arenas and modes added to a game over time? They're free. Have just one friend around and want to play online against others? You can. Have friends who own the game on other systems and want to play against them? It is possible. Okay with DLC but feel it should not be a gamechanger? All paid DLC is cosmetic. Dream of playing this game as famous cars like the Delorean from Back to the Future or the Batmobile? That option is here (for a price). Enjoy a catchy soundtrack? You are in for a treat. Want to play hockey or basketball with the same formula? Wish granted. User generated arenas? Curated ones are already here and more are on the way through Steam Workshop integration. Consistent updates? In spades. What more could you reasonably ask for?That is not to say Rocket League has zero flaws. The cosmetic DLC has consistently become less and less of a good value (2 new cars and extras used to be only $3.99 now you only get one car with fewer extras for $1.99 or get a random item for $1.50) and the cross system play is sadly limited only to private matches (no party system) but these are minor quibbles in the face of an incredibly strong base package.So should you buy Rocket League? Well do you like sports? Buy it. Are you (like me) disinterested in sports? Buy it. Do you like having fun? Buy it. In short if you like video games this game is for you.,Rocket League®

2017-07-12,0,0,246,False,Recommended,Easy to pick up very hard to master that's what I can figure out of Rocket League so far in the meager time I've played it for. I will update this review as I play it for longer.Basically it's some Sci Fi Futuristic form of soccer where you play with cars instead of people. It has quite the learning curve and it takes a lot of practice to be even decent. This game is INCREDIBLY unique and barely any other game will transfer its skills to this game. You will very likely start in the lowest rank in the game when you first start (Bronze 1) and will suck at that too. Contrary to CS GO where you probably wont start in Silver 1 unless your aim is garbage you are pretty much guaranteed to start in Bronze 1 in this game. There's a lot of new concepts to learn in this game that no other game can transfer their skills to at least in my experience. It's fun there's a lot of things to learn it's new I love it. People usually aren't too competitive in my experience however there has been 1 that told me to uninstall the game after I missed a goal. You likely won't be able to do ANYTHING until you have 50 100 hours in this game you will just be horrible.Overall it's a satisfying game when you're good and hitting a goal just feels so satisfying a lot more satisfying than say a kill in CS GO. It's fun it's good I recommend it.,Rocket League®

2016-01-07,0,0,97,False,Recommended,I had been eyeing Rocket League for quite some time. Seeing YouTubers play was quite fun. When the Steam Winter Sale 2015 hit I decided I'd give it a whirl for $12.99. Now I can confirm that it is indeed worth it's full retail price! I dove into this game thinking it'd be much easier than it is but was hit with a wall of difficulty. The ball's physics will play tricks on you left and right leaving you wondering how you missed the ball or how the ball went in that direction. I am constantly being frustrated with the ball not doing what I was expecting it to do or not going the direction I hit it in.On top of the frustrating ball physics when playing with teammates it can also be very irritating as they will run into you left and right while you're trying to shoot for the goal. Playing with friends does not refrain from this happening and it's even worse as you have the ability to verbally abuse them over voice chat. You will constantly see yourself going for the perfect goal for someone to hit the ball into the corner of the field for the sake of touching the ball.The controls in Rocket League aren't the best with keyboard and mouse but they aren't the worst. Fiddle with them a bit for them to suit your needs and you'll be golden. I constantly found myself boosting instead of jumping however nor did I find it easy to control my car when going aerial no matter what I did. So I gave up trying with my keyboard and mouse and play mainly with my Xbox 360 controller (Xbox One controller also supported). Splitscreen play and PlayStation to PC crossplay is awesome and leads to the game always having matches. I wish more games were to do this rather than splitting communities of games apart. I love to play splitscreen with my girlfriend while playing with my buddies online and going up against other PS4/PC players online. Sadly the only issue with splitscreen on PC is you MUST have two controllers not a controller and a mouse and keyboard. Luckily my family owns several PlayStation 4's so I could use a DualShock 4 controller with some drivers. Since the game already utilizes the DS4 on PlayStation the buttons even show up as the proper cross circle triangle and square which I found awesome.Despite the many issues I have whilst playing Rocket League I still played 20 hours fairly quickly and never once got bored. Getting epic goals will make you scream and shout and make you feel accomplished every single time and it's an awesome feeling no matter how many you score a game. The rounds are short and sweet coming in at only 5 minutes and you find games instantly whether you play 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4. This is a must own game for any Steam user and I highly recommend it especially if you have a friend or two to play with whether it be online or in the real world sitting on your couch.,Rocket League®

2016-01-11,0,0,668,False,Recommended,Rocket League is well worth your money. It's a refreshing entry in the virtual sports genre and one that doesn't take itself too seriously. The basics of the game (double jumps boosts) are easy to get the hang of. Don't want to embarass yourself online? Start a single player campaign or just revisit the tutorial to hone your skills. Plus you can just jump online play a five minute match and get out. Great for when you have an hour or two to kill. The servers were a bit laggy after launch but this has been largely resolved. When it comes to multinational servers there are always improvements to be made but Rocket League has tidied itself up quite nicely. The online ranking system could have been deeper but it gets the job done. After a while it becomes addicting to see your ranking points increase or decrease after every match urging you to play another quick game to compensate for that one loss or keep the winning streak going.In short Rocket League is a nice little game with a simple and fun formula but also a game that gives you all the tools to develop your own playing style. Not one match you play will ever be the same. Grab a couple friends and start playing right now.,Rocket League®

2015-09-10,0,0,393,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE 2017 After some certain update the game is totally unplayable and lags and rubber banding everywhere and the developer doesnt seem to give a damn about it so will give it a ""No"" for now until they fix itThis is my edited (official) review of Rocket League after playing it 144 hours I believe I will be able to give it a proper review.Gameplay The gameplay is beautiful kinda of tricky for keyboard but you can get the hang of it soon enough if you plan to purchase the game it is recommened to have a controller for easier gameplay.Some of the key bindings for keyboard are wierd (at least to me) and you might need to rebind to be comfortable and be able to play it more smoothly with keyboard and mouse.The gameplay is so much fun especially when you go against or with your friends and work out a plan and so on.Graphics &amp Art Design The art is not realistic nor too cartoony it has this feeling of warm and nice design to it that fits it everything goes together very well.It has very nice sharp colors and lines making it easy for you to see and notice stuff off the batIt has many colors to use and beautiful arena colors as well as nice addons of colors and textures for you to add to your own car and customize it.Music &amp Sound Rocket League has a very uplifting music with lyrics most of the time it is great and I recommend purchasing the soundtrack if you like it.There aren't that many songs in the playlist and it will eventaully get looped but you can always open your own music and listen to it while playing the game.And the game shows how much the developers have spent detail into making the sound effects and such as you have uniqe sounds for everything single thing and it isnt looped from hitting the ball to the trails and many more.Community Rocket League's community is very helpful most of the time. If you have an issue with the game you can post it on the steam discussion and mostly get a fast answer either by the moderators or players on how to fix it.Even in game the community is very nice there aren't much rage quiters (to my knowladge) and most of them are very good sport when losing and so on.Cash Shop The cash shop for rocket league is very simple and reasonable the prices for the DLC's for the game go from $0 $5 and the developers give amazing things in the DLC for the price and all of them are cosmetic and doesnt effect the gameplay at all.Suggestions I would love to see a in game mini map where you can tell where the ball/your team mates are to help keep track of them.Would love to see more maps with different aspects in it as bumps and jumps and so on.It will be great to have a export system or editor system for the replay saves to make some cool videos from it.It will look way better if the colors for online teams acted the same as season mode and had more colors and the goal area changed color depending on the team color.I would like to see some love to keyboard and mouse gameplay to make it easier and such.Is the game worth to buy for the price? Yes and if you do make sure to get the DLC just for being awesome the game is 100% fun and easy to play with friends and family. I myself cant wait to see more updates to the game.DISCLAIMER This is my own opinion on the game and review you might think differently about it.Thank you.",Rocket League®

2016-01-11,0,0,27,False,Recommended,"When I first heard about this game I was surprised. It sounded like either a joke or something that involved RC cars. Not helped by Yogscast being where I first heard about it. They have a habbit of being more comedic in their game play. That was in July 2015. three months later I was given a controler and was introduced to actual play of the game. It felt fine but i was still not entirely interested. Then the review on MMO Grinder happened. It dawned on me what this game is best at. This is game built for pick up play. Do you need much practice to play a game? No. Is the game as fun to watch as ity is to play? Yes comeplete with 4v4 bot match on All Star be the the best case of ""Me get Ball.""",Rocket League®

2017-07-15,0,0,1046,False,Recommended,Can't believe I didn't writee a review earlier completely forgot guess ill do it now while there's not much to say that you haven't heard before ill just add something that I personally dislike about this game and that is the singlee player season mode it's pretty bad scratch that it's REALLY bad the AI even on hardest difficulty play like the worst players in the world they're completely braindead it's quite laughable honestly I mean if it was just meant to be a practice mode sort of thing then sure but the fact that it's not instead it plays out like a proper season how you see in every other sport it's quite mind blowing that it's this bad.It would've been nice if there was a proper season with good AI a ladder that actually means something teams that you could have rivalries with AI drivers that all behaved differently for instance the smaller AI cards prefer to fly while the big ones prefer to take out other drivers whatever it may be I was looking forward to a cool season mode but nope it's garbage.Rest of the game though? Perfection don't really need to go any further than that you all probably know how it is by now amazing game that everyone should own.9/10 highly recommended.,Rocket League®

What I mean is that if you get on a team where everyone crowds the ball like a bunch of 4 year olds playing soccer then your team is going to get blown out...if they play like a team and people drop back when all the other players are forward so the other team can't get easy goals then you will have an even better time playing this game.tl dr buy it but expect a lot of bad team mates,Rocket League®

It's a game that doesn't require an insane PC to run and is easy to understand and to pick up. Also anyone is welcome to play no boundaries nothing. I have a fair amount of hours on this game by now because I used to play it on PS4 before I began playing on PC and when I eventually drifted off into PC Gaming I bought it. Also you can easily use a controller by just plugging it in to your PC but I much prefer the keyboard and mouse. Overall a great game a little pricey but worth what you pay.,Rocket League®

This game is like Tom&amp Jerry made for children but adults can have a lot of fun.Football with cars which is best played with a controller. You ca do amazing stunts thanks to the boosts which help you fly. Very well optimized. It offers anything you can ask from a game where you just want to relax.The only issues I could find are 1. Sometimes you don't get the boost when passing by it 2. Sometimes what you see in the replay of the goals scored doesn't match what you saw during live play.Highly recommended!ATTENTION Extremely addictive!!!!!!!!

As soon as i spent my first dollar i felt my chromosomes draining away as I opened crate after crate rare decal after rare decal. After my first 1 cases I took a selfie and made it my steam profile picture and facebook profile picture to. I thought I was the king of the world after i got this rare decal until I decided to trade it for the first time. This guy added me and I asked if i could have his white wheels and he replied ""MY WHITE ZOMBAS FOR YOUR OCTANE BUZZ KILL ARE YOU !"" I awnsered with a truthful response of ""P(SDUGB SFPEDBPFGP. yes."" He left the game and I cried while eating ice cream. After about 184789 ice cream buckets later I played my first competitive and my team was yelling into the mic so much that I lost all of the chromosomes that remained inside of me. My next game I remembered that my dad used to abuse me as a child and shove his longest popsicles he could find down my throat until I passed out.

2015-12-30,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Beginners review (3hours). Rocket League really manages to deliver moments of fist pumping celebration I haven't seen in many other titles I play. I was never into football (soccer) but had enjoyed that element of Fifa (local MP) on the odd occasion too. Fifa never felt right but the addition of customisable cars with rockets strapped to them actually makes all the difference. Low cost quick rounds and heaps of fun and that's just on matchmaking (looking forward to teaming up with friends too),Rocket League®
2015-12-30,0,0,67,False,Recommended,You get a new customization item after every match no matter how awful you are. I feel satisfied every match.,Rocket League®
2015-12-30,0,0,42,False,Recommended,This game is... amazing. I've logged upwards of eleventy thousand hours so far still suck and still enjoy every game.Pros Super high skill cap while still being fun while you learn. Once you're good the level of strategy and skill is off the charts and you feel like a superhero. Just plain FUN. Very visceral feeling to the game especially when scoring goals. Matchmaking is decent primarily in ranked games. You'll see the occasional smurf at low levels but for the most part everyone sucks as badly as you as you learn making it fun. Lots of cars to pick from with slightly different (though hidden) stats. Lots of visual customizability. Very pretty. Cons Hard as hell. Still super fun but you'll spend your first several hours unable to even hit the ball where you want to. Push through it. So worth it. A few trolls here and there but hey... this is the interwebs. Tips Do the tutorials! Trust me. If you don't you'll spend a ton of hours never even considering what you can do.,Rocket League®

I picked this up for me and some friends and it quickly became one of our most played ganes together because of how easy it is to jump in and out. That said please consider doing your audio chat with buddies on steam and set the options in RL to disallow all chat.

What a bargain. Gameplay is excellent and it's the type of game that will have you coming back for more since the playablity level is so high.

2017-08-22,0,0,1822,False,Recommended,"I've dabbled in this game a bit. It's kinda fun.Update From what I've seen in my years of playing this game is if you spend money on lootboxes its gonna make you very salty. If you use the trade network to get what you want thats another story. My thought? I think the chance for a good roll on a crate is very slim in my experience. I think it's programmed that way. If its not then devs if you see this prove me wrong. Like I said I've been playing since year one. 70 plus crates in my inventory. Good game though if you never spend money other than the entry fee. But to the game though If you are a noob prepare for a little hate on your skills but survive through it gets better. Controls are tight. Graphics are basic but efficient. Music soundtrack is crazy good. Bottom line is buy it. Best ""holy I only have 7 minutes to game before work"" that you'll ever have.",Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,264,False,Recommended,Absolutly Love this game! It reminds me of FIFA and Need For Speed combined into one game with my love for cars when I was in my mid teens and soccer which I still love to play. The controls are smooth and really feel like I can control the rocket car to my desire with the volleys and trick shots even flying through the air is all creative and the sky is the limit for how games can turn out. The graphics are amazing along with the car customization even though there are only team orange and blue you can customize your car to your desire for either color with yellow to red range. My only concern with this game is the lag online but that is probably due to my own connection... but overall the online feature is awesome as well and playing with friends in chat is even better would defenitly recomend this game as one of the best multiplayers this year next to mario kart8! Its a game anyone can pick up and just have fun or truely hone your skills to be a professional and dominate ranked mode just like real life soccer player ),Rocket League®

2016-07-22,0,0,192,False,Recommended,OVERALL 9.5/10Psyonix has really done something amazing here creating a unique title that looks and plays great with nearly unlimited replay ability. I can say with the utmost confidence that the number one game that is preventing me from really working toward my goals with this website is the fact that I can not stop playing Rocket League. I can easily admit that I am absolutely obsessed with this game and it comes to my surprise while writing this that I would easily rank it in my top ten favorite games of all time brushing shoulders with the likes of Final Fantasy 7 and The Last of Us. While the idea of the game might come across as a bid odd to some people it is something that once you experience it you will see how great it is. And with such insignificant issues to complain amount the developers commitment to bringing massive levels of content very consistently shows a real love for the baby they have created.

2016-11-24,0,0,58,False,Recommended,"I'll be honest I wasn't expecting this game to live up to the hype. Of course I never buy into hype so I can't be disappointed if a game sucks (*cough* No Man's Sky *cough*) but I'm still pleasantly surprised whenever a game manages to be good and live up to what everyone is saying about it.I like to describe the gameplay of Rocket League to my friends who haven't heard of it like this ""Start with soccer put the field in a cage make the balls bigger and floatier and replace the people with 3v3 teams of RC cars that can jump around and fly through the air."" If that description doesn't get them curious I can tell that they probably wouldn't be interested in trying it out. If that description piqued your curiousity you owe it to yourself to at least try this one out.There's not really much I can say about the gameplay other than the fact that advanced moves like hitting the ball in mid air are extremely difficult to pull off but extremely satisfying the first time you do. I'm still a novice but I'm at least good enough that I occasionally yell at the ""Pro"" level bots for doing something really stupid. That's not because their programming is horrible but because they're just dumb enough that I find myself thinking I'm smarter than them. There's an offline singleplayer ""season"" mode along with split screen and online multiplayer but no matter how you play the game itself is going to be pretty similar across all modes unless you vary the player's skill level.(Side note If I ever get enough people to buy into the idea I want to hold a version of the singleplayer season entirely with human teams.)Where this game really shines is in those game changing moments. They don't happen every game but when they do happen they stick in your head for the next few matches and make you feel very confident if you're the one who did it. If you can follow the action of an average game I reccommend watching some plays from the Rocket League Championship Series or RLCS. There are so many game changing moments in those matches it's frankly amazing. You might also learn a trick or two you can adapt into your playstyle.I have only two complaints about this game First some of the achievements depend on you owning DLC cars but achievements tied to DLC seems standard enough that I can't really call Rocket League in particular out for it. Second you can't sell the crates and keys on the Steam Marketplace. I understand not selling the keys but some of us don't have the money for microtransactions so if we get a crate it'll just sit there unused. I say we should be able to at least sell the crates on the Marketplace but neither of these complaints are enough to not reccommend the game.If you enjoy fast paced action support indie developers want to master a game's more difficult tactics to get an edge or just need a party game for you and your buddies to play (split screen or online) this game is definetly worth your time.",Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,577,False,Recommended,EDIT Late 2017 still my favourite game! It becomes better and better...This game took me so much of my free time but brought me so much fun in exchange. I played tons of hours alone but also with randoms and friends. I admit I'm a huge fanboy but that's because this game brings all that I want from a sports like game. It has online multiplayer with competitive and fun modes single player agains KI to practise some stuff and of course tons of content to unlock.The cars all have different hitboxes but none of them is overpowered so the balance is very great. BUT the cars all have their own charme and possibilities. Long vehicles for example are super great for freestyle flights on the other side thick vehicles like the bang bus are great for pressing and playing as a goalie.Online competitive is fun and well managed but sometimes the rank system can be a bit demotivating. It just feels like win 1 match &gt nothing lose 1 match &gt demotion at least most of the time. But if you own the skill you will also have your positive moments. Soundtrack is also nice. The community is mostly fair and funny but there are more and more hater/flamer kiddies playing Rocket League (feel free to ignore/report/ban them ) ).My last words go to the devs You guys created such a great successor of SARPBC and it landed on all three big gaming platforms. Also I think that you pushed the game industry into the right direction when it comes cross network play. In addition the monthly updates bring a lot of content. Very often I thought RL is so full of features it can't get any greater. But then you smash out things like the Rumble mode or the upcoming training mode or Steam Workshop support. The DLCs became a little more expensive over time but you know what? If you keep on maintaining RL like that I enjoy paying you for that and that IS indeed a rare occasion! Love you Psyonix &lt 3,Rocket League®

The game's pretty much perfect as is. If I were to ask for anything from the developers it would be more! More maps more modes more car customization options all of it.

You don't have to commit to an hour long gameplay session but you will often find yourself spending that much time and more in a single sitting.There is somewhat of a steep learning curve but as you advance through the ranks you'll always find new moves to learn new tactics to employ and become all around better at controlling your little rocket car.Extremely frustrating and at times enormously satisfing at others.

I played during the free weekend and I would recommend the game twice if I could it is INSANELY fun with friends once you all master the controls (2 3 days)!There are PLENTY of game modes so you will need some time to get bored (I've spent 3 days playing only soccar).The voice chat (F) makes it 10x more ridiculous (along with chat trolls of course).Graphics wise it looks amazing on high.There are A LOT of customisation options in game some of which ARE paid but there is PLENTY of microtransaction free content.The servers were a tiny tad unstable but I'm assuming that was because I played during the free weekend PIt sems to be able to run on the most rusty of tin cans like my PC on low settings even I never go above 70% usage on my gpu with these settings.Price wise it's a bit expensive for a game like this but this is steam...GET IT ON SALEOverall it feels more than polished! )SO Insanely fun gameplay + decently low price + friends + LOADS of customisation options + soft on your rig GET IT NOW CUZ THE DURN DEAL GONNA END10 / 10,Rocket League®

2017-02-15,0,0,355,False,Recommended,Psyonix's magnum opus Rocket League is one of the most fun games I've had the joy to play. The master of fast paced addictive gameplay the 5 minute matches keep you playing into the early hours of the morning and never failing to keep the action above 60mph! The vertical flexability that the openness of a Rocket League pitch offers is incredible boasting a Cirque de liberté for you to perform all sorts of zany twists and turns in mid air it's remarkable to see glorious goals and superb saves made by some of the insanely talented players. One can better their Rocket League play naturally by simply enjoying the game however the more difficult tricks like airials freestyles dribbling and perfect positioning take some serious skill and precision and are a sight to see in competitive play. The game's perfectly playable with either a controller or mouse 'n' keyboard so it's up to you to decide how you play. The customisation is great fine tuning your Rocket Powered Battle Car is fantastic and the options are near endless offering plenty of choice. However there is microtransactions. But these are implemented in one of the best ways I've seen in any game they're not intrusive or necessary for victory AT ALL they're simply cosmetic. The free Rumble gamemode is serious fun and it's nice to see the devs frequently adding new features and stadiums to one of the most fun games of 2015. I don't care too much for either cars or football but I adore Rocket League. Totally worth its full price and it's a steal on sale highly recommended.,Rocket League®

2016-06-28,0,0,901,False,Not Recommended,Really like the game.But this game is like about to die in SEA so few player that you meet same players for 3 competitive match in a row also if you wait for matchmake a little bit long they will matchmake you with any rank even with newbies. If your opponent is a party don't expect much to win (This happen if you reach Expert or higher or about 300hours+) because you will teamed up with random player with random rank from the lowest to highest but mostly lower rank (atleast in SEA). It will be fun for the first 200 hours tho. Solo competitive are also dead it probably took 5 mins till never to matchmake.I will recommend this if you have party to play with. If you are solo player don't expect much when you reach higher rank or MMR.(Don't tell me to git gud because i mostly carry hard my teammate with 500+ score while my team had 0 100 score ) ),Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,121,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is undoubtedly my #1 hidden gem of 2015.First off let's talk gameplay. It's fun. Really fun. The incredibly simple physics based gameplay makes the game approachable to everyone since holding down the boost button and going straight for the ball is certainly an acceptable early game strategy. But as you progress in the game you begin to develop tactics and timing and you're more capable of controlling your car and making it do what you want. Basically what I'm saying is that this game is fun and the gradual progression of you as a player makes the game pretty damn addicting as well. I don't know how many times I've said to myself ""I'll just play one more game"" only to find myself still sitting in front of my monitor an hour or two later.Besides the tight gameplay and controls this game has a hell of a community. I've made more friends playing this game for a week than I've made in the past 3 years on steam with 100+ games. The only relatable experience for me is back in the golden days of Halo 3 where randoms would invite you to custom matches and you'd spend hours goofing off with people you barely knew. It truly represents the best part of gaming just being able to have fun with friends and strangers alike.If you think you have any interest in this game at all I'd recommend dropping the $20 and getting Rocket League. Truly a unique gaming experience that I haven't had in quite a long time.",Rocket League®

If it isn't something the what is?One of the best games I've ever played with. This game needs skills and reflexes. And a good team. If you play it with friends then it can entertain you for hours. Per day. Because you will never get rid of that game anymore you will want to play it every single day because it gives you adrenaline doesn't disappoint you even if you loose and you will always find some spare time to play with it. Matchmaking is lightning fast I found the rounds a bit short (5 minutes) but it just matter of taste I guess there was a good reason behind it. PS4 crossplay is an awesome thing it's a really rare thing in the game industry nowadays and I just simply don't get it why. It could be a bit better though you can't create a party with your PS4 friend due to the fact PlayStation has no Steam and PC can't join to PlayStation Network. But private matches works fine which is nice. DLCs are only cosmetic doesn't kill the balance I bought all of them because I got the game itself for free as a gift from my friend and the 20 I planned to spend on it was already on my Steam Account ( P). Music DLC doesn't worth to buy. I didn't like the default keybinds if you already played any racing games you will find it confusing as well I guarantee it. But you can get used to the default one as well I just rebinded them 'cause I'm an NFS idiot don't mind me. If you see this thing on discount don't miss it buy it immediately. But if you decide to buy it for 20 it still worths it.,Rocket League®

2015-12-22,0,0,175,False,Recommended,As you can see I've put 50 hours into Rocket League so far. When I say 'so far' I really mean that because this game can be a lot of fun. For the most part I play with a friend of mine IRL he will come to my house and we are able to play the game splitscreen and online. I'm very happy with this feature. It's hard to find games for me to play with a friend on my PC and when we do it's usually an indy game without a lot of content or a game that's been badly ported. Having something to play online means many hours of play as opposed to however many it takes to finish the campaign of most other games.As for the game itself think of it this way what makes both racing and soccer more fun? Rockets.And maybe a hockey puck.,Rocket League®
2015-12-22,0,0,63,False,Recommended,Pretty simple formula here you and your teammates hit a ball across the field with RC cars and try to score more points than your opponents.You can fill up your meter and boost your car to very high speeds to hit the ball further and blow up other cars by crashing into them.That's the whole game.But ROCKET LEAGUE's simplicity is its genius. With tight controls colourful graphics awesome sense of speed &amp impact and solid car customization this arcade sports game is incredibly easy to get into and will have you feeling very pumped.Highly recommend this for you and your friends,Rocket League®

Car winds up being reversed Backwards glitching out and hard to straighten out. when changing controls to move left or right with mouse. car seems to want to pull in the opposite direction.Im gonna have to keep playing with MISC &amp controls for a while and hope to finally get this going the way I want to.its a really fun game just controls will frustrate some people.This is why I believe this game was created with the intensions to be played with console game controller and not with Keyboard and mouse even though its a PC game. ya im a bit confused by that too.A game that will take time to get used to. )very fun game though.,Rocket League®

I have only experienced 2 issues with this game so far The server disconnecting every single player in the competitive lobby all at once and giving each of us a cooldown for 'leaving the game' despite us having no choice because we were kicked out. People take this game far too seriously some times and it's sometimes fun to watch sometimes sad. xDOther than the 2 previous points the game is great fun. Good customisation for vehicles and a good variety of maps and modes. If you're looking to have fun and play competitive without really having to worry too much about strategy then this is a great game.,Rocket League®

Spamalot of ""What A Save!"" very common. Quitters. Not a lot of defensive players. Move from goal and be chided as ""useless"" and be forever asked ""how did you not save that?"". Occasional crushing one player defeats. THE PLAYER WHO WANTS TO HIT EVERY BALL. Breathe deeply. Let them. There's little to do but to try to pick up the pieces.Addiction. Frustration. Elation. Joy. Bewilderment. Terror. Awe.It takes all sorts to play this game and they all do.I recommend that you turn off the chat box altogether. It's pointless unless you have friends with you. It helps to have a plan of attack but occasionally you'll completely surprise the trolls with a glorious win and all the defeats before are worth the wait for that moment.It's a great game. Very well optimised plays on my old Toshiba laptop just as well as my PC with the obvious exception of the graphical quality.

I would like to see more maps added to the game. What is already there is very good that's why I would like more. Also I'd like more cars to choose. Single Player content. The season mode is good but I would want to get more invested on my teams. I mean I'd like to keep track of how many seasons each team won including my own for example. Something like a trophy room would be awesome. LOL. Also it'd be nice that the bots tended to be more defensive or to be attackers. Also more variety for the teammates.So yeah this game is awesome even though I don't like football (or Soccer) that much. I'll be wasting more hours of my life on it that's for sure.EDIT There more cars now. More maps too. Now you don't have an excuse. BUY IT.,Rocket League®

At first I didnt check to see what rank he was considering it was a ranked match and guess what... A ing Veteran I am barley Semi Pro.... going against... a Veteran.

The party system. You can have a party but you can only play ranked with 1 other person for 2v2's. The only other ranked gametypes are for solo play and they are 1v1 2v2 3v3I believe they should allow parties to play anything from 2v2 4v4 RANKED.Exhibition can get pretty darn easy so allowing the ranked increase will make this game 10x betteri have dual graphics however i havnt had any issues with that.there is very minor server issues but i really don't think it's the servers i think it's the people Queing up. I've always been low ping in this game however i see and vs people at like 160 ping constantly and that creates skippy game play.,Rocket League®

2017-01-09,0,0,1,False,Recommended,"This is a game of football where the players are all cars. The game is very fast there's a lot of skill involved but the controls are simple and it's easy to play more Mario Kart than a ""proper"" car sim.There are a few different cars in the game with others available as unlocks and DLC. I found the single player game a bit repetitive. There's not a proper campaign which doesn't help. The graphics and sound are good.It's funny watching a car race the length of the pitch in order to put the ball in from the goal line only to miss and go crashing into the back of the net. This happens very frequently.I think I would probably enjoy this multiplayer but none of my friends own it. This is possibly because I'm a sad sack no mates.",Rocket League®

2017-11-07,0,0,1240,False,Recommended,At the time I'm writing this I am 728 hours into the game for the record...Rocket League is the kind of game I never thought I would like. Playing soccer with a car is wierd period. However this is neither a standard soccer game nor is it a car game. At its core the gameplay of Rocket League is a team based arena. 3 players (or less) battle 3 other. They each have a battle car that they control to try and drive a ball in the opposite team's goal. It doesn't get any simpler than this. The game revolves only around 2 skills one must aquire Mechanics and Strategy (game sense).That makes the game fun straight away. nothing to buy nothing to grind no waiting. Being skill focused the game has a huge learning curve and a training program inside the game is available to help you improve your mechanics that is how you control the car to move the ball the way you want and game sense. You are matched against player of your level and get better as you play.Being a team game you have to cooperate with others. So yes you'll never know who you'll end up with. if you want to be able to comunicate create your own or join a comunity of players you will play with. If you are easily tilted disable the chat. Relax and focus.There is nothing more rewarding than being MVP of the game. The better you play the better you'll want to play. Fast paced quick matches are ideal if you don't want to play for extended periods of time.A great Esport game with growing tournament scene.It is truely the first game I am so eager to improve at. I'm not a very fast learner and I play video games mostly for fun. I'm 30 and I have a full time job so I'll never be pro. I picked up the game a year ago. I immediately decided to get better at it. My goal is to be ranked champion. Currently I'm ranked diamond not yet a rocketeer. There is still a bit of road ahead of me but I truely enjoy every hour. pick it up it is a great pvp game.,Rocket League®

2015-12-25,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Holy crap is this a fun game. I'm usually not on board with sports games but this is just...it's whimiscal. It's Soccer at the core. But then it's also got an interesting twist on it because you're cars with rocket boosters on them. So it doesn't just feel like a sports game it feels like something else too. It's like a Mario Kart game compared to a NASCAR game. It's a twist on a sport that makes it fun and whimsical.I've only played a little bit but I can just sense that this is going to be an absolute time sink for me. And I'm perfectly okay with this.Only issue I've come up with so far is that playing against a player who is more skilled than you can just absolutely blow your self esteem. The Hockey game mode kept giving me guys who were much higher ranked than me and losing a game 5 1 or 12 1 feels bad man. I don't think it's supposed to do that I think it's supposed to find people close to you in skill to play against but a couple of times some real pro dudes slipped through and just destroyed everything I love.Still damn fun game. Definitely worth checking out.,Rocket League®

I don't know about future plans but I love that in a gameCONS It's a team game so quitters are a thingLag when it was noticable (not often) was very much so because of the fast pace of the gameAs of writing no way to play in a party or communicate with my PS4 friendsI feel like I first have to mention that I am not a fan of racing games soccer or sports in general. Despite that I was hooked on this game in the first round. The simplicity means that you and up to 3 of your friends can pick it up any time and you wont have to explain any rules. This makes it a great local game to play to have a high energy intensely fun time. Competing against or cooperating with your friends are both equally enjoyable even as the losing team.Although the controls and rules are dirt simple the game has complexity and is deeply skill based. Moments that inspire ""Hell yeah!""s and ""Daaaayyyuuum""s are plenty and the replay feature that comes after every goal nearly always has something worth watching to show. Once I bought the game on my PC and played solo online I found difficulty surpressing loud shouts of glee and longed for an audience to see the many spectacular occassions that dot the experience of playing. Doing well feels so damn good and mistakes seem to slip away as the pace and intensity of the game consumes you.Teamwork seems to come naturally and with the exception of a bit too many rage quitters the online community was polite and surprisingly forgiving.It just feels good all around.

2015-10-05,0,0,1612,False,Recommended,One of my favorite games of the year if not ever. Since day one I have been addicted to RL and can't stop playing. Im glad I stuck through all the issues of launch this game is amazing now 10/10Update After playing for over 1 000 hours this is still the best game ive everyplayed. the replayability is top tier and the developers at Psyonix are some of the best ive seen when it comes to pushing out new content constantly and listening to its fan base in regards to what we want to see. They are also quick to fix and own up to mistakes.,Rocket League®

2017-11-13,0,0,1055,False,Recommended,great game with fun competitve edge. All I need now is useful team mates p or get better...,Rocket League®
2017-11-13,0,0,226,False,Recommended,The game is fun. Is it worth the $20 to get the game? hmm yes. If I were to describe this game it would be the game you play when you are inbetween games and nothing really seems interesting and you need to waste like an hour. That being said it is really fun to play sometimes Frustrating but fun. People you play with are normally nice although the ingame chat is completely broken. It takes around 50 hours to really start to get a good understanding of the game and especially aerial hits/goals. Not something (Atleast for me or my friends) that we hope on and could play for 8 hours but is very competitve.7.5/10,Rocket League®
