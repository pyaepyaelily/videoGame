2018-10-27,0,0,262,False,Recommended,I love the game in so many ways! Guns are so realistic and the physics are so lovely! The team work and i can go about a lot good stuffs that are in the game BUT the desync thing and the cheaters makes the game impossible to play i tough that i was the bad player but after replay all my deaths in the death cam you can see that many times the server get my kill 0.5 sec to 1 sec before I even realized that was alredy killed by the other player and the 70% of my deaths was for that reason! And the game itself is difficult and died for silly things is so paintfiul and is pointless to play it. So Bluehole you need to fix de desync issue with your servers. You have a true fan and player here that doesnt want to play fornite with all the kid graphics and the arcade COD 4 that love the game but stopped to play it because 70% of time he dies for silly things.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-29,0,0,308,True,Recommended,"This is going to sound like a negative review it's actually an incredibly fun (albeit frustrating) game and I've had some of the best video game moments with PUBG. I would recommend it purely based on fun factor That said there's a *lot* wrong with this game most of which can be fixed (and hopefully will).Performance has improved a lot over the last few patches but it's still horrendous. It's especially bad when a lot of things are going on (at the beginning of the game when items/things are still spawning for example.) Server wide lockups (where everyone is frozen in place for several seconds) have become very common. Framerate drops are insane I can go from 100 fps down to 30 for no reason. Again greatly improved over a few months ago but still very noticeable.Optimization is... really bad. I have a Ryzen 1700 and 1080TI frame rates are anywhere between 30 and 100 on medium low settings. Two things that are interesting 1) friends that own the game with lower end computers get around the same performance that I do and b) my CPU(any/all cores)/GPU utilization runs around 40 50% even during framerate drops. The game itself will not use the computing power available to it. This is expecially odd since this game looks horrendous even on maximum settings. This is an Unreal Engine game and it looks like it was made in 2008. I don't care about graphics much but I have certain expectations for a performance/eye candy ratio. I mean Crysis looks better than this game and it's smooth as butter. Again this to me is a sign of server issues. Whether the code is just bad or the servers are underpowered I couldn't tell you.This is technically an early access game so this isn't bad just... interesting while core things are poorly implemented (controls are the worst I've ever seen no vaulting yet shooting out of windows is frustrating af the comically broken driving system etc.) other things are very well polished (the delay between seeing something in the distance and hearing it independent suspension on buggy's etc.) It reminds me of when a software team hires an intern and just says ""make something cool"" so they work on their own little project outside of the core planned development cycle. It's not ""bad"" that these nice pieces exist just odd that they worked on them now instead of the core game.There is absolutely no way they can release this game on time. They've already extended the official release date to the end of the year but that isn't NEARLY enough time to complete this game. I am fine with that I bought the game Early Access and am fully aware of the 1+ years of development this game will take. But it's deceptive to have put a 6 month timeline out to begin with. The game's features aren't even completed (extra maps being a big one) that's not to mention the plethora of controller fixes driving fixes items custom modes environments (fog etc.) modding support and the two biggest doozies of all performance and bugs (looooooots of bugs I find a new one almost every game). I bought the game as is and will happily wait for however long it takes to complete but don't lie about your timeline. Cheating in this game isn't that common in the grand scheme of video games. Some reports show fewer cheaters than most other games. The problem is in a game of 100 people it only takes one cheater to completely ruin the game. Even if only 1 in 500 people playing PUBG are cheating that means that on average 1 in 5 games will end with you getting headshotted through the bushes from 2km away. It's also really hard to see when someone is cheating since poor performance looks a lot like cheating most of the time and there's no kill cam for obvious multiplayer reasons. But I have run into a few instances where there is absolutely no denying someone was cheating (if 3/4 of the map is dead after the first circle shrink someone's probably cheating). It really sucks and discourages play.While this doesn't affect me or my wallet I think introducing micro transations in an early access game is immoral. Maybe if the team was struggling to make ends meet before the release I would understand it but this game has made millions in just early access. It's one of the most popular games on PC right now the development time should be spent fixing performance issues not milking players for more money. Add to that Greene said he would not add microtransactions in early access it's just a bad move. Add to some of the other things Greene has said in done (especially in regards to banning/punishing players for strange things) I just find him to be erratic.The community is horrible. Like worse than Rust horrible. You can't play with all chat on or you'll just hear people screaming into their mics sometimes racial slurs sometimes just unintelligable ape noises. Teaming up with randoms is a 50/50 chance you're going to get a stoner or a team killer. This is not a game you play with other people unless you know them. This isn't too big of a deal since it isn't an especially social game (if you're playing with friends) but still... get ahold of yourselves people. This isn't /b/.Lastly something I've alluded to a few times but deserves a special mention the controls. I can overlook the performance bugs microtransactions etc. but I just cannot overlook the controls. I haven't a clue who picked the default keyboard layout for this game but that person needs some medication. But even if you re map it everything is like moving through mud. The mouse delay is horrible (most likely do to framerate issues and not being able to lock your framerate) the shooting is improved but still very unresponsive jumping onto anything is a suicide inducing and just walking feels bad in an indescribable clunky way.So the tl dr is If you want to play something quickly and casually this is not the game for you. It's 98% tedius item collection/running/driving/hiding 1% dying under unforeseen and questionable circumstances and 1% heart pounding terror. But I remember my first chicken dinner and it was the first time a game made me feel like I was going to die from heart failure. For that alone I think it's worth the money.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-19,0,0,337,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I definately got my moneys worth out of this title but then again I spent probably 10'000 hours playing league of legends and never had to pay a cent.I feel like the Developers professional ambitions have got in the way of what really matters here. It's not the best looking game out there but certainly performs as if it should be. For me having a 7700K and 1080SLI setup and still having to play with most settings on very low to maintain over 100fps is dissapointing And I have not really noticed any remarkable performance improvements since it was first released to steam.The detail in the games environment gives the illusion of value but upon closer inspection is actually just the same recycled assets scattered about the place with some minor variations and in some cases no variation whatsoever.The hit registry and netcode would have to be my biggest gripe close quarter combat feels like a dice roll at the best of times and mele combat feels completely redundant especially in the opening minutes of the round.Long range open terrain combat is fun as is traversing the map with friends the game does a great job of capturing a realistic feeling of helplessness and tention.I can definately recommend this game as a good alternative multiplayer fix to the standard format of shooters that are out there currently. But not for more than $25 $30 unless you plan to commit to it which is hard to do when its so demanding and unpolished. Great fun for the first hubdred hours as you learn the game but once the novelty wears off frustrations arise as frequently as excitement.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is just my personal Post *I said yes to recommend but you'll understand at the end*Like the title states this is the worst time I have ever spent TRYING to even play a game. Yes I understand that this game is still in development and will crash or not respond But so frequently?? Why?? No but seriously this game just will not let me play. The furthest I have ever gotten into a match was jumping out of the plane and then the game crashed which is saying a lot. Every other time the game will crash in the menu or right when I find a lobby. So in all honesty I do not recommend this game as of now. Still though the developer is working very hard on this game and they deserve all the support that they can get. It may not work for me but it might work for you. Still try it out and support the development! If you don't like it or you have the same problems then just wait a while for the devlopment of the game to get a bit better.Anyway enjoy the game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-04,0,0,692,False,Not Recommended,The game's concept is great however many issues are not getting fixed. Instead of adopting new things into the game the developers should focus on fixing current issues such as latency issues are still a thing too few servers(enemies bugging around/being much quicker or items not spawning for me but for them)(ADD MORE SERVERS) the camera often is often buggy and moves into random directions(recently with pressing the F key the camera just pops straight forward is this supposed to be of any use?) texture issues(random bumps on the surfaces that make vehicles fall over whilst not being visible) cheaters still have an easy way through(aim bot no recoil etc)These would be the main issues that would really matter since they ruin the game experience not to mention dying due to these problems and not actually the lack of my skills.Less new added stuff more fixing the problems that remained since the beginning.

2018-12-02,0,0,511,False,Recommended,While i would agree with many that the game has only gotten worse since the release of 1.0 the game doesn't deserve as much hate as it gets now. The game was alot simplier and overall just more fun with far less issues in beta which is where most of my hours come from. I would prefer to go back to beta so that there isn't the feeling of a company so desperate to squeeze every bit of money out of this game as they could. (They promised never to add microtransactions which they did. They also added items which are only unlocked for a set amount of time before being revoked.) I play in the EU and almost never encounter any cheaters but i can't speak for asian or NA players who apparently regularly encounter chinese hackers. However as i stated at the beginning the game does not deserve as much hate as it currently gets. The optimization is far better than it ever has been (i have a mid spec pc and can run this on high/ultra at 100fps+) They have improved the UI and added alot of QOL features which can be toggled on/off. They massively fixed the dsync that everyone constantly complained about (for the most part you still get the odd instance but it is rare now.) I also more or less never experience any game crashes now either which used to/still is problem for some although saying that it isn't anywhere near as bad as it used to be. The overall feeling of the game is that it's good feels fun to play is quite smooth and entertaining especially with a group of friends. But there is always the underlying feeling of a company that just doesn't care about the community as they ignore/put off fixing the main issues of the game as they would rather add new weapon/player cosmetics. And as i stated some of these expire once aquired. You can't help but feel dissapointed in PUBG especially as someone who put so much time into the beta. I played it when it was incredibly unoptimized experienced frequent crashes put up with countless numbers of bugs. Each new update greatly improved the game and pubg's number rised. I thought it was going to be one of the most popular games on steam for quite a long time. Until the release of 1.0 and ever since then i just continued to lose faith in bluehole. I would reccommend trying it out again if you played it before but decided to take a break. However as for purchasing i'm not entirely sure. I think you should make your own mind up.TL DR It's still a fun game especially with a group of friends not as bad as almost everyone claims and is far more polished than it was in beta. But as with everything still has it's problems.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes and no.I will just cut to the chase.PROS.1.Really fun.Yes that is the most important.Cause after all it is a GAME.2.The physics are really good.There are some cons with it but will go through the cons later.3.You find a game extremely fast.4.The game brings satisfaction when you win.(DUH)5.I get the feeling of an old game called SWAT (if someone remembers that you will understand).I say this cause you will actually have to put your mind into how you will go into a house with multiple enemies.The game is not just mindless shooting.If you do not have a strategic mind you will lose.A LOT.6.ADDICTING AS .7.You don't feel punished by dying.Simply queue for another one.CONS.1.The graphics are a bit underwhelming. For a game that is priced 30 bucks it does not look that good.We have 2017.I have a good system but i still feel like the graphics go really hard on it with mediocre result.Just no.2.The foliage setting is just stupid.You can have lower res foliage but they should stay there.It can add more into the hiding factor.3.Opening/closing doors sometimes can be irritating.Those who play will understand.4.I feel like my character is a bit slow on his actions sometimes.5.One map.6.Players camping at the outskirts of the blue cyrcle.I don't know if this can be fixed by forcing players to actually move.7.Make the blue cyrcle and the red one more punishing for staying outside/inside them.When i see that i am standing in the red zone i am like yeah. I have a lot of time to loot heal reload check for enemies then gtfo.Make the whole area EXPLODE. Then i would have a motive to actually leave EVERYTHING that i am doing atm and get my outta there.Overall conclusion.Really fun game.Is it worth 30 bucks? Hell no. You can buy games way cheaper and WAY better.But it has the potential to be one of the best games ever made.Even though the game has a lot of negatives they dont surpass the positive ones cause it is soooo fun to play.I do not have many hours in it but i feel like i am already hooked on it.I know the devs are working on a continuous basis on the game it still needs a lot more to be great.Cause it can be one of the best or even the best online game.Make it feel smoother when i play. No i do not want to play a doom style game.But i dont want a slow charactter that while he reloads and he opens the door the reload gets completely canceled even though i have loaded 2 rounds in my shotgun.Those simple things.The game is really really addicting so be carefull boys.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-07,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,"I've been playing this game for a while I remember when it was the biggest game on steam but i'm sad to say the players have lost too much hope you can look on the ""fix PUBG"" forms and see that everyone says that they had their chance and also trying to give them other things to do. This game has had a luxury life they've had more money and fame than MANY other games out there. And still they can't fix basic issues fortnite on the other hand is run by a very hard working company and I know some people don't like the gameplay of fortnite. But the devs did everything right that PUBG did wrong. Weapons are reworked daily. desync and hit regestration is nearly perfect and fixed content ( Is not super op (QBZ) and is also usable). I still suffer from alpha bugs today the plane ""jumps"" halfway across the island then zips back making jumping at the right time much harder than it should be. I can't pickup weapons for almost 10 seconds because of desync. I lag forward and backwards making gun fights impossible to fight. I also see many negetive reviews that make VERY good points are found helpful by 100+ people. All in all it's cute to see PUBG on their knees begging for us to come back because while they were rich they were busy trying to get richer (trying to sue fortnite constant release of crates and payed skins) all they had to do was listen and fix bugs that should not have made it past beta. All I know is that anything else this company releases will have a VERY hard time becoming popular and trust worthy.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I love the ability to customize with my opticals and grips etc. It's a lot slower than H1 so if that's not your thing I don't think you'll like this game.

I have had more fun and challenging addictive gameplay with this title than any in quite some time.That being said let's dive into the ""controversial"" topic of the ""micro transaction"" and ""cash cow"" business people are freaking the f**k out about for some reason.Micro transactions that are purely cosmetic and related to a charity and tournament to promote the game and increase its popularity and legitimacy as an E Sports title are completely irrelevent. I understand that people are upset because the developers ""went back on a promise"" but seriously suck it the f**k up. The gameplay and content involved outweighs the hurt feelings of supposedly being lied to.The truth is that the boxes that were free are still free and the boxes that cost money to open are charity/tournament boxes and just have exclusive ""event"" type cosmetic skins.

Having only 3 games and one large map sounds like there is not much content but the map itself is huge and each game theres somthing different. Despite what the game is the current state is kinda rough on PCs. Frame rate drops are a common issue with top of the line PCs. Servers are not always stable. The inventory system / looting can be buggy at times. One huge issue i had with the game was looting. I would ho into an appartment and found several rooms with just clothes.

2017-06-08,0,0,543,False,Not Recommended,This game has gotten worse since they released it. The amount of asian players on US servers has ruined the game. I feel like this is H1Z1 KOTK all over again. It died when asian players infested all of the other servers with cheats and lag. You would think blueballs would of learned from others mistakes. Also the cheating in this game has gotten out of hand. Two games in a row i got killed by somone who landed and just started shooting 1000 meters accross the map. Blueballs probably shouldn't have added a killcam if they didn't have a grapel on the hackers in this game because it just puts a light on how bad hacking is in this game.

2017-11-30,0,0,297,True,Recommended,I've clocked in around about 250 hours ont he game now and I /mostly/ recommend this game. It's an addictive game where once you get past what seems like a steep learning curve you can't stop. Playing this game with friends is where a lot more of the fun is fighting together as a squad and mowing down opponents that dare come across your path. But like every single game out there this Battlegrounds is not without it's flaws and there are many.In a rough sketch servers are a constant issue when it comes to desync and jitter. The game is very demanding for your fps where having a GTX 960 like myself will average you around 40 frames. That's not ideal but you can work with it. The game seems littered with people cheating where sometimes you can run into a player breaking ToS every 3 games. However all huge games have the capacity for large amounts of cheaters and PUBG is no exception. The cheating situation seems to be mostly under control however. There are a lot of Asian players populating the other servers (Which might I add is where a majority of the cheaters come from) and it's great to see them playing and enjoying themselves but it's rough when they seem to kill you through walls from the ping. The sound of the plane beginning is like the devil molesting your ears and rain in this game is similar but toned down a couple inches. Don't get me started on optimisation either.Other issues I can mention but honestly if you immerse yourself in destroying any players in your path you can mostly ignore this. I find this game hugely fun even when I've died and I'm watching my teammates either hand out L's or get their beat. Getting headshots in this game is so rewarding and even the average kill is pleasurable. Being in the final moments of a round gets your heart pumping more than a hot pair of blond twins wanting to take you back to their place. (Preference of course.)I sincerely hope the full release of this game can remedy some of the issues that plague this game and bring it back up to it's potential as the best Battle Royale game of all time. It's certainly fun to play watch and especially win. The market of items for this game is also likely to be huge if it isn't already.I give this game a 7/10 overall.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-03,0,0,215,False,Recommended,I am new to the game with only 100 hours. Everyone has heared abou the game destroying bugs but the truth is is that the game is very playable. It feels rewarding when you kill people and/or win a round. The only 2 problems I have with the game are the sheer amount of hackers (about 1 every 30 40 matches) and the fakt that the only glitch I am suffering from is that I have 18000 BP (In game credits). If you buy this game you are probably going to play it alot. Network lag is going to be an instant death if you suffer from it so if you have a high ping dont bother buying it. You wont get those game destroying bugs but sometimes the game gives a up yours to physics.

2017-07-21,0,0,191,False,Not Recommended,Hard to say much negative about this game really. It was made for the right reasons with the right crew with the right background and it has all the pedigree of being a small classic in the genre. Which is fitting being made by the guy who 'invented' Battle Royale/King of the Hill in the Arma Mods. Only real negative thing in my book is the vanilla solo mode. Its just TOO random TOO often who wins I find. Some might like that though because it gives the lesser skilled players a small chance of getting that juicy chicken dinner on rare occasions. But yeah I like being rewarded for skills not luck. But other than that this game is rad af. And the main Dev is aiming for a full mod platform. Who knows.... Might surpass DayZ in a few months already lol. I say Hell YEah! Have at it Modders! (updated review)After being loyal to the development the game itself and hanging tough with it for a long time now I lost interest in it entirely. Im now of the mind that this game still has awesome potential as a spectator game. I enjoy watching other people play it more than I like playing it really. ANd thats the main reason I dont recommend it anymore really. Too many promises werent delivered too much RNG (randomness) in the game (its a competitive tactical shooter. Nothing tactical about getting a mortar shell in the face after you played perfectly for 20 min afaik). Its become a cash titan. And as such the developers cater to markets and elements that shouldnt be the main reason for development. Like E sports data miners skin traders etc. And at this point the only thing that might get me back to playing it wil be when the modders get access to the code. If that happens it MIGHT still become an epic game. But as it stands now its not worth it for casual gamers. Other games does that better with faster patching &amp better coding. Ill cross my fingers for the modders for this one. Till then meh.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-10,0,0,157,True,Recommended,Fantastic game.It's easily the best Survival Battleroyal game there is I'm not sure you can call it a survival game on it's own like Dayz so think the comparrisment is unfair. Dayz is a much slower experience which you play for the long game while Battlegrounds you are forced into other players making the experienced heart pumping action based.The game price originally put me off but watching the youtube videos pop up and having a friend buy me the game after playing for 30+ hours the content here is worth the money.Early access this puts many people off it never has for me IF! They relase the first version with a lot of content PUBG delievers a lot of weapons every single building can be entered (as it should) contains a huge map has multiple options from single duo or 3 4 player teams as well as custom games which I believein the future will allow gamers to buy hosted servers so they can define their own playing experience. Because I play duo I can't play customs games YET I hope they sort this out in the near future.Graphics are good but I wouldn't say well optimised the gritty easten EU enviroment has a depressing tone but you'll be hard pressed to enjoy the view while you constantly have eyes on every tree waiting for an enemy to jump out.What really makes this game for me is player spotting being able to use the compass to spot players locations and communicating them to a friend this is how it should be done no artifical orange spot on the hud displaying enemy location just verbal communication which can causes arguments )The game is actually being updated frequently which surprised me we've all heard promises during EA few rarely delievered. The updates consist of new guns and heavy gameplay tweaks to balance the game what's being impressive is that there hasn't been an update that's unbalanced the game or a gun that you needed to own to win the game it's really well balanced and each weapon has a situation where it can win you the fight.I hope in the future they offer search features for servers for example I'd like to play in a server where it's more slow paced so the white circle moves every 5 mins or 10mins games would last longer than an hour. No many peoples idea of fun I know but it would make winning that more satisfying.One last thing the lag I'd say for a server with 100 people the lag is very little either great predictive lag code or decent servers who knows? But far from perfect it's certainly better than any other game with near 100 players in.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I see myself pumping plenty of hours into this.And it's only going to get better PUBG Corp have a long term strategy in place for this game not unlike TF2 in termes of longevity.The learning curve is steep however there are plentiful resources to be found online despite claims the community is highly toxic the amount of support tutorials help and education about the systems in play on the likes of youtube reddit wikis etc are exaustively comprehensive.It's exhilerating most of the time however it's also infuriating at times. Looting for a solid 10 to 15 minutes only to be shot to bits in a 3 second firefight sucks but this is what it's all about PREPARATION.Sure you can get frustrated and throw your headset off in disgust when you get killed unfairly but then go back and check out your gameplay on the extremely slick replay system and realise that YOU were infact in the wrong.How you approach the map is entirely up to you each game but each frustrating death each exclamation of OMFG HAX each choke in the top 10 is a learning experience. You get better for next time check your corners more carefully plan a more strategic advance as opposed to crying foul because you were shot sprinting across an open field chasing the circle.Of course shooting straight helps too. )Buy it.

2017-10-12,0,0,604,True,Not Recommended,I really liked the game when it got released first. But after playing it for several month i start getting tired of the game and get angry every time im playing it. I m aware of the fact that the game is still an alpha but after several month online there should be at least some improvements. Cause there are too many bugs in the game to be noticed here i will just write down the bugs that me off most and are known since month and not fixed.1. Server performance and lags. In 1 of 3 rounds im pretty sure lags are the reason for my death and not the skill level of the enemy. You hit enemys 10 times close range... no death. Headshot on enemy with no helmet...he survives with blood in his face. Shotgun close range at the beginning of the round...no death. Being like 3 seconds behind the tree and get hits after hiding again...Shooting straight trough enemys without hit detection. Enemys getting hit but no damage calculated and so on.... Its really annoying. I dont have a problem with dying to good enemys but lags are just 2. Server crashes. Playing like 20 minutes only 15 enemys remaining... host closed connection... thank you for nothing3. Armor bugs. Not sure whether everyone got that. Lets give an example. I have lvl 3 helmet and lvl 3 armor. Im at full health. I get shot from a building and get 3 hits of an m16a4 and im down. After my friend revived me im looking at my armor. No dmg at all on my chest or my head. From dmg system i can not be dead from 3 hits in my arm so in my opinion sometimes game doesnt calculate your armor and its like beeing naked....Pretty sad performance here cause this issues are in the game since day one. The bring in new weapons and new crates you can open for money like in cs go but they are not willing to improve their server performance....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-13,0,0,122,True,Recommended,This is a very very very close to being negative review. The game is fun when luck is on your side but be prepared to be completely screwed over by the RNG more often than not.The game map is enormous but it might as well not be because the large map serves to hurt you more than help you about 50% of the time. Depending on where you drop into you may find yourself having to run miles (or drive if you're lucky and find a vehicle) just to get back into the playing area once it's determined only to finally reach it and have it shrink again to be even further away. This will happen in 33% or more of your games.The only times I ever die for the most part are when I'm on the move. Advantage here goes to the guy with good position who just happened to drop into the area where the game decides to take place. This should be remedied by the play area being visible before you drop from the plane causing a risk vs reward decision to come into play INSTEAD of RNG deciding who does well and who doesn't.RNG also can be stingy with weapon drops. You can sometimes search 3 houses and find great weapon attachments but no weapons. It happens more often than it probably should in a game that's about shooting people why be so stingy with the guns?I haven't encountered that many bugs only one crash and no cheaters to my knowledge.As for the loot crate thing? Honestly who cares? It's cosmetic completely optional and 100% not in your face. No big deal.This review sounds negative but when the game is fun and RNG isn't sticking it to you too badly the game is very worth playing. Hopefully they sort these things out because for the most part this plays very well.If the devs want to see this played at any sort of competitive level though the RNG t needs to change.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-13,0,0,447,True,Recommended,Great game great experience still having issues at times but you should definitely buy it if you enjoy playing games like H1Z1 Just Survive or Arma 3 Battleroyale.One important thing don't take in consideration the bad reviews about microtransaction. Both the community and the devs got to benefit from it. People are crying about a lot of things and I bet that most of the owners that have given this game a bad review actually got themselves some money back from it through the microtransaction system. With this method of getting the crates ( you have to play to get some in game currency so you can buy those crates and then sell them or open them the choice is yours ) it encourages players to get better at it but to not camp. If you end on the 26th but without kills you'll be awarded with less points than if would end on the 70th place after you've killed 3 players.TL DR The game is good. Buy it and enjoy it. If your system is not that great you might want to check some gameplays of this with those specs so you can make sure that your computer will be able to run it. I'm playing it on a GTX 970 and i7 4790K ( 8 GB of RAM ) and I can run it above 60 FPS only if I set most of its settings to medium/low/very low.Pros It's a really good game gunfight is great. The wider variety of guns ( compared to H1Z1 ) and gun attachments make it a superior game ( again compared to H1Z1 ) Armor actually gives you some protection. A level 3 helmet protects you from a couple of shots ( while in H1Z1 2 headshots with a helmet on meant that you were dead )Cons The game still needs a lot of work ( especially optimisation ). There are times in which the buildings don't load entirely ( for me at least ) and I can't get inside those. I have to wait a couple of seconds ( sometimes a minute ) so it can load properly and I can loot some items. Got killed sometimes because of this issue hopefully they'll fix this soon. The spawn system for items should be worked on. If you are about to land in a zone with a lot of buildings and you are unlucky to get a gun even a pistol in the first place you get to loot then you are most likely dead. I understand that this is how the game works but it can be really annoying. The loot system needs improvement too. There were times when I tried to loot a certain item ( having my crosshair on it ) and it grabbed some other items next to it. Not to mention that items can spawn so close to each other that you'll prefer to open up the inventory to drag and drop them in your bag but can get yourself killed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-08,0,0,566,True,Recommended,Among all the battle royale games on the market this feels like the perfect one. Good animations models and weapon balance realistic but not too unforgiving gunplay and a nice learning curve. The weekly and monthly patches usually fix an incredible amount of bugs and errors making it a a lot more enjoyable day by day. With the arrival of first person only servers as an option I feel like there are no competitors left on the market. The only cons I can mention is the optimalization which is actively being worked on and the vehicle physics. Learn to drive or a 5 cm rock can end your life on a motorcycle.

2017-09-16,0,0,66,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an early access game riddled with bugs glitches and annoyances. But the game is a great concept that's fun to play despite all the bugs. And when a game overcomes the bugs and problems that someone has with that game and still manages to be really fun then it is a great game. The graphics are boring to look at and the animations are stale and weird. If you're looking for mindblowing graphics you won't find them here. Also this game lags a lot even on the lowest graphics setting (Or at least if you have a PC like mine). But again the game overcomes these flaws and still manages to be a fun game. The best way to play this game is with friends in my opinion. Get at least three friends and play this game together and you will have fun. I usually don't get early access games because promises can prove to be false. But with this game I didn't base my purchase in promise I based it on what it is right now. And I can only imagine how much better this game can get as development progresses. Buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,I just want to get out of the way that the foundation of this game and the concept is really good and it's the best Battle Royale out there however the reason why I'm not recommending this game RIGHT NOW is because of Hackers and Cheaters I've played 15.4 Hours of this game after posting this review and I've encountered so many t moments heres just a few I've encountered I Literally just finished a game and died from 2 Shots to the head from the front from an AKM when I have a Helmet Level 3 (Strongest Helmet) AND I also had a Ballistic Mask 3 Shots from a Shotgun up close didn't kill a guy that had no vest at the start of the game (Blood appeared from every shot) Guy kills me with a P1911 with one body shot at medium range when i had Full Health Unloaded 10 M16A4 shots into a guy with a Level 1 Vest (Worst Vest) and he doesn't die he then shot me twice in the body with a UMP when i had a Level 3 Vest (Strongest Vest)The list goes on and on.At the games CURRENT STATE DO NOT BUYNot only Cheaters and Hackers but the Devs have also announced that Micro Transactions will be added (Buy keys and crates)I really want to see some Better Anti Cheat stuff in the game because battleye isn't working for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-21,0,0,610,False,Recommended,It was hard to decide...I think the game is great even if it has big flaws..I like having fun in video games and hate it when people take it too far with competitive gameplay. I cant stand people that rage all over team chat when a glitch or a bug appears and gets them killed. I usually laugh at situations like that. Sometimes i get mad too when a bug or a glitch ruins my game..but still the game is realistic (bullet drop/bullet travel time/recoil). Another thing that i really hate is cheating...Cmon why cheat..i never cheated in a video game before and im happy that i didnt. i still dont get the point of cheating and this game has a lot of cheaters. The graphics are quite good in my opinion..but i think the game still needs optimization..i gave it a positive review even though it has a lot of glitches and hackers.

2018-08-25,0,0,174,False,Recommended,Very popular game in the genre of battle piano. This genre lies in the fact that in certain areas there are people fighting for 1 place. To remain the last survivor is the main idea of this genre. In our case we do not just appear somewhere unclear where but we jump out of the plane and choose the landing area that suits us the most.There is a fairly large map a lot of weapons and body kits various vehicles. All you need for a good crazy brawl here and there) the game also has a kind of currency which we buy cases and get the armor. And what falls to us from the cases can be sold and it is very pleasing. The game has 3 types of gamessolo( every man for himself and hope only for their forces)Duo( game with a friend you survive in 2 and compete between other players)skvad( you unite in a group of 4 people and fight against the same groups of people)The game is constantly updated add new weapons armor and more. On E3 2017 showed a new animation of the hero associated with parkour (looks good it will greatly facilitate the task of jumping out of houses or jump over the fence) I Advise you to buy this game even if you do not have anyone to play one is also very interesting to play!

2018-11-09,0,0,116,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game a few years ago when it was still very new and had a substantial amount of hype. Its simplicity and conceptually efficient style knocked every other game off of my table for some time. This game was absolutely brilliant in building tension and giving players a sense of progression and improvement throughout matches. The variety of weather attachments and grenades really meant that winning was not just about pure aim but also awareness and creativity. This meant for players like me who are not very good at shooting games that I could get close and even win a few games with my hands trembling and my body sweating profusely.However the game wasn't exactly perfect ergo my recommendation against this game. You see at the time when it hadn't been fully released the game was littered with jittery and messy bugs that at times were simply comical due to their absurd nature yet sometimes incredibly frustrating for obvious reasons. It didn't matter that much at the time because I knew it was still early for the game and with the community surrounding it I was sure that the developers would work hard to resolve any issues. Oh how I was wrong. The game was left broken and tattered which was incredibly discouraging for the fans which had once loved the game so dearly. The devs went on to release and focus on the mobile version of this game while its pc version was still riddled with glitches and even worse hackers. In addition to this expansion of the game's content was almost non existent apart from the new maps of course and after every game there was no feeling of account progression or having had something gained from playing all those matches.In conclusion as of today the devs have fixed quite a lot of those bugs and gotten rid of many hackers although I am sure there are still some lurking in the shadows. So if you are looking for a game where you can quickly jump in shoot some dudes and constantly be on the run to feel that great rush of adrenaline this is that game. That being said I just can't say that can justify buying this game at full price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's really fun when you play with a group but I've tried by myself and it's too boring for me. The games are a bit slow paced a lot of people just camp in a building with high zoom scopes and snipe you from far distances. However I enjoy the pin point precision of where you are on the map (way better than H1Z1 although this is now implemented in the game as well) and the compass to know your direction. This game has a lot of potential.

2017-08-25,0,0,468,True,Recommended,"For a summary skip to the bottom. If you like books read the whole review.This game is extremely fun MOST of the time especially with friends. There are however many moments that make you want to rage quit i.e. When you have what you believe is a clear line of sight only to hit a windowsill or door frame and end up killed by a player you easily could have beaten otherwise. This is particularly frustrating in third person because the aimbox (in my own and others' experience) seems to be off even more so than first person. The same issue applies to grenade throws there is a visible throwing arc showing the path the grenade will travel but it has rarely held true especially indoors. More often than not I end up hitting something (like a door or window frame) that is far outside the arc of the throw and end up nearly killing myself or a squadmate. I have come to consider grenade throws as a gamble for my own life at this point and only use them with extreme caution. This should be an easily resolved problem (I blame beta state). Do keep in mind most of the issues come with precision throws indoors and into buildings. If you're out in the open there isn't a problem. The mind boggling ""accuracy"" of some players *cough cough*. I know I'm not the only one who experiences being instantly headshot at 100m+ as soon as an enemy turns around to fire back at you. For example a previous game in the Top 5 where I spotted an enemy from behind with my 8x scope. I decided to play it as safe as possible and fired prone from a narrow slot between 2 trees from within a modestly dense forest. As terrible as I am I missed. But my target didn't 2 seconds after I fired the other player turned around and instantly headshot me. ""How is that possible"" I thought marveling at the extreme skill and precision it would require to perform such an extraordinary feat of marksmanship at that distance. His ability to ascertain the exact location of my face in that short time having only gone off the general direction of the sound of a single gunshot was astounding. ""He must be a professional!"" I said aloud. Truly it was an honor to be in the presence of such an elite player. Then again it may have just been blind luck on his part. Is it possible? Sure. Sure...In summary aimbotting is an issue. Although most players prefer to actually test themselves and use their own skill there are a few (and I mean MAYBE 1/100) players who would rather pretend they're excellent players by using software to assist them. This is of course not the fault of the developers and doesn't impact my rating for the game. I understand it's difficult to crack down on these players but it's very disheartening to make it so far in a game only to be cheated. In regards to microtransactions Many players have decided to negatively rate this game based on the addition of this feature. I completely understand their anger and I agree with them. As another poster pointed out the items aren't entirely cosmetic. Everything you wear impacts your visibility. It is more difficult to see someone wearing camouflaged clothing than a yellow tracksuit. In PUBG everything you do and wear affects you. To be able to purchase clothing that increases your odds of survival is unfair. It's true that you can simply buy these clothes yourself for a fairly cheap price or get lucky with the RNG of a crate you purchased with in game currency but supporters were promised there would be NO microtransactions and that promise was broken thus giving the edge (however slight) to those willing to spend real world money on the game. As far as the Gamescom crates go and why I decided to finally rate this game Wow. I mean I'm not the luckiest guy but I didn't think I was unlucky enough to spend hours collecting points to purchase three crates with in game currency spend $7.50 real world currency for keys and get three of the same pair of $.20 cent school pants. The price that people buy them for isn't the issue here it's the fact that I got RNGed from behind so badly that I got three of the same item. But that's just how RNG is eh? I gambled and I lost big time.The almighty Ban Hammer and its liberal application in the protection of overly sensitive streamers in PUBG You've already read the popular posts about players being banned unfairly so I'll skip the lengthy paragraphs I would have written on the matter and just throw in my seal of agreement on the side of those who find it absurd. I mean a BAN? Come on. Especially for those accused of harassing streamers with the car horn. Odds are the guy has no idea he's honking near a streamer. And how many streamers ARE there? Consider the possibilty that someone streams JUST so they can get people they don't like banned or to feel some warped sense of power. I find that far more plausible than the unlikely scenario that someone happens to be in the same game and going far out of their way to survive long enough just to harass a streamer with a car horn. I imagine the Hammer wielders visualize a helpess streamer child being followed throughout the game by the big bad man with a horn. I played a round where there was a player driving through a town back and forth without fail blaring his horn as he drove through the streets all the while being shot at by every player in the vicinity. My friends and I thought it was hilarious. Had I been streaming I still would have thought it amusing even if they were doing it as they watched my stream. But I'm lighthearted and like to have a good laugh. In contrast streamers seem to have this strange idea that they're special and their needs should be catered to for the sake of their own benefit and enjoyment to the detriment of others. I know I said I wouldn't write a lot but it turns out I couldn't help myself Summary Get the game. Try it. Don't go off just the negative reviews of others. Also keep in mind that most of the recent negative ratings are for microtransactions and unfair bans and NOT gameplay (though there are still issues #beta). There are problems. It's a beta. Stick with it. Endure the pains that come with pre release. It's more fun with friends. If you play alone and have an exceedingly frustrating time find some buddies and go at it! The developers broke a promise but I believe they'll get back on track. If they don't leave your feedback and a negative review as others have. You will encounter cheaters at some point. When you do report them after they shoot you in the face. For the streamers don't be a pansy. If someone is ""harassing"" you shoot them. You have a gun (or a grenade (careful with the arc)) they have a car horn. Seems like an easy free kill if you ask me. The good times and stories far outweigh the bad ones especially with friends. Example I was once geared to the teeth having landed alone in the Military Base. I needed to cross the water to get within the circle and decided to take a boat. Having failed to reconcile the momentum of the boat as it slid across the beach I jumped out early. I immediately died my body flopping across the sand. After 7 minutes or so of unhindered play I killed myself. To me it was funny. For those enemies that saw me hilarious. This game has become one of my all time favorites. At first I hated it. I was bad at it. I played alone. I got better played with friends and now I love it. Do I approve of the antics of the developers as of late? No. Is the game still enjoyabe regardless? Yes. PUBG will give you an adrenaline rush unlike any game you've played. It's terrifying exhilerating and extremely rewarding.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-28,0,0,152,True,Recommended,*Acknowledgement that the game is still under development* Pros Multiple group modes that are all equally fun from paranoid inducing solo to tactic's focused 4 man squads. Gun's handle great and are balanced well with each other. There are no insta win weapons like a rocket launcher in halo. Hackers are almost non existant for an FPS. Seperate game modes for people who want either 3rd person or 1st person gameplay. This is no sniper simulator but the guns lean more towards the realistic than most FPS. If you want to kill someone 400m away you're going to have to carefully aim with a scoped zeroed rifle. Cons Melee is completely broken. One game you can run through a building 1 shotting people with a machete then the next you will not be able to hit a non moving enemy after multiple swings while he kills you with fists. The melee range (when it does work) feels like it is 1 inch away from your chest instead of the 2 3 feet range a crowbar would have. Hit detection needs some work.

2017-08-25,0,0,886,True,Recommended,"First and foremost to everyone that is saying that stream sniping/ honking shouldn't be bannable I feel doesn't know what they're talking about. I personally like how PUBG's team is handling stream sniping. In my eyes streamers that stream for a living can be impacted by stream snipers. It literally affects the quality of their stream. I know that some streamers find it funny but if someone was constantly harrasing you in game I'm sure you wouldn't be a fan of it. Another more ""heavy"" topic is one of microtransactions. To keep it short as long as they are ONLY cosmetic (which since PUBG is a battle royal game it literally has to be no worries about that) then I'm 100% okay with it. Why not drop a couple bucks for a piece of cosmetic gear if you have some cash floating around? I hate this topic as people seem very bipolar on the topic. Anyway the game itself is really fun. For an EE title it has one of the best dev team's out their atm. The interaction between the team and the community is great and their new switch to updates with more time in between each other for high quality updates is great in my opinon.

It takes a toll on your computer if you don't have all the specs but that's also because it's not very well optimized nevertheless you can still play it.

2018-01-26,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Its probably the worst game I've played in a long time. Was gifted to me by a friend whom enjoys it. I stepped into it with the only knowledge about it is that its pretty much battle royale and the area gets smaller and smaller after time goes on. Soon as I load into the game the graphics were the first jarring thing that popped out. For a game that involves long ranged combat its hard to distinguish between a shrub and a person. The rest of the game's effects look like it was made at a B grade university. And even that is a me trying to make this game sound good.Then comes the gameplay the main part of any game. Even if its visuals are garbage the gameplay should be enough to make the game worth it. This is one of the first games in my entire life where I was yawning within 5 minutes. I was in a group and I should have known the game's quality the moment I was in the lobby. The aiming was buggy even after messing with the control option. The running was buggy. The climbing was buggy. Even falling down the stupid plane was buggy. The game is a broken mess and its been apparently released. For $30. You spend most of your time just looting only for the garbage controls to get you killed anyway. I mean if the game worked it would still be subpar. The game really is split between 2 different phases looting and then finding something to do. Every round. In repeat. Fun.Its not often I find myself actually annoyed with a game this is actually one of the first. I cannot believe anyone would release a game in this state. It baffles me anyone likes this game and it got the recognition it did. I spent about an hour on this game an hour of my life I wasted and probably will never load it up again. 1/10 the 1 was for the fact that I could actually start the game. Which in the end was a waste of my time.Long story short Dont expect much. Its a garbage game with no appeal.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is intense as hell and this is really fun but yes of course there are alot of people from china there are a few cheaters ( i haven't seen one yet) and yea what else....In my opinion this game is balances as hell there are good weapons in Airdrops which you have to fight for there are good weapons/equipment which you have to search for...idk all i can say is that....this game is above my expectations and it's really freaking fun to play it with friends.In my honest opinion i'll give this game a 7/10 with a ""FUN"" approval.

2017-07-21,0,0,85,True,Recommended,"A great game in it's infancy. Much like a lot of early acess games the idea is awesome. Unlike other early acess games the PUBG guys continue to work on the project and provide improvements and additions. They also so far are keeping the game along the path it should be on not one based on where the money is which has become to common these days. The PUBG guys listen to the players that a big stand out thing. This game may be doing well in Steam stats but if they keep on the path to what this game can be and can accomplish they will top all gameing lists and then for being patient and listening to players then is when more money than ever will pour in for them. The game is great of course early access so it has it's little quirks but overall the best early access game I've played quality wise. Gun handling feels great unlike most other ""survival"" type games. I call it an FPS injected with some open world survival. It gets your heart pumping at times makes you want to rage at times makes you feel awesome at times in the end you always go back for more. Also if you don't like hearing the dumbest most pointless ignorant crap via mic mute voice chat upon entering the game. It's pretty bad almost always. My biggest tips wear a headset...turn it up. Listen to your senses if you think you heard something 9 times out of 10 you did stop and check your surroundings. Pace yourself be diligent and listen carefully.

2017-10-04,0,0,215,True,Recommended,I just wanna say I like the game most the people who are ing either A. Never win a game and always get ed over at some point. B. Have no real friends who are good at the game or C.Just suck at the game enough to and whine..On another note bringing up streamers and them exploiting bugs.. They have been BANNED. Destiny was Banned for driving through walls with the car and The Doc got banned for killing a teammate.. You saying they don't do anything is BS as the Devs and the main dev himself even said no streamer will get special treatment. And you realize they just have to make a new accoun they don't HAVE to tell you they got banned. I mean come on now. Overall the game is a bit buggy but for a game in Early Access it's doing 100% better then most games that have been in early access for years now. Looking at you DayZ Standalone. The game is good and I wouldn't look into the reviews to much as most people tend to cry about problems just go in and have fun! Yes you will get camped and at times get out played but all you can do is learn and improve at it as well. Good luck to everyone and I hope you guys can get some future chicken dinners!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-28,0,0,1006,False,Recommended,After 800 hours on this game I can give my opinion on this. The game is way better than at initial release. Still lots of bugs probs with hackers and region that are not locked. Play in FPP TPP is full of campers and cheaters. Arm yourself with some friends and go slay some people on your way to your precious dinner full of proteins. The game is sometimes laggy and dsync have been horrible the last couples of updates... Now it feels better. With a good computer the game feels smooth. Won't run it on a potato. I still think that for the gameplay mechanics the weapon mechanics this is the best BR. Sadly the quality of the servers and of the updates (the fix pubg campaign was not successful at all imo) the Dsync persistent cheaters and all ruins the experience. Though it's still my favourite BR and I've tried a lot of them. RNG can be cheesy but hey that's life. PS If you just come to say fortnite &gt PUBG i'll tell you you're wrong. The best one is the one you enjoy the most. Don't misunderstand me I play fortnite too but i'm quite bored about how easy it is. PUBG has recoil control tactics more than building brain a better ballistic... Fortnite's fun PUBG is for me a better game to play with my friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A complaint i have is the progression system as its only cosmetics if you play online games for the progression system only then this might not be for you. The developers update this game with big consistant updates which i really like.To sum up this game is just very fun and the fact you can jump straight back in to a match if you die is great. i would give it and 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However this might be down to individual players just having a bad connection and since hit reg seems client side with no compensation this makes it sometimes frustrating.I have not encountered any hackers in 500hrs of playing at least I have not noticed them (I'm playing EU servers only).Overall I had a lot of fun for 30 bucks would buy it again but still hope it's going to get fixed (last weeks look promising).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-03,0,0,472,False,Not Recommended,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.The servers are the major problem with this game and I cannot recommend it in the current state. The servers were designed for 1 million concurrent players. Considering the devs could not have predicted that the game would blow up beyond that I understand that and accept the explanation. But once the game blew up in popularity beyond that their attempts at fixing these issues are far from enough to do any good.They patched the game a few months ago and after that they said they also fixed the servers (this was around the time they acknowledged that they were completely unprepared for the volume of gamers on their servers). I have had constant disconnects ever since that patch and no amount of ""fixes"" on my end or their end have done anything to assuage the problem.This is a game breaking bug that tens of thousands of people are experiencing.Don't get me started on the shoddy character movement where you feel like you're floating/sliding and movements are not precise. Nor the poor shooting and registration of hits on characters. That is just the beginning of how many problems this game has.At any rate the game is not ready for mass consumption and I would wait until Early Access is over and the game receives some serious overhauls.*Update*Their FIX PUBG campaign was a complete failure. The patch they released just before declaring the game fixed broke the game completely. I have spent hours trying to fix it and it rarely ever works and if it does it crashes my PC so soundly that it requires a hardboot (if I even get into the game) within seconds or minutes.

2017-08-24,0,0,914,True,Recommended,An awesome game making its way through early access.. I really enjoy playing the game it's seriously intense at points and can be alot of fun it's also enjoyable to play with friends or by yourself. I've clocked up a few hours on this game now ) and it can lead to tears of joy or tears of anger and I mean the FIFA angry when that guys scores a 99 min goal by passing across the box when there's only 2mins of extra time given.. that level.The crete system is fab just like any other game if you dont want to buy don't buy. In fact its nice to have items that actually do effect the game whether its camo or coloured items for upcoming maps ). You can also sell your crates on the community market to make money from nothing but just playing the game I think its one of the best crate systems I've seen. One negative part of this is the huge percentage that's charged to sell back the items you've opened to the market and yes the focus on micro transactions.There are a few issues with the game and I'll list these here in importance to me with a few ideas.People seeing through absolutely everything no textures load Being shot round corners or behind objects this is constant and needs to be fixedHit registration is poor at points. Lag at start when landing the beginning is one of the most important parts of the game also other players jolting when close to each other.Campers it's way to easy for them.The landscape while using vehicles bikes in particular needs improving.Loot sometimes you can go through countless buildings without finding an AR or anythin but a shoutgun and pistol.Valting I know its comingIDEASThere should be more visibility of someome who has been to an area ive noticed you have black footprints on the floor why not leave them round only when someone has looted a building and closed all the doors?The blue zone is too powerful near end and not powerful enough to begin with.... ill leave gamescom solo winner last night Evermore to explain more ) 1 use spotting flare? a good idea would be able to have a spotting flare that you can only use once will cover a small area and for only 5 seconds or so. That way if you wanted to use it if you thought someone was camping use it then or save it to the end zone.... if you make it. Nerf the shotgun its way to powerful getting one banged with level three armour and helmet is stupid. Less powerful but a bit more faster shot on trench sk12 is fine on recoil but reduce damage. Also the distance reach of these is way to far without choke.Leave rare boxes in buildings In very few buildings why not have a locked crate with a grozer* in or similar that takes a short period of time to open? The crates that are dropped are few and too rare that you'll actually get it or even find it especially in solos. Also you should have to carry a crowbar (one member of suqads or duos) to open the red crates that are dropped.Glare from scopes for a scope thats 4x or above it should have a slight glare or shine if being aimed in.Anyway fab game keep up the good work see you on the battlegrounds!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-21,0,0,354,False,Not Recommended,This Game was Bull**** from the beginning. I have never saw a good Idea become devastated this much bad. all developers and producers thinking is MONEY! they even took BACK gifted battle points they distributed between players for recent growing problems as a promotion! some people even received negative battle points!!! can you imagine that? what kinda dumb apologize is that? but my main problem beside many other disgusting negative sides of this game is that I recently realized that different users receive different data volume for the same update. I receive 3.6Gb while others receive 1.8 and even 900Mb! I don't know if its steams problem for showing amount of update correctly or PUBG gives different updates for different regions. if any one knows whats going on here how we can fix it I would appreciate if they share their knowledge.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-15,0,0,484,False,Recommended,I'd recommend this game to my mates. Fun as hell and is a good laugh. HOWEVER there is so much stuff still broken and issues out the with it. I've encountered sound queues not working such as footsteps not being audible (even inside) explosions causing the sound to distort and cause the sound of an earthquake at a rave and some sounds that cut out randomly. Visual glitches such as seeing guns through walls or floating as if they are attached to players.Then there are gameplay issues. Oh my god are there gameplay issues. Dips in the ground cause vehicles to stop and act like you've hit a wall characters head bang like a paint shaker if proned on a hill and holding a weapon constant server issues cause rubber banding and the frame rate drops...the frame rate drops are the worst. I had the counter go from 60fps to 11 because someone used a grenade. When the game first came out as 1.0 (though more like 0.75) it was running at a smooth rate and 30fps was the lowest it got. Now with the new update I'm lucky to even get to 20fps when running through a field. How the hell they thought this was out of early access I'll never know. It still needs so much work for it to be out of early access properly,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-27,0,0,663,False,Recommended,2 months ago I was introduced to pubg mobile from a buddy of mine and instantly fell in love with the game. So much so that after a month of playing the game on my iPhone I decided to make the investment and build a new gaming pc just to play the official version. (I am normally a mac person and would have never thought in a million years I would buy a pc). I own a ps4 and not an xbox so it seemed to be the best option since there was no evidence of the game being release on the ps4 anytime soon. $2500 and 1 week later I was playing the game (I am now single thanks to it) and I have absolutely no regrets. Initially the transition from console to keyboard and mouse was very tough even with me being an experienced FPS gamer on console. Luckily it continues to get easier and easier the more I play. As expected I have not been able to stop playing this game. It is challenging and every match is unlike the last so it never loses my internest. I am excited for the upcoming training map which will be avaible within the next few weeks since I found it very useful on the mobile version. The game runs smoothly and I rarely have problems/ lag while playing. There are updates all the time including new skins guns and weapon adjustments. I hope bluehole will bring back the option to use OPSKINS to trade the skins (using wax) since this would definitely bring in new interest. I paid $19.99 for this game from the Steam website.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you just want to read one review that breaks down all the pros and cons of the game and although I do reccomend it this review may convice you NOT to buy it because again it has it's issues. The first part of this review will be a bulleted list of everything the game succeds at and everyting it fails at anything marked with * I will go into more detail in on the second half. Pros Fun fast pased gameplay and gunplay* Revolutionizes battle royale based games* Good graphics (sorta) Realistic type shooting and driving mechanics The adrealine rush game*Cons Very poorly optomized as of right now* Incredbily horrid community* Not enough character or area customization* not enough game modes*Fun gameplay The gameplay of this game is incredibly fun. Your instantly thrown into a game of 100 people and have to wait no more than a minute to get right into the action. There's a ton of differn't weapons and weapon attachments. All of the guns in this game have uniqe characteristics that once you get used to one regardless of its actuall prowess you will get attached because you know how to use that gun specifically better than its counterparts and I love that. Revolutionizes battle royale Battle royale is a very new game type and the only games that exist (That are relavent any way) that also have this are H1Z1 and day z. They completly fall flat to this game in almost every aspect and this could very well be the start of an usher of amazing battle royale type games. The adrenaline rush game I've never felt more of a kick while playing any other game in my life! When your in that single digit alive club and the cirle starts to close up real tight you start hearing your heart racing! and although some people may not like this i'm sure the great majority of people would because it will make that victory all the better. now onto the consVery poorly optimized I know this game is still in early access and they are plannning on fixing it but it has to be said. If you don't have a beefy computer do not buy this game at least not yet. You will open it up attempt to pay it on the lowest settings and then realize how futile it is and that you just lit $30 on fire. It's a huge issue that needs to fixed immedatly if people are going to be playing this game for a long amount of time which I hope they do. And this is also why I said the game sorta has good graphics. 99% of the people playing can't play it on anything higher than low settings which obviously makes the game look god awful. This is truly a damm shame because if you turn the game on ultra for a second just to get a look at it it looks pretty damm good.Community The community for this game is awful if you turn your voice chat on longer than 5 secconds in a solo game you will instantly become deaf due to people with mics trying to ear becasue its funny even though its not 12 year olds screaming and a grown man yelling at everyone to shut up. Every. single. time. And on top of this if you kill someone they can still talk to their killer through a mic so what they do 9/10 times is scream call you a cheater or just salty name calling. All very loud and obnoxious fortunatly there is an ailment to this. Mute all. Character and area customization The character customization in this game is a joke. You have a ton of generic looking people with the same exact body type and the same 5 hairstyles running around it truly feels as though your character was made for you. You have these crates that will give you random drops of clothes and cosmetics but they're all so bland and ordinary. The coolest looking thing you can get in the game is a trench coat and even that looks pretty meh. On top of this lack of innovation there's only one map it is pretty fatiguing losing a couple rounds in a row pretty quickly and just doing the same in the same spot over and over there definitly going to need to add more maps if this game is going to have a lifespan of over another year. Not enough game modes This game does one thing and it does it well battle royale but I just feel like it needs something else. Doing the whole battle royale thing for over a couple hours can make you bored and then your going to want to take a break from the entire game becasue there isn't anything else to do in it. There doesn't need to be something else huge in the game but just something simple would be a nice little break inbetween games something that isn't too off from battle royale but doesn't have the whole half an hour plus games and the 1/100 chance to win.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-28,0,0,1127,True,Recommended,If you have a wide group of friends that are competitive and also just looking to chill out and have a fun time PUBG is your game. Despite the things this game is getting bad reviews for this is a must buy. I have had some of my favorite gaming moments on this game and it hasnt even been finished yet. The game does need some optimization and the vaulting and climbing mechanics the devs are currently working on to eliminate the terribly clunky jumping mechanics in the game now. But other than that if your looking for the next big thing in PC gaming this is your game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-29,0,0,1189,True,Recommended,so far so good this game is exellent at combining pvp and teamwork with its multiple game modes and has great potential if new maps and weapons are implemented during updates. the game already has exceeded most peoples expectations and has quickly become a favourite for people enjoying fast paced survival of the fittest combat openworld and looting and the fact that everyone starts with the same chance to win. personally i enjoy pretty much every aspect of this game so far. an idea maybe for specific clothing or reward system for the people who get the chicken dinner would be a great insentive for players to take the game more seriously but above all to keep it competative while keeping the enjoyable game play it already provides,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-26,0,0,934,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game to anyone I know even to enemies. The only thing the company cares is to earn more money. Add new crates and skins? Yes! Add more crates and skins? YES! Add skins for weapons? Yes. It is important to look cool when you need to concentrate on the game play.They added new map but did not bother to add map selection. Ofcourse it is better for users to been forced play map they really do not like.Another interesting thing is to provide us with bugfixes and optimizations without even testing it. One update and added ten errors or new bugs. It is typical for me to get 5 times connection error before loading lobby.And the biggest frustration is mis synchronization of client and server. You can try to hide from bullets behind some wall but after few second of hiding you die because server desided that you still running to the wall. You can watch replay and see how person shooting not at you still sucessfully hit you.I don't understand how the company with such amount of money can't afford to hire competent developers or at least buy more powerfull servers.Still the idea of the game is good but unfortunatelly it was invented by wrong people,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-02,0,0,372,False,Recommended,This is worth 26.99. With two current maps a new 4x4 and 8x8 kilometre map coming to the game soon there is a lot to do. I wil admit being killed by hackers or people who use recoil macros is annoying but the hackers are being dealt with well and constantly being banned. There aren't many bugs but when a new bug is found Bluehole are quick at patching these. The game is balanced however it is hard to get used to the shooting style and looting since you need to know what ammo goes for what gun and what attachments do what. It's heartbreaking to come second but relieving af when you get a chicken dinner. Overall I recommend this for anyone who likes battle royale games as it adds a whole new experience to the scene however not everyone can run it which is sad but the game is always being optimised to run better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-13,0,0,893,True,Recommended,"I'd like to start this review by stating that I purchased Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (hereafter referenced as PUBG) with my own money and of my own volition. The game itself is generally well polished however being just shy of release there are still some bugs to be expected here and there. The important thing is that whenever there is a ""Game Breaking"" bug or problem with the servers the devs are willing to be up all night working to fix it. This game works well on Higher End computers however if you can't run Counter Strike on Ultra settings I'd suggest running on lower detail to maximize performance until the game is fully optimized. The game is highly realistic this being both a pro and a con in some regards. For example the mortar fire in particular is very realistic and could be traumatic to persons who've experienced it in real life. The plus side to PUBG'S realism is in that the weapons and gameplay both feel very. Experiencing hackers and laggers are about as commonplace as any other run of the mill hypetrain game however the devs have been fighting that battle as well. The most negative thing I could say about the game is the Loot Crate System for skins however that's an option that you doesn't affect gameplay too heavily. All in all I'd recommend this game over and over again. Now enough of this review time to get some Chicken Dinners!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

HOWEVER this game has issues Rendering is a problem for example sometimes buildings dont load in until 40 seconds into the game which can be vital and mean a win or a loss. Another apparent issue is the constant whinging of streamers that results in the banning of alot of innocent people. The game is great and definetly an enjoyable experience at times.

Half the stuff they show in the trailers isn't in the game and probably never will be (some guns shields etc) The movement is clunky. Developers refuse to address community complaints like the red zone. Vehicles are still an issue. And yet we've got a whole bunch of new skins!!

Also since these paid crates contain cosmetic stuff that does not offer any advantage in terms of gameplay (in other words no ""Pay2Win"") I've no issues. Free crates do still exist and as far as I observed their content has not been reduced in any way.The game itself is great albeit still somewhat buggy and with occasional server issues.

2018-08-17,0,0,147,False,Recommended,"What I would consider one of the best Battle Royal games if you're looking too play seriously and don't want to deal with building mechanics and similar gimmicks. Somewhat buggy especially on the miramar map but I find it in no way makes the game awful. This game is great to play with squads as this game heavily relies on teamwork but solo is fun in itself as it consists of small 1 on 1 skirmishes and I find is good for practice and training. One of my strong negative points is the loot boxes which most require a $10 key to open in a game that already costs nearly $40 having a lootbox system that requires money makes the company seem greedy. Luckily these loot boxes don't have strong impact ahead of looks so it's passable. What I hate most about this game is that there is no server lock meaning people from other serves like the asian or european servers can join the North American server. This doesn't seem like an issue except these people abuse ping lag out games hack a heavy amount and don't speak english in a team based game. Luckily this game is in a state called ""Fix PUBG"" where the developers are fixing stuff like this so hopefully these two major problems will be fixed sometime soon. Even with these two negative points I would recommend this game but it needs fixing.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Crates can earn you some money i made 80 bucks off a denim jacket the first crate i got so i was really happy the game paid for itself twice over.

2017-07-12,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I bought the game very recently but after at least 5 matches of PUBG I asked and got a refund. Not because I'm like bad at shooters which I'm not its because honestly it's just boring and completely unfair most of the time too many stalemates and when you do get killed you get killed in a bulls**t way. Because of the other person saw me when I couldn't see him at all. The combat just feels horribly unbalanced between the attacker and the defender. Even the team play isn't that fun. it's all because of that third person camera. The reason that Levelcap listed here is why I refunded the game.And yeah other third person shooters like GTA V have the same problems but at least your death results in the end of the game. These are the same reason. Granted that's just me but in my opinion It's insane how much attention this game got after just a few months of being released.

2018-06-25,0,0,420,False,Not Recommended,I've sunk my fair share of hours into this game and here's my conclusion after the Sanhok release. I want to like this game but with the lack of improvements on gameplay/optimization I can't be excited or recommend this to anyone looking to just now purchase. The added content is great and I could care less about the cosmetic loot crates but the more important aspect of gameplay is not being improved. I run an i7 7700k/1060gtx and still struggle to have smooth gameplay between hit reg rendering and general clunky movement and gunplay. This was acceptable before full release but the improvements made since then are hardly noticeable. The amount of money this game has made does not reflect in the product.TL DR Cool idea and continuous content lack of gameplay improvement from pre release.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-21,0,0,1401,False,Recommended,First of all all things considered I am not saying this game is bad per se but in the state that it finds its self it is no longer a title that can be looked at in awe in the battle royal genre. This game had potential unfortunately in the state that the game finds its self I can no longer recommend it. Especially with other titles like fortnite and Roe improving on the mistakes that blue hole made during the development of their game. The latest update was clearly rushed for the holidays regardless of whether or not it was ready for such a release its season pass is riddled with bugs on day one with massive ui issues and the such. In addition on the last game I played today my friend was basically invisible we could not see him at all. With such game breaking bugs being introduced to the main branch it is clear that they did not have stability in mind when rushing the new update but instead it was money. On top of all of the poor business decisions with their ridiculously overpriced microtransaction and pushed content I do not think anyone should consider buying this game until the company starts to shape up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-14,0,0,635,True,Recommended,This game is not for everyone. If you like tactical shooters king of the hill games and the general idea of fearing for your life where ever you are then this game is for you.A lot of people say this game is overhyped that might be the case but that doesn't mean there is a big part of the community which actually really likes the game including me. Hackers ARE a problem definitely. Mostly in the higher ranks but even as a player in the top 25 thousand I've been killed by hackers which is just infuriating if you loot 20 minutes to get killed by someone who is cheating.Dispite what people say blue hole is working on their game and the issues with it. They are not as experienced as EA for example because they are new to the multiplayer game market. They include new content like vaulting new guns and maps (mostly) regulary. Yes there are microtransactions but hell they are purely cosmetic and it's only a 30 game Overwatch for example is a fullprized 60 game and you can purchase lootcrates. Developers need a consistent income to finance new content and as long as it is cosmetics who the hell cares not like influences your chances of winning. The game still needs a lot of tweaking bugs and glitches are annoying and happen but its also an early acces game.But after all that's juts my opinion. I like this game. I love that feeling of finding an 8x scope or a suppressor for a Sniper I love the feeling I get being in the top 10 hitting a sweet headshot with the kar98 or running over someone with a car. Try it out if you think that's something you would like if not that's totally fine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-13,0,0,305,True,Recommended,I can only recommend this game. Easy to learn easy to grasp hard to truly master and if you die you're right into the next match again. Put in mind that this game is still in Early Access but it certaintly playable at this stage even though the game still needs a lot of optimaization. Saw a comment that they went p2w which is far from the truth. It's pay for cosmetics and you will absolutely not be able to buy anything that will grant you an advantige ingame. Warning They do ban people if you cheat if you team up in soloes and if you stream snipe. Have seen it countless times which I certaintly approve of. Game is not perfect but they constantly add new stuff and deliver what they promise and new cosmetics and weapons etc. are added to the game from time to time. There is currently one map but they have promised that there will be more. This is more of a hybrid between the more hardcore version of battle royale from the mod from Arma3 and the more casual H1Z1 which essentially reach out to both groups. They nail it in my opinion. Really good game still in early access (put that in mind)!I certiantly recommend it and the price is very reasonable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-08,0,0,192,True,Recommended,Pretty good! But can be kind of frustrating since you often get shot out of nowhere and you dont even get to see a replay of whom/from where you got shot. Dont expect it to be call of duty like its mostly medium/long range combat/sniping. Collecting gear and weapons can be a bit tedious especially if you get ganked just as you completed the perfect setup..Best strategy is probably to seek out combat until you are good enough at it so you can grab the stuff the other players spent time collecting.Expect to spend a fair amount of time tweaking graphics settings for good performance.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-04,0,0,1149,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale shooter that pits 100 players against each other in a struggle for survival. Gather supplies and outwit your opponents to become the last person standing.This game is really good all the players kill each other in order to survive until the end to eat the Chicken Dinner.The graphics are also pretty good which supports high end pc and other HD settings.For animation is also very good. There are many awesome effects such as explosions blood bullets and so on.But there are still many problems to occur because no game is 100% perfect. Such as drop FPS lag lots of bugs wall through vehicles and many more. Especially drop FPS and strutter which makes me so disappointed. I have a fairly high spec PC and it seems like my pc is fine. There is no problem in the internet RAM processor graphics card etc. Also server problems that are very difficult to connect. I hope the developer can resolve this many issues soon.Overall the game is worth it for you to buy because the game is already in Esports and very interesting to try.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-09,0,0,242,True,Recommended,While the games is fun and has it's moments PUBG is pretty much a lucky you won battlegrounds game. It really come down to who see who first and who is the luckiest shot. Too many times I've been the first one to shoot but an AR against an A12K is a losing fight at close range. Also I have come to the conclusion most FPS game of this type have a major problem with LINE OF SIGHT!As for me personally I have given up playing the PUBG solo I will now only play Duo's or squads as any game is funner to play with friends. Bottom line if PUBG ever comes out of Early Access it might be an awesomely optimized game but as for now just deal with its issues and have fun playing this mess that's way better than H1Z1.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-16,0,0,2706,True,Not Recommended,The sad thing about this game is its amazing potential and how far it is from achieving that potential. Don't get me wrong the game is fun and exciting. The scenery looks nice. But the gameplay is a roulette wheel at best. You want to shoot through this window? Sorry there's an impenetrable wood bar at the exact level of the gun barrel. Want to peek around this corner as you know there's aguy coming around? Well that's humurous as you are going to shoot the doorframe. Sniped by a shotgun? Probably. Can't hit the broadside of a barn with the same choked shotgun? Also probably. There are a ton of things that the devs have promised that they haven't delivered. Cheaters run fricking rampant. Servers are terrible. Optimization hasn't occurred even though they promised it long ago. Wait for the full release whenever that comes. It will be good once it gets the attention it needs. It is sorely lacking that attention.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(not to mention the bigger gun variety and also the attachments)And the fact that Daybreak studios hardly ever releases a new update (shotgun most unbalanced i ve ever seen) for their game makes Playerunknown more interesting cause the developers care about their game.The reviews for this game are constantly rising and thats why i can see a bright future for PUBG. We know H1 got a lot of hate in the past weeks because of PUBG and dont get me wrong its a good game but we players want that you take care and maintain your games (Valve pls fix CSGO)i can only recomend this game you wont regret it 8/10 see you on the Battlegrounds ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So why have i recommended this game? because when you eventually get into a game with players who are all on the same even playing field its actually a lot of fun. If there was an option for nutural i would of clicked that option but there isnt one.

2018-03-03,0,0,171,False,Recommended,So PUBG is truly a great game. Competitive game mechanics fun weapons funny ways to die. I recommend this game for those who like FPS's the battle royale genre and a fun time. But... the game has a lot of problems. DO NOT get this game if you easily dislike a game because of numerous problems. The devs have put a lot of love and work in this game but it still has a ways to go and many problems to fix including Places where one can get stuck The deathcam and replay system (bullets do not ever hit anyone it is delayed) Car mechanics. For example today I had my 2 favorite guns when I got out of my car and it lightly pushed me causing me to fly 20 feet and die. Parachute mechanics (I often lose half of my health or more because of rubberbanding and other issues when dropping) Issues with region locking and foreign players. Non China servers are infested with Chinese players and no one is happy about it. There needs to be a region lock. Also sometimes my region gets set to Asia automatically causing me to join those server and waste my time. Other than these issues (and more that I have not encountered) I think PUBG is truly a great game and it still can become more perfect.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Thats not very much yes very annoying to be killed by them but whats 3 deaths?________________________________________________________________________________Community? Very toxic on the plane although somtimes you will find one or two people who are very pleasent to hangout with.________________________________________________________________________________Multiplayer? Very much so its very rewarding to win a solo queue match! But its even better when you can share your success with one or even 3 more players! Squads are enjoyable not very toxic but most the time people dont have mics.________________________________________________________________________________Regions China is very preasent even on the NA servers. So dont think you will avoid them... cause you wont but most the time you'll be fine if you dont squad up!________________________________________________________________________________OVERALL SCORE?! 8.5/10 Extraordenary game! Like any game it needs work. But with a little TLC you'll see it grow!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,367,True,Recommended,8 Square kilometers of Battle Royale bliss!https //youtu.be/FXkpMYI9RioJump out a plane and skydive onto a massive island where everyone is trying to kill you.PlayerUnknown's Battleground is my first dive into the world of battle royale arenas and i have to say i am quite impressed by it.The general quality of the game is really good but does lack that little bit of polish but saying that the is has only just been released on Early Access so i'm sure that will improve in time and i'm not saying it looks bad in anyway.The sounds are really good and you get to hear the other players running around the house you're in or when they are close by. Guns shots will ring out across the map and can give/will away your location to people looking for a fight.It's got a leveling system too.....of sorts fight to gain exp to unlock some goodies in the form of bonus loot crates. I was in the closed beta for this game and since it's release on early access it has come down with a case of the lag. In the early stages of the game it suffers the most trying to deal almost 100 people at the start of the game really shows the strain on the servers but once the herd is thinned slightly it does ease off.There are a huge varity if weapons to pick up ranging from a classic frying pan for up close and personal encounters to silenced snipers rilfes for you want to sit a the back of the bus and take them out from a distance. Almost all of the guns can be upgraded with attachments when you pick them up.There is only one map at the moment but hopefully that will change in the future. There is only one game mode type but you can either do it solo Duo up with a friend or Squad it up with a bunch of friends! if you don't have any friends to play with online then you'll get randomly paired or squaded up with other players. So be talkative as you are going to need to work as a team to survive.So it's got a massive map a health amount of equipment to use cars to drive (don't jump out of them when they are moving or you'll run yourself over....trust me i've done it) and lots of heart pounding moments when you hope no one sees you as you have not picked up a weapon yet!If you have not played a battle royale game yet then this is definitley not a bad place to start.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-24,0,0,286,False,Not Recommended,This game had great potential to be very good game. It has huge player base and massive sales all over the world.But even with this succes the game is garbage. Since the early access nothing really changed except addition of few new guns cars loot crates cosmetics and map. After release game is still filled with bugs random crashes and cheaters. Hitboxes sometimes just doesn't work and even if I shoot somebody and see blood splashes nothing happens.A lot of times I get stuck with my parachute having to cut it off and falling down which takes most of my health but that's not the worst.What really pisses me off is the input lag. I don't know why is the input lag so distinct. Maybe its the lack of ping lock.Another problem is gameplay. Every game you literally have to loot for 10 15 mins. just to die from some cheater and yes this game is packed with cheaters. Almost every third game there is one.Conclusion BUGS BUGS BUGS AND CRASHES INPUT LAG CHEATERS GAME DEFINITELY DOESN'T FEEL LIKE FULL RELEASE+FUN GAME+EASY TO JUMP IN AND JUST PLAY+NO WAITING FOR MATCHMAKING+PRICEI will keep occasionally play this game hoping for fixes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They refuse to fix their god awful servers and optimization and instead rely on trying to make money by adding crates.To be fair I was all about this game for a long time and I really felt the last patch went in the right direction. It wasn't great but it felt smoother and slightly more polished. Now after this most recent one I have so far died to a guy shooting me two more times after I rounded a corner (couldn't even see me anymore in the killcam) punched a guy out only to die from him shooting me as I was looting his body. (kill cam was literally me crouched on his body and 2 bullets coming from nowhere). And finally having the wonderful experience of using the S12k on some guy that was standing still only to have him turn and 1 shot me upon review none of my shots did any damage and he was rubberbanding. As a slight sidenote whichever at bluehole thought ""hey people that play FPS games absolutely love not having a gun to shoot"" should be fired immediately. there is nothing fun about landing at a place like po i/pecado/military base then searching 5 building or half of a barracks and getting nothing not even a pistol. Bring back the patch when you released the vector where you could enter any building in the game and get like 2 AR's or at least an SMG.At the end of all of this all I can really say is in its current state I recommend no one buys this game. And unless they take a lonnggg look at themselves (yea right to busy suing people for no reason) this game will remain trash.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-03,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Here comes my review for PUBG I only played it for a few hours but i do can say that it's worth a recommendation. I mean it's not perfect that's for sure but many people are ignoring the fact that Bluehole is trying to make the game worth the 30 bucks.Which it isn't right now.30 bucks are a bit of a price for PUBG it's is not fair enough to justify that. It has a variety though There are (as of September 2018) 3 maps 2 big ones and 1 small one. That's a number and makes sure that you won't be playing on the same boring map all the time. The amount of different weapons and attachments is decent too. And even the vehicles are varied enough.But what my point is is that the skins and other accessoires are mostly paid which would be no problem because it's optional but it took the sense out of the Battle Points system and since you paid 30 bucks (or a bit less if you got a good deal) you don't want to have a feature that you can't even use properly without paying more.My suggestion A leveling system attached to something similar to a battle pass. Not that seasonal battle pass where you are forced to play 24/7 to get the coolest item of it but more like a permanent one where you climb the level ladder into infinity and get a nice item for every level up. Transform the total BP a player has earned in his career to XP and everyone is happy. This gives PUBG another feature and you can leave the current system in for those who don't want to wait for an item. If Fortnite takes your Battle Royale take their Battle Pass! And don't be happy with the current piece of the Battle Royale fanbase. Reach for it as a whole! It would be very helpful if you upvote this review if you agree so the others and Bluehole see that PUBG has potential to be the best Battle Royale and that it does can die like H1Z1 if it's not being cared about enough.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There has been some efforts to curb hacking and the game has had multiple updates with a couple new maps since launch. I would honestly like to say I enjoy playing the game but theres 1 problem. I can't play it....it's been broken for me for about 3 months. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it only crashes. My crash report also crashes so instead of beating my head on my desk about it I'm just done playing PUBG i guess. I've never once cheated at the game so that can't be my issue.

The concept of the battle royal is perfectly impliment in PUBG. The objective of being the last one alive is a thrilling rush of excitment when you finally achieve the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner. Even though i am not an expert and probably only win a game one out of 50 times the game is still able to bring me back again and again. The controls are not very hard to understand and they are easy to pick up and learn. The continous updates and support for the game is unbelievable. The developers continue to make the game better and add richer details to every new map. If you are a fan of the shooter genre I highly recommend this game.

The servers are so bad that you will constantly be shot while behind cover due to latency issues. The spawn rate for weapons is disgusting you will run into whole houses with nothing but a helmet and a back pack. The addition of the rain map makes the audio queues irrelevant on that map which is a majority of how you tell where someone is in the game.

2018-12-29,0,0,22,False,Recommended,I want to point out something that you'll find very odd later in this review I don't like BR games. This was the first one I bought and at first when it was in early beta stages I hated it as well. I was always good at it. In solo I rarely die before the final 10 players but i just don't like the game mechanics in BR games. I always found it cheesy and stupid that a colored wall pushes players toward one another to force fighting instead of other games like Escape from Tarkov where resources and missions and looting push players into certain zones instead of a silly enclosing wall as I'm more of a realism shooter person anyway. That being said after giving this game a very long break refusing to play it with firends and not putting any time in I started watching streamers and saw how they were enjoying the game so i decided to see if it had improved since i played it.The first thing i did after reinstalling it was check settings and run a test to see if it performed better and oh boy does it run so much better than it used to. I don't exactly have a beefy set up but my system has no problem playing with pretty much everything on high. The second thing i did was just click the quick join to see how long it took to get into a match and see how playing with randoms would be. Boy was aI shocked. I had more sucessful 4player teams than I could have imagined. Being a long time CS player playing with randoms usually means a lot of novice players but I was paired multiple times with top 5 teams and although i was paired several times with teams that died in the first 60 seconds of hitting the ground i was still having fun becuase I could hop right into another game on a different map andusually get a better team. And in the first night of playing the game I actually won a match with 3 random guys. I don't think I've ever seen that happen in any other game. Where 4 random people could joine up and win esspecially considering how talented a lot of the players are in this game. It honestly provides those moments that battlefield used to be known for. And I love using my nvidia software to save highlights and such and upload them for my friends to see. And that was one of those moments.So yes coming from someone that doesn't like BR won't even think about fortnite and plays mostly realism shooters I have to say this is now a game I think I will play alot more than most games because of the potential for so many fun things to happen.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,Warning ( I can't recommend this game right now. ) Im rolling a 980 Ti Card with 32gb of ram. In the begining i could run this game smoothly. But now I can't even get 20 fps.. It's t.. im not sure what they done or what update screwed up. but even on very low this dont work.. but im not the only one that has this problem. When this fix this.. I will remove my negative review. I love this game. It's everything H1Z1 Is not. It seems to actually know what It want and the short time It's been in development is amasing how far they got. Now.. It do have problems.. Allot.. And some I hate so bad I broke a keyboard playing this game. Let's get to it. Things I love.. Well I love the amount of guns and attachments you can find. It's really nice. Many hours in and im still finding and using guns for the first time. I love firing the guns and the reaction from when you fire from when the bullet hit the target from when the target dies feels really nice. The cars feel quite nice when you drive them actually.. Way better then I expected. The map is huge. Things I hate.. The desynch.. It happens more often then it should. Lag. People sliding around. And everything is delayed. Get in to a car 2 sec after you press F. Pick up an items. About 1.5 sec delay after you press F.. it gets tedious as hell and many times It causes your deat. Boats.. They are useless.. Theres only one major river and the barrier always come from the coast. I dont see how or why one would use the boats. At any time. your exposed in them and they take like 15 20 sec to swim out to actually get one. Semi mode on all weapons as standard. Running in to a house chased by a bad guy. you pick up a gun slam in a mag and whoops your on semi. And holding down the trigger in a 3m CQC encounter just made you pop away 1 round. Why is automatic not the standard? Semi should be the one you switch to. Bullet dropp is also wierd. Some guns have almost no drop and others have riddiculus drop. You can zero down scopes so Its workable.The crate reward system feelt nice at a start but it's just plain stupid. Instead of having a store that allows you to buy the cosmetic you want. You can only use your winning coins to buy chests. And open them to get random cloth. This sounds good at first with the coins being quite easy to get. But the chests double in price each time you get them and you can get My first chest i got a red basic shirt. It looked just like the grey black White one you started with but red. And now to chance getting a pair of blue sneakers I must pay double. Then double then double. It's ing stupid.. Either keep the chest at a reasnoble price or give me a store so i can pick my stuff.. Im not paying real money to unlock chest and chance getting crap. I hate how It's a campers fest and if you go down get in to a house get a gun and notice on the map your deep in the zone and safe It means you will camp. Cause winning getting to top 10 or winning gives you allot almost 300 500 coins. But a kill only racks for maybe 30 50 points. So sure allot of kills add up.. But taking the risk dont outweight it. And many times I feel i go down quick notice 10 other guys came to the same town. Then it becomes camp fest in every house until where forced to leave. This becomes dull as . Cheaters.. Wow.. 24hours after it came out cheats came on. And you can notice it. Some people pull of almost impossible shots with guns not made to do it. But what I feel give it away Is when your 100% Super silent in a house.you camp it for 10min not making a single sound. And someome then rushes in and shoots exactly where your hiding even tho he had maybe 8 directions/doors/rooms to pick from. Also Im not sure if this is cheat but everything is loud. you move and make really loud sounds. Even when crouching makes no diffrence your still loud. Walking slowly makes no diffrence still loud as . Somehow tho people manage to go in to the house open the door. And run or sometimes sprint up in to my back without even making a fart. Im not sure if its a glitch or cheat.And last Parachuting. It's nice that you get to decide where you jump off.. But holy hell many times when im parachuting down It s up. You dont need to pull the chute out yourself just go down as fast as you can and at about 150m it goes out itself. But when your 10m or so from the ground he automaticly goes in to this slow glide state thats a pain to controll and this glitches sometimes and happens at 50m.. And that Everyone will have a gun by the time your down there with only your bare fists.. It's annoiying.. I presume most things I mentioned will be fixed.. If you like H1z1 King of the kill then you will love this. It's way better. Even with optimisation It works way better. But it has its problems. I say Buy it if you want.. I Dont want to recommend at this price tho.. They should asked for like 19 99 or something. Not 29 99.. It's almost as much or even more then some full games. Give this game some time to develop Buy now to support. Or pick it up cheaper at a sale or something. Your choice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-02,0,0,352,True,Recommended,Not too long ago I left this game a negative review but I have completely changed my mind. Sure this game can be furstrating but all competitve games are you just need to face the fact that if you are an average player you are not gonna win much at all so just enjoy the thrill and the gameplay you are expiriencing (which are amazing in this game)I bought this game in mid november and it was quite a mess then but the developers have done a lot to imrpove it. I'm getting way more FPS than I used to especially on the test servers.The gameplay is fluid fun and engaging. The maps (currently one in live version but the second one is up on the test servers already) are great and really fun to traverse and loot. If you have the pacience to deal with some bugs long texture loading times and minor server problems this game is a blast and is totally worth $30. GO ahead and buy it right now you will not regret it. It is especially fun with friends provides a bigger chalenge but it's easier with friends (got my first chicken dinner with my close pals just today)This game is big and abisious fun and hilarious with friends. It is far more serious than H1Z1 and less serious than DayZ which is a perfect spot for it.What are you waiting for? BUY IT!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you dont buy it you cant keep anything and you miss out on alot of XP grabs becuase you dont have the pass. so 30 for the game and 10 for the pass. They refuse to do what people ask if it doesnt make money. The game is slowly dying. Once another game comes out like PUBG you will see this game population drop by more then half again. This game was once king and has fallen into a a problem of not caring what anyone says but making money. I would wait to buy this game if you havent yet until you see ""mostly possitive"" in the veiws. until that day gones ill look to play something else but this trash",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-08,0,0,206,True,Recommended,Good game.Pros Good variety of weapons they can have attachments too. Fighting is beneficial (for loot) Hitboxes are pretty decent Often has updates Loot crates are high risk high reward which makes it fun and can change tide of game Fun custom games e.g zombie mode melee only sniper only etc. Large playerbase so find games almost instantly everytime (within 3seconds)Cons Poorly optimised (You will need good PC to run at constant 60+ fps) Tickrate not good. EU servers not very good In squads i think the circles close a little too fast When you connect to a server the minute countdown usually doesn't start until full or almost full wish it would start at 80 people connected whilst others still connect,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-28,0,0,379,False,Recommended,So ive been playing this game since August 2017 and every issue that i had about this game a year ago (version 1 was dissapointing) has been at least recognised with most issues being on the path to being completely solved.System Performance The FPS has increased from 70 FPS in 2017 to staying in the 90s almost constantly. I play on a variety of settings going from Very Low (foliage) to Ultra (View distance). The PC is budget with an X58 board from 2010 and an RX570. Just turn a couple of settings down and you'll be good.Servers What can I say? It now selects the closest server to you. This'll stop ping abusers and cheaters connecting to servers that are far away from them although it looks like the Chinese government is doing the job anyway. Ping's good here in the UK as long as you have a decent internet speed ofc.Weapons and Balance Huge weapon range even though some guns dont appear on all maps and there is now 5 variants of an auto firing 5 point rifle (M416 QBZ AUG SCAR L and G36C) which all play rather similarly. They got rid of random spawn L3 helmets which brings the bolt action snipers back into relevancy. Overall decent balance.Good game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After escaping the wall for a moment I ran into this dude with a gun. I mean why are there guns in this running game? So I boop him on the nose and take his gun in case there are any other crazies.

2017-03-24,0,0,343,True,Recommended,"Updated Review I am now over 270 hours into the game and I can say it has been a fun ride! Everything from clear foggy to rainy weather. You still have some issues lingering like chain link fences/stair railings that don't allow bullets to travel through them which can be frustrating if thats where the fight happens. Recently there has been a much larger flux of Asian players also connecting to the NA servers which can be a teamkill in the making for no reason. We are still in early access so remember that. A good practice is to also record your games if you do play by yourself so you can report any TK's that do happen if you matchmake because the ""Report"" button alone is just a button they require video evidence with sound.

And before you say ''oh it was because he was wearing armor"" just if your wearing a motor cycle helmet and you get shot you live because it proctets you from falling I mean even if it stopped it you would be stunned it would still hurt so next time you say its acurate that being shot with armour means all damage is gone get your freind get a gun get a helmet have that freind shoot you pointblank in the helmet and tell me it dosent hurt. And another thing about armor how come hen i get shot (in the chest mind you) with level 3 milltary vest i die almost in the 3rd shot? If its the level i asume it is (level 3A) it would stop it not go through and how i shot someone pointblank in the face lives gets shot from 30 feet away with an akm dead! Overall PUBG is a good game if you like games that make no sense and are bad sincerly Memes",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This ignores the other issues with the game like the developers abandoning the forums and player feedback and daily updates trying to patch their broken anti cheat system.I drop from plane I go through 5 buildings finding nothing but a few bags a shotgun and accessories for guns this is typical since hte past few updates when they seem to have halved the number of items that spawn probably to improve performance of the game. There is no ratio in drops of items to quadrant of map or what items drop just ""quality of item"" which can mean anything from silencer and decent gun to trash items.I find a car drive to next village (3 or 4 houses). Nothing in them.Drive to next village find some decent items. Drive to next village drive through a wooden fence the game crashes and asks me to report the error I can't as I need to rejoin the game.Load the game back up and resume blurry textures and empty buildings as I try to loot as the game loads. I'm impressed they manage to let me rejoin a game in progress I'll give them that.Drive to next buildings with the circle nearby loot the buildings.Next circle is on opposite side from this one.Drive car to exterior of current circle with a quick walk to next circle driving up to some buildings. Hit invisible wall in the grass with car.Get out as now I'm getting shot at and run to nearest building. Have to leave this building as circle is now drawing closer as I spend all my time healing after running to this building under fire.Run out door make it to the next circle just about but have taken significant damage from circle start healing behind tree get head shot which is the only part of this round I don't have a problem with lol.I quit Steam and even though PUBG is closed it says it is still waiting for the game to close to let me exit Steam...If this sounds like a game that you would be interested in please proceed to make a purchase.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-03,0,0,571,True,Not Recommended,Usually i dont write reviews but the rating for this game is way to high it diserves much lower ratings. First i know its an alpha stage game and i didend have high expectations graphics wise and i knew some random crashes could happen. It was mostly the gameplay that was entertaining for me. For the most part i had some enjoyable games except for when the early july patch came my game would run better for the first few games after that every game horrible lag and stuttering even after a reboot of my pc. The game becomes unplayable. Payed 30 euros for this way to high a price for such a poorly optimized alpha state game. Unplayable when the stuttering hits and no fix.

2018-12-24,0,0,18,False,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) Review12/24/18A fine Monday evening and I'm here to review one of the best battle royale experiences you can enjoy. Introduction PUBG is one of the best battle royale games on the market. It is affordable and very entertaining when I play Call of Duty Black Ops 4's Blackout mode I get the sence of fast paced action with the grapple gun and all that slidng. Hell you can sprint and slide while healing. To me PUBG is just a slower paced game the Blackout and sometimes some of us enjoy a slow paced battle royale every now and then. Weapons The weapons in PUBG are all taken from real life I see some weapons that I have studied in the past for example the Kar98k the German sniper rifle. The Kar98k in PUBG portrays a similar resemblance to the rifle in real life. The Kar98k is a great rifle that has almost no bullet drop honestly the rifle comes in handy in most maps especially Miramar. Maps As of writing this review 12/24/18 PUBG has released 4 maps that you could play in which are Erangel Miramar Sanhok and Vikendi.ERANGEL Erangel is a 8x8km map and is the first playable map that PUBG has released. Erangel has small buildings and has a ""foresty"" look in my opinion.MIRAMAR Miramar is a 8x8km map and is the second playable map that PUBG released. Miramar is a desert map that has large open areas great for sniper rifles.SANHOK Sanhok is a 4x4km map (rather then the usual 8x8km maps) and is the third playable map in PUBG. Sanhok is a rainforest map that has lots of grass (dear god) and great for campers in my opinion. Sanhok is one of the loot rich maps here in PUBG.VIKENDI Vikendi is the fourth playable map in PUBG that has a size of 6x6km. Vikendi had just been released recently for the PC and mobile versions of the game for PS4 and XBox Vikendi will be released later on January. Vikendi is the snow map and has minimal hiding spaces because many open buildings. The Vikendi map is located in the Adriatic Sea. Community The community in PUBG is quite big and still rising PUBG is quite popular in the streaming platform Twitch and streamers there have found to enjoy PUBG for example Shroud https //www.twitch.tv/shroud and DrDisRepsect https //www.twitch.tv/drdisrespect have their own custom skins in the Ghosted crate Shroud and the Speed and Momentum Crate DrDisRespect but have been unfortunately removed.SOURCES https //pubg.gamepedia.com/https //www.twitch.tv/",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-01,0,0,296,False,Not Recommended,Game itself is fine apart from the broken vehicles and gun physics. Obviously big problem with chinese cheaters which is obviously condoned by PUBG corp as they will do anything but stop it. Another problem is the proverbial middle finger given to consumers in the form of micro transactions. You grind away at the ame to earn ingame BP which you then spend on lootboxes with a maximum of 6 boxes per week which is fair enough. The problem comes when you don't get a say in which box your given as the majority of boxes require you to then go and spend $2.50 real money on a key to open it for a 99.99999% chance of getting a mediocore or trash item. From this I would highly recommend to not buy this game and instead go play fortnite for free,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-23,0,0,64,False,Recommended,I really love this game! The other day I managed 10 kills in a solo game and won which was great. I really find the overall feel of the mechanics which are very interesting and I enojyed learning how to control my character etc.. I noticed recently when the game had the update releasing the new map called Vikendi (Which by the way is a very detailed and well made map) that there was less lag less frame drops and I got killed by desync way less often. When I did get killed by desync it was a very minor effect on whether I died anyway. Overall after that update I think PUBG has just got way better and if anyone looks to buy this game I would definitely buy it and it's worth the 26.99 because even if it seems too much it's definitely worth the value.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If your new and just starting you got a lot too learn so try and hang in there if you get destroyed by people who been playing the game since it came out. I would recommend watching some tip videos on the game to help you learn the basics of the game. One tip I'll give because some people just completely ignore this if your playing in a third person server use third person to your advantage not only just in looking around corners but sometimes shooting in close quarters in third person is easier and faster and some of you might think that's obvious or you already do but I have heard some people say they don't ever do it and I don't know why I truly feel like it helps with certain weapons in full auto.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-11-04,0,0,1213,False,Recommended,"I love battlegrounds there are many other games out there that have preceded and stemmed from this But like Dr.Disrespect mentioned he feels this one has the best narrative game development. As volitile as he is. his game wisdom is about as on point as it gets. Gamers are a tough crowd. Often due to age immature attitude and self entitledness they will pass up a good thing because it isn't perfect. On stream chats it's always exhausting reading the moronic words of a guy saying a ""game is trash"". Although this game like everyone has had major/ minor issues I have been super impressed at how hard they have been working to make the game work. To use another comparision employees always seem to know how to run the company when in actuality if they were in the driverseat they would soon find out dealing with running the company and the PEOPLE is extremely hard to balance and tank the business. In the sam way pleasing a bunch of whiny gamers and still making the game pay has got to be ridiculosly hard. Ghost in the Shell ""sunsetted"" because they didn't listen to the players the top glorified players wewre clearly cheating and the in game purchase or earned rewards system was idiotic. PUBG in my opinion has listened to everything and gone to great lengths to make it happen. GITS was a fun game play and fairly accurate and satisfying but they turned the game on it head in efforts to retain gamers and it was unfortunately the last nail in the coffin Another thing that Dr.Disrepect mentioed is a game can have weak graphics atmosphere storyline but if the frag/ kill is satisfing and accurate it makes the game! ""Dsync"" seems to be rampant in all games of late and that is probablby the # 1 reason a player would abandon a game. How do you have fun if your shots don't hit where they are supposed to its a super fine line but on either side of it the game is great or the game is terrible. Now GITS had a good feel to it so I am kinda contradicting myself about ""kill feel"" but the game design and operatives became the problem so much so it overshadowed the accuracy. Oddly enough clean honest gamers will put up with a surprising amount of cheating. If they like the game it can be looked past but again there is the tipping point and Counterstike was one of them for me. Loved it but the ""very bad words"" cheaters ruined it. PUBG i was supposed to talk about right... PUBG has done crazy amount to remove that scum. Even getting reports back when you do report a $#!*bag cheater. and personal prefferance i have always be a 1 or 2 game kinda guy. My friends kids have a 100 games in there steam profile each with 3 hours of play shoot me in the head what a scattered unfocused existence. Really hoping PUBG goes the distance and never goes away new content is always a good thing but it cant be stupid fluffy crap. It has to appeal to the solid gamer Advanced Warfare COD with the jumping snipers rounds was curious but ridiculous. Maps are good and wow are PUBG maps incredible! So hopefully there are new maps and a continued thought out addition of guns. Quality content is what will win the day. Im not gonna edit to hard )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-13,0,0,914,False,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game. It had potential but the developers have made it clear they don't value player feedback and only care about making more money. Instead of fixing the bugs that have existed since Early Access they add new crates every month for people to pay for. Instead of giving players the option to play with weather effects (rain and fog) they COMPLETELY REMOVE all weather effects. Their anti hack software is a joke the items you get from paid and free crates are a joke the entire game has really become a joke at this point. I know people don't read reviews prior to buying games but if I can save even 1 person from wasting $30 then my time here is well spent.As of this post I've spent 610 hours on PUBG. Developers have had ample time to fix this game and they REFUSE to do it.

2018-08-13,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,I picked up this game recently and I thought I'd share my thoughts as a new player.This game has a lot of unseen potential to be the best but Bluehole keep on their game and their players. I think it's clear the devs care more about their unregulated gambling than the actual game itself and don't care about the players but about the money made evident by their port to the xbox while the game was still unfinished. I got the game because honestly it seemed pretty cool. I wanted a BR game that wasn't cartoony and wasn't AS as H1Z1 and in that case the game delivers. It allows for a more realistic tactical feel. Basically when it's good its GREAT but when it's bad Its horrible. That's about all the good I can pull out my for now. To cut it short this game is VERY broken and crashes FREQUENTLY I was only on my third game when my game stopped.... and closed without warning do NOT buy or gift until game is fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-10,0,0,32,True,Recommended,First time I've ever left a review but I just have to this time. Ive played quite a few matches now and there is one GLARING issue the hitboxes/damage. I have not found any info on how it really works but from my experience at least I can say it doesn't. One example I was on a roof in one of the main towns with an m16 and shot another player across town 5 times(blood spatters included) and he kept running. He eventually fired back and killed me in 2 hits (I had lvl 1 helm and lvl 2 police vest). The game said I was killed with the M16. SO WHY could I not take him out with 4 shots? Another instance is when I was firing through a door but my bullets were hitting the inside of the door even though my barrel was through a hole in the door. So really my main point is this game's damage and hitboxes are a bit messed up and will hopefully be fixed in the future. For now though I have to say if you easily get frustrated with being killed in t ways you might want to give it a pass for a couple patches. Rating for now (6/10) I'll give it a recommendation BUT be wary before you purchase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,83,False,Recommended,It's a great game. Knowing that you will most likely be seen before you see the enemy gives you a powerful feeling of paranoia. The mechanics are pretty good especially after the release. The problem is you will get killed by a hacker in 1 our of 10 games. Every game takes an immense amount of effort. Finding all of the guns you want and attachements only to be killed by a person who is inside a house aming at the ground and still shooting at you from 200 feet away and behind a wall is very frustrating however. I already find myself not wanting to play very much anymore and if they hacking doesnt go away in the next couple weeks I really do not think this game will have staying power.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-14,0,0,905,False,Recommended,"Addictive. Exhilarating. Fresh. Game is as fun to play on the first go around as the 1000th and every drop is a new experience. The progress the game has made since Alpha and upcoming features leaves me certain I'll be enjoying the game for a long while to come. I know there has been a huge wave of negative reviews due to hacks bugs and ""CHINA"" but I think the issues are overblown and the internet hivemind is just having a childish REEE moment. I see maybe one hacker every 50+ hrs of playtime. Major bugs (not weird minor inconveniences) are even rarer. The 'China' controversy doesn't make sense to me (just don't play with randoms?). Game no longer crashes since v1.0 release and game has made breakneck progress in a year. People who expect otherwise are just being naive and childish in my opinion. My only real gripe with the game is the tickrate. There are few things more annoying than playing gun roulette on initial drop only to find the player who dropped after you finds a gun first because you ran by something that hadn't loaded when you were there. And the 'smoothness' of the game right now feels like the old low tick CS1.6 CS S days hopefully PUBG will improve on that end at some point. Having a good computer and internet helps with this so I'd recommend you have over the minimum settings if you really want to enjoy it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unfortunatly It feels like a Hash of other games. Like back when Doom first came out. Ya Doom is amazing but it had so many knock offs like Hexen ect. It kinda feels like that. Yes I played Fortnite and who the hell kinda of bag comes up with fortnite. That game looks like Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft had a ing baby and was dropped on its head. As for H1Z1 Battle Royal. The game H1Z1 isnt even out yet. Been in Development for 4 years and hasnt budged yet they make this Cheap Crap called H1Z1 battle Royal. These Kinda games makes me really Hate Game Companies. Come up with something Original and Not a Nock off. I Dont like that you rack up so much BP and you can only spend on Crates as well as 00 31 second wait queue and its been 11 00 mins waiting. Overall Im giving this a 3.5/10 Dont Make the Mistake and waste money like I did. Its cool that it looks realistic but the over all BS with weapons and armor is ing stupid. Dont Fall for the money scheme called Crates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

DON NOT BUY THIS GAME If you buy this game there is the chance that you will get banned for nothing becuase of the false postives. You could get banned for the following1. network lag2.glitches in game (that have nothing to do with you)3. cheating (obvious)4.using discord5.Random bans due to false postivesOn top of that they wont listen to any appeal that you have. I applied for a ban appeal and when I did they told me that once banned you cant be unbanned probaly to try and get more money out of me. Which will never happen dont ever buy a blue corp game. !!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-01-10,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,I liked the concept of the game when it came out first. I wanted to buy it. Due to lack of money I had to wait for a long time. Finally I bought the game a few days ago. I was hoping that the game would run smoothly as I it was able to easily handle some recent titles like AC Oddessy Farcry 5 GOW 4 Shadow of tomb raider etc with high or ultra graphics settings a 720p. I used to get around 35 40 sometimes over 50 fps. But when I tried PUBG at first the game set the graphics level to ultra at 720p. I was happy to see that. But when I started a match it took very time to load the game. sometimes I was disconnected and sometimes the match started &amp I was stucked in the loading screen. Again when I face any in game player the ping was about 700ms or more. Rest of the time while running and looting the ping was around 60ms/70ms. I even tried to lower my setting but did not work. Next there is no bullet indicator on map like PUBG mobile. Even faced terrible glitches in Miramar and Vikendi map. Developers really need to fix this issues. They should add bullet indicator on map add an option to select server and fix the optimization of the game which is very bad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Most of the reviews are people with unrealistic expectations and a niche for complaining about everything.

So I needed to go whole alone to them on the other side of the bridge...I ran &amp ran in de grass without a weapon. I entered a small town where I picked up a smallhand gun.Then I suddenly hear the engine of a car. I check the window and see an squat on a small jeep fully loaded with guns lol...They don't see me but I can get to shots of and I het 2 bullets in one passenger his body. I could see that blood splatter from afar. They immediately turned back and I ran outside from the backdoor and just ran ran and hide in another house for 5 minutes while I could here engines coming by checking for me. When everything was silence. I ran to the bridge where I was supposed to meet up with my Squat. Everyone was already dead just one surviver left on the other side of the bridge but he was in need of help and wounded.So I dint trust the bridge I was sure someone was camping there. And I was right. Boom A sniper shot. I get on the ground in prone. And boom again right next to me I could hear the metal from where the bullet impacted not so far away from me. Then another bullet Boom! It hit me but I surived it. So I just went full sprint to a ramp on that bridge and jumped of the bridge in the Deep ocean below while I could clearly hear more Shots fired at me while I Jumped.I dive underwater to hide from the sniper that was hunting for me. Till i reached the other side then I proned my way to the grass undetected and there she was my teammate squat wounded on the ground. I help her and revive her but then I see in the horizon something moving its a guy with a clear long rifle about like 300 meters far away from me. BOOM!My teammate got a bullet right between the eyes. Blood everywhere. I pannick and try to shoot with my small gun on the sniper that clearly got me locked in his scoope. BOOM!! DEADOk guys this was awesome. Its so immersive and big and all runs so smoothly. To all the cry babies complaining about performance.

2017-10-07,0,0,376,True,Recommended,Even for Early Access this game is better than a ton of the trash AAA titles that are released every year. The random nature of the game means sometimes you'll have an easier time than others. The game is free from the camping meat grinder style game play the industry is used to crapping on us every single year.I really enjoy how no 2 games end up the same way. The weapons drops starting location and zone shrink all guarantee something different will happen.Update Negative reviews are likely due to hacking from Asia which has largely been dealt with in recent patches for most games. If you're good and you find yourself in the top 100k of any one game type you'll still see home hackers out there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-22,0,0,108,True,Recommended,TL DR Good game. Good devs. Some flaws but not game breaking. Hackers are rampant but being sorted. Gunplay could use some polish. Needs more maps soon. Worth the 30 bucks. Great game idea with a halfway decent implementation. Dev team is actively solving issues and deploying patches. Development has begun to steer away from adding features and has started focusing on bugs and polishing existing features. Cheating has become somewhat of a nuisance but is now beginning to be dealt with. Mass bans are happening regularly and I'm sure we'll see the cheating taper off after a while. Servers are unstable on the occassion but are overall pretty sturdy. Haven't had any disconnects myself. I have heard of some stability issues and desyncing but it seems to be a mostly isolated case and may not even have to do with PUBG itself. Gunplay in my opinion is far from polished. While it does the job it doesn't feel clean. New maps are on the way and not too soon. The existing map is massive and full of places I've never even touched but the landscape feels mostly the same in most locations. After 20 hours or so I felt like I needed another map. Overall this game is totally worth the price even in Early Access. It seems as though there is a large amount of effort being invested in this game and I can see a worthy product at the end of the development tunnel. I hope BlueHole continues to follow their current trend and we see some new developments in the near future. If you're on the fence about this one just do it. I don't believe you'll regret it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The gameplay was buggy and the servers were trash (still aren't great even at the supposed ""60 tick"") but it was great. the game started going down hill the more it approached 1.0 with less optimization and more new content that also just created more optimization problems and bugs.As every month after 1.0 goes by this game seems to go out of its was to dump on its patrons with less and less game updates and more cosmetic t. This game has become the new CS GO of skin garbage and blatant cheating. Go play fortnite it's a cartoon game but at least your not paying for it and its had more updates in the past 2 months than PUBG has had this year.

2017-06-09,0,0,444,True,Recommended,I will preface this review by saying this game is still early access and has a handful of optimization problems and a good bucket full of glitches and server problems. However this is hands down my favorite multiplayer shooter game right now. The matches are always tense edge of my seat thrill rides and very rarely do i feel cheated when i get killed. The learning curve is pretty short and the way the game is set up it is easy to play with any mixture of full blown aggression or stealth. As far as server issues go i have to say that i have never felt like they have ever been bad enough to make me feel like the game is unplayable. And that is saying a lot for a new early access game that has 3 million purchases and upwards of 100000 people playing at any given time. To top it all off every new update and patch just adds to the games. Optimization fixes new guns new gear and every piece of the game that has been changed has only been a boon and not a bust. 10/10 Will play a lot,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-01,0,0,283,False,Recommended,I've only got just shy of 70 hours booked on this game and it's already one of my favourite games of all time. The feeling of dropping into a zone with other players and rushing to find a gun and hunting them down is unreal. The looting and weapon modding/attachment experience is quick easy and fun and once you're in the top 5 players remaining your heart can't stop pounding your senses go into overdrive listening out for the silent thuds of a supressed weapon or the slow muffled footsteps of another player sneaking up on you constantly watching out for movement and keeping one eye fixed on the psychopathic and homicidal Blue Circle of Misery theres no other feeling like it. However there are constantly bugs but they never last more than a week. The team at Bluehole are quick to squash bugs and patch things up and improve the gaming experience. PRAISE THE PAN.I've since put plenty more hours into this game and even though people give it a bad rap I still love it ridiculously much. Highly reccomend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You then have to race to search the nearby buildings to find guns armour and equipment to help you survive. An energy wall slowly decreases in size forcing players to stay on the move in the ever decreasing area. This mechanic limits camping.The game aims for realism with real world guns vehicles physics and people only taking 3 4 hits to drop which makes the game have a constant tension. The tension keeps building as the game gets down to the last few players with a last man or squad standing end.Good graphics reasonable price regular updates and a huge player base (which means it is rare to wait more than a minute for a game). Option to play third person or first solo pairs or 4 person squads. All of this prior to the game leaving early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Shooting mechanics to be reworked/tweaked this game needs heavy optimization and I think they can go ALOT farther with their game design (little by little make it more dynamic.

I would say 8/10. optimization is a mixed bag my pc is 3 years old but PUBG runs perfectly fine. but I know some friends of mine who have top of the line PCs and they receive frame drops. recommend playing this with some friends but being top10 in a solo match makes your heart race like no other.

2017-05-16,0,0,45,True,Recommended,I would honestly really like to recommend this game but there are WAY too many potential game breaking issues (as in it'll ruin any possibility of this game becoming as much of a household name as CSGO or TF2). The hit detection is beyond broken for a start. I'm sorry If I sound salty here but I don't appreciate that another player and myself can be standing completely still (I have a crow bar and he has fists) and he'll win the fight because only about half my hits actually register. Yes this was a thing that actually happened. This goes for guns as well though that's remedied by the fire rate of most guns and is made even less noticeable when you have teammates who are helping yout out. There's also starting to be a cheater problem. I've had more than a couple of instances where I'll jump out of the plane go to a very specific spot (whilst checking around me for anyone else also going for that spot) be the first to drop down on top of and walk into a building to get gunned down by a dude who somehow got there first and had time to find and equip level 3 armor with a shotgun and an M16A4. Before you ask no. I didn't report him as I was too off to pay attention to the killfeed to get the gamer tag of the cheater (as there's no in game player list) and I didn't feel like hunting down the seperate website you have to visit to report people as there's no in game way to report.Like I said there's a lot of issues that could be potentially game breaking though I'd go as far as to claim that they'd be brand ruining if they're left unchecked. The devs are open and honest about what they're working on which is good at least. I'll gladly change my review once they fix at least the hit detection issue but I can't reccomend it in its current state. If you really want to play it then go ahead and get it with the knowledge of the rage you'll eventually experience. If you're not sure I'd say to wait until later. If it goes on sale then go for it. $30 for a very early access game is a bit much imo. I say very early access because I wouldn't call this anywhere close to being complete.Edit I'm fully aware that all my issues could be resolved fairly quickly because of the early access nature of the game and the fantastic support of the devs however I still stand by my criticisms as early access isn't a sufficient excuse for these types of problems. These problems hinder the ability of the community to figure out other issues with the game which in turn prevents propper feedback on those other issues.Edit The most recent update that they did fixed my hit detection issue and now the majority of the times that I get bent over it feels like it was my own fault/ bad luck rather than the game actively screwing me. I'm not sure if this is the case across the entire board but it's fine for me. As true to my word I now recommend it. Even the cheater issue doesn't appear to be a thing anymore (for me at least).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-11,0,0,56,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN's Battlegrounds is the most successful take on the battle royal genre as of May 2017. It's still in early access yet it is very fleshed out and addicting. Your average match involves just the right amount of fast paced action and strategy in a fully open and high quality play area that remains fun whether you are a loner or otherwise. Genuine skill based competition (and a moderate amount of RNG) means that this game isn't for the feint of heart but still remains accessible to the public.Just remember to turn down the volume at the beginning of every round or get your finest recorder and play your heart out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,586,False,Not Recommended,Ever since the game left early access cheaters and hackers have been rampant.

The game is fun. I'm not chinese so not spammed with ads. When I watch a streamer I'm not trying to get in his game. Funnily enough I haven't been banned for stream sniping. Go figure. 2mill peak players. You'll never queue long for a game. You decide if you want to slug it out or play a long game. The matchmaking is surprisingly pleasent (going squad solo is completely reasonable about 50% of my hours have been doing just this with a couple of top10 finishes!)I prefer FPP but worry people wont be able to change from 3rd person which will split the community (people from the start in 3rd and newcomers drawn to 1stperson).

2017-05-03,0,0,243,True,Recommended,I bought the game a few days back and it's safe to say that I'm hooked!I love the concept and how this company made this with the feedback of the community.Good things You can play solo duo of squad (3 or 4) which in my opinion is great for playing with friends have had a lot of fun in squad play. The amount of gear you need/find is perfect everywhere I drop out of the plane I'd manage to get all the weapons and medic stuff I need. Weapons are well balanced imo. Bad things The latency to some players is horrible and you will see that many of your shots won't do jack on these guys still they will be able to hit you when in cover.Not going over the optimalisation because everyone already has. My friends randomly disconnect of the game quiet often.. but you can just start a new game!Overall I'd recommend buying the game if you have a decent gaming rig. (I've got a i7 4770k 16b 1800 ram &amp a Gtx 1070x and getting overall 70fps on high). If you don't you might want to wait till the game get's a better optimalisation.Good fun with friends sometimes a bit laggy but I'd still recommend it (8.5 10).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-11,0,0,1797,True,Recommended,"Don't let the PUBG haters steer you wrong!This game is worth every penny! I am running my settings all on ultra and although I'll admit sometimes the environmnet will need to catch up with my computer it rarely takes long for it to do so. I have just now been experiening minor server errors because of the major increase of player activity. These clowns who have been seeing it longer probably have dinnosaur eggs as computers. I have been playing for a few months now and have yet to experience any of these so called ""ban hammers"" from the Devs. I've come to the realization that if you aren't a you don't get treated like one. However there are some fixes that need to be addressed like EVERY EARLY ACCESS game (I swear people forget this game is still in BETA!). Most of the complaints I have like vaulting walls getting graphics to load instantly changes of weather in game and more maps are already being addressed. One thing I would like to see is more uses for the ingame currency you acquire for surviving longer. The crates are kind of a rip. I only buy them in hopes of getting something rare to sell on steam. If you want a game that is a butt load of fun with or without a group PUBG is the one to try out. The rush is great! The play is Great! Gun fights are Great once you get the hang of it. If you wanna puss out hunker down in a building somewhere. If you wanna fight run the fields and catch someone offguard. People wanna tell you how to play but those types are the ones that clean DP.

You act like it's p2w when it doesn't effect the game in ANY negative ways other than make some people look better than others ""note that you can find these items in houses the fact that they're permanent unlocks change very little it's not like they're giving away ghillie suits"" stop always looking at the negatives like the pessamistic individuals you are. This is also a great way to get the market for items up and going some games take years to get reasonable prices on items this helps promote the market and help people understand the reasonable prices. Of course people won't be giving for charity but they will be giving to charity I'm not saying anyone who buys a key for the sole intention of getting their cosmetics are a good person but initially their own wants are giving to those less fortunate look at the bright side folks no need to hate for what you people assume to be a ""mistake"" on their part just look at the bright things they do instead of trying to cover the light with an umbrella.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is only $30 and it has allowed me enough replayability that I have consistently since its release. There are plenty of issues with it many issues. The game will sometimes break maybe one patch will fix a lot of problems but then another one will come along and cause more. There are many cheaters that play the game and that can cause some problematic experiences.At the end of the day though this game gives you a chance to display your mettle against others and along with your friends. This game pits you in a battle with very good vehicle and gunplay in a format that is exhilerating and one that rarely showcases the same events more than once.

2018-06-29,0,0,1036,False,Not Recommended,Gameplay is fun and unique. One of the most exciting games I have ever played. That being said PUBG is the most buggy game I have ever played. It crashes constantly and it was more stable in early access than it is in 1.0 form. I can't recommend it because I can no longer open the game because it crashes everytime I try to open the game. A lot of people will say that you have to change certain settings to have it be stable to play. No. The game should work especially if you've spent money purchasing it and buying anything in game. A free game I've installed that has been out for only a few weeks runs better on my 1 year old system than PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-26,0,0,473,False,Recommended,So...pubg. Pubg is a game that I have very mixed feelings about.On the one hand it s literally one of the greatest multiplayer experiences to ever exist. No other game really does what pubg does...as well as pubg does. There are lots of knock offs but they all fail to recreate the same feeling.On the other hand the game is very deeply flawed frustrating and heading in a questionable direction.All in all I have to say my opinions are more positive than negative hence the positive review but again my impression of it is heavily mixed.So the game itself. You have giant maps full of cities country sides forests/jungles rocky cliffs etc. They are 8x8km in diameter with the newest one being smaller at 4x4. The bigger ones are larger than a fallout game or skyrim possibly on par with planetside 2 s maps. You have 100 players dropping in and the last one to survive wins. Players fight with anything they find at their disposal a wide array of military grade weapons vehicles even a frying pan. Honestly the thrill I get from playing this game is nothing like I experience in other games. Late game fights can be tense and cause your heart to pound. They re so good you ll be shaking when you re done from the adrenaline. Winning or even coming close to winning is an extremely satisfying experience I just don t get in other games. And I play TONS of shooters. But the thing is .the game is flawed. It was made by a small indie company that did not expect it to be a hit. That said the game has a lot of technical debt to pay. Performance is a mess. People with top end computers struggle with it on ultra and even computers capable of running any other game maxed out might need to settle for high or medium settings. If you want high frame rates you might even want to play on low or very low. Stuff takes a while to render and load at the beginning performance struggles as a result. There s a lot of lag in the game. People die when they shouldn t die get kills when they shouldn t get kills. What happens on your screen isn t necessarily what the game decides what happened. This can lead to lots of salt and rage.The game is very buggy. You might be cruising around in your vehicle only to tip over and randomly explode for no reason. You might tip over your vehicle get out and then it will magically try to up right itself by rolling over on top of you in the process. You might literally get launched across the map (they might have fixed that one I hope they fixed that one). Stuff sometimes doesn t render properly. The game is full of bugs and lag.The game also struggles due to its own success. It now has this massive community and attention from all of these professional gamers but many of them are souring on the game. They petition the devs to implement changes and then those changes tend to make the experience worse. There is a real demand in the community to make the game more fast paced. This is because streamers play fast paced and people want to emulate streamers. So instead of playing tactically people rush right into fights die early and then the people left complain about the game being too slow. Then they try to change the game to appeal to people who want it fast and it ruins it for those who want it slow and people get alienated from the game. And then you got the esports problem. This game is attracting a lot of attention from esports communities despite it not being particularly well suited for esports due to lots of RNG elements and the aforementioned technical debt and the devs start listening to an insular small extremely vocal group of minority pro gamers who want the game to become more hardcore. So they change the recoil patterns make them harder and then you got these esports players who like it that way despite it alienating more casual players. That said these pressures the devs face from the community complicate things because I feel like they shift pubg away from its roots as a slow tactical game to a more fast paced twitch based shooter despite it being poorly suited for that from the ground up. PUBG seems to be at a crucial point where it may turn its back on its roots that made it successful to pursue the whims of more vocal elements of the community who seem to want it to be something different than it actually is. If it were a completely different game say like what islands of nyne is trying to be it might work. In order to make the game fast paced and twitch heavy the game needs to be designed around that from the ground up. Movement has to be smooth. Instead it is sluggish. Maps need to be designed for fast paced combat instead outside of the newer one they aren t. The gun mechanics need to be more arcadey not realistic. Stuff needs to actually load in and render properly at the start of the round which they often don t because of the massive technical issues that are inherent to the game as it is designed. This game works when it s slow. It works when people play tactically and treat it as a realistic shooter. If they hide and use cover and spread out and try to survive as long as possible. But the second you try to make it fast paced and appeal more to the crowd who wants deathmatch and fast paced esports the game falls flat on its face. And that s where the game seems to be heading and in my opinion it may be the downfall of the game.Regardless before you think that I m gonna rip on pubg and give it a negative review despite all of this complaining I m not. Because pubg actually looks really good once you start comparing it to the rest of the battle royale genre. The two other major successes in the genre are arcadey cartoony games with a relatively fantasy setting that just doesn t do it for me. And most games I ve played that go for the more realistic approach just feel soulless at best or are flat out bad at worst. Honestly playing these games and coming back to pubg pubg is like 90% of the way there. It s a great game. It just needs a heck of a lot of polishing and it needs to stop trying to be something it s not to appeal to players who would be better off playing other games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-17,0,0,229,True,Recommended,awesome game. it is not perfect though and does have bugs that need to be weeded out but currently as it is right now its very fun and gives great entertainment.If someone gets easily frustrated this may not be the game for them. you will end up dying from stupid mistakes or just get flat out unlucky or someone will catch you completely off guard. Playing with friends will reduce the frustration.new players should expect to have a difficult time adapting to the game. in my experience the difficulty makes the game very rewarding once you win the first match and when u start consistently getting into the top 10 20some of the vehicle physics need to be worked on. for example you may hit something pretty hard but take little damage and then next you hit something while you are not going as fast but take higher damage. also has been instances where i have jumped out of a vehicle but my movement becomes super slow cannot run for a few seconds.one of the things i like is you can choose to start off passive or aggressive. want intense action from the start? drop at a place that is popular to drop to based on the flgiht path of the plane. would you rather be more passive and/or play it safe you can jump out and go to a spot that is less likely to have other players going to it.majority of my experience with this game is playing squad first person with friends. if i only played this by myself my experience could of been less favorable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-09,0,0,1530,False,Recommended,I usually don't write reviews but because I already have over 600 Hours in game I felt compelled to. I've mostly enjoyed the game for the months leading up to 1.0 release. I have found that I really enjoy the Battle Royale genre and the feeling of success being the last man standing out of 100 players in a match. Overall I have enjoyed the gaming experience that PUBG has to offer. I love everything from the range of available weapons and attachments to the unique combat situations that arise throughout a round of play. Once I started winning more frequently however I noticed I was running into more and more cheaters (mostly Chinese players joining NA servers). Now whether or not this is just bad luck or PUBG's MMR system I don't know. What I do know is that it has completely ruined the game for me and caused me to not even want to play anymore. It is near impossible to join a Third Person server without having multiple cheaters in the game. I enjoy TPP because it is what I'm used to from my days in H1Z1 and it's a different look from traditional FPS games like CS GO. I realize that people are reporting less of a problem with cheaters on FPP servers and I'll probably have to make the switch at some point. But if my preference is to play third person I should be able to do so without the fear of having multiple cheaters in the game with me. I find that my play style has changed considerably from what it was before knowing that there is almost guaranteed to be someone with an unfair advantage in any game I drop into. The addition of the replay system has only confirmed my suspicions. Most people don't even try to hide it. Before I would play more in the open and take most fights I would encounter. Now I find myself running from fights and moving from building to building to not get shot in the head from halfway across the map by a player with a SCAR aiming over their shoulder. It absolutely just sucks. I'm not normally one to complain about anything hell I could care less about desync and subpar netcode at this point. But from someone who used to really enjoy playing this game...please please...get rid of the cheaters and give ALL OF US the peace of mind to know that we have a fair chance at winning any game we queue up for.

DONT waste your time on this game when you could spend the time on much more fufilling game experiences like.....anything but this one..3/10 overall final revieweverything past here is OLD...In theory 10/10. right now 5/10. Every part of this game needs work combat feels very cumbersome and the sensitivities are totally ed up however it plays well considering how bare it is now. Would like to see this game get the treatment and upbringing it deserves. Okay for now with miles and miles of room for improvement.UPDATE okay so here we are...awhile after 1.0. Asian players have invaded NA servers and make the game unenjoyable (i would say unplayable but F***ing over a full squad of them is too entertaining). I am going to end up with hours upon hours of replay footage consisting solely of asian players where they dont belong doing the dumbest things all while not speaking a lick of English...or spanish...or french (i mean its a north american server shouts to the french canadians eh!) so...do the math. current state 6.5/10i recommend the game to anybody who can have fun with a game having (considerably) polished combat and tactical movement. dont buy if you like devs that dont listen to overwhelming demands from the community and reframe blame....we arent racist we want to be able to communicate as a team and enjoy the game.update UPDATE here i am countless hackers in game yet i cant play....servers too busy? probably because the world found out that you condone hacking.....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The Design is as mediocre as it can be in this type of games a big and at the same time empty island with copy/pasted houses and evergreen forests filled with boilerplated guns like M16 or AKM. Gameplay OOOOOOOO Eh it's a very boring even more boring than Arma 3 camper battles. A group of 90 players land on a large map and then try to kill each other no respawns or concessions given. It's a heaven for said campers gankers and regular DayZ players. Miserable and easily forgettable gameplay that bursts with boredom to put it briefly. Stability and Online OOOOOOOOO It's pathetic. I've had 2 crashes in a row in just 10 minutes after starting my first match. The optimization is also awful it sometimes drop down to 39 and even when it shows 60 some really annoying stutters hold their ground. The online for this game is HUGE for some awkward reason though so finding players for a match takes literally a couple of seconds. Overall 2.5/10 This overpriced excuse for a game is a joke. It's not even close to being ready for an early access release. And then there are lots of other of these ""battle royale"" type of games that are much cheaper with some of them even being just a free gamemodes from the workshop so it's not that crucial to pass PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS by. and YES 38 minutes of playtime is more than enough since that gewgaw is just a primitive shooter.

2018-06-10,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,"Game started off as really good. It was fun and interesting to play. Now it's just died out. The devs forgot they actually need to implement gameplay to compete with the market. As much as you want to give it Fortnight actually has gameplay and doesn't even cost anything to play. This game runs terrible too. I could forgive it if it actually looked good too but it doesn't its just horribly unoptimized. The devs want to implement a loot crate and key system for cosmetics (I guarentee they'd give you weapons with these crates at the start of the game if they knew they could get away with it though) with some of the worst drop chances I've ever seen in a game that already asks for $30 to start. The start of the games is pretty fun just running around in a Hunger Games competition but after the first 50 players die (and they die quickly because most of them are just bots trying to get random drops) the game devolves and just isn't interesting. Most of the time I gear up and get stuck wondering ""what do I do now?"" until I get sniped from across the play zone. Hackers are also a huge problem in the game. To put the cherry on top the devs have lost it at this point. They ushered in a new type of gamemode and it's good don't get me wrong but they seem to think they have a copyright on it and go after anybody making something similar. This hurts both the industry and the gamer. With no competition this game would have no reason to get better until it inevitably dies out.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-14,0,0,1037,True,Recommended,I have played this game for just shy of 800 hours since launch. It has slowly been improving the game is enjoyable with friends but pretty tilting at times playing solo with some of the issues that happen server side. I would highly recommend buying this game if you have friends who play it and they want to duo or squad. I am really hoping that when 1.0 launched (fingers crossed) that it will be a better game that brings players back. With it being an early access game I give it a higher benefit of the doubt that it will get better. I will be revisiting this review once 1.0 is launched (again fingers crossed). At the time being I will give it a 6/10 for server issues but a 9/10 for fun with friends.I will say I recommend this game to friends who want to play just because it i s so much fun with friends. Take it with a grain of salt some of the issues are very wide spread and sometimes hinder game play. That is why with 1.0 coming out I am hoping these issues are fixed. If not I will be changing this whole review to negative.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,0,0,981,False,Recommended,Disclaimer I run the game on my desktop ( i7 8700k GTX 1080ti 32gb RAM ) and my laptop ( i7 7700hq GTX 1060 16gb RAM ) so this review might not be representative of the ''average'' gamer who's playing this game. At the time of this review I have about 800 hours of playtime. First of all yes there is some bugs but I haven't experienced many maybe I'm just lucky. Most if not all of the bugs I have experienced weren't ''gamebreaking'' either. I also believe that if you've played 200 + hours of a game even if it pisses you off afterward you got your money worth. And with PUBG no worries you'll get your money worth of in game time ! There's so many locations playstyle and weapons to master that you won't be bored of the game easily.As far as performance go for me it's fine but older systems with no SSDs will struggle. It's a ''recent'' game and it requires recent hardware for the experience to be enjoyable. I personally wouldn't play the game if I didn't have at minimum a GTX 1060 6gb or a RX 580 8gb. The game also struggles on ''weaker'' single/quad cores processors like AMD's Ryzen line up for example ( the lower tiers one if you have a 1700 and above you'll be perfectly fine ).This is the kind of game like it's predecessor arma 2 and 3 where you need great hardware to fully enjoy your experience but weaker hardware will run the game it might not be the best experience however. I ran the game on a secondary laptop with a i7 6500u and a 960m 4gb to give you an idea.The ''crates'' debacles personally doesn't affect me if I want a skin I just buy it from the market but there's not needed I also got a couple from my Amazon prime subscription ( which translate to twitch prime ). I think this game is the best battle royal available currently and it's definitely worth playing. Now maybe some people will disagree but to each his opinion.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,882,False,Not Recommended,bought the game in early access for 25 but at it's actual stage is not worth a penny since is full of cheaters cannot play 1 single game without any cheaters in it just a waste of time(time and money),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-11,0,0,414,True,Not Recommended,has a decent amount of bugs but all are small and they don't affect the gameplay that much and its nothing more than a game in early access should have. the real problem lies in the amount of rng and core mechanics of the game. without any way to guarentee getting yourself a competent weapon in a match a large amount of the games you play you just feel helpless and waiting for someone with range to pick you off as you move through the map and make it to the final circle. third person mechanic combined with the reliance on sound almost encourages campers to find a good camping spot and not move an inch. and even if the person isnt camping stale gameplay is bound to happen as rushing/advancing enemies is 10x harder than defending the rush as someone can just hide behind a wall and peek around it without risking their safety. and just pop out on their terms with full sight of their opponent giving them an easy free shot instead of the odds being closer to 50/50. air drops will drop the best gear in the game but due to their random flight paths and drops not being easily trackable trying to actually persue the best gear isn't even worth it unless it drops right next to you or you're already on your way to the location of the drop. the game is about 75% luck and then 25% being good at their mechanics. their trying to make the game more focused on first person which in theory would make it more like other first person shooters out there and easier to learn and be good at but the way the controls feel right now it feels terrible and nobody is interested in the first person ques at the moment. its going to take them a long time to clean up the gameplay and make it feel better to play if they want people to take it seriously. the highs you get in this game are like no other especially if you have a group of 3 other friends you can play with and joke around and dont take the game too seriously. but for 30 dollars i can positively say i do not recommend this game for new people interested in it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-10,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Fun yet highly overhyped definitely not worth the full price until at least the game is better optimised and most bugs and glitched are fixed. The game is fun for the first few matches and after winning a match the player will feel an amazing surge of excitement. However there are far too many bugs and problems with the game that become more and more clear as you play the game. The most irritating problems with PUBG are the cheaters and lag. There are countless times where after shooting an entire magazine into an enemy does not kill them because the server was not able to keep up and as a result the enemy kills you before you can reload. The game is fun. However the game still poorly optimised has yet to properly deal with the cheaters and fix the netcoding of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They're greedy and sue their competition in South Korea just to have a chance at winning. paid progression system in a $30 dollar game w/ lootbox based microwagers. If you want to play battle royale here's four different games made by people not nearly as much of an as Bluehole and PUBG Co Fortnite (not the game for me but I can see the appeal. Will recommend because it's free honestly).Realm Royale (Fortnite but without building and some small class based combat that's at least something different. Also free).Totally Accurate BattleGrounds (It's 5$ made in the span of 3 weeks and has no right to be as good as it is for an April Fool's joke).Hunt Showdown (Yeah it's in early access and a bit buggy. But the concept just has so much more variety to it than your standard BR. There's actual character progression permadeath and even an objective to complete rather than being the last one alive. NPC enemies are actually a threat and bosses are are a great idea that just needs some polishing. Bit pricey but worth a try).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,79,True,Recommended,This is a genre defining game that you should play. Nothing beats the adrenaline rush of trying to survive against 99 of your best enemies in squads or in solo play. It's a little rough around the edges but I'm confident that the game will be mirror polished by the time it exits Early Access. The developer has proven to be communicative aggressive about cheating and deeply interested in the competitive / Twitch scene. This has all the makings of being the next really big thing.Like many games there are now some microtransactions for completely optional visual stuff that has absolutely no gameplay value whatsoever. It's great if you're into that sort of thing and utterly ignorable if you're not. Personally I like the skins and such but if it's not your cup of tea (or if you simply don't like games with pay to win aspects) you don't have to engage with them at all to be on a level playing field.Overall it's probably the most engaging game I've played since League of Legends with its immediate appeal high mastery curve and extreme watchability.

But the devs have proven again and again that they will never listen to feedback and they focus on their own greedy agenda. The game is a Flop a desync mess and has the worst netcode and optimization that the gaming community has ever experienced.

2017-11-04,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,My review for this game used to be positive but I think I've changed my mind the large amount of negatives definitely outweigh the small amount of positives. You're about to hear a review which you've definitely heard before but I think it's necessary that everyone that thinks the same way put up the same review so here are my thoughts on Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.I could see what they were going for a tactical shooter were players could go rogue in solo mode or play in teams in duo or squad mode. But when you're playing squad with a bunch of kids they just don't understand the game and they wander off and get themselves killed. So it's better to just play solo by yourself but even there you will find problems. Hackers! Hackers everywhere (here come the memes). Remember that kid who wandered off on his own and got killed you know who probably killed him a hacker there's just so many of them now hardly anyone can play the game without finding one of these hackers. If they actually had an anti cheating software on this game (at the time I'm writing this review there is none) it would actually stop a lot of the hackers but since it doesn't hackers all get onto the game and kill a bunch of people to feel like they've won something which they shouldn't have getting an anti cheating software would also make it a somewhat better game but they still would have to fix a number of things such as Sh**ty Servers (you need to live in Asia or Europe or have the worlds best internet connection) Sh**ty Performance (you need the world's best gaming computer to play this despite what the spec minimum is) False stream sniping bans (basically if you kill a streamer EVEN if you didn't know they were one you get banned /) Kids squealing and screaming (I know this isn't fixable it's just plain annoying) Flimsy shooting (To me the shooting feels strange and flimsy I don't like it)Even with these all fixed they probably still would have even more things that they need to fix. I don't like this game at all believe it or not I used to enjoy it but now I realise how bad it is. So Player Unknown's Battlegrounds I'm afraid gets a thumbs down from me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-31,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,Here's my honest take for this game.PROS 4 big mapsWeapon mods with combinationsFun gameplay. What else can I describe? It's pure battle royale game.CONS LootboxesServers are too busy. CrashesSoundtracks are terribleCrates within lootboxesCheatersCluster UI design. The fonts are ridiculous same with sound effects.Toxic fanbaseCrappy company. Hey hey listen here instead of fixing their crap or optimization they've once put effort to put a camel toe on female underwears (test servers). I'm no feminist or SJW or some shet but don't they have anything else to do rather pull this dumb shit?Cringe name. One of the worst triple A video game names I have ever seen in my life.Forces you to play Squad by automatically enabling that in the lobby without ever knowing you're on solo.Lack of player costumization. Like... Do you ever wonder why Fortnite is a very success game? Because skins. Players can pay like 10 dollars to get their battle pass and get skins along the way by doing challenges plus some rewards even have in game currency. That's amazing. This trash however doesn't. Hell even H1Z1 gives out free lootboxes and free cool clothes unlike this trash. Hell if you want to change your player's face hair (now it free) gender you'll need to pay in game currency and it's about... probably 2 days of full game time to have enough. How pathetic is that?Unpolished and the maps are unnecessarily LARGE. For maps this large I think it's about 250 PLAYERS to be enough to fit in these maps. It just takes forever to walk to another tower. Even with some vehicles.Uneccesary match timer. Wait 60 seconds after we got all the players like just what the why?Bad cheap a s s engineVery bad optimization. Check my setup in my profile if you're curious. But I don't think it matters because the game is very stiff.Robotic animations and movements. It's so unsatisfying it's horrible.Objects and doors are awkwardly misplaced4/10The game needs alot of improvements a ton of bugfixes and imo the biggest is to give the players (who BOUGHT IT and mostly paid COSMETICS on MARKET) some respect. Give them some free skins.I do not recommend this game to anyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The ""boots on the ground"" aspect of the game makes it good in the sense that it is predictable and the vehicles can make you go across the map quicker however this repedetive pattern makes for a quite repetetive and boring experience in the long run.

You can get so incredibly unlucky that you can't even find a damn pistol and the guys nearby have AK's. This game has such a small skill cap it's sad. I'd rather go back to CoD than keep playing this garbage.Let's not forget the fact that if you're outside the circle you have to stop looking for weapons and start running right away or the blue zone will just kill you before you even get to fight anyone.

It killed the buzz completely and I wasn't going to address this game any further till something got sorted out. And while they haven't region locked China like everyone's been asking I will say that the ping locking in the recent update has indeed changed DRASTICALLY how my experience has been. I dove back into it with a few pals after the update and the amount of China and hacks has decreased dramatically and it's been fun as hell again for me. PUBG is taking the right steps into fixing one of their biggest issues and when I say fixed I mean it has been fixed quite well. It ain't perfect but it definitely got me right back into the game. So if ya haven't picked it up since the newest update please give it a go again.

2017-08-21,0,0,23,True,Recommended,I have heard both good and bad reviews for this game but I cannot deny that above all this game is FUN! it's a weird brand of fun though and I know it's not for everyone ( different strokes for different folks and all that ) sure it has it's problems but it's still in it's infancy and it's already massively popular for good reason. Don't be mislead by those that condemn this game for it's micro transactions ( for the love of pete it's only for cosmetic items like t shirts and ball caps ) and besides the developers are only following the business patterns of the industry and you can't fault them for wanting to get paid for a product they are selling. If you don't want to spend your parents hard earned money on crates you dont have to. The idea of the game is solid fresh and above all FUN! ( there's that word again you spoiled mouth breathing trolls remember fun yeah? ) it's a no hold barred shootfest across a massive island that has more character and soul than anything triple A developers in the industry are pumping out every six months and it doesnt even have a single player campaign you loot scoot and shoot your way to an ever decreasing playing field all the while looking over your shoulder for the guy or gal that's going to fill you full of lead or run you over with a jeep or pummel you with a frying pan Samwise Gamgee style or blow you up with a frag grenade heck you could even have the misfortune of being hit by one of the many random artillery strikes that occur all across the map to discourage camping sure sometimes i last as long as a 16 year old boy losing his virginity on prom night but you can just back out once you're dead and go at it again (like a 16 year old boy on prom night) rinse and repeat over and over again until you've had enough punishment and call it quits (or rage quit if your mum doesn't or didnt hold you enough).the one issue I personally have the biggest problem with is no mic mute. So for the first minute or so while you wait to deploy your auditory senses are treated to the chorus of spastics who will wail curse rock out attempt to rap use every curse word in the english (and other) language eat thier mics call eachother homosexuals proclaim that *insert name of country here* is number one tell eachother to shut up and generally be belligerent and abusive (so par for the course for online gaming). There are other minor issues but my current PC is only able to run the game smoothly on low graphics settings and it still looks and plays very well never has a surefire kill been stolen from me due to lag or glitches of any kind. I was skeptical of this game for a while which is why it took me so long to purchase and play but i have no regrets about my purchase and i only have high hopes for the future of this fine peice of electronic entertainment. 9/10 I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a good contemporary shoot em up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Don't purchase this game go for the free version (Fortnite Battle Royale).The devs are not ashamed to make cosmetics drop rates as low as 0.01% for the rarest items to force completionists to purchase those skins for hundred of dollars on the marketplace.If you consider the fact that the newer lootboxes require a 2.5 euros/dollars to open and that a player can only open a maximum of 6 lootboxes per week and that there is only a 40% chance of getting the lootbox you want (except of course if you purchase one from the marketplace) it means it would take 80 years to get a specific rare item from one of the newer lootboxes and 1500+euros/dollars for the keys. And that's just an average.As everyone in the review section I paid for that game. We deserve all of its content. All I regret is that I did really support the devs on that one.

I enjoy the option to go into the 100 person battle alone or with 1 other person or with a squad of 4.The need to keep moving to the circle keeps it interesting and games can still last a while.The controls/ movement could use work but this is an early access game so i imagine it will only get better.Driving feels alright a bit clunky but works. The guns all feel pretty deadly and can take someone down in 1 3 shotsI would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys survival/battle royale type games who can also be patient to wait for this game to fullfill its potential.The only bugs i have is when im loading into a match sometimes the loading screen stays for much too long after the game has already started or it just stays and never stops loading.

It has very good gunplay and is lots of fun with friends driving around and having fun. For the minimal amount of content that it provides it dies very quick in comparison to fortnite which is updated almost once every week.

2017-09-09,0,0,453,False,Not Recommended,PUBG was a game that was amazing in every way except execution.You could find thousands of reviews going over what went wrong but I'll just stick to a single thing the clothing. I'm all for customizable features but incorporating them with the steam market was a mistake of ungodly proportions. This invited people to farm for crate drops as much as they could (AFKing then later on blatantly cheating) to get as many clothes as they can and sell them on the steam market for steam bucks (which was funneled in a variety of ways to real income). This pushed out a lot of honest players and by the time Bluehole got around to dealing with cheaters (like placing soft region locks after calling its playerbase xenophobic) it was too late. You're left with a game mainly inhabited by cheaters bots and the occasional dummy like me who thinks the game can be fixed. In the midst of implementing microtransactions to squeeze every last buck they can out of the game Bluehole squeezed every last hope for one of the giants in a formerly niche market making any kind of comeback. For the considering buyer don't. Wait for another title that does the battle royale genre justice (assuming you won't play fortnite).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,124,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS REVIEWBattlegrounds came out very recently on steam as an early access title but has already gained a massive following with 150 000 people currently playing daily including myself. That is no small feat considering the 26.99 purchase fee which is a lot higher than most early access titles. I purchased this game based on the hype surrounding it and straight off I can tell you that the hype is justified and is a really fun and addictive game. It suffers from in game lag and lack of polish however but most of the time that doesn t detract much from the experience. Battlegrounds is a Hunger games battle royale type of game where one hundred people are dropped onto an island and must fight to the death until there is one man/group remaining. The best way to explain it is actually with the use of other titles within this genre because it s as if ARMA and H1Z1 had a baby. ARMA is known for being hyper realistic and H1Z1 has a very arcade feel. Battlegrounds sits in the middle of the two and being all the better for it.The island you are on is pretty big and if you play carefully and have some luck it is quite possible to not meet anyone until the very end but you should always be prepared to fight so that is why when you land you should be searching buildings around you as quickly as possible to find loot. Anything from assault rifles to backpacks to helmets It all could be useful and it is up to the player to decide what they should take and what should be left behind. The best moments of this game is the tense seconds of hearing shooting in the distance and wondering if you will win the next battle for survival Or the need to move through an open field feeling paranoid because someone could be watching from a distance. All fights are awesome as it really feels like a battle for survival even if some of the controls are a bit clunky. Punching and jumping for example need work and I am sure they will be sorted out due to the developers rigid and functioning update structure.Not only do you need to think about all the people about to shoot you in the back but you need to be conscious of the electric field that slowly closes in around the map to push the survivors closer together forcing the last people to fight it out. This pushes you to either drive (if you can find a car) or trek across the map making you always try to be aware of your surroundings. I personally love this mechanic because you have to adapt to your current situation and reevaluate it every couple of minutes while being aware that any random encounter with anyone could happen. You just have to hope that you are better equipped than them. To top it all off supply drops land in open areas with the best equipment inside but you can be sure you will have to fight people to get the treasure within. The entire game takes strategy to win. Do you sneak around or are you strong enough to take the fight to the enemy. Do you wait for a battle to end and take out the victor or do you retreat into one of the games main cities. It s all up to you and needs to be reassessed on a moment to moment basis.Audio is great and you can tell where gunfire is coming from just by listening carefully. There is no music to speak of but that is so you can listen for doors opening footsteps approaching or vehicles going past you. It s all directional and very helpful. Graphics are pretty poor but that isn t really an issue to me. If you are looking for a game with good graphics however maybe this isn t the game for you unless you can look past them. Currently the optimisation is even worse. I have an i7 processor and a GTX 1080 graphics card and I have to run it on medium settings and even then I get drops. Though I believe this will be fixed within a future update. I just hope it s sooner rather than later.Having friends to play with I believe really adds to the experience. I have been playing the DUO mode with a friend and we have been having a great time protecting and strategising with eachother and I can see hundreds of hours being poured into this game and even more as it develops further. Other cool things that I want to mention before wrapping this review up is that you can customise the look of your character. There are many weapon attachments such as silencers and scopes. Boats are drivable though even more rare than working cars. There are red zones that change throughout a match that get shelled with explosives so its best to get in the nearest building. Finally this game can be played in third or first person and both are really well implemented.In conclusion this game is definitely worth your time if you are into the survival genre or just want something different to satisfy your multiplayer gaming urges. hopefully every issue I have listed will be fixed and the game will be developed further. If I had to give it a score it would be an 8 out of 10. Thank you for reading I should be reviewing this game again in a years time.Written reviews here https //blitzzreviews.wordpress.com/2017/04/01/playerunknowns battlegrounds early access review/,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-24,0,0,251,False,Not Recommended,It's a lot like The Hunger Games. Fun to play with friends. Extra fun to murder your friends. Since it's early access there are a lot of bugs but nothing that makes the game unplayable. Would like to see a spectator mode for friends that aren't playing/in your group. Or a larger group. Like 6 people.I'm terrible at shooting and worse at aiming but I still find the game enjoyable.EDIT The game is now no longer Early Access. However it's still riddled with bugs. Probably even more so than when it was in Early Access. This game is 100% not ready to be official but it was only pushed forward to try and make more money despite the game not being finished.Wouldn't recommend until these issues are fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If these issues are not sorted out I woudn't recommend ever picking it up.

2017-12-25,0,0,425,False,Not Recommended,meh 1.0 launch still didn't help. Random luck generator. U might get decent gear but you probably wont. Almost every single person when you're playing squads suggest you got to high traffic areas then they die instantly leaving you alone vs teams of people while blaming you for not doing more when you haven't even found a gun yet.. Or you go there and you yourself are shot instantly while thinking how the did he get a gun already!? Sometimes in high traffic areas I've run through 5+ houses without even finding a pistol and I was the first one in the house so no one had looted it then bam shot in the back on the way to the 6th house. When you take the time to go to a low traffic area and loot you still have a good chance of not getting essentials for late game. I've gone 10 rounds in a row before without finding anything beyond a red dot just to get sniped by people whos shot i can barely hear and definitely can't see. It annoys me because my k/d/a on COD and halo are epic yet i can't seem to be good at this game because you rarely get good gear. How am I supposed to kill all these snipers witha pistol? I just reinstalled to check out 1.0 and played for 5 hrs now and still I've gotten ONE scope that was above a red dot. Same thing over and over I can see a teeny tiny sillhouette of a guy whos body is the size of the dot of my red dot scope and I know he's there but i can't accurately hit him while he lands a single perfect head shot on me to end me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Calm your folks.If you don't have the game already I wholeheartedly say give it a try. If you don't like it have Steam refund you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-18,0,0,163,True,Recommended,I bought a PC specifically to play this game as I got a taste of Battle Royale on Fortnite on PS4 and needed to try this. It's a very fun game whether in solo or squads...when it works. The game is optimized like so my settings have to be turned way down. It also tends to have issues when connecting to servers or other people. For example tonight when I was with a squad trying to get into a game it took all of us refreshing our UI probably 5 times to get the damn game to let us ready up. So those issues are frustrating but if you can look past them PUBG is a very fun tactical battle royale game. I wish that the devs would focus more on optimization than on climbing over walls but it is what it is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-17,0,0,330,False,Recommended,"This game is getting a bunch of negative reviews. Here's my take I've played off and on for about a year. It's improved a lot. Lots of new weapons vehicles clothing and a total of three maps. I find that all the maps provide a much different experience and are all enjoyable.People complain about cheaters desync the devs and a whole load of other stuff. I don't know for sure whether I've been killed by a cheater yet or not. Usually I die because I did something stupid gave away my position fired when I didn't have a certain kill shot or drove straight into enemy fire. I've gotten first place I've gotten 99th place. I usually kill zero to 1 player a game so by no means am I an ""elite"" player and probably wouldn't rank as even a ""good"" player. But I feel that I'm getting better simply by knowing the maps so well. I enjoy the stealth aspect and sneaking my way into the top 10 even if I never fired a shot.I very much enjoy the solo rounds but it's a lot of fun to team up with friends to wreak havoc. Nothing like completely disagreeing on strategy three people sneaking while one is running wide open and engaging everyone they find. Lots of laughs as well as very intense moments.Overall if I have a free evening I'll gladly board onto the PUBG plane jump out and fight it out with 99 other souls. Other games I enjoy are X Com 2 Darkest Dungeon TF2 and Skyrim.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,This game has no much potential but it's plagued with cheaters and bugs. I had to reinstall the damn game in order to get past the black loading screen bug. I constantly get errors when trying to equipt gear. This game has no business being out of early access. The cheating is out of control and Bluehole refuses to do anything about. Perhaps admitting there is a problem will be bad PR. Getting killed by xxchianhuangxx from across the map by a full auto at hip fire is not fun. Neither is being shotgunned from across the map. Being stuck in a black loading screen with the PUBG logo which doesn't go away until my team has already landed is also not fun. Fortnite is simply the better game. It's WAY more optimized. It doesn't have a problem with hackers/cheaters. It's just a better game period. Please close off China from the West Bluehole. That will solve a significant amount of the cheating. Until you do that I'm probably going to stop playing this game. For people looking for a Battle Royale game get Fortnite. PUBG is not worth the time and effort. You put all this work getting yourself into a good tactical position just to be cheated out of a win.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-17,0,0,446,True,Recommended,This game is pretty good for an Early Access title. I really enjoyed the early days of DayZ and this game brings back a similarly thrilling atmosphere with all the boring parts of the aforementioned walking simulator cut out.Pros Graphics are pretty good. Gameplay is intense and combat is extremely rewarding when you get a kill. It doesn't take very long to get into a match. The map has interesting unique locations and while there are some copy pasted buildings there are much more memorable locations compared to other games of the same genre. The devs seem very involved in updating this game so far with two new maps rumored to be on the horizon. Sound design is on point. You will want to wear headphones when playing this game so you can hear your enemies.Cons Not well optimized. Be prepared to run certain settings on Very Low Medium. They had to remove flashbangs because the performance problems with them were so bad they were freezing some clients. Gameplay can feel clunky which can be both a good or bad thing. Third person gunplay makes defensive play very strong. This might be remedied by a first person mode in the future. Some people may find solo mode boring so you may want to also convince your friends to buy this game as well for more fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are a lot of very frustrating things about this game that could easily be fixed and improved by the development team but have not changed. They have a function to report team killers and cheaters but is very selective on who you can report. You cannot just report anyone cheating. You can only report the person who killed you. The team has certainly put more work into the mobile port of this game than they have the PC verson. The mobile version has a shooting range to better familiarize yourself with the guns and shooting dynamics. It also has an arcade mode that proves to be arguably much more fun than the normal mode. The PC version only has prmotional game modes on weekends and does not have a gun range. Overall great game but very poorly managed by developers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Gunplay is pretty good melee system is a bit lacking but isnt the main focus.I wouldn't say I like the RNG of the redzone randomly blowing you up sometimes even if it is rare but again this is uncommon.The first circle is around the millitary island 1/2 of the time which is quite annoying seeing as it is 1/5 of the map area at most.Overall 8/10 very enjoyable absolutely worth it at full price unlike most games on PC.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-18,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,Alot of fun so far definately shows promise. Alot easier to get into than Dayz was when I initially played that and more user friendly. But don't expect it to be easy I thought I was going good for a while but it was mainly that I didn't come across people in a few matches since then i've died within like 5 minutes.. but atleast in this game I know they aren't 'friendlies' and it's expected unilke Dayz where it's annoying to always get killed by everyone.Unfortunately it's not without it's bugs. The most annoying bug by far is the microphone not working randomly match to match and sometimes takes multiple times exiting the game completely and going back in to fix it. That doesn't matter if you play single but playing with teams a mic is needed.You will get killed alot and then have to load a whole other match which can be annoying sometimes. But it's all pretty fun and addictive.EDIT Due to the microphone bug which after the first day I got it has been CONSISTENTLY not working i've changed my review to negative. It ruins the most fun match which is team and is almost a deal breaking bug and TONS of people are having it yet the thread about it on their forum was closed down.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A growing number of cheaters are about to ruin this game. It has finally gotten to the point of an early access game that its cheating problem is noticeable. Buy this game if you dont mind dealing with cheaters. It has the potiental to be a great game. I was going to say many good things about it. Buy at your own risk. I would wait to see how the developers address cheating. BattleEye? That was their big idea to help address the problem. If EPIC address the cheating problem. FORTNITE is the game you should problay try. Come on PUBG Corp...Fix your problem before its too late...Dont end up like all the other failed Early Access. I want to see this game make it but its already going down the path of all other early access. Good luck,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-18,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,Not recommended mainly because the performance that is really not optimized well for a game this size.Maybe If you got a good rig I can say try this out (even though there are people who have high end PC that are still complaining about the performance) but unfortunately for i5 4460 GTX 750 (2GB) and 8GB RAM A.K.A. Trash user like me it's unplayable with very low settings it's around 30 FPS max with frequent drops to 9 12 FPS (Could even down to 1 2 FPS lol).I actually didn't expect that this game would be so heavy to handle for my system since I can run older AAA games like GTA V in medium to high settings.Since it doesn't work for me and this game is just your typical battle royale game I wouldn't recommend it. I'm sorry but as popular as it is now I believe there are better battle royale games out there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game never ever gets updates like how other Battle Royal games do for example fortnite...

The community for this game is absolutely absurd I understand that this type of game is considered a ""Tactical Shooter"" but man people play like a bunch of babies... Fortnite or any other BR game our there would easily beat this title... I've played this game since the very first release of this game and man when I say this game gets no serious updates this game gets no serious updates. How in the world do I run this game with 45 55 FPS with a 1070 i5 on low graphics and downscaled resolution?? Any other game I play and run I can get up to 100 plus FPS. This game also reminds me of running simulator by how much you have to run just to make it to zone which then you get shot in back by a camping 3rd person abusing loser who has no kills and wins with 1 kill... Not even including that the last couple of circles are completly random and that shouldn't be the case the next/ending circles should be near the middle of the previous circle not completly random... This game is a bust and would not recommend it to anyone unless your want to be filled with rage and hatred. And don't even get me started on how long this game is in early access still...

Nothing beats dropping in on the same few buildings with multiple enemies and running like crazy to find a gun to be the champ of the drop. Example Run in the same door as another guy.He skips the crowbar laying there.I pick up the crowbar laying there.He found a gun in the next room.I smack him in the back of the head with the crowbar while he was reloading the new found gun.I took the gun too.Ran into the next room to accidently run by another guy.Both turn around in 180 and fire as crazy.I died.I rejoined a new match.And it even made me order a GTX 1050 to run it more smoothly damn you addictiveness!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's both a mental and skill game combined.

2018-07-19,0,0,613,False,Recommended,This game probably has the most amazing gunplay of any game I've played to date.Sniping someone from a good distance is satsifying spraying an automatic weapon is great and modifying weapons to better suit your playstyle is fantastic. 2/3 of the maps out currently are great those being Miramar and Sanhok. Erangel is complete ing garbage but that's my opinion.This game is optimized well enough to play at least on low settings on most low to mid range builds and runs beautifully when playing on ultra. There are still quite a few bugs in the game that can be annoying and sometimes it feels as though the devs have no ing clue what they're doing. This is really only 10% of the experience.The other 90% is excellent gunplay amazing customization and overall probably the best BR experience there is and with polish maybe even the best there ever will be.I wish skins were cheaper and/or easier to get. We all want a Turquoise Delight or a Shark Bite skin but unfortunately because the game has a market for skins getting them is a ing hassle and then some. There are times when PUBG Corp feels like the greedy s who funnel out just to make money and there are times when I receive something or buy something at a fair price and am left satisfied. In the however many months I've been playing this I made roughly 120 dollars back so that isn't all that bad.This game also fills the niche for playing with friends. Some matches are very competitive and test our tactical teamwork other matches we're shooting each other in the back and pretending there was an enemy behind us. You can take it seriously or around. It's great.Maybe there are some hackers here and there most of them are chinese but they're far and few between these days.I'm playing this game until it dies. I hope for that to not be any time soon and with how much money PUBG Corp is farming in it's very likely that it will not be any time soon. you if you play fortnite play a real game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-21,0,0,135,True,Recommended,When the player count dwindles to twenty and you're sneaking or shooting for your spot in the shrinking circles PUBG gets your heart beating. If you claw into top ten every gunshot arrests your attention and every death brings you closer to your chicken dinner. The few wins I've picked up have been the most intense and euphoric gaming experiences I've ever had. Though it still needs some work PUGB becomes consistent fun with a squad and often solo once you tackle the learning curve. This game just barely runs at about 30 FPS on my low end pc with all the settings at their lowest and the resolution dropped to 1280x720. It chugs momentarily when I zoom with an 8x scope and sometimes the buildings take a bit to load in when I touch down. I'm cautiously optimistic for better optimisation to give me a smoother experience but I'll keep playing regardless. If you're unsure about the game now I think PUBG will be worth your time upon its full release.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-30,0,0,150,True,Recommended,Pros After playing this game for almost 25 hours I can safely say that iut deserves a 8.5/10. 8.5 points because it is very action packed its the new h1z1 and the game is early acess so this game is getting updated constantly. This game gives the message of using tactics to winCons its 30$ 1.5 points because you can get mad easily to the glitchy t that happens in the game. sorta glitchy can be very laggy and be a bad expireince of your internet isnt decentCONCLUSION I would not waste 30$ on this game get it on Or just get it on a steam sale. This game is worth 25$ and under. It had alot of hype built up to it it is a developing game and it will change in the future.

2017-08-22,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I just got this game and have about 10 hours when this review is being written and honestly very fun game but there is room for improvement. One thing that I will say off the bat if you're reading around the time I post this is that the optimization of this game is absolute trash. My computer can run GTA 5 with medium settings at around 60 fps but this game is quite the killer. You will have to tweak a lot and manage with trash settings to get 70+ fps on very low settings. That should be expected though since it is in early access but like king of the kill it will most likely stay this way for a while. The gameplay is super fun and the bugs add personality but somethings you should be aware that the map is very large so there will always be something wrong. I was playing earlier and fell through the world on one of the beaches and it's quite frustrating but killing in this game is extremely rewarding. If you like games that are quite immersive and challenging this is perfect for you. You really feel like you're in this battle royale simulation and I often find myself red faced from intensity. Personally this game is worth it pretty cheap compared to triple A titles but you get what you pay for. Thanks enjoy! Hopefully this helps! Also the game is kinda based off chance because you choose where to spawn by jumping out of the beginning airplane but sometimes the area that you need to head to can be on the complete opposite of the map sometimes extremely out of range. Even if you are the best player in the world you will NOT win all of your games. I've won sometimes and next game would get 70th place.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You may not always do well in terms of your rank in a game but every kill and stand off you live through feel like a victory in their own right. That's what keeps me coming back.When playing with friends it's even more crazy. You could try to win but it's about the same odds as solo in regards to how often it usually works out. The fun with playing with friends for me comes more from the moments where even though every team member is well kitted you decide to charge an enemy stronghold with machetes and pans anyway.

Sometimes the game just runs better on high setting rather than low?!?! what is this!!!!Next the amount of glitches and network errors in a full release game let me put it straight up this game is litterd with bugs and glitches and LOTS of server errors. If you want this game good luck just go play fortnite its better optimised than this piece of stinking hot trash,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-18,0,0,120,False,Recommended,I understand the people that get frustrated with the game's development cycle but overall it's a very good game. It is fast fun and rewarding to put the time in. It has improved immensely from last year though I'm sure people may miss that because it didn't happen all at once and it's still just as addictive to play as it used to be. At the price point which is about half of a modern day AAA game I would still say it's worth the purchase if you've got a little team.Personally I wouldn't play it by myself.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,361,False,Recommended,PUBG is a fun game. However it is massively overhyped and has a plethora of issues. If you don't have a good pc I don't recommend this game. The game lags rubberbands and crashes/freezes constantly. Close range gunfights are a coin flip the majority of the time. This game is just as frustrating to play as it is rewarding. What makes this game good is that it is the most rewarding Battle Royale game on the market. The long setup is what makes kills so satisfying and wins even more so. It is a blast to play with friends since it does provide a good time. Playing squads or duos with randoms is a far worse expereince because of the absense of region lock. If you can deal with the game's problems and don't take it too seriously you will enjoy it. But clearly the game is not perfect and the developers need to adress its problems sooner rather than later.Major problems that need to be adressed Still horribly optimized Rubberbanding (Ruins early game looting) Incosistent close range gunfights (connection issue) REGION LOCK NEEDS TO BE ENABLED!!! (Half of the randoms are Asians playing on NA server)Until the game's issues are fixed I cannot say it's a good game...but it is fun. The fun factor is why I think even in its current state the game deserves a positive review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I know I may only have 90 hours on this game I can still write a decent review and here it goes I bought this game last year around September and I really enjoyed the gameplay even though I did die within 5 minuets of every match and felt like smashing my head through my monitor I played many more matches and learned from my mistakes which resulted in me Improving (A little bit). The graphics of this game are really nice but the preformance Isn't im sorry to say the developers are more focused on making money than making the game enjoyable and playable to their playerbase. The servers have been swarmed with Hackers and sometimes really bad lag issues which does bring down this game I do really enjoy PUBG on the occasion but not in its current state In my opinion I would wait for more issues to be resolved before you buy it but if you do go ahead and buy dont say I didn't warn you.Positives Graphics Flying over hills with your friends in a 3 seater bike Camping in houeses till the final CircleNegatives Gameplay (Lag) Hackers Not Individual Severs (Hackers can jump from servers) Battle Eye (Anti Cheat)Overall I would recommend to wait for this game to reach a stable branch before you purchase it which could take a while due to the owners not caring about their playerbase.

Just watch people play it on twitch or youtube because it is not worth you're time or money. ""Fix Pubg"" will never happen The amount of Bugs makes this game litterally unplayable. connection issues sound issues general game mechanic issues &amp just a bad player base. For a brand new player just joining you have no chance of winning unless you adapt to the absolute game style this game forces on you which is it's better to hide than to fight. &amp if you are going to fight ambush someone.Way too much is down to RNG. The gun's are unbalanced and it's completely luck based for you to get 1. the weapon you need. 2. the correct attatchments for that weapon. 3. good Armour &amp helmet 4. Heals 5. Boosts ETC. because (especially on the old maps) if you don't get everything you need you find yourself just looking for loot Which isn't fun. If you don't have enough health after the first fight of the game Tough your bascially 1 shot until you find what you need.For a game which emphasises staying alive you die extremly quickly you will get melted by nearly every gun. Not to mention as soon as you hide behind a corner you can still get shot for the next 2 seconds due to the games terrible connection issues. If you check the kill cam you are very rarely on it it's just a video of a guy missing nearly every shot.I bought a brand new pc that cost a Grand and a half with pubg in mind &amp I can safely say pubg runs terribly. UNLIKE ANY OTHER GAME IVE TRIED. The game has crashed several times at several different points in a match &amp it gives you no warning or explanation as to why you just have to accept it.Let me just put this in perspective COD4 came out in 2007. it is now 11 years later &amp This game is not even a shell of that. I cannot explain to you how little enjoyment I have recieved from this game &amp how over hyped it truley was. Because it puts you through so much BS the fun parts aren't even that great. &amp Even if you win then what? there is no progression system the player stats are always being reset you can earn crates but then you have to PAY TO OPEN THEM. It is a perfect reflection of the entire gaming industry. &amp I truley find myself hating this game &amp I honestly just can't bring myself to even play it anymore because I KNOW i wont enjoy it. This is the 3rd or 4th time of uninstalling the game every time i just want to give it another chance but there really is no point. None of my friends play it anymore &amp i think i will be moving on for good.This game is dying and i'll be happy when it's dead.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-11,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,"It's a decent game if you play enough of it. Most of the time into a match it's just long range engagements and you can't see the person who's shooting you. Next thing you know you're dead without a chance to fight back. In this game it's either always die or you're really good getting 15+ kill games. I however cannot be good at this game anymore because I'm banned. For literally doing nothing either. It's stupid in my opinion and I'm sure others could agree with me. Let me explain.Super relentless guidelines with banning people. I get it people may use the excuse they were hacked and someone else played on their account but at least give the people who really were a chance. In my case I probably had one of the most secure accounts with steam guard and everything. A really good hacker got into my account and played PUBG with hacks from his computer. I got banned almost instantly after I took my account back and I can't even appeal for an unban. It's just stuck at ""if you're banned it's your fault for being hacked."" Which is the most f*cking r*tarded thing I've ever heard.First of all I thought you actually wanted a community following but this is just mean to some of them. You guys aren't doing great in the first place compared to Fortnite so doing this is just adding insult to injury.Second it's not like it's my doing that I just ""let someone into my account"". I don't share passwords or information with anyone and I'm really secure about it. Just because some russian dude knows how to hack doesn't mean it's my fault that he chose to use hacks on my account. That just sounds r*tarded as if a 5 year old kid came up with those rules.Third not adding an appeal for the people like me who think logically is honestly just rude for people not being able to use the $30 they spent with their own money. I get it lots of people use hacks. Most of the time they should be banned. But like me who hates hacking and loves a fair game is banned because some f*ckface decided to use my account instead of their own is just lazy on your guys' part. I would appreciate a refund for my waste of time explaining something that you should've known in the first place.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-12-19,0,0,381,False,Recommended,Bluehole just needs that cash money They make you pay 30 for the game (well worth it in my opinion).They copied CSGO with their case and skin system with skins selling for 900 .They have a hybrid of the battle pass from Fortnite and the DLCs for R6Siege that cost 10 since it comes when a new map drops.I understand that it is a game as a service with constant updates and all these are not mandatory to buy but it is outrageous to ask for that much since the game launched a year ago and you maid billions of dollars.Pros Fun game Many updates Memorable moments Even the bugs are kinda funny Nice GraphicsCons Mostly above 75 fps but rarely over 100 ( gtx1080 ) You are not gonna notice those graphics because you can only run it on low settings Vehicles are broken Sound is broken They say there are hackers BUT personally I have never encountered one ( EU servers ) Cannot play with randoms in squads duos (toxic team kills from the start of the game not speaking English) Some problems with the genre ( ex. If someone surprises you from behind in a close range you are pretty much back in the lobby) Difficult to get used to gun mechanics much better than they used to be They dont listen to the community Problems will probably never get fixedUsed to love this game and I am sad watching it die...

I recievedthis game for free as a gift from my friend after hours of him trying to convince me to get the game I was unsure about wether or not it would be a good idea as the game was new and I knew nothing about it. After he had gifted it to me I downloaded the game and had a try I foundthe game was simialar to Day Z in terms of controlls and graphics Though there are some factors that might deter you from buying this game Frame rate on any machine powerfull or weak will have an unstable framerate as this game is in early acces and stills needs optimization thought i said factors as in plural this is the only thing that bothers me. If you are looking for a fun game to play with friends or aloneyou have hit the jackpot with this oe and i strongly reccomend you get it if the frame rates wont bother you I am playing on a Intel Core i76700 hq and a Nvidia GTX 960M and with medium to low settings with the poor optimizations are pretty smooth around the fourty to fifties and sometimes dropping to the thritys and twenties when around the ocean Im not too sure why it does this maybe because of the light and reflections rendering tied in with the poor optimization.

If that doesn't happen you'll probably get some great loot and sneak up on a guy start firing but even from 3 feet away your bullets will be absorbed by PUBG's servers and he'll turn around and one shot you with a shotgun.

2018-08-04,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,Isn't as buggy as it use to be but servers are laggy AF and annoys the hell out of me. Body armor you pick up like teir 2 doesn't slow down bullet damage anymore if somebody has a smg or a full auto combat rilfe you screwed even in teir 3 body armor. Can't tell where foot sounds are coming from can't tell which direction your being shot from to take proper cover. Decent weapons on Miramar are really hard to come by making it difficult to engage in fire fights. Solo battles are a nightmare with alot of campers. Best way to do good at this game is to buddy up and play Duo's or squads. This game is not worth the 30$ price tag it has on it. I regret my purchase of it. If you want to play PUBG just get the mobile version for you phone or Download the Tencent gaming buddy emulator for pc and play it like that. Its not as user friendly but has alot better support then this version of the game does. Its free and you can tell where your being shot from and actually do decently in it compared.

Very nice gun play similar to the realism of Arma while being much less clunky. (It is based on an Arma mod after all but what isn't anymore?) Voice chat is decent quality provided you stay away from All chat channel its like people just discovered the annomnimity of the internet in there. Map is a fairly efficient size not too big but surely not too small. Good variety of weapons attachments and pretty well balanced (Currently). Gave map selection option when queuing as community requested. Did something about hackers finally.Bad stuff. 90% of in game crates are now pay to open they just contain clothes and weapon skins but I began playing when there were no pay to open crates. (I have not and will not pay to open a crate.) Not as prevelant now but HACKERS. Close quarters combat with ping differences.(Not extremely easy to control but you will rage due to this.) Map content devlopment is taking longer than I and most of the community would like.Noteworthy Neutrals.

I have more of a chance of gathering where someone is if they have voip on but cannot hear footstep till they are litrually point blank in my face. Never known anything quite like it in a game and shocks me to think this game was #1 last year. How I don't know all I can think is that its because battle royale is the hype of the moment. If you do buy it make sure you get it on a deal as even asking for 15 is quite cheeky for the quality this game has to offer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-12-25,0,0,539,False,Recommended,Can be very fun and has recently been updated in terms of performance and a new map. Unfortunately the developers seems more concerned about micro transactions and adding streamer skins than listening to the community and making some much needed changes. So these QoL updates are rare and far apart. Also the addition of removing region specific servers and mixing everyone together was IMO a very bad choice and should be reverted.

A loot system that dynamically increases the chance of you finding something you already have/don't need (Hey want a fifth Kar98 this round?) Vengeful play area circles whose father you murdered in another life (Ooooh look another open field on the opposite side of the map as where you started!)In addition the game has attracted a diverse fun loving community of hackers your long lost 12 year old fathers and the Chinese. Featuring an in game voice chat system you can chat with your fellow survivors in the lobby over the soothing sound of the N word and ""China Numbah Wan"" activists in converstations that would instantly bump the ESRB rating up to M. If you do have any issues with the game you can always take your issue to the forums where you can get (Maybe) developer feedback (Probably not) on whatever your post is about (Yeah no).

Yet the cheater problem still isnt fixed same for the lobby lags or the general connectivity. e.g ""The severs are too busy"". The late February Update bashed the game even more its main purpose was the get rid off cheaters but the only thing it did was disabling Reshade and completely up the stability some people (gladly not me) werent even able to start game properly. Instead of a hotfix we got a major rollback and some nice new textures. It s nice to see that a cheater is getting by Battleye 5 hours after your match but the sheer amount of these events is a having a huge impact on the motivation to contine on the higher ranks.

The mechanics are sloppy and overall make you want to punch your monitor and the outright delay and slowness this game has is so painful to play through. The de sync is off the charts stupid and over the countless updates and 'performance' patches there still seems to be zero improvements just feels like the devs aren't putting effort into what the community actually wants. The players ask for game improvements and bug fixes yet we receive pointless weapon skins and new clothing items. If they stopped trying to fit the 'fortnite' style of battle royale and focussed on making a good quality game there would be no issue yet somehow after however many years this game has been in development it just feels as if its gotten worse since release can't even play it for a laugh with my mates as it is just too infuriating to enjoy.

2018-05-28,0,0,319,False,Recommended,Product received for free. While I do dislike Bluehole for justified reasons (their innate tendency to sue others and claim that their game concepts are original) PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds is my most frequently played game at the moment for good reasons. Its core gameplay is very enjoyable. The thrill of stalking other groups and then putting an arrow in their knee (sorry) one by one or running up close with a sawed off and just blasting them to hell is rewarding both in in game gear (usually) and satisfaction.The game can be extremely punishing as well if you make bad choices plan badly or simply aren't paying attention to your surroundings or the timer. You can easily die if you misjudge a situation or take stupid risks but it's just as easy to just jump into a new match. Matchmaking can literally take less than 10 seconds and that's counting the waiting time to spawn.I see some people here complaining about the RNG of how the circle is placed but that's one of the good parts of this game. It is unpredictable you never know what is going to happen where. You have to be able to adapt to the changing situations. No match is the same. If the circles always spawned in the middle there would be no diversity in gameplay. You would just play the same setting with different people over and over again. Also you're given plenty of time to get to where you need to get you just have to pay attention. This isn't a fault of the game it's a fault of the players.I'm not saying that the game is flawless it is definitely a flawed game. There are some game breaking bugs that can ruin a match for you if you are unlucky (I'm looking at you box in the green bloody barn). I wouldn't have recommended this game when I got it from my friends around New Years' but the game is much more polished now and I can now run it without ever dropping below 60 fps on highest settings. Bluehole is constantly fixing bugs and performance issues (although they have stagnated a bit on the performance front as of late) and the game isn't even close to being as unpolished as it was half a year ago. Vehicle bugs are as good as gone as of the latest patches.So while I am generally discontent with Bluehole as a corporation I'm more than pleased with their game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2019-02-06,0,0,815,False,Not Recommended,This game has turned into COMPLETE and utter GARBAGE. I have just over 800 hours clocked on this game. Mostly before Sanhok. It was nice with the 2 maps(Erangel &amp Mirimar). It was even better when they gave us map choice. I used to be in the top 1% for quite a while and it was my main game that I would come home and launch. In fact it was the game that encouraged me to buy a PC and start PC gaming. Now I've just given up hope on the game.With the new maps (Sanhok and Vikendi) it has left the original map(s) in the dust. I miss the short time to wait to get into Erangel and drop in Poch!nki hoping that I wouldn't glitch off the top of the 3 story buildings when I tried to land on them. Sometimes I would lose like half of my health but it was all part of the fun. There are very few games I would recommend a matching system based on lvl/gameplay but at this point this one really needs it. I have not had a fun game in over a year. Before the new maps and before FIX PUBG(Really? So bad they had to fix it? Yes. 3 months+) I would hop on with confidence knowing I was going to catch a win before the night was over. Now... I get on and can't even play the OG map(s) because there are only 6 people in the queue. I also have no confidence getting on. The way they have made the guns and numbers work seem unfair in my opinion. If you disagree cool. Don't rage at me. My word isn't law by any means. PUBG's daily online community has felt like it's significantly decreased since Fortnite came out with their Battle Royal version of the game(no duhh I know). I was pretty upset for a good while when that happened. I was not surprised that Fortnite took over due to the low price of FREE and the new take on a Battle Royal when your gun fights rely partially on the implemented building system. Now I personally suck at Fortnite SOOO BADD and prefer games with more realistic physics and qualities. I strongly dislike Fortnite. I don't know how my friends do it but they are quite amazing at the game. I suffer a game every now and them just to play a game with them because we don't have too many games in common and I know they love having the company.To put my feelings towards PUBG in retrospect I would much rather play Fortnite know that I suck and just take multiple L's and get a kill here and there than play PUBG. If you are interested in buying the game I'm not going to tell you not to. I recommend you don't. However if it seems like something you are pretty interested in and want to play I would do thorough research on videos of gameplay and more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In my case ...from infinite patience now its limited. Too much time has passed and nothing changed on a larger scale. (Most important problems still exists and ruining the game experience)EDIT(8.11.18) This game is more awful than before. Full of desync sound problems bad gameplay experience (they did nothing to improve it) ... you safely stop the car and not hitting or passing anything but suddenly explodes and bb 20 mins of looting/playing this is a new one.Some minor bugs that could be fixed in hours like jumping on the left side of the plane but your view resets/line up with the plane path instead of your desired direction. (jumping on right side is fine) ...and this thing is still here FOR WEEKS nearly months already.This game cant use your pc resources right ex it uses 30 40 50 % ...rarely 80+ of my 1050 oc'ed (but most of the time 50 70) and this is the problem that why i go under 60 frames often recently. Or having 1080ti for some users ... not using more than 40 % and sometime droping under 20% so you will get around 60 frames. An this is stupid for a top video card.Normaly my gtx 1050 should go 80+ to 95 99 ...around full load but no ...i dont know what they are doing with this game.And 1080ti should work around 60 80 % for strong and consistent performance. (with full hd and 150 200 frames all the time. rarely under 150.)I hoped to turn this review in a positive one but the chances droped to maximum 10% for me.Like my will to play this game anymore ... if this 10 % is gone ill leave and never coming back.

Stuffing 100 players into a plane to parachute down onto a desolate island to scavenge for weapons armor and supplies in hopes of surviving a bloody deathmatch. And to keep things interesting as numbers dwindle throw in the impending doom of an electric field that forces players into an ever shrinking warzone. PUBG's technical shortcomings can undermine its broader achievements on rare occasions but they don't override your desire to continue playing. Each phase of a match presents a different type of tension that is equal parts thrilling and terrifying driven by the insatiable desire to be the last person (or squad) standing. Whether you play solo or in a group successfully executing adaptive tactics to win intense high stakes firefights makes for an incredibly rewarding experience. Every player has unique stories of their most memorable matches and even after hundreds of hours PUBG continues to inspire rousing tales of victory and defeat.PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds has taken the military sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ boiled it down to its most exciting parts and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure hassle free survival based action.P.S. Vikendi PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds' new snow map has left the test servers and is now live for everyone to skid around in on their snowmobiles. Along with the new map there s the new pass. The Survivor Pass can be levelled up by completing missions netting yourself new items and skins. It s free for everyone but you'll need to spend cash to get the best stuff.

2017-04-15,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,"My own opinion (I do know this game is beta) This game is pretty bad I'm going to compare it to H1Z1 since that seems like what people are comparing it to.Cons Horrible performance (running everything at low graphics gives me a common 60ish fps ish being any lower than 60. Right when you turn your head you drop down to about 50 40 fps for about 10 seconds which is ed since you are completely ed if someone is shooting at you from behind. You may think I am just a pissy since 60 fps is good but in the game for some reason it seems like I am getting alot less even with low graphics. Unlike in H1Z1 where they have in my opinion evern better graphics and yet I get a consistant 80 FPS at medium/high settings. (Specs nividia geforce gtx950 i7 12 gbs of ram).).Weird pickup animations (Spamming ""F"" on an item or cosmetic will cause you to not pick it up and mess you up to in which you have to stand still wait 5 seconds inbetween each pickup and then you are done. Also it gives you the option to pickup items that you can't even reach in which then you have to move closer to it after the first try or so. Unlike H1Z1 you can just spam ""F"" and get on with your life. This may seem stupid but if you have OCD then you will want to uninstall the game just because of that).Gun glitches (The guns take a second to show that you even have the gun equiped and even then when you reload it will take a second to show you have ammo in your gun that you reloaded. I know this may seem like nothing but if you have minor OCD then you will flip a .Car physics (Tapping ""F"" on the car door won't get you in the car instead like the pickup animations you have to click e after waiting 5 second or so then you can get in. Same thing with the OCD). Pros A plethora of guns (Unlike H1Z1 there are not just 3 assault rifles and 1 shotgun and 7 pistols (including revolvers/magnums).Not as RNG (You get to choose where you want to parachute from instead of getting a random spawn. For some people this is good but I find it more fun to get a RNG spawn).Overall 4 Bilbo Baggins out of 10k am done thanx for read pls follow me on twitt",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Broken Limb penatration and sound bugs poor hit reg sometimes along with broken fps every patch. Interpolation is terrible in this game as well. For this game to survive fps will need to be fixed so its over 100 loot will need to be increased for all maps not just san hok limb penatration will need to be taken out till they fix it and circles will need to be slowed down till they fix the loot. If they don't make these changes Fortnite and COD4 br are gonna take even more of pubg community leaving this game to the trolls and hardcore pubg fans. If a dev reads this take it seriously it's not just my salty opinion it is literally the opinion of every random duo and friend and streamer I have talked to or seen. Don't get me wrong I know writing code for games is hard but that is no excuse it is your job if something is broken and you can't fix it you take it out of the game untill you can fix it like limb pen then re add it to test server test it and add it once it's fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-19,0,0,358,False,Not Recommended,"Started playing this game a little after it came out. Was a good game paid like close to 15 bucks for it. Did nt have any issues with the game. That is until the end of last year. Cheaters everywhere. Pubg says they are working on a fix for that but the anti cheat needs to be tested. Framerate drops are not in their best intrest to fix. Just like the anti cheat. Instead of announcing its there but it needs testing just implement it. Doubtful it'll even work seeing as they already have battle eye yet are banning millions of players each ban wave. I took a break for a couple months and came back when my brother and buddy bought the game for $35. Lots had changed. Dying as soon as i hit the ground to someone speed hacking and picking up weapons faster than usual. Esp no recoil and aimbots were atrocious. One night we had played 4 games where we barley made it out of the chutes before we died. After that we called it a night and the next day they both got banned. Tried an appeal got a crappy response from the devs. Seemed like it was computer generated. Stopped playing.Jan. 2018 they got new accounts. Started playing again. Cheats not so much still there but not as bad. Ping lock fixed alot of that. Still poorly put together turd however. Lag was worse. Fast forward.June 2018 after the most recent update. Game has significantly gotten worse. Lagging even harder than before. One match I shoot at a guy with an M4 point blank in the chest no hits. He runs off. Im now up by prison. Three guys come running at me i kill two. The other guy darts from behind a tree. I ads he is dead to rights 3 feet in front of me. Sights dead on his body. Apparently he runs faster than the bullets. Kills me. Okay im done. Nope play the next match. Shooting a guy in the face with an uzi same thing no hits. A guy 400m out kills me with an m16. Needless to say after that im done with this poorly optimized turd. I cant hit a guy point blank while the sights are on him but i can die to the air around a vehicle or a boat coming out of the ground. Uninstalled and will not install again. Id say waste of money but I got my fair share for around $15.I'll expect some comments about ""Get good"" or ""You just suck"". Seeing as it is the internet and you are entitled to your own opinion. Im just stating dont buy this game it aint worth $35 sure as hell aint worth spending $1.50 to open crates as the bp is etremely hard to get. Thanks to the farmers.

Not to mention the amount of poor performance and desyncing. The game is not near ready for release the fact they are pushing for release before end of 2017 is a good laugh. This is the most ADDICITING TERRIBLE game out there. Daily I tell myself ""I'm done with this game"" but somehow come back to get frustrated again and again. The inconsitent delivery of damage the cheaters who use aimbots or hacks to shoot through walls the random deaths because your vehicle hits a butterfly and blows up instantly when there is only 15 players left making you realize how you wasted 20 minutes of your life. Don't get me wrong it has HUGE potential to be a fun game it really does. But given that its in alpha and it seems like the random dice roll whether you will have a terrible experience. I cannot say ""GET THIS GAME"". I can not tell you how many times I have shot someone in the head/chest 4+ times when they have no armor or helmets I will have level 2+ helmet and chest armor and they shoot me once with a pistol killing me instantly. Uhh yeah cause that makes sesne. Or the fact that it does not matter if you have armor on and a shotgun can klll you instanlty. Umm no buck shot is not going to kill someone with armor on. The pellets will pepper your arms and legs and any other body part exposed but not penetrate. Maybe if it was a slug it would penetrate. Or how you can shoot someone 3 times with a pistol when you first drop and they 1 hit punch you? LOL YEAH OKAY. If they want to make a realistic survival battle royal they should look into real elements of what weapons can/cannot do and work on tweaking the delivery of damage and how that may effect the character.I have high hopes but I think for anyone who doesn't want to be frustrated by BS gameplay should wait until its out of Early Access. Until then I will give this a No on recommendation.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Prepare to do a lot of walking waiting and laying down just to get shot from nowhere wait another minute and repeat just to look at the clock and realize 3 hours just passed. If you start to play for some hours and wonder if the game is boring or if you're the one that's boring loser instead don't blame yourself blame your parents and plan threaten suicide for attention. But first leave the house and see the beauty around you on the way to taco bell before you buy $30 worth of junk food at Ralph's. Then go back home to binge on candy hentai and video games until its 3 am and your body is full of shame and sugar as you lean back on your squeaky office chair surrounded by food wrappers weed and fresh white stains on your black sweatpants. You pull out your phone to browse instagram and see all the beautiful girls you will never get a chance to touch or talk to. You see all the cool people having fun with friends doing all kinds of cool stuff that you always wanted to do but never will. Then you realize you've been living like this for all your teenage and young adult years and now you have to settle with a more boring mediocre life and will never reach your true potential because you threw away your free time to escaping into video games while you spend hours every day staring at a wall with moving pixels instead of doing things to improve your health happiness relationships exposure to the world and overall quality of life. It's too late. You destroyed your body from years of sitting on the computer. You'll never be able to have good sex with your back problems let alone be able to work out and attract women. It's over. You missed your train so you go back to your room and spend time with the only friend you have your computer. This is your life as you know it. The only happiness you have is escaping into a war game where you can communicate with your squad mates and have the illusion of socializing with people. This is the only time people will ever listen to what you ask them to do other than when you are mean to your parents and treat customer service people like because they're the only people who wont punch you in the face for being a jerk. In the real world nobody sees you as a leader but in PUBG you can lead your teammates to victory. You get a thought that maybe you should talk to that girl next to you or think of being friends with some good looking bros so you can go pick up chicks together but instead you hate what you dont understand and you make up stupid reasons in your head not to like them. Why? Because you have the ultimate talent the universe desires you are a video game master.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-11,0,0,25,False,Recommended,PUBG is a BatteRoyale game in which the only remaining player or team wins the game. The two maps are 8x8Km and start with 100 players who drop in with only the clothes on their back. More maps will be released including a 4x4Km one. I first played PUBG when it was still in early access and I was absolutely thrilled to play a game where the length of your weapon counts and suppressors don t lower your damage. Mechanics such as bullet drop bullet penetration and leaning (peeking) are also present. The damage model is a bit simplistic. With time the game got a much better netcode and it s a lot more optimized but it s still not very good. I love that they added the option of double tapping lean (peek) to make it toggled. Another thing that I really liked is that there is another fire stance besides the classic hip fire and ADS where you just hip fire more accurately while trading away speed. But even now you are being forced out of ADS when you get too close to objects like walls door frames etc. I think at the very least there should be an option to just prevent movement instead of forcing you out of aiming when there is no room to move. The way maps are deigned works well for PvP but it s very nonsensical and look unfinished. Vehicle physics is still wacky. Gameplay wise it s not that exciting except maybe if you get in the last 10 or 3. A lot of matches will be you running around for 15 minutes ending when a player gets the drop on you or after a short firefight. Time to kill is very low but it can be increased a bit with armor. Rating Chicken chicken this game s not the winner.http //pixelloot.com,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Would have been nice if there was a training mode or shooting rage so you can get used to the weapons instead of having to figure that out in combat.. Yeh ok at the start of the game (lobby) there are weapons to try but not with all the extensions (scopes foregrips silencers... ect.) This game made me ragequit a couple of times already. I hope they soon come with Damage report system that tells where you hit him or he hit you how much dmg it did. and what he was wearing. And ofcourse after you die you have the option to see his point of view. so for now after all the frustrating moments that i have encouterd so far i do not recommend it unless you do like to ragequit and cry in a corner.EraZer out (ragequit!!),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,450,False,Recommended,"Alright so I have a unique perspective here on the game so if you care here's my opinion on PUBG Its past current state and future. So as everyone knows PUBG dropped onto steam like a nuke just demolishing everything out there and smashing gaming records and amassing millions of players in mere months. The hype was insane and nobody could get enough of it everybody wanted more! But thats just it. Everybody wanted MORE... But nothing more was coming... It got stale and old quickly then small patches managed to break the entire game to a point where players started losing hope. That's when I picked up my copy of PUBG hoping that all of the negative was just people finally getting off the hype train... Boy was I wrong I played merely 4 5 hours before I totally lost hope in the game and thought to myself ""there goes 40$"" and i gave up on it for months. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when I had gotten wind of a new map battlepass and apples to say you to Fortnite I laughed and said "" in' hell guess ill give that game a try again"" in preparation for the new update I got back on and gave it another go and to my surprise the game actually felt slightly less bugy and a little more playable then I had previously remembered and for the first time I was actually thoroughly enjoying PUBG! I started watching more and more footage of the new map and was genuinely excited for the update. I couldn't wait! Now we arrive where we are today. The release of Sanhok the battle pass and seemingly some optimization and slight gunplay tweaks (Correct me if I am wrong though) And I have to say that this is the first huge step in a new direction for PUBG co. THIS is fresh new content that your playerbase has been screaming at you about for a year now! The game actually feels fresh and new. New weapons scenery sound tweaks AND APPLES! No more updates of more Microtransactions and new skins and t nobody wants. Continue listening to the people keeping your game in buisness and your game will last for eternity. SUMMARY PUBG has been notorious for a lack of innovation and a lack of concern and care for their playerbase and what they want. BUT now it seems they seem to understand what is going on around them and how their multi million copy celling game is failing. They released an amazing update. The gameplay on Sanhok feels new and fresh. This is what we've all asked for guys. ITS HERE! If youve given up on PUBG in the past. This is a new beginning if they continue on this track. 10/10. Good job PUBG",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Other than that this game is pretty boring.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-08-12,0,0,449,False,Recommended,"Listen if you've read many of the negative reviews on steam you'll realize that quite a few have 100+ hours on PUBG. No one spends 100+ hours on a bad game. Furthermore the negative reviews tend to rant more about the company bluehole (blueballs) and not the game so ultimately I think that most of the reviews should be positve but blueballs is ing garbage. No moving on to my opinion of the game not the company. This game is honestly a modern classic and witht he recent announcement by bluehole to ""Fix PUBG"" I think that by October of this year this game will turn around from being hated to being a steam favorite. Let's start with solos. Solos in this game are a bit hot or miss. On one hand the tension of a 1v1 or top 10 situation is amazing yet on the other if you don't know the hot drops or player movement solos can be a boring experience where you run into no one for 15 plus minutes. So ultimately solos aer OK if you are willing to either hot drop or you know player movement so you can hunt people down and force yourself into fights. For the next section i'm going to focus on both duos and squads because they both share many similarities. Duos and Squads is where the game really shines especially with friends. there is enough downtime in which can converse with you friends especially in squads yet there is enough where it is stil an enjoyable experience. The gun fights are even more tense with a 4 man fight truly feeling like a war zone you have to cover your teamates help yourself revive teammates and take down the enem of course. This is honeslty where PUBG shines. Now to the negatives of the game not blueball's negatives. The first downside and idk if this is really a negative is the monsterous learning curve. This game takes so long to learn and with server issues which I will touch on later the game can be very frustrating to 0 IQ individual (noob). Secondly the game has sub par performance on low end PCs. I have a 1050ti and an i5 6500 which should be decent for this game and it kinda is. The only real performance problems I have are occasionally the game will fail to render building before I land the only exception being when I drop at Pecado and Hacienda on Miramar (The Desert Map) I almost always never have the buidlings renderred before I land. I run the game on medium very low on all the settings. The last real problem is the servers in this game supposedly patch 19 made the servers run at a somewhat stable 60hz yet I still face hitreg desync lag and the ""Network Lag Detected"" error. This is exacerbated by my low to mid range PC where I feel like 1/2 bullets I land when spraying are actually registering. When single firing the hitreg seems to be fine. With all that being said the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign blueballs recently announced aims to fix performance and server issues and I have faith in blueballs because if they don't COD Battle Royale and BF5 Battle Royale will kill this game in mere seconds. Blueball's entire game lies on ""Fix PUBG"" and they need to succeed. You have been visited by the Fedora of Atheism and Autism!

2017-07-27,2,7,148,True,Not Recommended,"I've wasted 76 hours of my life on this game. The physics (ESPECIALLY vehicle physics) are worthless. Most of the time when you're driving you'll hit an imaginary bump that will flip your car and (if you're lucky) leave you with no health. You can't jump over anything unless you're at a full sprint. Weapons/damage feel like they're detirmined by RNG instead of a base damage. You can put 14 AK rounds into someone then they'll turn around and burst you with an M16 and down/kill you (true story). When someone is down they take about double the damage of someone who is up so it takes a ridiculous amount to kill someone in Duo or Squad. Third person is the worst thing this game could have ever done for two reasons. First it gives a massive advantage to anyone on the defense. They can sit behind a tree or at the top of stairs and wait for you to show your head while they are completely safe. Second it's 100% broke. 99% of the time I'm unable to shoot at someone from 3rd person (or even 1st person at times) without exposing almost my entire body and then getting swiftly ended often times without being able to fire a single bullet. There is a small red circle that indicates to you that your rounds will hit an object instead of your target and usually your bullets will hit said object even when it isn't there. These are just basic gameplay issues. This doesn't include the errors random game crashes ""network lag detected"" that can last anywhere form two seconds all the way up to five minutes and a plethora of other bugs. Like I said 76 hours wasted. I regret buying the game and wish I could get a refund. It's a fantastic concept and I understand it IS still early access but it's so broken in so many ways.P.S.

Its nothing like Call of duty though or Arma or any other good titles. The rounds are super short ( if you die). As soon as you spawn you have very very little time to get anything before you need to rush to the next area ( Which can sometimes be so far away you have no chance of getting to. I will say due and squads make the game alot more enjoyable but still the same crap. Seemed to be a few bugs Opening doors and sometimes just moving around getting rubber band effect.

2017-03-26,0,0,166,True,Not Recommended,"This is essentially just a redo of PU's king of the hill MOD for Arma using the Unreal engine. My negative review is not for the low FPS lack of optimization or lag (it has all those EA problems) but rather the poor game play meta and balance. It plays like PvP in DayZ sped up minus zombies and with slightly more people per sqKM. As a mod it is not worth $30 more like $10 15. Let's hope the devs don't take the money and run without finishing the game. It seems that because of the debacle that was/is H1Z1 gamers are overreacting to this release with joy. When the bar is low...If DayZ is a walking simulator Battlegrounds is a running simulator. EA or not the balance and game play mechanics are completely off right now. The dev's description states ""Players must fight to locate weapons and supplies in a massive 8x8 km island to be the lone survivor."" No they don't. At that size there is a density of only 1.5 players per sqkm. There is no incentive to engage other than the slowly shrinking combat zone or ego. The map is too large for 100 people and guns are way too prevalent. You can parachute in away from all the others loot one house get a sidearm and long arm (often in the same building but certainly in the same compound) and then hide. While you can get first aid kits there are not any other ""supplies"" or any other goal than just be the last to die. Now most people are parachuting in large groups early and quickly killing each other but that play style (to each their own) is essentially death match. Because you only get one life and can't spec the people doing this would probably really love an actual death match version of this game (hint hint). Also this instantly results in a balance issue. When as often happens 20 30 people die very quickly the player density plummets. Which ultimately exposes the flaw in all KOTH games they are too repetitive and limited. When it is but one game mode among others for a game KOTH is fun. But as a standalone game itself it makes no sense. Even with ladders and leader boards. Now some will get sucked into earning clothing for their avatar or some other perk but those are the same people that will grind a game like Farmville.I'll admit I don't know what the solution is. Increased player density for a start by shrinking the map. Reduce weapon spawns. That will help in the general playability but long term?

2017-10-24,1,4,100,True,Not Recommended,"Unfortunately I was only able to realise how terrible this game is once I experienced Fortnite a similar infamous ""Battle Royale"" game by Epic Games. It highlighted obvious flaws with PUBG's core experience that have not been addressed since release. Bluehole have failed to keep up with this games unprecedented success and that fact rears its ugly head prominently every time you hop into a game.PUBG's map is far too large for what it tries to achieve which is an intense survival experience. What ends up happening is that you have to choose between becoming an easy target by using a vehicle or embark on a super duper running simulator as you run from zone to zone. It feels extremely dissatisfying when you and your friends gear up for 10 minutes or so without seeing a single enemy only to be picked off by one swift shot by someone you didn't see. You desperately call out to your friends for help but they can't see him either only specs in the distance is that a bush or a player? Moments like these destroy the enjoyment of the game for me.That brings me to another gripe with the game its graphics. The realistic style of PUBG would work fine except the game is an unoptimised piece of garbage. My computer is by no means high end it would barely qualify as a viable low end machine with an embarrassing GTX 750 as its graphics card. That being said I have no trouble running Fortnite CS GO or Overwatch. Even GTA 5 runs relatively smoothly when compared to PUBG. The optimisation becomes an issue at the start of each round where 100 players are crammed in the loudest jet plane in existence and dropped off into a dull map with pre bought assets that don't load for at least 30 seconds into the game which by then everyone else who landed around you has found a weapon to violently shoot you with. Speaking of shooting....The games combat system seems incredibly wonky. The end game relies on you having scopes just so you have a chance of hitting your opponents. WHY??? Additionally if you are lucky enough to get an adequate scope for final engagements you are met with another issue the unintuitive wall of scoping distance. It uses squares on the map as indications of 100 metres which is supposed to allow you to register in your brain how far away the enemy is from your current position. It uses the ""Page Up"" and ""Page Down"" buttons (for some reason...) and is confusing especially in the heat of the moment when you are getting shot at repeatedly. The looting system is passable for the most part however linking back to the issues of scopes there are far too many variables that inhibit looting from being satisfying. You can spend such a long period of time searching for the right weapon to use only encountering rooms with crossbows pistols and weapons such as the VSS. If not this you'll never be able to find the right attachment for your gun. Oh you wanted an extended mag for your SCAR L? Sorry pal this extended mag only works with SMGs you ing idiot!The fact that this game passes 2 million concurrent players a day on steam is disgusting. Don't support this shambles get Fortnite.

2017-05-20,0,0,492,True,Not Recommended,This is my first ever review on a game.At the time of writing this review the game costs 30$ and is in early access and I have 70+ hours in it.In my honest opion this game is not worth picking at this point. Having A LOT of issues 1. Textures not loading properly2. Unoptimised(fps drops)3. Lag switchers(even though they said they fixed the issue i see no difference)Good parts 1. Fun to play(either alone or with a team)2. Intense gun fight towards the end of the game3. Gives a good feel of a simulator,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-21,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,The majority of the time in this game you will die in the first few moments because you don't have a gun trudge around a vast empty open world here gunshots hundreds of meters away get sniped in the head die from the circle because you can't find a car survive because you played like a hermit and never see a living soul. The environments feel empty gun play is so rare you can't really enjoy it. No range to test out guns. I played 5 games and fired fewer than 30 rounds. Much more of a survival game than a shooter in my opinion. Gunplay felt cheesy at most times more rock paper scissors than strategy. I like the concept but the game doesn't have a good pace for solo. I should also make it clear that this is not a game built for solo the mechanics only really make sense in a group setting. The game is no doubt much more interesting and fun in a group. Great for streamers and pro teams not at all good for someone who wants to play solo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-29,1,3,374,True,Not Recommended,"So Im going to finally get around to writing a review other than ""Its Aids""So to start off it seems like the philosophy of ""I like it therefore its good"" is something that is spread far and wide and many people follow this idea. Unfortunatly this is a very subjective viewpoint and it is the cause for many games that are actually flawed getting so many great reviews.That is the case of this game. It is sure fun as hell to play with friends but overall it is a lack luster game filled with devs and so many bugs that the fingers of the world could not count. So let me start off by listing some of the things I enjoy it is a small list but there are still some fun things.Pros It is quite and enjoyable game fun to play at times. Plenty of people playing no need to really wait for a match. I mean thats it? I cant really see much else with the gameCons So many bugs it hurts youll run in to them every single game whether it be your head sticking through something or getting stuck on nothing. The servers dear god they are always laggy at the start of the game the pickup time for loot is delayed and that is infuriating when you know someone next door is coming to blow you away with a shotgun. I always ask others in my squad just to make sure it isnt just me lo and behold it never is on my end. This happens in 75% of games and you will probably experience some lag somewhere throughout a match other than the start 50% of the time. The optomization is pretty doo doo the game is not that graphically impressive and I have a GTX 1070 and a system that should be able to at least get 60 on medium but that isnt the case you will get dips in frame rate and stuttering at times. The gunplay is sloppy from random sprays where one person will get lucky to the pans being able to one shot headshot whereas an M4 or AK wont. The gunplay is also relatively slow and clunky for a game that has some intense combat (When that actually happens). I dont really know how to explain it but no other game has felt this way.The Devs ALright you autistic s banning people for ""stream sniping"" whenever you feel like it is the dumbest ive heard you can honk your horn around a streamer and be banned instantly im not even joking. The whole ""we have to test the paid crate system"" has to be the biggest form of t the earth has ever heard. You dont need to test it now so you can take our money later. It is a simple system when compared to the game and guess what? It worked fine. Youre promises mean nothing and everyone will remember that. This whole issue with the chinese servers is just plain greed and is disgusting. You have so much ing money it is ridiculous and you cant even give them dedicated servers? You deserve terrible reviews and you deserve every bit of you get from it. Also now the NA and EU servers are lagging hard because of it thanks you dolts.*EDIT* 10 17 17 Every time I got to play a game it allows me to join one and after that is over the game will crash without fail as well as canceling any matchmaking I try after that first game.

2017-07-12,0,0,112,True,Not Recommended,If you're playing it alone Solo prepare to be annoyed. Also if you don't have a high end computer prepare to be annoyed. You won't see where the shots come from. Also the audio is screwed up. If it sounds like a car is right next to you it may be half a mile away but may also be about to run you down...Insanely frustrating aiming system. Double click to use the sights otherwise it just zooms in a little bit. A lot of work still to do. 3rd person is nice and all. But it is too easily used to peek around what you're hiding behind and see what's coming. Also the matching is ridiculous. Brand spanking new players who don't know what they're doing are pitted against people who have hundreds of hours in game. So there are new players like me who are slower at everything who also have slightly lower end computers also me... Who get shot by invisible people while dodging cars driving through a town half a mile away.This game needs a tutorial for those who wants to learn how to play it. Straight into PVP with no clue as to how to do things gets frustrating real fast. I would do a squad game but what does that help? I still can't see the people shooting at me. Minimum system requirements should be upped a bit running an overclocked i7 BUT with only a GTX 745 graphics card. I would at most be a mule for the other people on the squad. Also my friends are scattered all across the world. Playing overseas servers are not really an option.Bottom line I'll check back in once game has had a few more months to mature and work out the kinks. As it is now it's far too biased towards high end computer users who knows the hotkeys.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,2,3,43,True,Not Recommended,"I don't recommend this game to anyone. It definately can't be compared to epicness of Arma 2 battle royale mod. Levels of gear is just laziness. Instead of Having lvl 1 2 3 helmets they could of come up with realistic variants of helmets such as motorcycle helmet/ iron helmet/ Combat tactical helmet etc. Same goes with backpacks. Can you imagine lvl 3 backpack in dayz? Breaks all immersion. Shooting seems more arcadish than in counter strike fine fine it has bullet travel time however the whole gun handling physics for example switching weapons is just horribly made. Another point I want to make is movement. It really needs alot more work to be done on it to be comfortable. (For example comparing Guild wars movement to world of warcraft movement EVERYONE knows that fluidity of movement in WoW just feels perfect and doesnt off your nerves like guild wars.Everything I listed here has nothing to do with a stage of a game such as alpha or prerelease or w/e.

2017-12-10,0,0,91,True,Recommended,"Player Unknown's Battleground I feel is a very underrated game given the mixed reviews. I've put a fair amount of hours into the game now and I think it's overall a great game that just needs a little polish. And no surprise there it's still early access. Here's my breakdown of what makes the game great what could use a little work and overall how this game feels to play.The Good The ability to play in first OR third person is a nice touch. I remember when that was not an option. (Well you could but there was no FIRST person only game option on release so you would be at a huge disadvantage if you did). The graphics are not bad especially when you think about the type of game this is. An open world survival battle royale game. It doesn't have the best graphics for sure but they work for the game. And the new map on the technical test server seems even better. It really seems they tweaked something for the new update as it looks a lot better.Gunfights make sense. You're not going to snipe someone with a shotgun and up close they do plenty of damage. You can switch fire rates so if you want to use an AR as a poor man's sniper you can do it. You see muzzle flashes you hear the different sounds each gun makes so you can usually identify what you are hearing by sound alone. Direction of gunfire is pretty easy to tell too.High skill ceiling. Every match is a challenge. It takes a lot of effort to ""git gud."" I personally am not there yet but I don't feel like that is out of reach either. It is definitely competitive and every kill feels rewarding.The Bad Bullet drop sometimes feels unpredictable. It may be just me but sometimes the bullet drop seems inconsistent. No vaulting! While this WILL be changed in the upcoming patch for now you cannot vault over low objects like fences and small walls. This won't be an issue for long though and the vaulting feels great on the Technical Test Server (TSS).gun balance could use work. I would like to see every weapon viable but that just isn't the case. There are many trash weapons that you pretty much bypass entirely because of how useless they are. I would love to see crossbows and pistols actually useful for anything besides an ""oh crap I need something NOW"" type of panic weapon.Game doesn't seem optimized the best. I'm running a GTX 1060 6gb with 16 gb of DDR4 RAM. I shouldn't have significant frame drops running with everything on high but I do. I keep a few settings to medium to avoid this. So the game could be better optimized.Controlls sometimes feel a little clunky. They take some getting used to. Not game breaking by any means but occasionally things with the controlls can lead to a bit of frustration until you learn some of the kinks wth it.This part ironically irks me the most about the game the fact you need BP the game's currency just to edit your character appearance. And it's not cheap either it's a wopping 3k BP. That's quite a grind to get especially if you aren't that great at the game. Dev's should seriously consider letting you alter your character appearance for free considering it has no in game effect whatsoever I feel this is a pretty low blow to do to your playerbase.Overall A very great game especially for the price. It is a lot of fun solo OR with a group. If you like 1st/3rd person shooters and battle royale games do not miss out on this one. Game seems to go on sale fairly often too so if you can snag it on sale even better. This is a game you can sink a lot of hours into and have a lot of fun doing it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-28,1,2,722,True,Not Recommended,This game needs a lot of ing work. Instead of fixing bugs the developers want to add more ing features so they get more sales. Scummy Some bugs/Stupid Viewmodel bugs (People can peek seeing all of you but you only see their arm/elbow) Too many hackers (People who use ESP are EXTREMELY common. Aim botters not so much. Only came across 2 aim botters from what i know) Chinese invasion Most of the hackers i mentioned above are chinese. They play on EU servers only it seems. There are also too many chinese players who are just simply abusing their ping to gain the upper hand. There needs to be region locks on PUBG to block the toxic chinese community out. Gun combat is just ing awful. I wish i could say they nailed the head on gun combat but they really ing didn't. Let's start with shot guns. There is only one shot gun that is useable on this game and that is the double barrel shotgun. It is to op and needs nerf'd. It can one tap people with level one armour/helmets from about 25m. Snipers are useless because there isn't one sniper that can one tap level 2 armour (full health). Not even the AWM. Rifles aren't too bad the ak is just for range. The SMGs need to be nerf'd so people cannot run and gun. Zone camping. There are too many people who camp inside the zone to get easy kills. The devs need to add something so it's harder to see when you are in the blue but when looking into the blue it's almost clear. This would reduce these toxic players. FPS Lag. This game runs terribly. I have a GTX 1080 i7 and 32gb of ram and still can't get good frame rate. Desync lag. The game is not skill based at all in the first 5 minutes. It is to laggy. You could hit someone 4 times with a shotgun just to get one tapped. Oh but you didn't shot 4 times according to the server.I refuse to let the devs get away with the 'beta' game t. If its a ing beta game then make the game playable and actually treat it like a beta instead of whoring out your game for money. Have some self respect. I am only listing the negative things because they need fixed and pandering to the devs isn't going to get this fixed. I don't even know why I put hours into this game anymore. The devs don't give a about it only their cash flow.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,After 40 hours of experience of play PUBG i have experienced positives and negatives. The difference is the positives as of now do not out weigh the negatives. Yes PUBG is a tremendous amount of fun but only for those with extreemly high end gaming pcs. I have a really good pc running the game with a 1070 and a high end I5 and i still had bother with buildings loading in at the start of the game and crashing. Even others i know with 1080tis had the same issues. This makes it difficult to even get to start enjoying a game as textures not loading at the start of the match is game changing lettings others enter buildings and get weapons to kill you before you can even see that the building is there but that is even if you can enter the match because 50% of the time it'll crash before you can get in the game. The problem is at the moment the developers are working too much on microtransactions (WHICH I HATE THE IDEA OF) and the xbox release as apposed to finishing the game they started. Yes this is a pre release game but at least focus on releasing it on the platform it was intended for before porting it onto a new console.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But good thing is they suck at this game so you can have some ez kills until they not start their cheats cuz they are really like them.2. If you have bad PC as me (im playing with 25 40 fps most time with often drop to 20 fps when shooting) just buy better pc im kinda used to to playing games with low fps D. But its not too bad I can still get lot of kills.3. Cheaters most of them are from China...4.Can t mute exact person in my squad only can mute whole squad.5. For some people can be looting really boring. I dont have fun when im in start of the game dont have single kill and then you are close to end game and still dont have kill and you get killed by someone and have 0 kills and then you realize this game was useless.But as i said game is still really fun to me and for many people.

At the end of the early access period I can only hope that they renege on their statement about completely preventing players from getting cosmetics without paying for it.Edit Following Bluehole's whining about Epic's Fortnite BR mode being a ""copy"" of the PUBG formula I'm shocked at the arrogance and naivety of this company that thinks its created the ultimate version of the battle royale game. Bluehole your servers are most of your game is store bought assets repurposed crudely to fit the map and your optimisation is still terrible after more than 6 months in early access.

Unable to open door at the start of the game because the game have to load textures is really great when you hear gunfight close to you )GRAPHICS it looks blurry not matter what setting I use hard to distinguish someone over 50 meter if there's many details around him (like a car of window) I play on 1080p 24"". I assume it's caused by FXAA ( lowest AA setting doesn't fix it)GAMEPLAY the gunfights are boring as hell and I see you coming THIS IS NOT A REALISTIC GAME. Realism is a just pretext to introduce arcade gameplay like Battlefield series is. You move like you wear a 60 kg jacket. Jumping feels painful.

2017-06-20,1,2,387,True,Not Recommended,Started the game. Played for about 45 minutes on one map just to get a crate that got me an item 0 03$ worth.. great. Decided my pc sucks because i was getting 30 fps. Bought new pc close to high end. Downloaded game went into options put on ultra... barely 70 fps. Optimalization disgusting. Gameplay not even challenging. You are running around the whole map for 1 hour just to get 10+ kills and then getting shot in the head with one bullet dying. And if you manage to get that 1st place all you get is a few points that you get to spend on your C R A T E that will get you 0 03$ worth of items... Conclusion Optimalization very sad Gameplay ? Not challenging. No Ranking that will keep you pumped up. Glitchy as hell. Just to mention this game isnt even worth 30$ ofc its not full yet maybe i will change this review in the next few months. Or maybe the developers will abandon it. I am here just to say that my 30$ weren't worth this game and i am really sad that i heard all the commotion around this game bought a new pc and got barely 60fps stable ? Great no more hate i guess.Positives are maybe that this is probably more fun to play with friends than rival H1Z1 and you have more joy in looting.Overall 5/10.Unless you get it for half the price its not worth it not yet.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-14,0,0,82,True,Not Recommended,"Idk what you guys are doing over there at Bluehole but no one appreciates being lied to. I have no clue what was in this newest update which caused it to be 5GB but this myth to your development team called ""optimisation"" is actually hilarious at this point. Your claim that you have improved optimisation issues is totally false. When someone who can play a game on the Frostbite engine at a stable 90fps cant get over a stable 50fps something is TOTALLY wrong with your game especially when it's on the Unreal Engine which when used by developers with actual talent can be a super crisp and smooth experience. the TL DR of this dont throw all of your development money into a tournament for a game that is in Early Access. That money can go towards systems for the game improving your god awful servers optimising the game so everyone has a great experience creating new Points of interests or new maps as a whole creating new weaponry creating a variety of strange but interesting game modes.All you guys are doing is riding off of the interest your game has picked up and this will die off the second a Triple A company gets on this amazing genre which you are making a mess of. This is the reason why you guys are putting dev money to tournaments to gain more temporary popularity and a cheeky little profit which wont even go towards the game.

However instead of fixing the vehicles or the buggy sounds they decide to hold a tournament in Germany. And instead of fixing ""sometimes buildings just don't load"" glitch or the crashes they add new weapons or vehicles. Instead of fixing the doors or the frequent network connectivity issues they decide to add crates that cost real money to open.Even with public outcry for these bugs to be fixed they decide to go out and try to make it as close to an esport as possible without it even being a 'fixed' game. The devs only seem to listen when there is a huge issue or listen to new additions to the game instead of fixing bugs. It's so endlessly frustrating but I give it the benefit of the doubt because of it being in early access.

Need a decent PC to handle this game even at medium quality 2. When people shoot you you can't tell where the shots are coming from and normally you would have a super hard time spotting the enemies.3. The loot drops are so ing messy . All the loot is gold in color and to know what kind of ammunition you are about to pick up you would have to point your crosshair at the item so the name of the item would pop out.4. Extremely boring game . It should be called ''Player Unknown's Running Ground'' because if you can't find a vehicle you would run around for the whole map and then just die from some dude camping in a building 500 meters away sniping your off.This game really got me disappointed and I am glad that I made the right decision to refund it . 35 USD for this game no thanks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-20,1,2,187,True,Not Recommended,Game has a lot of potential but currently largely unplayable. You better have a good rig to play this on i don t think minimum requirements are correct. I have i5 2500K 16 Gb ddr3 and gtx 960 4Gb and game runs at like 15 fps at lowest possible settings and when fire fight breaks out it drops for around 5 fps which means that firefights literally often last for 3 frames and there is no chance to do anything if you are spotted. Sounds are very glitched which probably are because of general lag and sound localisation appears to be occasionally reversed. Sounds are your most imporant tool of detecting another players so this a huge deal. Graphics feel glitcy but that might my rig though.Game itself is very much about looting camping dying to campers dying to blue wall of death that does way too much damage on late game and often forces you to run across open field when there are enemies shooting you from cover. Of my last 10 times in top 10 blue circle screwed me over 8 times and so far i ve found no cure for it but to get lucky with camping spot. Shooting is very laggy for me atleast and most of time bullets seem to hit but not register. Shotguns only work on people standing still moving targets might take 2 shells to head and not be affected by them. At early game it takes a second for clicks to register whether it is opening a door or picking up an item. Melee fights are match between 2 ghosts because lag makes it look like you punches are hitting air and then dying 10 meters away from your opponent having punched you in the face ages ago.Could be lots of fun but there is a ton of updates bug fixes and balancing that need to come first. It s an realy access game and it feels like it. I d probably recommend this for gamers with new computers and good internet connection but not for anyone else.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,1,2,5,True,Not Recommended,I love the idea and it's not bad but after playing for a couple of matches I've got several complaints. Most importantly is the lag caused both by the network and I suppose my system though I am running a 7th gen i7 processor and 16gb of ram this game has a really tough time rendering things and causes my game to freeze up. My internet speed is also 30mbps so I'm not sure why there would be a problem in that regard. MY system has no problem running heavier loads so I don't think the game itself is properly optimized yet. My next complaint is that the map is so damn big for just 100 people honestly. The timers in which the play area shrink and the rate at which it does seems way too quick. It sucks to spend majority of the game running to the play area only to get there and be killed by the people who found the vehicles first and secured a good camping location. I think another year or two in development would do this game justice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-27,0,0,339,True,Not Recommended,"Honestly I thought I would really enjoy this but that is not the case.It's buggy as hell. I appreciate it's still early access but they've got the funding. They have a button on the main page to 'refresh the UI incase it's buggy'. If that isn't an indicator of what to expect I don't know what is.Performance is terrible. People with modest rigs still suffer from poor fps.It's so clunky. Things you can't walk up or climb over are just beyond frustrating. Putting your gun to a window or over a desk prevents you from doing so. When you think you're picking up ammo off the floor you end up picking the gun instead you switch back but then have to reload the gun again even though it was previously loaded.The maps are so large half the time it feels like a walking simulator. You spend 50% of your time staring at the floor for items 49% walking and 1% shooting.The general gun mechanics are strange. There's been several times I've pumped a full round into someone (the blood spats are an indicator it hit) and the player is still alive and shoots you dead in one. Other times I've shot someone with a shotgun from 25 meters away and killed them in 1 hit.The devs themselves are poor too and act like children. It's just a massive cash cow now. Here's why Bringing in micro transactions during early access is just unethical especially after the amount it's made in sales there's no excuse. Bringing in micro transations when they clearly stated they didn't. So that was a massive lie. They ban people for stream sniping and even those that aren't. There's no care for their players. They support the streamers because it's their way of marketing and getting more sales. They ban people from their forum that have posted a polite opinion.

2017-11-10,0,0,326,True,Recommended,"My first experience with PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds (""PUBG"") was a rather negative one. I had read all there was to read about the game's horrible optimization yet still had a glimpse of optimism that I wouldn't be a victim of it. But that first game I got into threw all that optimization out the window when the game barely functioned at all despite me having good enough hardware.I set the settings all down to the bare minimum everything to low and then the game finally started functioning at a good and playable framerate. I dive into the technicalities first before any other aspect of the game because this is a game that will stress you out and disturb you with its poor performance. There will be times when menu buttons won't function you'll see errors you can'r resolve and have to restart and simply bugs that make you want to pull your hair out.Furthermore if you have anything less than extremely good hardware get ready to play with poor graphics since that's most the settings will let you go without causing you to stutter and get very low framerates. The excuse for all of this is that it's in Early Access and thus it's 'understandable'. What remains to be seen is if the issues are resolved by the time the game gets out of the early access stage (if that time ever comes).But if you can ignore all of that there really is something to be had in PUBG. The concept is fairly simple you take 100 people throw them on a large island that has ruins houses buildings vehicles towers military bases and above all weapons. They scrounge the island for whatever arsenal and armor they can find and fight until one remains. Eventually the playable area begins to lower until a small chunk of land is left upon which the final victor will stand.This simple concept is taken and presented in a way that makes every match feel unique despite the same objective. A lot of this is because of the large map that is quite vast in size. Aside of the re use of the house models that are scattered across the island each location feels different and thus leads to fun experiences each time. The main thrill of the game comes from all the hiding guessing and killing you'll be doing as you try to make your way to the final few survivors. I'd give this game a thumbs down if I hadn't too felt that rush of being among the last 10 people as you see the area around you closing in gunfires running ablaze in the distance and you're hiding in a patch of grass hoping to make it to the end and get the glorious chicken dinner. That thrill is really what this game's all about and I feel as long as the developers are commited to solving the bugs and fixing the technical issues of the game there is a lot to be had and experienced in PUBG.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I played this game to death over that first summer of it's release and I had a blast throughout. I met some friends on this game that I still talk to more than a year later. This game was released very early when the battle royale genre was getting popular and was basically the better version of H1Z1 in my opinion. I can still remember my first game on landing at Mylta power and getting pummled but trying again and showing my friends as we sunk 100's of hours into it. Some of the best time of my life were playing this game. But then update 1.0 came out. It was hyped up to be this great update which would add cool new things like more weapons vaulting a new entire map to play on new vehicles to drive and more. My friends and I were so hyped up about it but when it came out we were sorely dissapointed. We played it for maybe 5 hours and thought this new map sucks the game hasn't been fixed why is this not early access anymore why do the new weapons feel awful why are there more bugs than before? We thought the update would change the game forever and it did in the worst way possible. This game used to be filled with passion and the creator wanted to do something with this but maybe the over popularity ruined it for us.

2017-06-13,0,0,131,True,Not Recommended,4/10 A game that has less to do with survival and more to do with a roulette wheel of server lag spikes and game crashes that define the user experience from the start of the game. Delibiating server lag renders this game completely unplayable. Resulting in minute or greater lag spikes in a situation when seconds count. Couple that with the poorly compressed graphics that are slow to render in the first place. The result is a game that looks like it's from the mid 1990s and runs like it too. Due to it requiring the user to run at the lowest setting even if they play every other game at highest graphics settings.A game with a lot of potential that ultimately falls short of being fun because of the numberious technical issues the interrupt the user experience at every turn.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game has got to be the slowest most boring shooter i have ever played. RNG loot system means good luck when landing in a high pop area all beats are off. You either get the good or you die quick. And if thats not bad enough the community is nothing but a bunch of mouth mic idiots and camp like no other game i have played.

Game is extremely buggy and no region lock allows foreigners join servers for ping advantages making it hard to kill them but allows you to get shot around walls. The devs only care about their paid streamers and have banned innocent people that killed a streamer because they stream sniped them (put a 20 second delay on problem solved). Even though they made millions they re now focusing on porting this game to consoles because of this they stopped releasing weekly updates that fixed and improved their game while promised updates on new maps game modes and features are rarely mentioned now or have been severely delayed from original timelines.

So killing people in a game where you kill people might get you banned.Controls are clunky be prepared for mass frustration trying to jump over a low obstacle.Incredibly unforgiving for new players. No matchmaking system so you'll spend 95% of your games for the first few months getting killed and not knowing how. Be prepared to mute your voice chat options as soon as you buy the game the people in the lobby are constantly screeching.Roughly one quarter of the games I drop into have all the buildings missing or not rendered which means you just waste all your queue time and have to leave.Server Lag usually results in lost gunfights at point blank. Matchups are usually decided by who shoots first not positioning.Chase down opponent with crowbar. Swing at pointblank range and miss. Opponent kills you with long rifle.Game just banned 25 000 accounts or so for cheating but has sold millions of copies and doesn't have adequate cheat protection.0/10 for realism when it tries to be realistic.Edit Post Release Everything is the same as the last few months people are still cheating my gun dissapeared in the middle of a fight and sound turns off for no reason.Pre game non loading makes play impossible.

If you are going to have a test server and you find issues ON THE TEST SERVER. Maybe you should FIX THEM! Week 2 of most recent patch Kept playing on the advice of others. The issues still persist AND now there are massive frame drops in fire fights. I have a 1080ti a 6700K and 32GB of RAM. Not to mention Gigabit internet. This is all on your end and I am sick of it. I will come back to your game when your idiot developers fix it.Week 3 of most recent patch Crashes are more rampant than ever. This update is the worst I have ever seen added to a game. Still a HARD NO from me!Week 4 of most recent patch It has now been over a month since the most recent update and it is still incredibly broken. I have gigabit internet and a computer that can play witcher 3 on ultra with hair effects on... Yet in this game I get insane frame drops and network lag like nobodies business. I am done coming in second in solo due to massive frame drops and lag. Get your together. If I could refund this game I would!Week 5 of most recent patch Still so broken people can see through walls and shoot through walls. Servers with their dsync are so disfunctional that asians to go US servers just to get easy kills and vice versa... Week 8 All of these issues still persist even after a FIVE GIG UPDATE!

2017-08-10,0,0,400,True,Recommended,Feel like I should post a review with all the people that have been dogging on this game lately. Yes its early access and i know people are weary of that I've been burned on a few early access games in the past and there have been some issues with servers but i would not hesitate to buy this game at $30 as it sits. If it were left as is id still be happy.Pros Its a steal at $30Huge and growing player baseDevs have been great with updates and supportGameplay is great and every match is excitingCons As with every early access game there are bugs with updates but nothing to worry too much over and always dealt with quicklyEvery once and a while theres some bad server lag but have been coming across it less and less People have also been complaining about buying keys for these new crates but I think thats completely unwarranted. First of all the crate is bought with in game currancy you get for playing matches and there are other crates you can choose to get that open for free. Second its an optional key you can buy to open a crate which just contains cosmetic items. If you buy a crate somehow by accident and dont want to buy a key THE CRATE IS MARKETABLE. (I've nearly made back purchase price of the game with crates) Its not some sort of pay to win thing. The proceeds are to raise money for charity and a tournament set up/prize pool not an uncommon occurrance. I have gotten way more than $30 worth of entertainment out of this game so far (150+ hours) and would highly reccomend buying before full release.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The first major problem is the games framerate even if you do meet the system requirements. Another is the weapon balancing which could be easily fixed (and I look forward to seeing progress on this aspect). The last major problem is the glitches and bugs but these are to be expected in an early access game.

2018-02-16,0,0,132,False,Recommended,"This game is broken. I love it. The devs on the other hand... they basically called their own playerbase a bunch of racists because us Americans didnt want to play with China... from across the globe. The Chinese are over 99% of the hackers in this game and when you play an online game with people from across the globe especially with 100 people in one game you're gonna experience some ping issues. Anyways the maps are nice eriandel being the obviously better map the graphics are nice at least when they aren't bugging out and the different guns and attachments are nice. The customization is really good (buy a gas mask it's only like 15 cents now). The part of this game that keeps me coming back to it however is the rush that you get either at the beginning of a game when you land with several other people and you are scrambling to get any weapon you can before rushing the others or at the end of a game when there are only a fraction of the original number of players left and you don't know where anyone is unless they are shooting... it really makes you think quickly and my palms sweat almost every match.This game is worth the $30 in my opinion. It is not ""easy to learn hard to master "" as they say. It is the opposite of that. Beginners will be on. That is part of the game. Once you get half decent and start winning some games or at least coming close the game gets fun. It gets competitive. You get mad when you lose at the end of the game or even when you get sniped in the head from nowhere. but that's all part of the random nature of the game. If every fight was fair then you would never get those moments where your opponent has the upper hand but you come out on top anyways. When your enemy gets the first shot but then you get to cover and end up winning. Those moments are priceless.If you know how to take a loss this game is for you. If you like competitive shooters like CS GO but want a sort of break from all the action though it somehow being more intense then this game is for you. If you have a small group of friends to play with (or a nice discord you use) then this game is a great time in duos or squads. Try it out. If you don't like it refund it. If you do have a good time.8/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They literally do ban people for reasons that are beyond questionable and by their own admission unprovable like the honking BS. There are artticles on it on the net. Then you have the lame streamers put out a video a few days ago to try to push their narrative showing an alleged ""stream honker"". There are NO other videos on the internet to support this claim. There is this 1 viedo with the same 2 honkers each time driving STRAIGHT to the streamers like the streamers are telling them where to go or a pre set point. The video was posted Aug 23rd. The original unedited videos that were supposedly used to make this video are NO WHERE to be found.Very pathetic. The reason a few streamers are allowed to pull this garbage is in my opinion they are friends with the creator. I know Grimmz is one of his best friends and more than likely the person that is referrenced as giving Green the idea to make a ""Hunger Games"" type Battle Royal. The picture used in every article of the ""sniper"" is GRIMMZ FFS. If you don't think so take a good look and compare the 2. It's him.Now there is also a butt load of cheating in PUBG.

They don't want to do the real mod work of moving/combining posts making pins etc... So they just flame and delete because they are lazy. That is why sooo many posts get vaped.

""I know a lot of the people in the game industry think they're scum. I really don't think that. I've been lucky enough to call a few of them friends. You know they're not necessarily bad people all they want to do is just find holes in things. Like as you're growing up you wanted to take apart the radio to see how it works. That's the kind of mentality they have.""A lot of the guys who buy the cheats yes I would put call them just cheaters. But all the people who write the cheats they're just looking for an outlet for something that they love doing.""If you come here and read reviews I would pose questions on other reviews not the forums because you will only get a biased view there.

I'd prefer to kill myself than play alone but with friends its fun. s hiding in bushes and proning is still an annoying thing that makes me want to quit every once in a while but other than the factor that playing like a total gives you the upper hand in every situation the game overall isnt bad (im keeping the review as a no because s are ""fun"" to play against).(also ps.

2017-05-20,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,I don't recommend this game in it's current form even though it is early access. The servers are extremely low quality and the developers have announced that they have to rebuild a large portion of the core game code in order to stop the horrendous desync and other player lag. Being shot and killed seconds after taking cover is unfortunately a normality in this game (think early Battlefield 3 style only much worse).As for gameplay this is absolutely NOT H1Z1. The gunplay is far better and the overall feel is aimed towards a realistic approach. It's essentially a game of who spots who first in a lot of cases and unfortunately again with the desync sometimes even that's not good enough. Gunfights are largely a coin toss to see who's hits register first if at all.The good news is that the developers are very attentive to problems and are quickly working on improving the game and adding new features along the way. I will update this once the desync issues are fixed and the game is in a much better state. If the majority of the desync can be eliminated and the server quality improved this will be a really great battle royale. It's popularity has already gotten Daybreak to move their butts and actually work on fixing H1Z1 and communicating with their playerbase which is tremendous as well.Edit Love the downvotes for honesty and transparency keep 'em coming. Broken game is broken don't believe the hype folks.Edit 6/25/17 Performance on the GPU side has increased tremendously which is to be congratulated. Hit reg especially melee is still a massive issue whereas desync doesn't seem to be as bad as it was. Unfortunately I've also come across my first definite cheater though I suppose that's to be expected with the massive increase in popularity lately. Unfortunate really ruined an otherwise okay run.Edit 4/14/18 Recently revisited PUBG with a friend and I have to say the optimization is currently feeling really great. My i7 2600K/GTX 980 system didn't have a single complaint in the frame department. The new map is also pretty cool and the updated UI is clean and minimally intrusive which I always approve of. I can't speak on network stability since we only managed to squeak in about 3 very quick rounds. I understand there is much to be desired in the area of destructable objects (fences window bars etc) which is unfortunate. Once I manage to get a few good rounds in I'll update again.Edit 4/17/18 Having played a few more rounds I have to say I still really haven't had a good chance to shoot at anyone. The game continues to be one of whoever spots the other first generally wins the exchange. One major complaint I have is that at one point I ended shooting at a duo with my duo partner he ended up getting dropped and we got flanked by another team. I peeked into a guy around a shack and fired about 5 rounds directly into his face and I died. My teammate in spectator reports that I fired once at best. I'm not sure if this continues to be due to the abysmal tick rate the game runs at or if desync/lag is still a major issue but I was pretty disappointed. I'm still looking to get a couple solid rounds in where I'm able to fire at people multiple times in the round before I commit to an updated score.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-07,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,I really do like this game but it's sad I HAVE to give this game a negative review. Now the main reason why this is all negative is because of the god damn optimization. It's complete crap! It's worse then GTA IV for crying out loud!I was in a match just a second ago and I had 5 kills I was on a role. There was 20 people left I was in cover waiting for someone. Then boom. The game freezes and crashes. My specs aren't even bad I have an i3 4160 3.60 GHz 16 GB DDR3 RAM 2000 MHz and a GTX 1050... like seriously? It crashed... And I can bet you I didn't get any credit for that match at all like it didn't even happen. That was actually my best match ever until it crashed...Another thing I forgot to mention the loading times are now horrid as hell it usually hasn't taken me that long to get into any matches but it took so long one time I spawned in when there was only 60 people left... Yes I said 60 when it started at 100 players. My internet isn't even bad I don't suffer from ping lag or teleporting in the game at all.So I'll go over some pros and cons.Pros Great Graphics Pretty entertaining as a battle royale typed gameCons Horrible optimization Servers USUALLY aren't always working... Textures take for ever to load in Good amount of hackersIf anything I don't recommend getting this game at full price only because of the reasons I've listed. It isn't worth 30 dollars unless they fix the god damn optimization... That's my big issue that I honestly can't stand.

2017-03-31,1,5,2,True,Not Recommended,I was hoping for this game to be the ultimate battle royale game but I think PLAYERUNKNOWN and his asian dev team bit off a bit more than they can chew.THE GRAPHICS Long story short this game is not a looker. I run everything at 2K on ultra but still the graphics are mediocre and the design choices are nothing special at all. It's like they just decided slavic name y towns and cities are survival themed so they went with it. Character customization is pretty much non existant with very limited choices in different models of hair and the likes. Even the clothing options are limited with only 2 jackets with 5 skins in total. This means every character you meet will look like the other one you just got shot by.The map is not up to standards with todays other games. The scale is off with roads being maybe up to 3 times the size of a normal road so they could fill the map more. The landscape has no real life to it with a severe lack of bushes rocks and difference in terrain height something that is even more noticeable with the washed out and lifeless grass textures. Things are pretty samey aswell when it comes to construction you will see buildings being repeated and small details like most doors looking the same. In graphics and design the tiny details matter and I'm not familiar with the development teams previous games but it looks like they don't have the creative art &amp design department to think of something intresting and original.THE GAMEPLAY It's OK. It's nothing new if you have ever played H1Z1 ArmA or Rust's Battle Royales. Once you go through the small amount of lootable weapons there are in the shipping of the early access theres only the PvP perspective left to the game. Which is quite enjoyable but hindered by a bad FOV (It's pretty bad if you look down your head is in your chest.) meaning you try to use 3rd person as often as possible. This brings the review to the fatal flaw of the game so far which is the implementation of 3rd person. You will always be able to win through hiding in grass and behind buildings using 3rd person to look over the obstacles. The person who is moving is more than often the one who loses any fight. The gameplay is therefore slowed down to a crawl in some moments with no one wanting to show themselves. I've heard roumors about a first person only server but I dont know if theres any confirmation. It's the same problem that plauged ArmAs BR until people started enforcing first person only on their servers.The game is basically an inbetweener of ArmA and H1Z1 with the good sides and bad sides of both. Im guessing if you like both you'll find this game an alright game to play with friends. If you really like either one you will be fanny flustered about having to deal with the flaws of another game.FINAL RATING 4/10Atrocious creative work with a bland unoriginal game setting. Too much emphasis on gameplay without dealing with the flaws of either of the two games that PLAYERUNKNOWN previously worked on. The gameplay is still alright though meaning the game does have alot of potential but it's probably too late in the development to change any of its major flaws. I'll keep an eye out on this game to see if it ever changes it's course but for now I see no reason to play it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However the devs have been moderatley active in working with this game to make it a more enjoyable experience. so far they have made much needed balance adjustments to most weapons which has ""shifted the meta"" to a more pleasant pvp point. they have still neglected the plethora of physics problems in the game however driving and jumping in PUBG are still almost unbearable tasks that are neccisary in every match. im not going to touch on my problems with the 3rd person camera at the moment since news suggests its a feature that may very well be on its way out fingers crossed. hopefully that will be the last nail in the coffin that is some of the super campy playstyle of this game. where people can watch you from total saftey without giving up any info on themselves until they can easily jump you without any risk at all.while being lacking in content each match still feels unique and interesting. they have introduced a new custom match system that adds some diversity to the matches however it is not accesable for anyone to set up an unfortunate decision. all of that being said i still would not reccomend this game at its current state at the 30$ price point.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is not meant to be a platform for social justice and it's defintely not supposed to be a soapbox even if what I am doing might be along those lines but I will actually recommend the game on it's merits.I would probably play a lot more of this game if it ran better on my machine or if I had any actual skill but even as things are I'm pretty happy with what I get for my money. I would recommend this game to others especially to play with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,it's fun and a lot better than h1z1 but it's not worth 30 bucks. not even 20 if you ask me. absolutely terribly optimized. they made 11 million dollars on this. they should be able to finish the game in no time with that on of money but I reckon they will hire like one or two new staff members at most and slowly patch the glaring issues over the next 4 years. like every early acces pile of don't get me wrong I enjoy it. but it's definitely not worth your money right now,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-27,0,0,84,True,Not Recommended,I bought the game as it actually looks amasing. I expected to have no problems as I have really good specs but whenever I play I play at like 1 frames per second. I've done everything thats possible to fix it but it's still horrible. I know this might be an exception but im really annoyed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-21,2,8,4,False,Not Recommended,Personally I find this game hard to recommend. I really don't see how much fun it is when you end up spending so much time trying to find people. And I don't mean matchmaking. This game has got plenty of people playing and not even close to dead. I'm talking about how long it takes to find people when you decide to avoid high traffic areas to minimize your chances of dying early in the match. It's a first for me but I actually have a problem with the map size being so huge. Like ridiculously huge. It's larger than anything I've seen in Battlefield 1's multiplayer. Sure there's a player limit of 100 but that's very little for the amount of ground you'll have to cover if you can't get any long range weapons or a vehicle. There's also no tutorial so go on Youtube or hope your favorite streamer that plays this game is willing to teach you how to play. Other than that my only other issue is the frame drops but it's pretty minor for my PC. Not sure how it would fair on a mid range PC but I've heard it does pretty decent on a gtx 1060 and any decent CPU. The controls feel a little weird at first but you get used to it after a while. Now as for the positives. The game starts you off in a pre game lobby where you can pick up weapons and practice using them until the 100th player joins. Usually not a long wait as those lobbies fill up in seconds. I really like the survival feel of the game. You have to find weapons and supplies to survive and run away from a blue dome of death. There's also random airstrikes and supply drops with valueble items such as a sniper or medkit. It has this sort of Hunger Games like fell to it just without some prize at the end and the gaming telling something about a chicken dinner. All in all it's not a bad game. I just don't enjoy it much and think that people who play similarly to me might also feel the same. I'd say give it a shot if the game is on sale. Otherwise you may or may not feel like you just wasted $30 on an over hyped game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,149,True,Recommended,Let me start by saying this is the best battle royal game i have played and i have played all except h1z1's but that waas due to UI and loot mechanics(i didnt like the inventory).First ill give the pro points.PRO Large map it has a lot of areas from thick forest to thinned out forest and lots of cover from rocks to bushes and other random set pieces. Lots of swimmable areas and even a town that is flooded. Military bases and military checkpoints all the way to hunting huts. There are also nice little hidden loot spots too which is nice. Loot. As said every building you can see spawns loot. All of them. There is not one human made structure that doesn't give you loot. Weapons. As of now there isn't a massive array of weaponary but what is there is very useful from pisols smg to sniper rifles ALL have a high leathality. My highest killing gun is the UMP which is a 9mm varient in this game and it destroys people within 20meters. There is not one gun that doesn't feel like it is useless. Also lots of attachments from RDS SIlencers and 12x scopes. Buildings. All are very well designed and i feel that the layout inside feels realistic to what a house would have. I mean compared to something like ARMA where you don't know where someone would sleep let alone take a dump this game actually has toilets pantrys bedrooms and kitchens. This is useful because it lets you pick better locations in side of the house to have a gunfight in and more objects to hide behind. Servers. OCE Asian South American North American and Euro as of now are in the game which is nice. The latency is great and i have not had one issue yet with my connection to any of the servers i have tried (Asian NA and OCE) with 180ms to NA servers and 30ms to Australian/OCE servers. Server load. 100 people in a lobby/match. Short que time with minimal lobby time wait of only 2 minutes tops. If the lobby notices that no one else is joining it will auto start the game after a count down. This means you can have 30 or so people in a lobby then it will start which can at times be annoying but still is nice if you want to play late at night and just have a really intense match with a small amount of people. Cars/boat. 3 to choose from at the moment and one boat. All drive very nice compared to Wildlands(the ubisoft game) with minimal issues bar one for me which is that some times it takes a while for the game to notice im trying to enter the car. Not sure if bug or just locational activation issue. Weather. It can rain. Not sure if anything else but its nice to have that feature to change up the match. I personally hate it because you can hardly hear anyone around you plus it causes frame issues for me but thats because my computer is pretty garbage. Team and solo mode. Okay now this is what worried me about this game. But it was instantly settled once i started playing. Solo means SOLO no teams at all or teaming. I mean people could team up but i have never seen it. Duo is 2 people only and Squad is up to 4 players you can enter with 2 or 4 if you want or you can just go totally solo into squad for an insane challange. Medical supplies. It takes time to use meds i know as a BR player healing can be very irritating to deal with in a fight as some can be fast and others non existant. In this game it takes 3 seconds for Bandage 6 for pain pills(which is an over time heal) 6 for first aid kits and 10 seconds or more for Medkit. CONS LOD issues. I personally get this because i have a normal HDD which is very old and needs to be replaced. But some other people i know have had this issue before. It causes buildings not to load in properly and feels like you are running 1 2fps. You think its your GPU but it isn't its your HDD or RAM being overloaded so it causes the computer to freeze up. A good fix for this is to make sure nothing else is running in the background prior to joining a game. This issue can last as long as your HDD is jammed up or at 100% load. Terrain/map issues. Remember with an Alpha or BETA game you will always run into these. Some times if you jump up onto something it will get you stuck and there are some locations on the ground or next to walls which will cause this same issue where you are floating. There are also some invisible walls but very few of those. Overall Optomization. Pretty much not fully optomized. Expect to change your settings to medium or low/verylow. This can be a pain but later the game will be fully optomized so just take your time. Voice chat. Lots of spam so you may aswell turn it off most times. Price. Pretty high right now so it can put you off. But if you love Battle Royal games it is so damn worth it i swear on me mum. Other than that i can't think of any other problems with the game. I am by no means a fanboi of this game i didn't even try get an Alpha version when they offered it. I thought it would be another Culling or a crappy version of H1Z1 but i am happily proven wrong. I know there are probably more pros/cons i could add but right now none are so glaringly visable that i need to add to this review. The only thing that bothers me the most is just my own hardware not keeping up with this game and that i can fix myself in my own time.REMEMBER THIS IS A BETA RELEASE REVIEW. I will continue to update this as they update their game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It happens here too only you have an angry line that kills you if you dont move fast enough....not to mention the idiot children that sit inside of it. Shooting in DayZ is alot like shooting here clearly hit the guy 6 times but hell just 180 head shot you. Chain link fences literally just eat bullets.Only game i know of that buildings just dont render. Play CSGO complain about hit reg come here realise CSGOs hit reg was a godsend compaired to this garbage where ol Jacky Chan flies from behind a tree and kills you through a mountian cause youre still on his client side hit detection because he has a 200 ing ping. But instead of fixing those lets add a crate you need to buy a key for.Pretty sure armor doesnt register some times either. Hit a guy 5 times with an M4 he doesnt die but youll be 3 shot by a UMP with a level 3 vest and helmet.Also the only game i know that takes pitty on the streamers as they were the main focal point for advertising this game for them.Loot is terrible. You go into a house find 5 3 pants and a hat. The guy landed next to you goes into a shed finds 2 assult rifles all his attatchments 90 rounds of ammo each and full armor.This game is literally H1Z1 with first person and ADS pritty much just playing this untill a better game comes out.Fix the de sync hit reg garbage and loot dispertion?....

However the paid for crate system is a break of their original statemets FAQ and promise where they said they would not implement them during early access. The pay for crate system is similar to CSGO It's gambling with your money becuase there is no gurantee that you will get a decent item. Also the fact that the crate system that was already in place with the game with each crate you buy during the week the price goes up.

2017-06-01,0,0,106,True,Not Recommended,You idiots at PUBG should allow punching while crouching. How can someone irl not punch while crouching? IdiotsI've played 10 hours in one day and after this 10 hours I have to say that its incredibly repetitive boring glitchy and crashes 1 in 5 games. You spawn and if you die within a few seconds of spawning then its back to waiting to find a game then waiting on the island then you finally parachute out of an airplane to do the same things over and over again. Also the all chat is an absolute disgrace... Every swear word under the sun is said in the lobby and people make s*x noises and play very terrible noises too. The game itself requires a bit more to it.. I feel the player zones get restricted too soon. If you don't land in the middle of the map and don't find a vehicle its just 100% running the whole match just to get into the circle. So many negatives.. The positives are that its definitely exciting and gets the adrenaline going but theres not much else to it. I like it its just a bit boring.Biggest waste of time this game.I have 16 GB RAM and yet its still not enough. Absolutely disgusting memory hog.

This should not be happening on a high end rig like mine. Horrific servers constant frame drops really bad hit reg. The devs of this game decided to go on a week vacation once the game was out for a month on early access guess it shows how much they care about addressing issues with this game.

2017-08-31,1,1,556,True,Recommended,I personally really like this game. I think it has a lot of potential concidering it's only in the beta faze. There are a lot of things that need fixed. For example better optimization. I shouldn't have any problems streaming the game in ultra when I spent $2 000.00 on my PC (hand built). Other than that it has a lot of fun moments especially with friends. Maybe consider making the game 150 players to have more action throughout the game rather than have a game where getting 6 kills is decent. Also enabling FPP leaderboards (which I am aware will eventually happen) and enabling some form of system disallowing countries playing outside of their servers. This creates inconsistency with the game because of lag compensation. Regardless of all of the flaws it's a great game and I still recommend. Just some constructive critisism in a positive light.

2017-12-20,0,0,192,False,Recommended,PUBG is a pretty great game but it can also be pretty annoying when you die 20 times in a row and cant get a single kill. When I first wrote this review I said I have never met hackers while playing this but now I take it back most games I play (not actually most games but pretty frequent) usually end up with me dying from either really skilled players or hackers (I hope its hackers) and thank god they added death cams it helps me determine who is legit and whos a hacker (sometimes its hard to tell as lag could just be a result of how the player was able to kill)Another thing about PUBG is that everyone got butthurt over the loot crates being added to the game the only thing lootcrates do is give your character clothes to wear and the clothes only change how your character looks they dont change how much damage you do or anything it just changes the way your character looks and heck its a great way to make some steam wallet money too.Also whenever i play a squad match or duos (i play in NA servers) i always seem to be paired with people who dont speak english it isnt all that bad but its hard to communicate when you dont understand what your teamate is saying and vice versa Im not sure if i just have bad luck at finding partners but its either im in a team filled with non english speakers or theres only one person who speaks english besides me. (Ive had some pretty fun squad matches though with guys that dont or can barley speak/understand english so it isnt all that bad but its hard to coordinate)Finally in terms of rubberbanding matches and shots not registering none of those things have ever happened to me. The only time I have had rubberband connection was when my wifi was incredibly slow so slow that it would take me 10 mins to connect to youtube (not really). For shot registration ive never seemed to have a problem with that but there have been times where when i kill a player right when they shoot and if the bullet hits me I don't take any damage at all.I would definitley recommend this game and play it with friends its much more fun that wayAlso with the recent updates they have fixed fps i can finally now get a solid 60 fps with most of my settings at low or medium,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-04,0,0,448,True,Recommended,Pubg is by far the best battle royale game to date the devs constantly update and improve the game toggle items to make the balance a little better and listen to the community (on the dev side) the community manager is an idiot but thats not really important. Everyone in this game gets upset over PR mistakes and takes it out on a great game.I play this game a lot I usually pull in a few wins a day/session which tens to be somewhere between 10% and 20% depending on how the games go. The only RNG in the game is looting at the start other then that regardless of how you ended up fairing out in the field with a pressing circle the person who shoots better and is smarter about positioning wins the fights.A lot of people hate this game because they want to play like CoD and get mad when they get cucked for being slightly below average intelligence but their ego doesnt allow then to see the fault is their own.

Stream Sniping False Bans If I kill a streamer and don't know they're streaming and they get salty I don't deserve to get banned. Not my fault there are salty streamers and salty 12 year old viewers.2. Optimization I ran everything on low to where it looked like Minecraft/Worse with an i5 4460S Intel HD 4600 with CPUCores and ran the game at 17FPS max. (I can run H1Z1 and CS GO at like 60 FPS Minimum)3. Overall Gameplay Not very fun. It takes about 60 minutes for an entire game to get complete and the game just feels weird. Also so much for 'No Microtransactions' Like ffs.Overall I rate this game at a 2/10. Has its flaws and has it ups. Mostly flaws.

2018-01-16,0,0,485,False,Not Recommended,"So I bought this game in EA status in August 2017 and back then I really liked this game although the performance and the movement system was awful. Right now i really wouldnt recommend this game because a few but major things 1. It's has left EA too early.Too many things like bad servers (it's impossible to pick up a weapon within the first 2 minutes) bad performance( e.g. I don't have a great PC but its still enough for games like BF1 but in this game i always get my frames dropping down to the 20 mark when sombody shoots im a radius where i can see the muzzle flash. A really big disadvantage in endgame scenarios) the awful netcode(bullets just disapearing when you are shooting with a sniper rifle with zeoring on) or bugs (my best one was when I drove with a 3 P motorcycle on Miramar and me and my car just teleported in the air where i fall of the motorcycle.. happened to me at least 3 times or the ""bug"" I really don't know if this is done by purpose or not when a nade is near you you'll get blown away or more just teleported 3m to your right/left which isn't that bad but you also catch speed so you'll most likley die because of ""falling"" *gg*) ruin the game but these things are present in most games right now and which I don't really feel disturbed.2. Loot allocationThis is by far the most common reason why people die early and I think is really unfair.In one of my scenarios I landed in Primorsk at a small cafe and 2 houses. I looted them and neither i found a weapon nor a backpack i died because someone pushed me. Sure this whole game is based on luck and less on skill(which is also not really nice) but this is just disatvantaging people and stealing their fun with the game.3. The communityThis is by far the most thing i hate about the game. The ability to ""revive"" a teammate wfter he got downed is meanwhile useless because of all the people finishing you because they are greedy. Sure somtimes its usefull tu finish somebody off but for example in early game when you land with 1 maybe 2 teams and one of them downs and finshes you off instead of baiting the other teammate to come to them. This is by far the most stupid thing people make and is the only thing why this game pisses me off sometimes. Also there are 3rd person abuser who are only camping behind walls or in houses. Fair enough yes when you play 3rd person you'll have to expect this to happen but some people are using 3rd person so execssive you will have no chance. But most important there are people just iterrupting a firefight by killing the site which isn't even a danger to the team interrupting and these most likley get killed by te site that was and is a danger but they didnt killed them because.. I DON'T KNOW. Well back then you really had fun playing this game because there weren't so many people playing this.. now it's only a massacre of tryhards and trolls which is the only thing why I don't really enjoy this game so much I did in EA.. right now I still like it because I am probably here since EAbut because of the changes PUBG has gone through i like to switch between PUBG and Fortnite because Fortnite is making more fun so far. So for everyone wanting to buy this game don't you wont enjoy it but also dont buy H1Z1 its also trash.

2017-12-20,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,Potential to be great just not in its current state. Server Dc's rubber banding and poor optimisation dont make it worthwhile.Fun but should not be released until the devs fix their issues.The problem is that with early access you expect problems but to have this game soon to be released in a few hours doesn't bode well for its future.Its still far too early to be taken out of early access and if they sell it as a finished product people will be and move on. Its far from finished and not ready for release.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think this is due to the amount of players playing and I think that they're just better than you. If I versed the best player Shroud I'd probably call hack because I got dicked that doesn't mean I go on the reviews saying the game is overrun with hackers it flat out isn't.

2017-06-26,0,0,103,True,Recommended,So far in PUBG I realized that I cannot mute earrape player in the spawn zone which lead to my headset literally ing breaking. Just like H1Z1 I get spawns with either only armor or only a weapon but never both. Hit registration seems to be laggy and I spectating is delayed and not as fun to watch. Nonetheless I am going to sink hundreds of hours into this game hoping that it wont become a dead cause like H1Z1. Good times have been had so far with duo and squad queues and I think that the game should get an optimization patch fairly soon. (Having a fairly great computer) I find it hard to run the game at 60+ FPS without heavy drops. I do recommend the game though to anyone that enjoys KOTH sort of games and I am certain these little things will be fixed with small patch releases in the future. We all have high hopes for the game and I really am excited to see this game work wonders. Good job 7.5/10!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-25,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,Unless you have a god computer and money to pay for such a rig do not buy this game. I have a fairly good computer built for gaming and this game runs terribly. Its such a simple game there is no reason why it should be running so awfully. I know the devs haves buckets of funds from sales but instead they decide to add a shine to rocks when they're wet over optimizing the damn game. Wait for a fix to the optimization or just dont buy it at all. It's fun when it works but thats only 30% of the time at most.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I also have to add that there is not a lot of other games in the genre i would say u should get even if they are free for example fortnite.

2017-07-21,0,0,134,True,Not Recommended,July 25th The devs announced they would be bringing microtransactions into the game before the full release was finished. This contradicts their promise from months ago that before bringing in any additional content they would finish the game in its entirety. A concerning trend in dishonesty and unprofessionalism by PlayerUnknown and his team is beginning to form.July 21st The current state of the game is decent and has potential but there are 2 areas the development team needs to take more seriously Improving in game performance and community moderation. The game runs better than it used a couple months ago but is still pretty bad especially when compared to other popular titles. Bullets rubber banding lag poor server performance and fps drops are all pretty significant issues. In regards to community moderation they need to actually start taking the way the banning and reporting system works more seriously. The current format is perfect for people that want to troll other groups of players and ruin their experience while recieving no punishment in return.

Instead of using their resources to one up Fortnite they are going to try to falsely sue their competition. Absolutely ridiculous. I hope they don't win the lawsuit. I mean you don't have control over a genre that you didn't create to begin with.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-02,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,"Listen BlueHole just because someone makes the same style of game as you doesn't mean they flat out copied you. You don't own the Battle Royal genre no one does. If it were the case that Medal of Honor's developers would've sued the living Hell of out of studios like Infinity Ward Treyarch and Activision for making Call of Duty. Blizzard would've sued Jagex over the MMO genre claiming Runescape ripped off World of Warcraft and Valve would've probably sued Blizzard on the grounds that Overwatch copies Team Fortress 2. No one own a game genre. The reason you're losing to Fortnite is because your game is more or less an asset flip with hardly any identity at all. Fortnite on the other hand has its assets made by competent artists and a very talented team of programmers and games designers. It's neither their fault nor their problem that you got salty because they out sold you. It's not their fault they were able to take a simple mechanic and do it better as well as give it its own identity. The most you own rights to are your Title screen and a few pieces of in game art that aren't even featured in the main portion of the game. Let's explore their talent vs your own shall we?In PUBG how do players drop into the map at the start of each match? They parachute in after leaping out of the back of a C 130 gunship. Okay pretty standard pretty generic. Not very exciting but not exactly appaling either.Now in Fortnite how do they do the same exact mechanic which you don't own btw BlueHole don't get it twisted that you own the mechanic of dropping into a map from the sky. How does Fortnite accomplish that? One jumps out of a bus carried by balloons and use a glider to land safely in the play space. That's unique. That's pretty exciting too. It stands out among other drop in sequences by being anything but run of the mill. Point for Fortnite.In PUBG aside from the Storm and shooting other players what unique mechanics do players work with? Well you can drive motorcycles and cars in PUBG. Some of them. Not all of them. Okay once again pretty run of the mill for a standard multiplayer focused shooter. Can be exciting to turn someone into paste if they step in front of you but nothing that most gamers haven't seen before.In Fortnite however they said to hell with vehicles (unless you count rocket hopping) and gave you a Minecraft esque building mechanic that lets you create structures cover and ammunition if you have the right materials on the fly and pretty damn quickly. Building properly is almost as important as being able to land shots on a target in Fortnite as it can mean the difference between defeat and Victory Royale.That previous point is up to the player preference. I personally prefer PUBG in this regard as it is a much more straight forward concept. However straightforwardness doesn't ship units and sadly Fortnite simply beats out PUBG in the realm of unique mechanics building mechanics like the ones displayed in Fortnite are really only seen in crafting heavy games such as Terraria and Minecraft.What's the art style for PUBG? And I mean the in game assets that players will be seeing from the moment they open the game to the moment they close to desktop (or shut of the console if they perfer to play there). Well PUBG has a somewhat ""in your face"" logo that shows up in the main menu and in some of the loading screens. The in game assets are...well generic. It looks like what it sets out to be. A map of a generic island in the middle of nowhere with a base a port a few small towns a school etc. But there's not a lot else there to set it apart from other games thrown together with store bought assets. PUBG's world is very bland and run of the mill and in my opinion boring.Fortnite on the other hand reminds me strikingly of a Saturday Morning Cartoon. It's art style is colorful and vibrant and with the addition of Save the World mode there's actually a narritive here a story that one can follow along and appreciate for what it is. The way the story is handled in Fortnite actually reminds me of how Titanfall 2 handled its story. The Campaign was designed to equate one to the mechanics of the Battle Royale mode. In this regard the world really shines when suddenly the whole mape is full of grotesque creature that wish nothing but ill towards the players that defend the generators.Art assets definitely go to Fortnite Fortnites style from its cartoony aesthetic to how it implements emotes and cosmetic items for its player base simply out classes and out paces PUBG piece for piece.How much is PUBG? $20 US plus any microtansactions made there in.How much is Fortnite? Anywhere from Free to Play to $30 if you want to play story mode.PUBG spends no time teaching you how to play it but then again if you're going the Free play route neither does Fortnite. However only ones of these games bothers to teach you how to play at all. The first 3 or so mission of Fortnite campaign are the essentials. It teaches you the basics all the way up to building entire structures laying traps and crafting items.The concensus here is that if you're good at learning stuff on the fly Fortnite is the way to go. If you wanna be taught through an in game tutorial Fortnite will cost you $30 US for the full campaign even though you only really need the first three missions.Conclusion while I would prefer to play PUBG over Fortnite I cannot recommend PUBG in its current state. It has no identity it's servers go unmonitored so cheaters run rampant and its developer is more focused on sueing the competition than actually competeing. I don't recommend this game at all. If you want THE premire Battle Royale game go play Fortnite.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-10,0,0,347,True,Not Recommended,This game is atrocious. First off the textures are not very good at all. The servers are extremely laggy and the game is poorly optomized. The servers hold 100 players which is far too much and you are lucky to not be shot at by 5 different people at once. Looting is also terrible. Extremely unbalanced. In a few buildings you could find a lvl 3 vest lvl 3 helmet and lvl 3 backpack 2 guns with tons of ammo and 5 med packs. However sometimes you are lucky to even find a pistol in one whole town. In buildings most rooms are completely empty. And there is something about certain rooms that are too plain and simple. The beds look terrible grass comes through the floor. Also there are tons of bugs and being killed by no one in sight. The circle spawns too fast. Scopes are seldom unless you are in a prominent spot on the map. Grenades are bugged. Too many trees you can hide behind making PVP less about skill and more about who has the bigger tree. Try this game if you want i'm just warning you it is far from being polished or fixed. I have 1.5k hours on A3 BR and I made it to second place on the leaderboards at one point so I am not a noob just saying all of this because I suck. I do not suck.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A forcefield bringing players within the circle is needed and we all know this but if you get into a fight on the edge of one forcefield only to have to run and not make it to the next because it is too strong then there is something wrong with the game.

2018-04-02,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Honest Review.PUBG Create your character lalala configure graphics settingsso it looks cute lalala.Get into a Solo lobby.Sure the plane took its time to let me out or it took me a while to figure out which key to press to get out of it (knowing this ain't gameplay yet ANYKEY SHOULD DO by common sense/logic). It made me land on the southeasttestestestestestestestestestestestestestestestestest side of the map. Nice all the loot for me!Game &gt YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE ZONE IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTESNiiiiiice... I'll just walk up there I guess.Checked the map.The marked zone was on the northwestestestestestestestestest... you know by now.No actual functioning vehicles nearby and a transparent blue wall thingie ran through me. I started to lose health by this point.Aaaaaaand when I found an actual working vehicle I just die because the game previously decided so with the time limit!1/10. Haven't felt that much mix of dissapointed+frustrated feeling in a videogame before (IN A SINGLE ROUND) probably not the type of gameplay or gamemode I'm used to so that really cuts down the number of people that would enjoy this (people that are great players but have little to no patience to silly caprices).But the game looks (graphically) great tho! Sadly by the time the company decides to finish this it'll look ugly outdated...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand not gonna be a sucker on this one. Refunding.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But for a game that has been adopted on this magnitude it should be expected that the developers will be perpetually behind on these issues. Despite the issues patches are constantly pushed and the developers are responsive to issues. Despite issues this game is ever challenging luck based and fun.

On a computer that can run the Witcher 3 Skyrim Fallout 4 etc. the game is basically unplayable with the fps drops and sound glitches.

2017-09-07,1,1,1,True,Not Recommended,Bough and played for the 2 hours before getting a refund as fast as I could. The game is straight up borring and broken. But my real issue with this game is the terrible greedy developer that doesnt support or fix his game and instead just keeps adding more features like in game adds and micro transactions that earn him money. He also ports it to the consoles without ever bothering to fix any of the countless bugs and issues with the pc version. I will never for the life of me be able to understand how this piece of garbage became so popular. Its sad that developers can get away with this. The more we as consumers support this kind of behavior from developers by buying and playing their broken garbage games the more they will keep doing this.

Overall it gets a 8/10 I would like to give it more but the game isnt really optimised and there is a few bugs. I started out playing this game with family share so I couldnt really give a review then but now I played it more and dear god... I think im addicted xD. The snipers are good the shotguns are good the pistols are trash but not bad for the first minute or two. The melee... I just hit people with a frying pan and I get top 10 xD P. The armour is very good at level 3 and that pan I was talking about before? If you have one holstered on your back it can block bullets xD. The assault rifles are not bad but only good really for long range sniping unless you have a sniper that is. The game is blowing up and I can see that this game has a ton of potential they just need to fix server lag and add more guns and maybe more armour and pans xD.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game's fun I promise the community isn't as stupid as the players writing those reviews. If you were actually worried here are some stupid things people are saying in negative reviews all of which are not true.1) I got banned for killing a streamer even though I don't watch streams!2) The developers favor streamers3) They will ban players with little proof for stream sniping just because the streamer whines That one is particularly hilarous not only because of the stupidity required to believe they lack evidence but how it's outright a tinfoil hat conspiracy. It's literally no different than the Flat Earth Society in terms of lack of understanding and conspiracy required to believe it. Point is enjoy the game. Don't let the tinfoil hat playerbase diswade you from considering the game. I can assure you that issues involve false banning for stream sniping and stream favoritism do not exist(Hence why nobodies been able to prove it).

2017-09-13,0,0,1199,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. I was gifted this game about a week from my friend (and I in turn gifted it to another friend) and after 89hrs of playtime I must say I've really enjoyed it.I really like the tactical nature of the game and how fun it is to play either solo in a pair or a group of four with friends. It's specially fun with friends because of the inherit ""randomness"" in the game that can lead to some awesome or rather humorous situations that are pretty unlike anything I've played before (this is my first battle royale style game mind you). So while in duos or squads the fun comes from playing with friends in solo it's all about testing your wits and tenacity as well as your strategic and tactical mindset to win because you may have the best gear and equipment in the game but it doesn't mean anything if you can't get a good position toward the end of the game and that really counts once it's down to the top 10 players.Overall I'd definitely recommend this game to just about anyone interested in the genre to try it out or to play with your friend(s) though it does kind of require an SSD an more than 8GB of RAM in my experience. Having a good GPU/CPU is also a must to run it well enough. I've had to run it at low settings but even still I've had great success in a few games and have had loads of fun with this game. Of course keep in mind it's still under Early Access so expect some things to break or not work right every now and then and also a lot of patience and not rage too much because you'll die a lot to things you had no control over.

2017-10-09,0,0,317,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a battle royale game that brings 100 people into a deserted map with buildings scattered along it and other sorts of structures. The goal is to be the final person standing out of the 100 in an all out deathmatch. There have been plenty of games like this such as H1Z1 King of the Kill and The Culling. But what makes this game so good? Lets go through the pro's and cons of this gamePro's Good Graphics Variety of weapons (New ones being added pretty often) Active Developers Can be played at your own pace Easy to pick up Play in a squad with 3 of your friends Can completely turn random matching off (Play in a three player squad without getting a random player)Cons Along with being easy to pickup it's definitely hard to master. Along with good graphics there is the issue of this game being kinda poorly optimized (May just be a problem for me but I average 40 50 fps on this game.) You can get banned for stupid reasons (Killing a streamer having glitches and even teamkilling someone who team kills your team.) Servers can sometimes be pretty bad but thats typically because this is the MOST PLAYED game of all time on Steam.Despite these flaws I really do believe this game is worth picking up and I believe that you should give it a try. Its not as chaotic as H1Z1 and Its a lot faster paced than The Culling. (The Culling in 2017 though lol),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-27,0,0,180,True,Recommended,"Player Unknown's Battlegrounds has been blowing up lately. Breaking records on steam while still being in Early Access.Now let's start with the core gameplay of PUBG. You drop out of a plane on a large island with 99 other people. While looting the island and all its buildings you'll be forced to stay within a certain area called the Player Zone. The Player Zone get's smaller and smaller during the game. Since loot is spawned randomly games will have a certain factor of ""luck"". The graphics in PUBG look great if everything is maxed out and the map is 8x8km which is rather big. However unfortunately the map is pretty boring. While roaming the island and looting your way through it you'll come across loads of attachments. These make looting a lot more interesting. Now you have a reason to keep looting once you have a gun armor and some medical supplies. Deciding what place to go next takes a bit of strategical planning would it already be looted? Where will the player zone move to? Do I use the car or do I go walking so they won't hear me? Etc.Player Unknown's Battleground is rather buggy. The game doesn't have the best optimization and has a lot of buys/flaws. You can't climb/vault at all putting your gun to a window and peaking doesn't work great and loads of other small bugs. Now don't get me wrong the game does get updated and new weapons get added from time to time but they honestly should focus on fixing the bugs a bit more.Now why is Player Unknown's Battlegrounds receiving so much negative attention? It's due to a couple of reasons. First of all the bigger your game gets the more people you get that dislike it of course. Second of all the developers broke a couple of promises. They've promised us there would be no micro transactions during Early access yet here they are. They've delayed the vaulting update 3 times now they're calling out and threatening other Battle Royale games for copying PUBG banning people who kill streamers with the reason ""stream sniping"" &amp they're not really fast on fixing updates and bringing out new content. Does this mean Player Unknown's Battleground is a bad game? No. In fact it's a great game and although it's a bit boring if you play solo the game is great and one of the better Battle Royale games out there at the moment. It's a blast with friends and before you know you have been playing for hours. Looting until your loadout is perfect and sneaking up on players is really fun and killing enemy's is satisfying for sure.Overall if you're looking for a good Battle Royale game Player Unknown is a great option. Just be sure you like the slow paced gameplay. If you're not entirely sure if PUBG is something for you I can highly suggest looking at other Battle Royale variants such as H1Z1.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-16,0,0,412,True,Recommended,First thing to mention Everyone needs to stop listening to other people who dislike the game for certain reasons. The game is still in early access and I can honestly say I love it. The game is absolutely amazing if you like survival games. It has a unique feel to the movement and killing is so satisfying. I think currently the game is still not yet well optimised for laptops as I have a dual 770m running in Sli with an i7 processor and cannot hit more than 50 60 on high settings. On the other hand I do have a gtx1070 gaming x pc and it runs fabulous in 4K at 70 75fps.

2017-08-29,1,1,406,True,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battlegrounds or more commonly known as PUBG is fun and simply put addictive. Unfortunately however there are many game breaking bugs that often plague early access titles of this manner. Many of the bugs don't distract from the game however some of the bugs that affect core gameplay mechanics can be frustrating during intense firefights. Overall I think once the bugs are fixed the game will greatly improve and could possibly amplify the success the game already has received.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-29,0,0,703,True,Recommended,While the company needs a better PR department I'm here to review the game and not the company.The game itself is great one of the (if not the) best in the genre. Some bugs and glitches are around sure but seeing how early in development the game is that's to be expected. Most of them are solved rather quickly and most of the time the bugs only make you laugh (I'm fine with losing a match if it's by being catapulted 500 meters into the air after my car hits a tiny bump!).Would definitely recommend to anyone enjoying the Battle Royale genre.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-06,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,As much as this game can be fun it is extremely slow. Deaths are 99% likely to occur by dropping in by parachute and getting killed immediately or by some camper just hiding somewhere. This game is good but definitely could be better.UPDATE So I have played it a few times since they added the new map and I love how they added the death cam. However I love people being able to blatantly be able to see me through walls if im sitting still. You can see them staring at me through rocks. This game is just a pool of cheaters.

2018-05-26,0,0,310,False,Not Recommended,"COMPLETE CANCEROUS CAMPERFEST NOT RECCOMMENDED unless you are a serious hardcore gamer who takes this game religiously. TLDR This game has some fatal flaws that ruin the immersion for a filthy casual like me and seem to be targetted at very hardcore gamers. I reccommend casual gamers to turn to other cheaper or free alternatives. Let me preface this by saying when a game is outperformed by cheap China knock offs that blatantly rip it off (in this case the NettEase and Rules of Survival etc.) then there is something wrong. A lot of the great games out there are copied left right and center but they manage to remain competitive by ensuring that they will always be more attractive and better than crappy clones thereby ensuring people will still be willing to pay for them. The same cannot be said for PUBG in my opinion. This game is a classic example of something that has IMMENSE potential but was ruined by a few utterly stupid mistakes that allowed clones like Rules of Survival and Fortnite to easily surpass it. Pros 1) It has very detailed maps that are visually beautiful and there is clearly a lot of effort put into the graphical design.2) It has elements of realism added in such as better physics engines for vehicle movement and projectile motion (Both a good and a bad thing)3) It was the original game of it's kind thereby being the pioneer of innovationCons 1) It seems to be very poorly Beta tested or it was simply intended for super hardcore gamers because The player to map size ratio is so terribly skewed that the game in my experience has been nothing more than a MASSIVE CAMPER FEST. Because of the sheer abundance of camping spots and the very small number of players relative to the size literally EVERY game I just see everyone camping nonstop and the first one to make a move dies. This is just idiotic because it just means they didn't test it properly to optimize the player to size to intensity ratios. 2) The Increased realism is more of a detriment in my opinion. Realism is good but the developers have to remember that it is ultimately A VIDEO GAME. Casual gamers want some casual fun not a full on military training scheme. The projectile motion especially makes it quite unpleasant to shoot and more importantly it means that shooting at a even a moderate distance without a scope is very difficult this results in it being luck based If you find a scope you win. if not you die. 3) It is VERY luck based. Before all the addicted fools start shouting ""l2p"" consider the facts The scattering of weapons is VERY Sparse with tons of useless shotguns everywhere and very few good rifles or scopes around. This means that there is a high element of luck involved because in a game where EVERYONE IS JUST CAMPING getting a good rifle is akin to winning. 4) the aiming mechanism seems highly faulty. I make an attempt to watch killcams all the time (I did so just to verify this point) and I have noticed many times that shots that had the crosshairs completely off target were able to headshot me. And YES I am considering projectile motion and bullet travel time. I once got hit by a shot that was fired BEHIND me while running. This seems like a fatal bug to an already annoying system5) Price for something that costs quite a high sum it is clearly not very well planned out. In conclusion This game had a TON of potential but due to some fatal flaws in my opinion the free to play games do a better job. For all but the most serious and hardcore gamers I strongly encourage you to save your money and use the F2P games like Rules of Survival. (there is a PC version for it by scanning a QR code on your phone) NOTE Having said all that I did about the game I am not trying to encourage the sickening piracy of the clones. If you feel that you wish to support innovation and intelligence the perhaps give this game a shot as I did.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Money gets more important than fixing the game. Whatmore it has gotten even more bugged laggy etc as they implemented paid content with last patch. It feels like ""PAY US MORE OR YOU WONT SEE THE GAME FIXED"" or typical EA politics like 'oh yea we're going to release a game. Oh maybe not a game just 10% of the game for which you gonna have to pay 45$ then after 3 months we are going to release a DLC worth another 45$ so you can have 20% of the actual game'.

Staying alive against 99 other players is a blast and the plays needed can get downright psychological at times but the game does have a little jank to it. This is most likely caused by the engine though and its not really bad enough to ruin the game's experienceWhat IS able to ruin the game's experience though is content you have to pay for in an early access game akin to CSGO.This is the reddest of red flags because it signals that the devs have no faith in their finished product.Until something is done to prove otherwise I cannot recommend spending money on buying this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Chinese players have been swarming most of the servers in America and others which has lead to many latency issues and hackers. This has been an issue for months and I haven't noticed any fixes.If the game looks fun to you and you have friends to play it with go ahead and buy it. If not I'd save the money for something else.

Vehicle physics and mechanics are the best around. f1 2017 forza gta have nothing on this game. bumps on the road and small stones give true to life realism and the vehicle hurtles through the air randomly and spins around wildly.To promote motorbike safety the guys at bluehole implimented the ""Death Bike"" physics. this enables the rider to be killed knocked out or thrown from a bike at the slightest bump or if the speed exceeds 20kph. Medic items are true to life aswell. swallowing painkillers take twice the time to take than finishing a can of red bull... just like real life. adrenaline syringes in the game resemble the 1950's injections. which is a nice touch. finally my last positive remark on this game.... using first aid kits is impossible in a moving vehicle. taking painkillers is out too. i mean how realistic is this game. 10/10. i often drive to work and see lots of vehicles and ambulances pulled in to the side of the road so occupants can take pills and wrap bandages. fantastic job blueballs...10/10 for me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-19,1,4,181,True,Not Recommended,I love the concept of Battle Royale. It's a great way to get the adrenaline flowing. This game executes the concept very well. Some of the animations might be goofy but the gameplay is fun reactive and rewarding (if a little beta clunky).The problem I have with this game and most pvp games in general is cheaters. If you give the customer your client and tell them exactly where they are in the world by way of coordinates they will use a program like SoftIce to trace the variables and manipulate them in memory. Because the program has too much say in what you are able to do in the game world values can be injected into those variables and you get players teleporting all over the place. To be honest unlike in H1Z1 or even GTA V I have seen very little of this type of cheater but I have not played the game long enough to verify whether I'm just missing it. Perhaps they even have cheat detection in game which would essentially be verifying client/server variables are behaving properly.A more subtle cheat which I think is prolific in this game is the detection of other player data which is then used to determine where you are in the world and where other players are in the world. What happens is that other player data is sent to your computer through the interwebz so that you computer can draw players and such smoothly when they are supposed to interact with you in the game. If the game didn't do this players and specifically their different textures would tend to pop in and cause lag which is usually pretty annoying if not downright gamebreaking. The game's communication variable data needs to be encrypted with a simple encryption algorithm changed daily. This would eliminate the radar headshot and tracking cheats which are ubiquitous in this game right now. Until this is done stay away from this game.As the game is in beta I won't harp on the fact that graphics options need to be minimized so that players can actually hide in foliage etc. and use the environment (which can be pretty beautiful tbh) to their advantage.One day I hope that the interwebz somehow institutes this type of game as a streaming game. Unfortunately I think I'll be a little too old to enjoy it without having a heart attack. Anyways game is better then H1Z1 but cheater parasites are ruining it.Update for July 1st 2017 Some cheat detection is in game. So Headshots are still a thing but you'll find that you can get a decent fight once in a while because not everyone is cheating. Player detection ... um... detection... has also been instituted quite nicely. People seem to not notice you are there until you commit to a fight as opposed to heading directly for you when you haven't moved inside the attic of a barn for 5 to 10 minutes.Two new cheats seem to be prevalent however 1. There seems to be some sort of vectored head shot where if you shoot a character they automatically shoot you in the head/torso. My theory is they are detecting the vector of the shot and then sending a bullet back along the vector to your gun. Has happened to me twice now so cannot completely confirm. You'll notice this cheat easier if you play a hide and snipe strategy instead of full on fps.2. There seems to be lag when players get nearby at random occasions. Player induced lag is a thing and is detectable quite easily so hopefully they add some sort of detection into the game. Still a negative review however until game becomes more playable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Every time I get on to play they are having some sort of server issue or something stupid is happening and I can't really say they arent doing anything to fix it it just seems half and the majority of their effort seems to be focused elsewhere. Hopefully this game doesn't kill itself by releasing on the Xbox and cause a major fail for the company because the game truly at heart is a good game it just currently needs alot more TLC on servers optimization and just focus on the gameplay that has made it so famous.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Do not buy this game.....atleast not yet.There are many reasons for this but i feel like i had to just say that first to save you before figuring out this game isnt what you expected 3 hours after buying it. My Experience My friend bought me this game during early access during that time i hated this game due to the reason that it had microtransactions before it was even a full game even after they say they wouldn't add microtransactions until the game was done. Also was the price of $30.00 seemed to high for a game that was brand new and as i have previously stated in ealry access. But it was a new multiplayer game and my friend bought it for me so i had no choice but to play it with them atlast a couple times. The first match was amazing it wasnt what i expected the fuel of adrenaline was amazing as you'r natural split second choices had more effect on the you'r matches future than in other games. Eventually glitches started to apppear and it frustrating as all hell but somtimes they would be enjoyable giving me and my friends good laughs as our jeep does 3 flips before crashing on the ground in a fiery explosion in pure MURICA fashion. But when we would try to win the glitches would seem to pop in more and more and only when we were messing around did the glitches just seem to dissappear. But that didnt stop us from trying our damn hardest. When we got our first chicken dinner it felt amazing as the endorphines from this stress simulator started to rolll in and we realized we outplayed 97 other players. I only having about 20 or so hours at the time got only 1 2 kills as my team rolled with 4 or more. But the game was fun and i loved it.So why do i not recommend this game? Well what i just sayed were memories of a time months ago. Sound The guns sound good but thats about it. Sound is what can save you in any situation in this game. It can help you pinpoint an enemys location weather thats through gun shots or foot steps it is one of the most important tools in this game. When it works that is. Sound is compltely ed. You can get shot at and when you look in the direction of were the first shot sounded like it came from only to have a second shot come sounding like it came from behind you. Not to mention footsteps were if you are running it can sound like there is another set of first steps running alongside you. And the sound of vehicles can suck especially if you cant hear them if they are behind you only noticing them after they have ran you over. Hackers/China I am just gonna put both hacking and china in the same catagory as they are basically within the same cesspool of exploiting and cheating. If you scroll down the reviews you will see people screaming to region lock china now this isnt racism China is the most toxic people you will see in this game as they go to North American servers to exploit ping and end up shooting you from behind walls as they teleport across the map because of their 200+ ping. And Hackers god ing damnit the hackers. Its hard to go one game without getting a hacker shooting you somehow without seeing you or having their croos haris on you. My experience is when i was in a gamer and i got headshotted by a kar98k while driving in a car which i though was suspicious so i watched the deathcam. it was a guy named Francorea he was invisble for about 2 seconds in the kill cam i thought it was just a glitch so i let it go then as he saw my car he turned invisible again. He aimed his kar98k straight at the ground he shot and he got me with a headshot. WTF i instantly go to click the report button but after i clicked it my game crashed......ARE YOU ING KIDDING ME?Stop adding cosmetics and fix you'r damn game Bluehole Glitches Yes they can be funny and cool as hell but when the same glitch has been in the game for months and still havent been fixed dude wtf BlueHole got $720000000 from this game and still cant fix a glitch that has been in for months. And For sake fix that damn 3 seater motorcycle it does nothing but lean to the right and god forbid you hit a pebble and get sent flying headfirst just to get knocked out of you'r bike and get ran over by air.So why do i still play this game?I only play this game because well it can give alot of money sorry but its true. This game just isnt as fun as it use to be but whenever they add a new crate and it is $5 instantly on the community market? Well how am i not supposed to only play for the free money? Thats all this game is good for at this point in my opinion.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-08,0,0,656,False,Recommended,bought this game when it just came out on steam as the graphics looked stunning and the concept was interesting.this game offered a gameplay experience that was fresh at that time and i enjoyed every hour i spent on this game.every match felt newmy thoughts on the gameplay at first i thought getting a chicken dinner in this game was just a matter of luck i thought the guy with the better loot or the better position in the circle would win and not to mention man disadvantage in squad plays but after hundreds of games and being put in difficult situations i realise that this game is in fact really skill based. better weapon does not mean better aim positioning should always be part of your strategy for winning and ive won in a 1v4 scenario a dozen times by playing smart.my concerns i stopped playing this game a couple months ago due to the sheer amount of cheaters in a single match getting killed by cheaters every f***ing game is frustating and i felt like this game was just a waste of time.came back every now and then to check if cheaters are gone and always dissapointed.cheaters still there but devs keeps releasing new crates. what pisses me off even more is that these crates requires keys to open. i mean i know i shouldnt be mad as i play csgo and its the same system there and they have cheaters too and such thats why i still recommed this game to those who likes playing these 'battle royale' type of games. but i for one am done playing. i just like the old pubg better with no weapon skins just player skins.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Imagine if you bought a gun and although that gun was a prototype you were given a promise it would get better later and a list of things you needed for it to work. you get it working as you have everything you need and the gun refuses to shoot for several minutes at a time spits out a random number of bullets when it does sometimes ejects shells for no reason and has the accuracy of a one armed drunken welshman attempting to fire a M2 browning unbraced. This is my experience with the game thus far.I am getting random bursts of not 3 frames a second but 3 seconds a frame then when that stops i am still getting low but bearable fps but with constant random length and unstoppable Freezes while doing anything at all but standing stillI have spent 5 10 minutes frozen at one point and requiring a hard restart of my computer the second and third of my attempts to play a match. i effectively bought a 30 dollar desktop background of a parachuting manIf the game doesnt want me to play it ing fineThey have lost a customer and a fan hereGood ing jobI MORE than meet the minimum requirementsand i tried both the lowest settings and the highest with absolutely no difference in its preformance,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-18,0,0,159,True,Not Recommended,For all it could be the game is fantastic. For the current condition its just a ing mess. Don't let yourself be deluded into thinking you win because of anything other than good circles good loot spawns. Dont delude yourself into thinking you lose for any other reason than desync lag fps drops due to poor optimization and the privation of every other reason you might win. Sometimes you will be fully kitted within the first 2 minutes. Sometimes you will spend 20 minutes running bandaging and boosting to make it to the top 10 without firing a shot and dying to the playzone when you run out of meds. 90% of the time this game is just a giant Kobyashi Maru simulator driven by mostly non game elements. Rather its development issues such as poor optimization poor server and connection issues. As far as the player base goes the best way to make it to the top10 is to collect meds prone in a house with all the doors closed and go take a until right before death circle. Then med up grab a vehicle and hit one of the poor bastards that spent 20 minutes looting and take all his top off with more meds and just camp while the rest of the people kill eachother and then shoot the last person who has no earthly clue where you are because you havent made a osund or moved for the last 10 minutes.

2017-07-07,0,0,183,True,Not Recommended,I watched some videos thinking this is really a good game but after I tried for 2 games I did had some fun but I have to refund the game here are my reasons 1. I have a decent Alienware PC from 2 years ago the graphic card is GTX960 with i7 CPU and 16 GB System RAM it might be a little outdated but running this not too fancy game at medium settings barely hits 60FPS is unacceptable to me. The game looks fun but it is simple even for $30 still this game should be optimized better than this. Movement is weird as well. I just don't have a smooth feeling of everything in this game.2. My home network is pretty good playing league always at 23 ms latency but I still I can't move get warnings like I have connection issues several times within an hour. 3. The game does not have a tutorial to start with you will have to learn all the stuff through youtube videos. Which I already did but still having a little difficulty on how to use the items. This game may not need a tutorial but at least should have an empty room allow new players to try the weapons and equipment out. The waiting area before the game starts is not helping anything.4. The price I have some people saying this game's price is high. I was like it is not an old game and on steam No.3. $30 can t be overpriced now I take it back... The game is simple content is focused on the equipment and weapons which are good but the graphic does not look so good and optimized so badly is unacceptable at this price. If they optimize the graphic and fix the network issues I would consider buying again. Otherwise in its current state personally I would say the game worth at most $15 to $20 depending on how you like this type of this games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The map sizes are just way to big to run good. The reason fortnite runs so well is because its like 1/4 of the size of a PUBG map and they have the most half graphics in the world.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,226,False,Recommended,1.0 is out! and it's the biggest and best update PUBG has had. Now with the full release many improvements to the game have been added not only that but additions aswell such as the New Map and Vaulting. Yes this game is not perfect and yes it can get annoying but in the end of the day it's good fun. Playing this game has been the best thing to do with my friends instead of playing other dead games like CS GO playing something new and fresh that works is very good. Although the biggest demerit is you need a good PC to run this game before i had a laptop which ran this game at 20 30fps on low it sucked. BUT it was still fun it was playable (like the XBOX ONE version) now with a $2.5k PC i run this game at a solid 100fps and with more compatability changes from the creators i think it will become more usable for those with bad PC's. Overall a great game to play solo and with friends. A Definate Recommend. 9.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,So i played PUBG for maybe 30 mins and got my butt kicked it was fun but unfortuantely unplayable due to poor optimisation and i have a gtx 980 which should ideally run the game fine but it doesnt for some reason but the worst part are the servers are unfortuantely seem p2p and not dedicated leading to wonky as hell hit detection and lagg that leads to me not being able to properly play the game.

2017-04-10,0,0,1220,True,Recommended,"I feel like I have to give this game a thumbs up based solely on the fact that I'm having an immense amount of fun playing it with my friends. Everyone has their own criteria to determine their review. Mine is the fun factor. If I'm enjoying it it gets a thumbs up. However there's just so much that I don't like. The following are just a few things that I feel MUST be changed soon.1. Don't believe the lie that this game isn't as ""clunky"" as Arma 3 or DayZ. Because it IS. It's miserable. I'm not asking for it to be Call of Duty or something like that. But sheesh after all the talk from the Beta players I expected a bit more smoothness in opening doors entering vehicles picking up loot player movement etc...you know the basics. But it's not. 2. As soon as a little bit of optimization happens they need to LOCK FOLIAGE at a certain preset for all players. Preferably I'd like to see foliage locked at a much higher preset than ""very low"" to encourage tactical/stealth gameplay. As it is right now even if you have a supercomputer setting foliage any higher than the lowest preset only puts you at a disadvantage since everyone else has it turned down. That bush or grass you think you're using for cover doesn't exist on everyone elses client. You might think you're nice and hidden. But that sniper 200m away is laughing his butt off at this moron who's standing out in the middle of a field like an idot. *headshot* sucker!3. I'm personally not a fan of the map. I'm not talking about the map you pull up when you press ""m "" I'm talking about the actualy play area. It's just far too open. The terrain is not all that rugged there are only a few trees and rocks here and there. It's just a copy/pasted bland map. You can clearly tell they haven't spent a whole lot of time creating the map. They probably used a random terrain generator threw in a few of the same buildings everywhere and called it a day. Which is fine it's Early Access. I just hope they invest in the map and make more than a sniper's paradise. 4a. This is perhaps my biggest gripe with this game. And this speaks to points #2 &amp #3. With foliage giving you absolutely no cover and given the fact that the game map is basically an open field with a few hills and limited cover you can forget tactical gameplay. Basically 4x scopes win this game. It's a sniper camp fest until the final circle (the 3rd person peaking only makes this worse). It's bland and it's going to get old really fast unless they make foliage more dense and saturate the map with more than just a few copy/pasted rocks and trees every 50m. 4b. Due to the fact that this game favors the camping sniper they've had to make the player a bullet sponge. It takes several shots of even the 7.62 to kill a player. And when I say several I'm talking WAY TOO MANY. But they had to make it this way becasue without any cover to escape a sniper it would make them far more deadly than they already are. So I propose that the devs would give us more forests/foligae denser terrain more obstacles etc (basically favor cqb) and make bullets do more damage this would reward the sniper who will now only have a short window to engage their target (and must therefore actually require real skill in making shots rather than having 1 minute to unload your entire clip on someone hoping to land 5 or 6 shots) and would also reward the cqb player who uses tactics to gain the element of surprise. Honestly a map like Arma 3's Apex or even Chernaurus would be better than this. Give us more rugged terrain that we can use for tactical maneuvers instead of the stereotypical hill that we simply peak over in 3rd person waiting for the other guy to move. Make the forests more dense. Make foliage ACTUALLY do something. Allow people to flee snipers by finding cover. Heck give us more cover that we can use to flank the sniper. As it is right now that's very rarely an option. Force snipers to have to pack cqb weapons incase the circle ends in a dense area. Please Please Please take the advantage away from the 3rd person peaking camping sniper. That type of gameplay is fun for a while but it will not sustain this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Jump in to a battle zone with no weapons HOPE to find something before someone else kills you while the hackers know where every vehicle quality piece of gear and person is on the map. I am a top 1% player 3 seasons in a row and I still find this game to be horifically unbalanced horifically coded and horifically thought out. Random Red Zones Dsync Random weapon recoil cause the weapons are coded like one game the gins are fine the next they are jumping all over the screen. There is NO WAY to get good at aiming in this game cause its TOTAL RNG.... The RNG favors top tier players EVERY GAME. I know cause I went from loot when I was rated lower to amazing loot when I was rated high. Loot spawns AFTER you land so the servers can decide what to give you. This game is total trash. There are hackers in EVERY match Aim bots ESP Insta Heal God Mode you shoot a dude in the head 4 times with a sniper rifle and he never dies. Its garbage.

I love it because it's the first early access game I've invested in that actually paid off. People will claim that the devs don't care and prioritize useless things but that's simply not true. They constantly update their twitter and website with where they are aiming their focus and don't leave playerbases in the dark. They've admitted that they are pushing all their resources into getting the game finished and released on console but at the same time we can expect a new map vehicles and more within the first quarter of december january. That being said they also have an update coming out that includes new guns and a vaulting system which I've tried out on the test server and lemme tell you it's the People claim hackers are a huge issue buuuuuut in all my time I've only encountered about 3 hackers and that ain't t because I am a horribly salty person so if I really did have an issue with them then you'd all hear about it.

The lag spikes hits you hard during the most critical times of the game i.e when you are in a 1v1 and other situations. Instead of adding new content to the game they should focus on fixing their game first. This game will get you hyped during the end game playing with friends is extremely fun. Solo can be fun if you get better at the game which will require time. Even though I have only 100+ hours in this game I have experienced most of the pros and cons of the game. PUBG is better than Fortnite in my perspective as I like FPS shooters alot and like the strategical realism of the PUBG which Fortnite does not have. If you come to the hackers they are quite alot of them. Especially in Asian servers out of nowhere some dude with a 8x on a S12K will shoot you through a wall miles away in this aspect Fortnite does it better than PUBG. This game will get i you some really nice and enjoyable moments but at the same time will make you want to uninstall it at the same time.If I had to rate it I would give it a 7/10 for various reasons.Overall playing the game will be a good experience for every gamer.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game concept is good but they have the worst devs ever. 100 ing million dollars they could use a fraction of that money to hire experts in UE but no they introduce microtransactions instead.

2017-04-02,0,0,109,True,Not Recommended,I was really cautious on how many minutes I was playing on this game because for starters it's early access AND the price is bit high. I've decided to refund it as performance wasn't amazing same goes for graphics. I found the graphics to be a big turn off. My settings were all on medium execpt texture and view distance which were on Higy yet the game still looked somewhat bad. It wasn't clear. I found it difficult to see other people at far distances and couldn't tell if it was human or not.I did give this game a shot but with a price tag of 26 and being early access I didn't want to take the risk. It's a shame that steam only offers 2 hours of play before it expires then you can't refund it. IF it had more hours then I would put more into this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

We have been baited into a trap.I figured this out ENTIRELY too lateMAIN REVIEW All Hype. No Real Benefit. There is only one game mode and it favors people who were in closed alpha heavily. People in alpha know the map the feel of the controls there is not even a shooting range to practice. Obvious troll for money as dev favorites stream having a great time slaughtering noobs which of course motivates sales. Servers are attrocious. ""It's alpha"". All the more reason not to buy it. Pros Nicely balanced weapons working toward all the realistic little touches of Arma III. Smaller maps so games don't take for EVAR.Cons This game is hyped all to hell. It is an unfinished game in every sense and is likely to remain so. It's Arma III with one game mode that doesn't even really allow you to learn to aim. Basically a single mod for the Arma III server made into a stand alone game because the developer didn't want to make a better mod for free for Arma. I am deeply disappointed in the character movement as well which is the most basic limited clunky set of moves I can imagine for a 2017 game.Seriously. Start from the ground up with the ability to climb jump and so forth like about a cool half dozen games already on the market none of which seem to be realistic shooters. Why is it the realistic FPS genre somehow always features the MOST disgustingly glitchy and unrealistic move sets available in video games at the moment?P.S.

2017-11-27,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,Geez what a waste of time. I gave this game many chances reinstalling it every time another friend bought a copy but my first impressions were spot on. The gameplay is shallow and arbitrary. You can't replace gameplay depth with RNG. I don't even really mind the tons of bugs. At least they make the game somewhat interesting momentarily.The early game is engaging in a stupid way where you're either in a safe area mindlessly gathering loot or in a hotzone mindlessly gunning mindless gunners. The middle game is boring in a comfortable way consisting mostly of looking for better loot and occassionally getting shot at or shooting at someone. The end game is a cluster . And none of it is fun...Graphics are mediocre and the visual design is as bland as they come. Sound design is poor to say the least. Every update makes these things marginally better but the core gameplay is still a trudge.If you're looking for something tactical go get Rainbow 6 Siege.If you're looking for tight gunplay go get Titanfall 2 or Call of Duty or Battlefield.If you're looking for a battle royale game get Rust or Fortnite.If you're looking for a game which relies on randomization instead of genuine gameplay variety and depth then by all means play the dull unoptimized trash that is PUBG.Edit March 2018 Game is less buggy now. Loot now regularly spawns clipping inside the floor and objects. Framerate is better but the framerate is inconsistent so 144fps still feels worse than a 30fps PS2 game. Netcode is still TRASH. Who uses client side hit detection..? Despite the improvements in performance the core gameplay is still pointless. There is nothing to learn from losing. Winning does not feel good. It just feels like winning the lottery if instead of money you just got a poorly designed anticlimactic static image.P.S.

Those are 25 minutes that you can never get back. I have spent over 17 HOURS on this game and I have NOTHING to show for it. The only two emotions I felt while playing this were frustration and boredom. Only ONCE did I ever feel an emotion other than frustration or boredom while playing this game. I was in the final four and as I was looking for the other players someone with a sniper rifle shoots me through the wall of a shed. That emotion wasn't frustration. It was anger. I was tired of getting killed by a hacker shooting me through the wall so what did I do? I uninstalled. Please do not spend your $30 on this game.

Bunch of weapons I get that people cry about weapon balance but hey you can't just give everyone the same loot and then tell 'em to go kill each other (you have War Mode there for that ) ) because that would be boring! 2+1 maps (Sanhok will be coming out this month i think) Custom games will be available for everyone later this year Fun especially with friends but you can even play with some rando from japan or the UK I just don't get why do people want the weapon balance. The point of the BR genre is to get better loot as you change locations and not to get the same loot and the same gun over and over and over again. Weapon balance is good as it is right now. The AWM is far superior to the Kar98K that's why it's in the Supply drop. People don't like this game because they say it doesn't require skill. Well that's one hell of a big in' mistake right there! You can give a player who haven't played a single match in PUBG a Groza with an RDS and a suppressor and EXT.Quickdraw mag + an AWM 15x he will still have no clue how to use them because the Groza has quite a little recoil and all the weapons have bullet drop that's where the AWM comes in he won't know the bullet drop he won't know the recoil pattern he won't know the muzzle velocity. THIS GAME DOES REQUIRE SKILLJust look at shroud or grimmz or ibiza or ETC.Even if they join a fight with the worst pistol in the game against a normal player with an m416 they will win 'cause they know how to use the guns.If they would make the weapons the same just in the name of ""balance"" the game would be boring.I get that people get mad because they died because of a bug but just relax for 30 mins then try again.I know that 30 is a little bit too much for this game since Fortnite is f2p but be serious please.At least 60% of the fortnite players spend more than 30 on fortnite emotes or skins or whatever.That's all i wanted to say.Thank you for listening and go ahead and PLAY PUBG!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The damage output on minor vehicle collision is overpowered. The weapons are unbalanced and calls for you to use the exact same weapon every game with little to no variation.

2017-04-16,0,0,401,False,Not Recommended,"VINDICATED!!! I Been saying this for over a year and they finally admit that the game is F'd up and they are going to fix it...Gee thanks for FINALLY realizing you never gave us the finished game you sold us and after making enough money to start a corporation NOW you wanna fix it...All those people talking crap about how good they are and ppl must just suck when they say B.S. this is proof you are just trying to convince yourselves that it's all you and not a broken game...I rest my case. Now on to my review that has been proven to be correct and PubG Corp just admitted it they sold us a broken game and people have been making them rich and making all these I'm so awesome at Pubg YT videos. Let's see if they actually fix it or just placate us.I really wanted to like this game I like the coop play working as a team against other teams. I like the tactical aspect of PUBG. They did a great job upgrading the graphics with the PC 1.0 release. Driving cars can almost be fun. But I really feel like there is an imaginary 3 year old boy's arm behind the car who is really driving. The driving physics are no where near good. They are stiff and clunky driving around going over hills and bumps in the terrain can cost you your life as you slow down alot going over uneven or uphill terrain. I've literally crashed against nothing because there seems to be an invisible wedge on the front of vehicles that seems to grab the ground and stop you dead if the ground meets at too sharp an angle. Like coming down a steep hill. Riding bikes isn't a death trap as long as you ride smooth ground. If you get into a really hilly area your going to die because bike physics are way off and as soon as you flip you die instantly if your going a certain speed or faster. I honestly can't believe with all the problems that this game blew up like it did. This game is not so much based on skill as it is in your chances of the prgramming actually working the way it supposed...to which it rarely does. People just love acting like playing this game is the like equivalent of playing paintball game where it's all on your skill whether you win or lose. There are too many variables. Internet connection compnents imprefect programming the list goes on...If they worried more about the game and making it a great experience FIRST worry about money SECOND then this would be a spectacular game to play and the money would come. Because as is evidenced by the many great games out there GTA Witcher 3 Assassin's Creed(most of them)etc.. Having a great game and having it work consistently will bring in the money naturally. GTA had mad problems when it first released and they went into overdrive to fix things...If only they took a lesson from that line of thinking...If you have a shooter the shooting should work!Before I go into this(lol)... I know there are gonna be people who say I probably just suck I must not know how to shoot very good no skill...blah blah blah. Stop trying to convince yourselves cause you ain't convincing me. I know how badly some would like to believe that it takes super human skills to play a video game. This isn't rocket science sorry but practice is all you really need to get good. Now I understand why developer's like this exist. WE LET THEM! I also know why PC games suffer and it isn't because of consoles. PC gamers actually act like paying for a subscription service is blasphemy like PC gamers never pay more than they should have to for anything. But if there is a Leather Jacket or some stupid shoes or outfits or skins for guns...they'll pay HUNDREDS for THAT! LMAO! Don't wanna pay for a service that can put an end to the rampant cheating on PC. Have to pay with Time/Money to access more features on your Steam profile. Since more money can always be made and time is the most precious commodity we have...Giving your time is as important to them as giving your moneyFirst and foremost this game isn't based on skill...It's based on chance. They really should call this game Player Unknown's Loot Lottery and Running Man Simulator. I mean you name your game after what your doing in the game most of the time. So you would think by the name that it's gonna be a battleground. Then why do we spend 90% or more of the time Running and looking for crap or staying ahead of that stupid line. Like 2 10% of playing this game is actually ""battlegrounds"". The loot in this game in SO inconsistent. I've gotten in the habit of going as far away from the plane line as I can so I have time to search. Cause usually I can search entire apartment buildings and not find anything that works together. I don't care what anyone says there is NO FUN in getting killed a majority of the time... Because if I land in a town with other ppl. Run into a spot to search find a a box of AR bullets no gun 3 health kits 2 red dot sights 4x scope and finally a pistol with ONE box of bullets! I run outside and I see this guy goin around my house and I open up on him point blank range with my pistol from behind...hitting him with %80 of my shots at the very least( I seen all the blood) he spins while prey n spraying and shoots off my pinky toe and I bleed out instantly! Of course the one place he searched happened to have level 3 helmut vest backpack M416 with plenty of ammo silencer and now a 4x scope off my dead body! But I still Keep playing...I have finally figured out why I kept playing...It's all about the money...They have literally turned video games into Las Vegas slot machines with NO JACKPOT! Everytime I'm running around searching and find a good weapon or a good attachment...I feel like I've won something...When I call a good spot and we get good loot AND the Circle...I feel like I've won something. everytime I get a kill I feel like I've won something.THAT is how they hook us! Now we got ppl paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars for some digital NOTHINGS to put on their character's. I have games like 3 kills and 11 headshots...I consistently shoot ppl 5 6 even 7 times all upper body and head. They don't die. People somehow can shoot you from so far away in full auto and hit you with every single bullet from like 2 300 meters away. Like they don't have recoil. Same thing happens when I'm driving...somehow ppl can shoot in full auto and never miss one shot while your driving 100 kph over hilly terrain. This game has one of the worst bullet physics systems I've ever seen. I always die in 3 or less shots...no matter if I have level 3 helmut vest and when I watch they replay their reticle isnt over me and bullets come out on an angle and go right to me...These issues should've been fixed ages ago. But they got us so brainwashed pulling the bandit arm hoping we get some empty ""win"" to get a dopamine hit in our head. They don't need to fix anything they have the perfect forumla. Vegas should take a cue from the gaming industry...look at all the money we spend to Kill Time they don't ever have to pay out random jackpot's to ppl.

Game is unplayable on europe server because of lag.Despite the promises from dev team and the patches it seems that the lag gets worse by day and they have no clue how to fix this issue .

2017-12-26,0,0,96,False,Recommended,The game itself is fun but not as action packed as others like it. This game has Great Graphics if you have a decent computer but your FPS is not always the best. I run at around 60 fps on High Settings and I have a fairly good build. If I run the game on Low settings it still looks fine but the fps goes up to around 90 110 Which is what I normally play at I wish they would make the map a little better rendered to help fps. I would give it a 3.9/5 stars,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I started playing again recently and the performance and bugs are still there but it isn't as nearly as bad. It seems like the developers are really trying to make this work. idk why everyone is giving this game so many bad reviews I think it's pretty fun.

2018-06-26,0,0,139,False,Recommended,GRAPHICS 6/10 Acceptably modern but lazy.SOUND 7/10 Good gun sounds bad vehicular and limited environmental sounds.GAMEPLAY 6/10 Fun with friends but too repetitive and unrewarding to play alone.PERFORMANCE 7/10 Pretty smooth often suffers from high ping and hackers.SUMMARY 6.5/10PUBG is a well balanced shooter that is fun to play with a team of friends. It is however let down by repetitive gameplay server issues and microtransactions galore in an already unrewarding and overpriced game.Buy if You have friends to play it with. You want to be the very best that no one ever was. You just love killin'.Don't Buy if No one you know plays it. You want to be immersed in setting and story. You have rage issues. TLDR! PUBG is a well refined shooter that parachutes you into a shrinking area with up to 99 other players in a rush to gather equipment and eliminate any opposition so that you can have a chicken dinner all to your greedy self.Choose a landing zone in a city for high stakes high reward action surrounded by players desperately grabbing anything from the floor and defending themselves with whatever they can find or land in a rural area to buy yourself time to loot before heading out to meet others who have survived the deadly initial rush!This game is tough being the top player or team in 100 is quite the feat of skill and luck and getting your first chicken dinner feels good! The game offers the well paced tactical action of Battlefield along with the compelling kleptomania of DayZ's looting. It's truly a winning chicken dinning combination. The maps are large and varied and offer all types of situations for some duelling.Unfortunately by the time you have won your first chicken dinner you will have done and seen everything that the game has to offer. The gameplay whilst fun is extremely repetitive there isn't a vast amount of weapons and items and unlocking any fancy new threads or gun skins is highly unlikely with the introduction of microtransactions and season passes. The game is also plagued by hackers especially in America and high ping players in Europe.The game does get a recommendation as it is a good thing to have in your library for a round or ten with a team or friends but at it's core it's a very simple and generic game that is very lucky to have the attention that it's received.GRAPHICS 6/10It has the semi realistic stylized graphics familiar to all Unreal 4 games. The 3D models of characters are good though there are few varients but the weapons and items are stylized and cartoon like. The textures are passable but somewhat flat lacking in detail and unnatural in colour. The environmental lighting is good but everything has that sheen that seems to be in all UE4 games which I personally think is ugly. There is no artificial lighting as of yet. The animations individually are fair although when being utilized in the fast paced gameplay become as unnatural as in all PVP shooters. The three large arenas have a lot of variation and give the feeling of different locations but have a lot of copied and pasted elements inside them. Graphic options are fairly extensive to accommodate performance.ARMA and DayZ players will recognize elements still remaining from being lifted from DayZ Battle Royal. Although acceptable it feels very lazily done.SOUND 7/10The sounds of weapons are decent they are well recorded and produced although they seem a little too enhanced to the point of not properly representing the real life weapons. The effects used to imply distance and location are especially impressive and give a perfect impression of the trajectory of the projectile. Environmental sounds are well done although limited to waves light wind and rain. Some extra sounds to add as distractions and for immersion would be effective. Sounds for vehicle engines tyres and collisions are dissapointing and sound like something cut from Wacky Races. The footstep sounds which are used for locating an enemy player are also not fit for purpose they sound far too close even when in the next building and lack obvious direction and sound as though they were recorded by jogging in place.GAMEPLAY 6/10The gameplay has a good balance between realism and an arcade feel so players of Call of Duty and ARMA can feel relatively at home here. The maps have a lot of internal variation and provide very differing and unpredictable settings for firefights. They are a little too sparse for the intended gameplay you can sometimes spend a lot of time traversing the fields to get to the playzone rather than actually fighting.The game is equally fun and frustrating mainly because of a seeming lack of an AI director to effectively disperse loot and to choose intuitive playzones sometimes leaving you without equipment and having to travel for 10 minutes before being shot by a luckier player. Firefights are fun and quite exhilerating to start with but the game is SO repetitive and games so short that it quickly feels completely mundane. The game isn't realistic enough to be immersive or rewarding enough to warrant any disappointment in failure. The introduction of cash for stash lootboxes further reduces any rewarding feeling that you get from receiving points and reduces the game to a 'Guitar Hero' with guns a cashgrab that is fun to play with friends but requires a certain possibly undesirable mindset to play alone.Gameplay could aslo be improved by optional experience based servers. Some people have already spent more than a thousand hours playing this game which makes it hard for newcomers to enjoy or gain experience.PERFORMANCE 7/10It runs smoothly enough for a fast paced shooter it's not completely seamless but it works. The main issue comes from high ping players from out of the server region which will cause massive lag and desync when you are close to them rendering you defenceless. American players suffer massively with hackers but the problem isn't as extensive in Europe. Clearly the game needs a region lock and it is bizarre (although explainable by the amount of transactions that hackers make in the marketplace) that it doesn't have one.SUMMARY 6.5/10PUBG is a well balanced shooter that is fun to play with a team of friends. It is however let down by repetitive gameplay server issues and microtransactions galore in an already unrewarding and overpriced game.Buy if You have friends to play it with.

Oh If you want to enjoy those things don't even try. People put it on the lowest settings only so they can spot you miles away. You got cool shoes in a chest you want to wear? Nope. You gotta run bare feet so people don't hear you as loud. You want to learn to play? Well amigo you gotta keep on dying for 100 hours or so untill you learn something. Want to win? You know that your chance is 1% right? Oh also you know that at least 10 of players are gonna be PROs? Well your chance of winning is probably around 0.01%. What's that? You want to play game for skins? Well you just bought $30 game where you won't be able to get skins because YOU SUCK AT GAME and kills give you money for chests but YOU WON'T HAVE ANY KILLS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LIFE! Yeah you need to throw away your humanity hate your parents and play 24/7 to earn some money. What's that you finally got 1400 coins so you can buy 2 chests? WRONG every second chest is DOUBLE THE PRICE. But don't worry you can always give your real money for those chests and also you can give some more money to get that beautiful battle pass. So what you gave those $30 for? Pretty much nothing.

And by unoptimized I mean I've played alphas of games that crashed constantly and required some serious hacks to even load in Win8 that had better framerates and loading times than this. At least this game is stable it's not gonna crash although there was a memory leak while I played.I tried to give it a chance I did even fairly well on my first few attempts but it's just a game that has huge technical issues and a few gameplay design choices I can't understand although it had bullet drop and felt sorta fair when playing. Melee hit registration is stupidly wonky though. A huge upside is that vehicles actually felt right because I was expecting them to be awful.If you liked H1Z1 or DayZ or any of those this is the game for you but personally? Can't recommend it.

I am so tired of having to clarify that cosmetics aren't P2W and that not all Microtransactions are of the devil.Worth it?If you don't like the cartoon gameplay of fortnite BR find Tarkov too Mil Sim dull dislike the Salt of Rainbow Siege or simply want an extremely active game you know will be active for 5+ years to come then Pubg is a great investment you will easily get your money worth.In conclusion?In conclusion its the best ""realistic graphics"" BR game on the market its wildly active and a cult trend right now i can see why its so popular even if I personally have it on my ""revisit later"" list worth a purchase but its not as amazing as you would think good but not great a decent burger but not a steak.https //bluntlyhonest.review/2018/01/26/player unknown battlegrounds prime steak or budget burger/",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I played enough to be top 5k NA. I played enough to get bored then have my interest sparked again. To that I tip my hat. This game has one of the absolute best battle royal feels to it. However there are still problems to be addressed (as that ""Early Access"" banner will assure you). For instance I find that more and more my deaths a lag related. I see the person shoot at them but I die without seeing any shot fired from their gun. It is.... strange. Then theres the fact that I get put in the Asia server half the time. This means i have to change server before every single match which kinda sucks. But even though there are some major issues I must say I have never enjoyed a game more.

2017-08-26,0,0,135,True,Recommended,so far ive been actualy rather happy with this game its like a simplified arma survival like game theres not much more to say. you can actually MAKE money if you play this game enough kinda like gambling in csgo only its all free.the graphics are pretty good especially for a indie game (even though they have over 4 million players.) it is a little beefy on gpu and cpu but so long as your not using the basic or cheapest gpu you can get you can acheive optimal frames. also the physics could use some work but other then that thats really it. I know many people are complaining about how they get banned unfairly. but this IS a game where teamwork and stream sniping can happen and in all honesty i think if you need to watch a persons stream just to get a kill that should be a bannible offence and there are clear ways to tell. also for the people who shoot your buddys for fun then whine about being banned thats kinda fair otherwise people who group up together and get shot at the beginning have no fun at all.now as for the game currently it is early access which puts a little dip in things but i do think the cosmetics improved the game at least in terms of lasting appeal. while this isn't tf2 in its day it may make a decent subsitute for now. in all honesty i give this game a 8.5 out of 10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That's the exact situation I see in this game. People with no taste in real games see this game on literally every ing where being played by every ing person you see on twitch youtube etc. and they start playing and try having fun like them.Yes surely this game has its moments as well. I remember my heart beating like crazy on my first couple of solo wins feeling the thrill of trying to survive was pretty exciting.

2017-03-25,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,If you are looking for a fast paced game then you might want to turn around and second guess your purchase. Even while running the game at 60+ fps there is still alot of server lag including looting ping issues with players teleporting as well as frame rate drop consistently in many areas of the map. The game would be much better if it was optimized to fix some of the issues but the slow movement and people flying around like fairies while jumping is just boring to me and super unrealistic. The new update for H1Z1 may look horrible to some but i can guarantee it will play much better with ping lock they are bringing to the table with the new features. Meaning it will cut out alot of those unwanted foreign players that desync hard and hack to win. To me H1Z1 has a much better play style by having a much quicker reaction including not taking a thousand years to parachute into the map like BG. I run H1Z1 at roughly 140fps even without optimization but for some reason this game locks me at 62fps. I prefer a much smoother gameplay without all the fanboys that bought this game due to their favorite streamers playing it and pretending that it is good and better than a game that is much better in its gamestyle. Nothing will match H1z1 because it is unique and overall better minus all the cheaters.

2018-07-08,7,37,632,False,Recommended,my honest Opinion on it because there are so many bad reviews here+ pros Greatest BR game I have played so far (I have played ArmA 2 BR H1Z1 ArmA 3 BR and Fortnite) New Map (Sanhok) is great Bugs get fixed when they appear Such much fun playing it with friends in Duos or Squad Games Optimization has improved a ton. (FPS are fine) Few Cheaters. (I have seen 2 Cheaters in 380 hours of Gameplay thats very very low when I compare it to CSGO) I like the Event Pass so you are killing people with weapons you normally wont Low queue times Weapon balancing and spawn rates specially on Sanhok cons People complain about things that are not really a problem Wish there was a lobby with 3 Players and not 3 man Squad Game Can't queue for Erangel or Miramar onlyconclusion Category Rating Graphics for a BR Game 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Audio Quality 9/10 Audio Effects (Ghost Steps Shots) 6/10 FUN with Friends 10/10 Price Worth the money overall I would recommend this game to everyone!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-17,0,0,99,True,Recommended,First of all if you are going to buy the game make sure you have some mates to play with because it makes the overall experience more enjoyable. Now with the game itself I can say that the controls aren't clunky and are relatively easy to get use to (if you are familiar with fps controls). The frames aren't too bad for lower end computer users and will continualusly get better as the devs update the games compatibility. To get a smooth experience (if you are playing on a lower end compouter) make sure you set the video settings to the lowest which maximises performance (and the game doesn't look too ugly). Overall the game at the moment is defiantly worth an investment of 30$ as it is constantly being updated and has a high replay ability level.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-29,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,PEOPLE ARE IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA OF WHAT THIS GAME COULD BE NOT WHAT IT CURRENTLY ISI never write reviews because generally I'm never this unsatisified about something I buy and I've been playing video games my entire life I generally will play anything. However there is just so much going wrong with this game that I feel people need to get the other side of the conversation that is just being ignored by people that are in love with the idea of what this game could be but not what this game really is.That's really what this game is it's a battle royale dream in theory but the game really fails to meet that expectation. My biggest issue is the inconsistancy in the level of experience you encounter between each game. Right now there is significant lag issues because the seller got greedy and didn't limit the amount of alpha users. This is an industry problem no one has really addressed. Early access should be limited based on what the provider can currently offer. Why in the world would you allow a game company that can only currently be able to support 5k members but sell 10s of thousands of game keys? It's downright idiotic. And when I say inconsistant level of play I mean it. Lag is a game killer. The game can lag at the worst times and either get you killed or you get a free klill. I would say both suck in their own ways. Another huge issue is optimization this game is a total trainwreck. Most people are just playing on minimal settings with high level gaming computers because it's highly unoptimized. Expect to play on the lowest setting possible if you don't want to struggle with FPS issues.The nail in the coffin is the large amounts of hackers cheaters and aimbots. They said they have already banned 25k hackers that's less then 1% of the popluation I've heard. Yet there are companies currently advertising selling these kinds of products and we the players have no way of really determining if it's hacking cheating aimbot or even just lag. You have no replay system which they are talking about putting it but it makes knowing how or what killed you nearly impossible unless you just record every single video and even then it's unlikely to give you enough feedback.Another thing to note is the current matchmaking system providers little to no level of play regulation between your current skill level and the people you're playing with. I'm not master aimer especially on a computer I was more of an old school Halo 2 guy but most times I just get utterly destoryed in a firefight unless I have a significant advantage which just isn't fun. There is also no real way to focus on improving you skills besides throwing yourself at new games over and over at the most populated area dying till you make a little progress. It's kind of weird to say it but it would be nice if they had a smaller team deathmatch map so people could die a bunch and learn how to actually use the guns. My last point is just more of a balance issue and how unfair some guns are. You have a sigificant advantage if you get a sniper with at least an 8x scope. As well guns like the S12K make close combat downright dreadful and grenades are very weak so you have little recourse. I think another significant improvement they could add to the game is don't make the collapse random. It would be much better especially in the later stages of collapse if it had a high prefence to close on areas where there is the least amount of people. So that it actually makes people have to stop camping and fight. It would make for much more interesting gameplay then just getting really lucky and getting a fantastic camping spot early and just riding it out.I would not recommend this game at its current price. At most it's worth only about 5 10 dollars.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-23,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,The concept is pretty fun if a little shallow and the gameplay and UIs are very nice especially gunplay. However it is currently plagued with performance issues and bugs.Unless you have an SSD you will be lucky to load in before the match starts. The world itself loads incredibly slowly when you first land.The physics is reminiscent of ARMA compelete with getting stuck in walls and wacky weightless vehicles.These are the sort of things that are forgiveable for an early access title.Honestly i would give this a neutral/mixed review if i could.The only other issues i have are with the price and a few small issues like being unable to see where your shots land making it hard to adjust for bullet drop.Their tonnes of battle royale games and mods out their in a much more content rich and stable state.

2017-12-14,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,If you're thinking about buying this game I can safely say don't...for right now anyway. From my experience this is a buggy mess which needs optimized. For example when I open the inventory I usually can't close it right away (I have to press tab multiple times to close it this is the same with the map). This game is the most buggy when you first touchdown from the plane and sometimes things have not loaded completely making it impossible to start looting however it does eventually load and will not be as laggy...after about 5 minutes. This is also a very slow game which is the way it was intended to be but it doesn't have to be THIS slow. The current map is way too large and the new map is about the same size and even more barren than the original one. I don't hate the concept or even the gameplay of this game (all they need to do is make smaller maps) but until they optimize and fix some of the bugs I'll just stick with Fortnite. Unfortunately it seems like the developers care more about adding more things into the game than actually fixing it. Which is great don't get me wrong but I just think they should focus more on optimizing right now than continually adding more and more. I hope to change my review to a recommend later when they hopefully fix it,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-13,0,0,211,True,Recommended,I m seeing a BUNCH of reviews giving negative comments and how there are Hackers everywhere in the game. Thing is I have pretty much never run into a hacker or spoofer in the playtime I have in this game. I m gonna be honest and say my mind. I believe most of the people giving bad reviews either just could never get far in the game and win or are salty as .Yes there is probably a few hackers still wandering around the game but the developers have been cracking down on them like no other. That also why there s a report function if you believe you got killed by a hacker. Most of the time the killer probably just got the jump on you or spayed more bullets into you before you could react. Though if it was a hacker it would be obvious and ban them. Getting into my next point. I ll admit if you die right at the beginning at the game and/or never make it to the end and possibly win. I admit it would probably get old. Thing is that s why people practice and play for countless hours so they can actually win a game. If your computer can t run the game then just don t play it! 1) it will ruin your experience in the game2) You will NOT win a game so don t bother. I hate it when people leave bad reviews saying there are hackers or are just triggered cuz they can t play the game due to bad computers. The game requires a decent rig to play so if you don t have one then just wait to play to game until you do. I have about 16 wins on record that I have been counting since release since the leaderboards reset due to early access. Personally I ve been having a blast with this game since it came out and I can t wait for the new map update. NOTE I know I may not have as many hours as other player s but that doesn t mean a thing. Everything I have said in this post is my opinion on the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I know it is early access or whatever but I feel like they are not even trying to improve the performance...I have a GTX 970 and I still get FPS drops the buildings sometimes fail to load at the beggining when I land and the game is just getting buggier and buggier for me.But instead of fixing that they include a new map.I literally can not run this game anymore beacuse it crashes every single time.A waste of money,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,579,True,Recommended,This game is wonderful.Let me explain The combat is fluid and fair the hit detection is second to none and the game is paced well with early game mid game and late game all in the span of 32 minutes max.I have never seen a dev so dedicated this is trully a miracle that someone so capable and willing is leading the project we get monthly content updates on top the never getting old gameplay and hotfixes are released within usually 10 20 minutes of the issue becoming noticable.Now you had blind idiots who supported Dayz post mortem and now instead of enjoying this great game with a good dev they write negative reviews because the game they have played for hundreds of hours received csgo crates which you can buy only with ingame currency that you cannot buy and only get through playing the game ( 2 out of 3 crates are free to open they sell for around 2 on the market and I personally have sold 10 crates already nearly paying for the game by itself)THE CRATES CONTAIN COSMETIC ITEMS AND ARE WORTH 2 TO SELL AND YOU CAN BUY THEM WITH INGAME MONEY PEOPLE WHY DO YOU NOT LIKE THIS,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-06,0,0,361,True,Recommended,First off i have to say that this game lives up to its reputation. I highly reccomend getting this game whether you are debating about getting it or not. Its all you could hope a battle royale game to be it has no ridiculous twists just the plain find equipment and weapons and fight against time and players. The combat is a lot hard than you would think compared to other FPS so dont go in expecting to destroy instantly as a simple 2v2 can last up to 5 minutes that said they can end quickly if you let your guard down. This game is extremely fun and don't think that only the amazing players will always win and you will die within 10 minutes because within 24 hours of the game i had come in top 10 twice in duo and won with a duo partner. Playing solo is also extremely fun and it is a game that you can play solo or with others for a whole diffrent experience. I think this game is worth the 27 and its only in its Beta stage.Now about the actual game there are less bugs than you would expect as i havent encounterd any and the game works smoothly as my PC allows it. The mechanics are easy to learn and not complicated. I can't think of anything to say really good about it to make someone buy it because its just an overall very well made game. The only down sides to the game is that the jumping is a bit iffy at time I.e you cant get over a fence the first time and fall damage is only really high buildings. the intial parachuting could be improved when about to land as you kinda just stall in the air for a while. And the scroll for weapons is delayed although I think this is done on purpose to give it a realistic effect but the U.I for the weapons is also delayed so somethimes you switch to far or too little leading to having to use the numbers. And thats the only downs to the game really. It runs smoothly and has no real big flaws in my opinion.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-06,0,0,284,True,Recommended,playerunkowns campgrounds... where do i start? This game is amazing if you enjoy the culling battle royale or h1z1 you'll enjoy this game however just being released... we come into issues that should have been addressed before releasing i know its alpha but lets be real being in alpha should no longer be a reason to have a bugged game at release let me start off by saying that they are addressing these issues currently and those issues are 1. lag the devs KNOW that theres server lag and client lag claiming that they miscalculated numbers you built a simple game has 1 map and has guns which are simple to code then the movement mechanics and what not for $30 you get 1 map and what not really? lets get past this get rich quick scams on alpha games an example of the lag is i started off could move fine for 1 sec then would warp forward or to an area i wasnt even moving to very very annoying as its constant the whole match and is a good chance it will happen next match it doesnt help that you get into a vehicle and the lag is non existant which the lag really effects fighting be ready to die after you spent 10 minutes finding 1 guy while pushing through the annoying lag. 2. glitches theres not too to many glitches but a big was is being able to go prone between stuff then getting stuck you can walk all over the area but once you crouch or go prone boom you're screwed enjoy sitting there til you die. 3. gathering items this issue plagues a lot of games for some reason you go to pick up an item and have to spam your pick up key or wait 1 2 seconds per item its not a game changer however h1z1 is bad with this and shouldn't be an issue what so ever however devs seem to not care cause we buy their games anyways. this also happens with opening doors and getting in vehicles 1 2 second delay for no apparent reason which can cause you to get in and out of a vehicle or open a door walk through then it closes and youre back where you were before you went through the door. just take note that is still there. 4. combat pistols are some what over powered you can have a level 3 helmet and vest with a coat on and get 2 shot same can happen with some rifles and i understand that headshots take a ton of health if not 1 shot kill however... with a level 3 helm i dont see why an akm or an m16a4 will being a 1 shot kill in the head top tier helmet but who am i to speak about it. also be aware that even if your sights are over a wall your shots might not go where youre aiming in 3rd person i find that acceptable as theres a red indicator showing your shots wont hit your target cause of the wall however aiming down sights thats very very annoying. other than all those issues which aren't entirely game breaking someone with a low amount of patients make break their gaming gear not good. also remember this game is an EXACT COPY of h1z1 you fly in gather stuff go to the marked location maybe find someone maybe not maybe find a vehicle maybe not and FYI THERE IS NO CRAFTING so dont come into the game expecting crafting. and using painkillers or energy drinks can replenish that extra 5% of your health bar as well as heal you over time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-11,0,0,107,True,Recommended,Ah Yes PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds. The open map battle royale sensation that took the pc gaming world by storm. A game with a steep learning curve and a lot of early access bugs that can really take away from the experience and the fun. In the games current state it's more or less if the game wants to cooperate with the hardware you have. I'm running a Gtx Titan and all of the other high end hardware to go along with it. I can only play the game on Medium settings right now. If I go any higher than that buildings can take up to a minute to fully load and be accessible. That can be detrimental to game play. So in short at the moment the hardware/optimization aspect needs a lot of work and it's more or less a gamble whether or not the game will run well for you. As far as the core game. It is in my opinion one of the funnest multiplayer shooters I have ever played. The large open map exploration looting countless buildings for new equipment armor and accessories brings hours worth of fun. As I mentioned in the beginning of the review PUBG does have a steep learning curve. There are people who have been here since day one. Growing and learning the game and bringing experience from other games that controll similar to PUBG and absolutely destroying their competition. There can be a lot of frusteration that occurs after searching for all your equipment finally having a full set up and boom you've been shot from who knows where. PUBG is a game just as much about listening to your surroundings as it is keeping a close eye on it. The audio levels do needs some work though. It can be a little much when you have gunfire an airplane flying overhead and a redzone going off all at once it's very loud. There is also an issue with the sounds of players footsteps it's an important part of the game to be able to hear where another player is as of now that audio is shoddy at best and can be misleading when trying to find the player you're hearing. You may thing you hear them in a building you are in when they're really in the next building over. Over all even though there is no definite way of knowing how the game will run/play for you until you buy it. The working fully optimized PUBG will be one of the best multiplayer games out on both PC and consoles. There is hours worth of fun to be had and it will be exciting to see how they improve the game over time. The Devs have a lot to work on and progress can seem slow but progress is being made an it's noticeable. For me personall the game plays much better than it did even a month ago. It's been worth every penny. I've talked my buddies into buying it and they all have enjoyed the game as well.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Once they optimize the game it will be even better. Long gunfights to short range spraying is all intense and involves a lot of strategy straight from the start of where you even land. Each gun is slightly different and how you approach each circle is different wether you want to flank a team or wait for two teams to fight it out then run.Great game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-17,0,0,1030,True,Recommended,You are stranded from your squad in a farmhouse looting for med kits and weapons when another squad happens upon your location and stops outside. You radio your teammates who hop in a jeep and drive to your location while you crouch in a closet. An enemy reaches the top floor and begins searching through rooms while you ready your shotgun.. He just about reaches your closet when he hears your team arrive and runs to the window to engage them. All hell breaks loose as you emerge from your hiding place and open fire on the unsuspecting enemy.This is just one of the infinite number of scenarios that can unfold each time you play a round of Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.This battle royale format of FPS suits many different playing styles stealth run and gun camping sniping etc etc. But don't get too comfortable with that style because the gameplay setup will routinely force you to go outside your comfort zone.You start in the lobby area which allows you to pick up and try the weapons for a short time while the server fills up with players. The game starts with a plane flying over a massive island where players choose their position to parachute from. Choose a remote area for relatively uninterrupted looting go into a city for a quicker ability to gear up jump to a key location like the school a hospital or the power plant or find a vehicle and drive to a location outside the path the plane took.If you encounter someone early on you may only have a melee weapon or a pistol or your bare knuckles to defend yourself. Looting up quickly is key.Soon after dropping in a circle appears that you must work your way inside of because when a countdown time is finished a poisonous closes in and can drain your health if caught outside the circle. This circle gets gradually smaller while the gas becomes more toxic as the game progresses.The gameplay increases in intensity as players are forced into ever smaller tracts of land until one person duo or 4 man squad is declared the winner.A wide range of weapons and attachments available including rarer weapons only available by daring to approach an air drop.It's fun intense challenging and incredibly addictive with no two rounds ever the same. This game will hold your attention for a long time Given it is an early access game PUBG is not without its flaws but a dev team is working tirelessly to address them and listens well to the feedback from fans.If you enjoy shooters you can't go go wrong with this game!!! As an early access game PUBG gets 5 out of 5.stars from me!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-23,0,0,29,False,Recommended,O.K. game. Very frequent updates Dev transparency Weekly/monthly updates that introduce new content bug fixes A/C tweaks and optimization. Some cons though are the vehicle systems (unstable death traps) server lag/de sync issues and the absense of a shooting range in which players can test/practice the many weapons in game. Another thing that grinds my gears is the Red Zone a BR game should not do random damage like this. Also the loot tables. there have been times where I have been in 4 different houses and I have yet to find a gun. If you are new to PC games I would not recommend. If you have a background in other shooters then I would definitely recommend. There are several minor issues which if fixed could easily compete with it's competitors. I feel that PUBG corp. is slowly making the game better focusing on the bigger issues such as cheaters optimization and bug fixes. Though I feel like minor issues such as server lag/de sync bad vehicle system etc. should be rolled out before new content such as new guns maps etc.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Will that shot land? Will there actually be a gun in this house that's worth firing? Will the circle land nearby? If not will there be a car nearby that I can use to get to the circle cause the map is so huge that there's no way I'll get there without one.There's many other battle royale games out there... pick one of those let this one die.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

As someone with over 350 hours plus in the game please listen to me when I say stay away and save your $30 for now. Think about spending that money on a gmae thats far better developed than this. The game isn't anywhere near worth $30 in its current state.

2017-10-14,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,This is my first experience with the game. Other people might have better or worst experience. Would be a decent game if there was not some much server lag. For an ealry access game $30 is steep just to try it and to have server lag. If there was lag in a game or two I would recommend trying it but 5 game in a row is not reasonable for the amount of money being spent. Game bugs would be understandable but to have server lag trying out the game preventing me from enjoy it and able to help in providing feedback is something that needs to be dealt with.Liked Time / Area Limit Matches ( Safe Zone shrinks over time )Easy Inventory Management ( Easily Interact with items ect First Aid Weapons/Weapon Attachments Armor/Clothes )Easy Keyboard and GamePad Controls ( Simple commonly used controls )Disliked Server Lag ( As stated about 5 game in a row server lag effected gameplay )Aim Sensitivity ( Tried adjusting higher and lower just does not like to have middle ground ) No ingame friends list ( Steam Friends Only ) Currently only one map (Hopefully more map later )Price Tag ( $30 is pretty high for EA game with unstable servers )Overall First Impression Not worth the time and money for something I really could not play.Fix the server lag problems then the game would be worth trying out and might be enjoyable to play with friends. I would write a better review when the game gets more stable but for now I am going to get my money back.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-20,0,0,188,True,Recommended,Fun as hell best multiplayer game out there atm. Just look at the current players despite only being out for a couple months it tops the most popular steam games Dota 2 and CSGO. With the new crates that you can sell on the market for around 60 to 80 cents you can make quite a bit of money back from this game depending on how much you play and win. Overall I highly recommend this game for anyone who is into comptetive shooters. If you do purchase this game then please do the community a favor and don't be a camper. Actually try and go kill people instead of cowering inside a building or behind cover so you up your placement. It is a lot more fun to play this game aggresive and get lots of kills rather than win with only 1 kill from being a camper. The game does need a lot of work and new maps/guns would be greatly appreciated but I am confident that those features will be implemented in the near future.

2017-08-11,0,0,222,True,Recommended,Honestly worth every penny. I don't understand why some people are so upset about the microtransactions that have absolutely no affect on gameplay whatsoever. If someone want's to pay $10 for a random chance of getting a dope coat to wear while they play (that doesn't affect the players storage or anything) then why should anyone be able to stop them? It doesn't hurt anyone or the playerbase and the microtransactions are good for long term development so long as they stay unaffecting gameplay. Onto the game itself. Freaking. Fantastic. It has that intense action packed gunplay of games like DayZ and the original DayZ mod but in a far more condensed version and without the literal hours of looting and running that those games entailed. The gun mechanics are tight and there is truly a difficult decision to be made when picking which weapon to use in a match as they're nearly all viable (lookin at you VSS). It is honestly some of the best fun I've had playing with friends in duo and squad games. I'm personally not as big of a fan of solos but to each his own. The devs as much as people complain really are fantastic and really do care about this game and the playerbase. I can see the time and the love that they have poured into this game and it really shines through when playing. I have full faith that the game will only improve over time as they have already fufilled so many of their early access promises and only continue to do so. In conclusion I highly reccomend this game. When playing with friends and even solos it's an action packed heart pounding adrenaline rush of a game that just never seems to get old. The devs are incredibly active and even though they've made some mistakes have a real heart for this game and the players. I would highly reccomend this game if a battle royale shooter sounds like the type of thing for you (yes even for $30).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Good game and good concept however some minor tweaks could be made to make this game even better for example the chance you have to find a gun other than a pistol or shotgun is quite small when you first land except when you got to the larger areas this makes the gameplay quite unfair in my perspective. Another thing that i think should be added is a smaller map this can be better for the aggressive playstyles having a smaller map also eleminates the long runs you have to make to the safe zone. Having a large map creates an extended amount of time in which players will not see another player for a long time. In many of my games i have spent 5 10 minutes running across the lage map just to be killed by a player camping in a building. Having a smaller map would take away these problems and make a fun quick and explosive gaming experience. Other than these issues this game is good and would be fun for any FPS player.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-17,0,0,2360,True,Recommended,PUBG is possibly my new all time favorite game. I originally came from the Battle Royale Mod that PlayerUnknown made for Arma 3 and as soon as I saw that he had began developing his own standalone game I knew I needed to get it. I waited a while to write this review because I wanted to soak alot before I expressed my opinion. I'm going to start by saying that PUBG without a doubt has some problems. Some of these include the occasional server lag and the chinese takeover of the NA servers. This I feel will be getting fixed in the long run seeing that the devs are very enthusiastic about their game. Now some people say its stupid that you can get banned from stream sniping/ team killing this is their way of trying to fix trolls and people that ruin the experience. There are ways they can change that and better ways to prevent the cheaters but the game hasnt been out for a year yet. The devs are trying and will find a way to fix these problems. The game also has a great deal of good things. This includes but is not limited to monthly updates and weekly patches. The monthly updates always add new items or aspects into the game some are small and some are big. They are also working on more maps to try to prevent the game getting boring and repetitive. Another pro is that the game is realistic but not too realistic there are realistic aspects but they arent too hardcore. Some examples could be bullet ballistics muzzle flashes bullet types and grenades some things that prevent it from being too hardcore is there is no bleeding unlike H1Z1's bleeding mechanic. This game is a very fun and chill game to play with your friends or by yourself I highly recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-20,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Game seems to have issues with AMD processors. I well exceed the minimum requirements by at least 8 gb in every direction yet the game runs incredibly choppy with FPS lag as low as 20. There isn't a noticable difference in FPS and performance when operating the game at ultra or very low. I still have FPS spikes. The volume needs work as shots echo as if they were passing through a tunnel. The recent patch made a VERY small improvement on my end in terms of performance and has seemed to make it more difficult to find any weapons (6 attempted games after patch and located only 1 AK despite being first in that area). Typically I end up locating a pistol and just getting easy kills on unfortunate players that have a frying pan. This is idiotic and takes away from the fun and the reason why I would play this game. Currently I would reccommend H1Z1 heavily over Battlegrounds mostly due to performance issues and lack of quality gameplay.

Maybe you end a game with a kill or not even. This game encourages coward playstyles unlike titles like H1Z1 or Fortnite. Don't get me wrong the final circle is incredibly intense but this point is worthless when you spend half the game trying to get attachments just to pimp out all your guns and make minor changes. In other titles of the same genre you pick up one gun and it is all up to skill. Not up to how many attachments you may have or how much loot you spent hiding in a game.Don't recommend this game in its current unoptimised state. slanee,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At the start PUBG was truly a game ""by gamers for gamers"". The developer has officially stated to not go into micro transactions and the like. Only to throw that completely overboard in the latest patches. Instead of focusing on core bugs the game has (lag glitches the amount of system resources it eats) it seems money in an early access game is more important. Beside that banning people who kill streamers because the streamers refuse to put a delay on their streams.. priceless. TL DR Developer is breaking all 'his/their' promises. Are in it for the easy money. They focus more on getting more money (by way of streamer advertisement/loot boxes for money (like CSGO) and less to actually tackle issues that need to be tackled.

2017-04-11,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,Alright. Lets start with the positives. The plot and the gun play is good but jsut like most early access game it was released way too soon. I've experienced so far to dieing to vehichle explotion while swimming together with 2 teammates yet no vehicle or enemy player was even arround. I've shot people in the chest close up with shotgunsmultiple times and gotten 2 shot by a rifle.yet I always die to the first shot from a shotgun every signle time with body armour and helmets.The movement on uneven ground is clounky and it gets me stuck a lot and specially in the worst time it could happen it always does. The game runs like complete (With a good setup). There's a lot of internet lag and fps lag. I would wait to buy this game until they've fixed that to save yourself from the frustrating feeling you'll get from playing it. I get it everytime.

These are the people who don't know about developing a game and maintaining it. Not every problem can be fixed overnight. People will try to run it below minimum requirements and then call it ""unplayable"". Does it have it's issues? Yeah it does. The netcode is very unoptimized and the servers tend to take a hit sometimes but it's not like you'll get that ""unplayable experience"" every damn time. Bluehole said they are working on improving the game which is definitely going to take some time. You can compare the state the game is in now and the state in which it was one year ago. Tell me you don't see the difference.

2017-12-21,0,0,412,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a Battle Royale Game that features back to back matches of fighting to the death and I love it.In the game as of Dec 21st 2017 there are two maps 1 Forest Rural/Urban Map and a Desert Rural/Urban Map. The Maps are set up quite nicely with a good amount of space with cities and a great amount of space for forests and other rural type buildings. The game offers nice houses to hide in or fast paced streets to run through.The various vehicles allow for fast travel and work nicely. I dont have much to complain about themA random red zone bombs an area every so often attempting to kill anything in its radius.The Gunplay is great in my opinion and the guns sound and feel great. The only thing I might like to be different would be adding more power to pistols just cause they feel pointless against anything else. Which of course they should but I still feel like there should be a bit more power.The Game offers a small but nice customization system where in game currency from winning and killing in matches.The Only con to this game is the lag and fps drops. I do wish that fps was steady and the map would load in completely before dropping as it offers a disadvantage to some players if there buildings to not load in (I myself have not had this problem but the people I play with do).Overall PUBG offers hours of fun and is great to play with friends or alone if your feeling it. It is definately worth 30 dollars.I recommend PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,752,False,Recommended,"This game is anything but perfect.The servers can be horrendous. There are many many bug often game breaking when they occur.The game is in fact slow which to some is a major problem. A ""running simulator"" some call it. Which is fair.There are notorious quantities of hackers despite my encounter of only one over 400 hours.Such complaints can go on for days and many of them are valid.But the game is fun. That's the honest truth. It's a flawed product despite leaving early access I expect it will remain glitchy and laggy for the foreseeable future but the game remains fun. It's true that it can be slow and much of the round is. The first 5 minutes generally consist of scouring the area for any viable loot mostly with little to no items of real value found. And then the trek begins if you're unlucky with the spawn of the zone. In my experience 95% of the time it's on the opposite side of the map. It's infuriating. If you can't find a vehicle you're stuck running for several minutes hoping its enough to outrun the zone. When you finally make it you're sitting behind a tree and healing looking around for someone anyone who would ambush you. The landscape is barren devoid of life. And then as soon as you begin to move to the next zone a sniper bullet goes through your head. That's it. You're dead. All the time you spent looting running all that is gone to waste and you never saw a soul the whole game. So what do you do? Well you either quit in fury or you immediately start another game. I am of the latter. Immediately you can start doing it all over again.When you actually find an enemy it's a flurry of action. Suddenly having bullets whizz past your head from a suppressed gun in an unknown location is legitimately intimidating. Being caught in the open is a nightmare. Anyone could have the tactical advantage on you and you've got to find a way out or forward. The gunplay itself is not snappy and ultra responsive like Call of Duty or Battlefield. It's in many ways slow and clunky. You will wrestle with the insane recoil the sway of long range scopes and the drop and speed of bullets. Often it seems as if hits simply aren't registering or the person is an invincible hacker. But when you manage to defeat your attacker it's a small moment of exhilaration. That's what keeps me hooked on this game The feeling of victory. I feel so much satisfaction lining up a headshot on a far away foe with a Kar98k. The game is nominated in the steam awards for ""Mom's Spaghetti"" and I believe it's the only game not in the horror genre nominated. There's good reasoning for that. When it comes down to you and a few others in one tiny zone everything silent as everyone tries to spot each other it gets you shaky. There's a legitimate adrenaline rush in the gameplay unlike anything I've ever played. The sheer ecstasy in winning my first chicken dinner is one of the best moments I've had in gaming.The fact of the matter is Battlegrounds is a flawed game. From a matter of design its a mess. But what has made it the most played game on steam is the strength in the experience of actually playing. This game is simply fun to play from the quiet moments running through a forest to the roaring firefights in a city. It's the lowest of lows as you take loss after loss but the highest of highs when you claim victory. That's the experience of Battlegrounds not a perfect game but a damn good time.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-14,0,0,569,False,Recommended,Pubg.... Intense Social Aggravating Challenging and alot of fun. Is there buggs? YES are they enraging at times YES are they hillarious at times oh by god YES. Sometimes your motorbike gets sent into orbit after hitting an invisble pebble on the road. At first you might be mad but you laugh at it later. Sometimes you run into some guy named ChengLong who shoots you from across the map through a rock with an AWM he got from who knows where? But sometimes just sometimes you are in luck you get 15 kills you out play your opponents and at last you and your brothers/sisters in arms stands there with a the bright Yellow text saying Winner Winner Chicken Dinner and at that moment you are truly on top of the world.Now I got about 384 hours in this game and I'm still playing is it for everyone? No. But it is a good game by my standards despite its short comings. Now is it worth 30 euros yes I would say so especially if you have friends playing it. I do reccomend however that you have a HDD with high rpm or an SSD otherwise you might end up with a problem a friend of mine have that it takes forever for him to load in and sometimes he dosent even make it in. But if you have either I will say that the game has alot of replay value. It does not have a Singleplayer campaign you can play it as solo. It does not have a Multiplayer Campaign and you do require internet connection to play it. If you have read or seen anything about PUBG you would probably know this already but I'll mention it none the less.I hope this has been informative and if so see you in the battlegrounds and remember Memento Mori and show no Mercy,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-11,0,0,45,True,Not Recommended,"This is by far the most delicately crafted piece of sh**ty optimization I've ever seen in a game. I bought the game some months ago and the optimization was quite terrible and now it is just as crappy as before. As if there aren't enough glitches in game the developers seemingly thought ""Hey let's include glitches ""out game"" as well!"". The game is so problematic that it's instabilty even interferes with the Windows itself. While the game is open everything outside the game starts to act extremely sluggish and sometimes simply freezes. EVEN THE TASK MANAGER ITSELF. And the funny thing is that these problems supposedly occur when a internet browser is open. How come they made something that interferes with a browser I'll never get to know. I never encountered this problem in any other game whatsoever. And that just means that the programmers weren't thinking straight. We're in the year 2017 and yet developers still can't find a way to optimize a game? Did they code this game in Visual Studio 2010? Seems like they actually did it with ""Brainfu**""(and yeah there is a programming language called like that). I don't care that everyone likes this game and claims that it is awesome and whatever I don't care that it made its way into eSports Gaming Events so quickly if one can't get the game properly working unless one satisfies some extremely odd and cryptic conditions then everything else is worthless. And don't come to me stating that my pc is crappy and I should buy a new pc or this game is still in beta stage and not fully completed. I can play most games made in this year without any problems (at least problems like this) but I can barely play this ""particular"" game. I wonder why? It doesn't help that I mostly suck at these kind of games but here there are just too many problems within this game. It wouldn't be much of a problem if this game were free but paying for a game just to deal with some problems and get frustrated isn't really my style.

The game has come to a so high popularity stage that theese ""critcs"" have come. They are angry at the develops for many diffrent reasons. They find a single little thing they can attack the developers for so they have a reason to spread negativity in the community. so i a honest normal gamer will give you a reviewFor Casual gamers BUY THIS GAME. if you are not person thinking about rank and stuff you will absolutly love this game. The possibilities are endless. Yes the goal of a match is to get the sweet victory but you can also just do completely insane strats just for fun because noone is stopping you from it. You might think the game i filled up with proffesional gamers so you cant win it kinda is but it dosent really matter. The skill gap in this game is very low. you dont need to have top notch aim or inhuman reflexes to win. the recoil pattern on the guns are fairly simple and nearly everytime a player wins a game luck is also a big part of their victory. So you as a casual gamer also have the chance to get sweet winFor the Competitive gamers If you are in it for the win its kinda mixed if i should recommend it for you. If you have the spare money sure buy it but if theese 30 euro could have better use wait till the game is out of early accses. The game is way too buggy to have a fair and balanced score keeping system. I wouldent say im truly competitive but there i times where i have gone tryhard mode to get up in the ranks and then get killed simply because of the bugs in this game. Its frustrating but it dosent make the game bad. The Basics of this game are great. it has everything to make a fun addictive game. So i wouldent keep you from buying this game because of the bugs because it only happens sometimes. This game is hard to review for a cometitive gamer.

2017-07-24,0,0,574,True,Recommended,Player's Unknown's Battlegrounds is an amazing game but has some querks to it wichch i will tell you about shortly. First off i have over 200 Hours in this game and was not very keen on it at first but as i gradually played it more and more i started to enjoy it. The game it self at first had some bad performance issues which have seem to been fixed in a short amount of space due to the montly updates that the team does. The Comabt system is iffy as sometimes you can be fustrated by the your bullets going into to space for no apprent reason but the Comabt over all is good as it only takes a couple of shots to kill a person. There are two ways that you can play this game 1. either camp which i do not suggest since in ruins the fun out of the game or 2. constatly push people and hope that you can kill them. Most of the palyerbase are good palyers and they push but you come across some campers that just stay in the same place and can annoy you the the max because you dont know where they are. Speaking of the playerbase it has very few hackers on it which is a good as the team were very good in banning hackers from the get go. Loot is decent you can get some games with zero loot and just have to work your way around or you can get a game that has a ton of AR's are you are loaded with ammo and meds. The massive down side to this is that the safe zone seems unfair as when you are in the top 5 of people the zone seems to give an unfair advantge as it is not even for most players which helps the people in the zone to win the game the people outside the zone in the top 5 normally have to push and even then you are most likly going to get killed because of the people seeing you in the zone. With all this said it is a wonderful game to play 99% of the time and has many great things to come to it with the monthly updates and so forth i would 100% recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,55,True,Recommended,So like everyone else coming to this game from H1Z1 is instantly a huge improvement. everything about this game already feels super nice and fluent. so far i have not run into any bugs that have caused any issues in game at all.Pros gameplay is fun lots of different guns and attachments you arent always going to get the best gun right away when you get kills you are rewareded has full leaderboards for singles duos and squads (something H1Z1 needs) cars work very nicecons poor optimization (the first update is going to start fixing this) graphics arent the best but im sure will be improved over time servers are slightly laggy at times due to game just launchingOverall i really dont have many complaints for this game as i know it just lauched only a little over 24 hours ago there really arent as many problems as some game lauches have had in the past. i hope the devs keep going with this game and continue to do what they are planning to do with it. i do not see myself stopping playing this game anytime soon!would reccomend this game for anyone looking for a battle royale style game it is going to be updated frequently and is coming in at a price point of only 30$!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-12,0,0,64,False,Recommended,I am a huge fan of PUBG you may not think that seeing I only have 50hrs logged at the time of writing this and I am writing this review because I like the game and the flaws need to be adressed as I want the game to be as great as possible but these flaws are holding it back. 1. Map Size. The new map aims to fix this issue. The two maps we have are too big therfore making gameplay feel alot slower and increasing game time turning off some people who do not have time to deticate like 30 minutes to a round just to die ( I am exagerating but the point remains) 2. FPS This has been mostly fixed but I think they could squeeze a few more frames out of the game. (Espescialy on Xbox One)3.Cheaters. you can ask many different people and they will say many different things about cheaters in PUBG I have encountered my share of cheaters and it is %100 not fun dealing with them in any Battle Royale game Alot of people complain about PUBG cheaters because the games Anti Cheat needs to be better to stop cheaters from well CHEATING! If I had to give the game a final verdict I would give it a 7/10Do I recommend you go buy this game att its full price of $36.99cnd yes I do just be aware of the issues. I also know Bluehole is not a freindly company to Epic Games in particular with the whole lawsuit and everything. I try to sperate artists from their work and not form my oppinion of the game until I have tried it and I quite like the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It not only the battle royal mode that exploded in popularity because of this game it actually have evolutionized a variety of gameplay mechanic that we soon will find in other games. Distance positioning gun skill and surrounding awareness is what i would say pubg is about.Also the new 3D sound engine really adds to the atmosphere and orientation.

2018-02-19,0,0,1333,False,Not Recommended,1k+ hours and I can not recommend this game in this current state. Will I keep playing it? Yeah probably I'm a sucker for punishment. The game itself is fun simple even. Drop in get loot kill. Fight or hide your way to the number one spot for that tasty chicken dinner. The gunplay is satisfying (even with the rework to ballistics). Gunfights are intense. But the number one problem the game is facing right now? Blatant hackers. Might have to do with my ranking but I'm getting one pretty much every match. From blatant ESP instant heal/revives shooting THROUGH WALLS all the way to aimbots. It just never seems to end and is only seeming to get worse as we go on. (INB4 Xenophone) Most of these hackers seem to be chinese players as well. Which NORMALY wouldn't irk me so much seeing as I play on NA servers... but here's the thing the majority of NA games seemed to be utterly filled with Chinese players. Every.Single.Game. Every game I have joined for months now have been filled with chinese players mic spamming (CHYNA NUMBA WUN) or just have an open mic in some game cafe. Lets say they were not even cheating (crazy I know) they shouldn't be allowed to play on the servers just from the massive ping advantage they get. Too many things are client side in this game so the ping advantage they get from playing on NA servers is just frustrating at best. The amount of times I get shot from a player after I run behind cover is just disgusting and everytime it happens well what do you know... its a chinese player on the NA servers.I remember this game having a ping lock. Your ping goes to high? The game froze you in place and told you that your ping was too high. That has been removed you some odd reason. I get the the dev doesn't want to region lock their money making region (as scummy as that is) but really? Removing the ping lock? One of the smartest things they added to the game just gone. And why? Hell if I know.This game is going down the same path as H1Z1 and I have a feeling people will jump ship as soon as a competent developer tries their hand at the BR genre. I know I will. I love this game but the lack of action from the devs its slowly going to kill this game.To wrap this up it's a good idea of a game. Its fun at its best moments. Satisfying gunplay. But its broken buggy and has one of the worst hacker problems I have ever seen in a game. And with a either stubborn or inexperienced dev team I don't see this game lasting when some actual competition enters the genre.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Definitely recommend trying it with friends as well definitely improves my experience.

2017-07-05,0,0,469,True,Recommended,"amazeballsEDIT Amendment while this game is still incredible and has only gotten better with age (!!!) the server management is probably close to the worst I've seen. Let's not even talk about the fact that you literally can't even find servers to play on a lot of the times in your home county. NA is full probably 20% of the times I try to play at night. But even worst You will NOT find English speaking people in your NA server groups 99.9% of the time. In the last 40 games I haven't had a single one. Mind blowing. Further A LOT of the chinese players are just cheats or don't give a FU$% and will constantly throw games teamkill run off with their buddy etc..And now I hear the EA servers are also having terrible stuff like instead of better policing BlueHole is actually ADVERTISING game speed boosting VPN services for them...as if after buying the game and then seeing PAID ADS in a game you BOUGHT the next logical step would be BUYING a service that would make that game playable.Jesus. What a clusterFU#$. And what sucks is that it's either put up with it and watch the cancer spread or let a beautiful game die and wait another 1 2 years for a worthy replacement to be at its current level.I'm heartbroken and confused. It's a very love hate thing going on. I just really hope they get their together and make a 180 degree turn from the dark place they're moving towards before they end up like the next ""The Culling"".Hopefully I'll get another reason/chance to edit this again. Really hoping steamsalty I still recommend the game but only because of the faith I think BlueHole deserves here that they will course correct and fix these issues soon.

2017-11-12,0,0,251,True,Recommended,Pro + Battle Royale System is a nice game structure+ It is fun to play solo or with friends+ The amount of possible changes at every weapon is good+ Different weather settings+ Quite good optimization for better performance+ Frequently given updatesContra Weather settings like foggy and rainy does rise the difficulty a lot. Many bugs (But that's okay it's an Early Access game) Many cheaters many trollers (if you forget to disable Auto Matchmaking in Squad) No killcam (Would be nice to replay it to change your tactics and improve your playstyle) Laggy servers doesn't matter in which region. The Blue Zone Update was gamebreaking. If you jumped out at the other end of the map you can leave. Many low blue zone or house campers who just lay down at the border and wait in a bush like Gaddafi in his dirthole. The announced updates like the new map and Vaulting update come later than announced. This game has no VAC Status so Bluehole has to ban every cheater themself. They ban players for several reasons without giving evidence. (Kill a streamer and you'll get banned)Conclusion I think this game has great potential and it is on a good way. It is also fun to play but the contra points are really heavy sometimes so after one game you might lose the fun at it for a day. I hope Bluehole keeps developing the game as good as they done until now (except the Blue Zone Update) so the game will be one of the best in the Battle Royale genre.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Along with the framerate issues are brutal audio skips which feels like a heavy metal concert where every instrument is a helicopter with phantom skips and footprint sounds thrown in. Apart from optimisation woes I'd also love for the game to improve jumping mechanics as well as make it easier to discern where you're being shot from. It'd also be nice if spectactors could at least do a *little* something... maybe be able to pull up the map and navigate?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you are going to play Player Battlegrounds and you get the new map i request that you should leave as soon as possible. The circle is a to me The red zone has been on me 4 freaking times .

You parachute to an area as far away from other people as you can but it's still uncomfortably close to a couple of other people (2 or 3) that you saw parachuting down nearby. You loot the first house or two (meaning you walk inside find a pistol and maybe a tactical vest and ammo laying in the middle of the floor in a pile). You go outside look around to be sure your friends haven't started closing in on you. You loot the next house (remember it's copy/paste pile in the middle of the floor). The game begins telling you that the playing area is shrinking and you have 2 minutes to get inside the new boundaries. You go outside happy with the amount of firearms/bandages/ammo/armor that you have and start making your way toward where the game is telling you the new zone is. Along the way you find a car. You get in the car and drive into a nearby micro town. Someone shoots at you. So you have a standoff on the edge of the town knowing that the person who was sniping at you will have to go to the new smaller zone at some point. He comes out armed with an sks and wearing underwear and an afro. You try to run him over and succeed taking a few hits to the car and some minor damage to your player. You hear gunshots nearby. You see that there are only 45 players remaining so you hurry to the middle of the new zone. You heal up with your bandages and prepare for the last bit of fighting. I mean there's half left so you're going to win right? You loot nearby structures carefully clearing them room by room. It's getting close to the finale now. There's 25 people left. You're stoked. You can see the magic blue boundaries for 360 degrees around you. So you're crouched down waiting licking your dorito stained lips in excitement for what is about to transpire. You see a small shack that is 2 stories high about 15 yards from you so you head that way. You carefully ascend the stairs and clear the room no loot. You go to open the bathro BAM BAM BAM BAM. You're dead cause someone was camping in there and you nearly sh*t your pants and your computer chair. Go back to lobby and queue for another game. 95 people drop from a plane onto an island.

2018-01-02,0,0,351,False,Recommended,I love this game. Has a great new look on shooters. But I do have some serious issues that need addressing. If you looking to play this game and have fun and never win. This is the game for you. Because it is full with chineese f***king hackers. The game is amazing. until you want to play with new people. you cant ever match with americans in the US servers about 90% full of hackers and aimbots. Someone needs to do region locks so that you cant be in japanee or china or whereever. if it is a US server you need to be in the US. I want to have fun but cant due to the lack 0f effort by game delevlopers. And now with the new added death cam it just makes it so much easier to watch your deams get shattered due to hackers. I have seen it over and over. A common one is which I see a person lean left or right for no real reason and aim no where near me and kill me instantly with a head shot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Before I coudl win a few games and get ranked against people who were really good and cared to live until the end which made for exciting mid and end game. New system players aren't placed with MMR of their own ranking so every game is filled with noobs trying to get as many kills as shroud and dying in the first 5 minutes which makes the next 20 minutes boring af until the last 5 minutes where you face off with the last 10 people.

2017-12-24,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,A blatant rip off of H1Z1 that is buggy full of cheaters and generally an unfun game. The game has managed to hit a bandwagon of hype that it doesn't deserve. Playing with a group of friends lends moments of humor but that is more laughing at the horrible physics and the obvious cheaters rather than actually enjoying the game itself.Add on to that the developers refusing to make regional servers (so rubber banding and lag related issues will forever plague the game) and PUBG shows that it has no ability or hope to become an actually enjoyable game.Edit After attempting to return the game due to technical issues I was refused twice from Valve.

2017-07-26,0,0,960,True,Recommended,EDIT Alright. It didn't even take me 10 games with my new computer to win. Twice. I can finally see the difference between players and bushes from a distance. Aiming is easier as you don't have those pesky mini spikes anymore and opening/closing doors way are more consistent.I've also got more control over where my enemies are judging by the sound they make. I'm also pretty sure I can spot players from way further away though this might just be my imagination. But all in all the game still feels the same but it's a LOT more pleasant to play with a high end computer for sure. PRE EDIT The game's pretty fun. Requires skill luck patience and general knowledge about the game. Fun to play with friends but if you have an old computer this game will screw you over most times. It will lag as hell during the parashoot phase even simple tasks like opening doors will show to be a challenge. You can get glitched and stuck in doors under stairs or similar things. You can't spot players far away because the field of vision just doesn't reach that far with your currenct specs and optimalization. Even when every setting but Field of Vision is put on the lowest setting. I ended up spending over $3750 on a brand new high end computer for this game. I might update this review if I see drastic changes in FPS drops lag and/or screen tearing and other crucial gameplay changes. Because I would not recommend this game if it requires you to have a high end computer to play it properly. That is just not acceptable in my opinion.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-31,0,0,322,False,Not Recommended,Fortnite is just more complete compared to this game. This game is more based on luck with the circles then actual skill. In Fortnite you can out build the opponent in most if not all situations when they don't grasp that element of the game. Fortnite is also more satisfying because you see alot more people in the games and they go by faster. PUBG just seems to be a waste of time when you don't see anyone for like 30 minutes then get sprayed down from nowhere. Trust me I have the aim from 1600 hours of cs to be able to kill some oppnents but the long games don't make playing worth it. The game also gets terrible framerates still. On my 1070Ti I get around 80fps on lowest with textures high whilst fortnite gets 300 on the same settings. It's unbelievable how they can't optimize a game like this... its astonishing how much the devs don't give two s about the game and don't even try at all like AT ALL. They just don't try at all to compete with the opposing game... They are losing hard in the battle that's for sure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Literally no reason for this game not not agree with my system and connection but apparently this company doesn't want to invest in its users by creating a program that can actually enter into a game. By the way this developer is known to charge for various games (DayZ H1Z1 etc.) just to abandon development and support.H1Z1 started at like 20 bucks absolutely never came to a point where the game was playable or even close to ""finished"" and then focus goes to PUBG a new game being charged $30. you all for you are a joke. bad game",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-14,0,0,424,False,Recommended,I think this game is great. Of course there are bugs but every game is going to have bugs so stop ya in. This game is hard in general so it makes it worth my while to want to get better. Your going to need a decent pc to run this game as mine runs 60 fps with a gtx 970 gpu and a i7 8700k cpu. This game should not deserve the amount of hate it gets considering that most of the negative reviews I see are Fortnite fan boys but thats besides the point the game has great loot spawn rates (except for miramar can't find a gun to save my life) the shooting is great but people say it's bad due to them not knowing that recoil is a thing kills feel very satisfying not like a run n gun like cod where another kill doesn't feel special and the way games roll out is insanely fun because hearing someones footsteps in my building scares the out of me and makes me feel like my life is on the line like a real gun fight would be like. I think this game is amazing and you should definently pick it up if you haven't already there will be bad momenets but know that everyone is going to die so it shouldn't tilt you but it happens.

Really hard for first time players (which i dont think is a bad thing if its fun playing but not knowing where you are getting shot from after a 30 minute game is not fun) and it doesn't help that there isnt any sort of matchmaking so first time players play against peopla that has hundreds of hours of gameplay. Apart from that the game is glitchy buggy in many ways and instead of trying to improve those aspects they keep realising huge patches (last one was 13 gb) for skins and emojis which would be great if it didnt have major problems.Im writting these review because i didnt play for a while (after the 13 gb update) and now that is done i played 20 mins and got to crashes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You'll spend the first 5 8 min looting and the next 10 15 min carefully moving through the map hopefully doing a handful of 2 5 second adrenaline pumping shootouts.

2018-06-19,0,0,94,False,Recommended,Theres two major things that I think need to be changed to make this a great game. The first is optimization. While being much better then what it was in early access there's still a lot that needs to be done. The second is the removal of keys for unlocking crates you had already unlocked by playing. If you're going to add a reward system let it actually be rewarding instead of charging you to unlock what you had earned. Overall I still recommend this game unless the devs keep ignoring these major issues. But it seems like they're making very small steps in the right direction.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-28,0,0,428,False,Not Recommended,So I bought the game and played it some hours. I thought I would get some action but here I am going in a house to get shotgun blasted by the guy that was camping behind the door. Not to mention that shotguns in this game have the range of a sniper. The game is slow paced glitchy camper infested and crashes after every other match.A lot of times my character freezes during a battle or I get stuck on switching weapons. If you happen to be in a match where all of the above don't take place then maybe you'll get some fun out of it. In general it is the most horrible unoptimised thing I have ever experienced.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,323,False,Not Recommended,Another game with Devs that say they will deliver on promise but fail to do so in spectacular fashion. Launced into 1.0 PC Launch and honestly this game doesn't feel any ing different in fact it feels worse. Optimization is still flat out garbage with horrible frame drops everywhere and some of the worst stuttering and lag in a game. In a game where it's one and done it's pretty pathetic to see no improvements found on the optimization side. Devs said the new map would be focused on close quarter combat and faster gameplay. What do the devs do in response? They make a new map that's even bigger then the first map (wtf?). This is my main issue with PUBG is that is just beyond ing boring anymore. You land hot and the game lags/stutters like crazy so you die so quick or you land safe gear up for 30 40mins only to die within the first engagement you see. I used to enjoy this game a lot but now it's just pathetic and nothing has been done to improve the game besides vaulting (which should have been in the game). I want to see things change and for the better after playing this game so much but instead we are just getting a mediocre game with some of the most boring and continous downtime I've seen in any game ever.If you're in need of sleep and don't have any Nyquil throw on some PUBG because this is the perfect sleeper agent. this game and these garbage devs with all these t lies and committments that are just following in the footsteps of how not to be a developer ala H1Z1.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For the people that not cares about levels or flashy borders etc you can tryhard to get that Top ""x"" per region or you could play more chill games with friends and have really enjoyable times playing.

2018-03-22,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,I honestly played a limited amount of this game before requesting a refund the third game I have ever done so with. The servers lag and cause inconsistencies Damage seemed to be far from consitent gunplay is clunky and often makes absolutely no sense A shotgun point blank to the head won't kill sometimes but will decimate others. That being said the game wasn't terribly non fun it just wore on me quickly the little pleasure of winning a gunfight suddenly would be eclipsed by the end of match death where the kill cam shows almost a dozen rounds of which you heard or saw none and it shows a location you had left a full three minutes before. All in all A potentially fun game that is held back by terrible servers bad gunplay and an overall rather boring frustrating experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I picked up this game because it was on sale despite all of the negative reviews. I thought hell they may just have a poor system or a crappy connection. Well I have neither of those things and I get the same issues they were talking aboutMy connection speed is 25MB/s I dont have lag spikes on any other game of which are many and they are mostly pretty demanding. Yet on PUBG if I'm within 40ft of another player and I'm not standing perfectly still my framerate drops to unplayable. I dont really get the issue otherwise just around other players...of course the worst possible time to be having those issues.

2017-09-14,0,0,875,True,Recommended,So honestly guys this game is amazing. The devs are putting a lot of work into it and it just keeps getting better and better. All the negative reviews are from stream snipers. Regardless of whose side you take on this (streamers or stream snipers) the official rules of the game state that stream sniping is cheating so I'm not really sure what the counter argument could possibly be for this? That would be like if the rules of Monopoly state that you can't just take your opponents money you do it anyway and then get really mad when they don't want to play Monopoly with you anymore.I have just shy of 300 hours in it and I love it. The game is hard heavily skill and position based. It also takes a little bit of luck. Buy this game if you haven't already (though you probably already have).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is one of those games that feels like absolute trash but you put up with because it has some really good moments. There's a lot of downtime where you're just walking or looting but each time you win a match it's such an exhillirating feel. Overall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone in its current state unless you've got a group of friends to play with because it's just way too rough around the edges and the developers have been making some terrible decisions lately with the player bans and policy changes.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-08,0,0,275,True,Not Recommended,This game was pretty glitchy with the flashbang crashes and aweful server lag when it first came out and they have done a great job fixing all of that. Recently though with their severe cutting down on the availability of loot the game is For my last 11 games I drop down somewhere with other people and I can search a whole floor at the military base and not find anything better than a crowbar so of course I get instantly killed by someone else that already found a gun. I am pretty decent at this game and have won many times but when they are lowering my chances of getting any kind of gun within the first two minutes it just ruins the game and turns it into another RNG horror fest. Yeah I get reducing the number of ARs while also increasing the number of Uzi's and pistols but shrinking the entire loot pool is a horrible mistake at this part.

NA servers mean Asia South Amarica Europe in an avrage game out of 100 u will have 50 NA player and the rest are De syncing so much that walls arent a thing. I got killed by an Asian then he got killed by a South Amarican and then he got killed by a European this all happened over my dead body while they are screaming in 3 diffrent languages. If they dont ping lock server and come out with update that ACTUALLY matter (NOT ING EMOTES) Then this game could be back as one of the best games but it lost that title a long long time ago.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Pros It gets your heart pumping dynamic game play with many different strategies diverse environments and weapons large vocal community good development team etc.Cons some interactions between surfaces and bullets make close quarters/ urban combat clunky and frustrating vehicles have a tendancy to flip or hit non existant/logical barriers causing you damage lack of 1st person only mode weapons in crates need fixed etc. I would pick it up expecially if you have buddies that play shooter games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,201,True,Recommended,You know there's a lot of games that get a lot of hype. Some of those games really just don't live up to expectations and others well others go above and beyond. PUBG is definitely a game that soars above expectations and really delivers an amazing multiplayer experience. PUBG really puts a new twist on shooter combat and creates an intense drive for players to survive down to the last man. And yes before you ask there are single duo and 4 player ques available. PUBG doesn't force you to play with random strangers if you don't WANT to play with random strangers they even let you choose to only hear your squad's voicechat if you so wish! There's also a ranking system but instead of making the game more stressful it only drives the player to succeed. You can approach the game with stealthy slow tactics or just run in willy nilly and try to take all the enemies down with you. This game offers a genuinely enjoyable multiplayer experience whether you enjoy tactics or chaos playing on your own or working on a team FPS combat or third person shooter combat playing casually or hardcore. Anyone who knows me well knows that I don't say this often but this game is totally worth paying full price for.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-13,0,0,368,True,Recommended,Absolutely THE BEST Battle Royale game that I've played and I've played most of them H1Z1 Culling etc.OVERALL 9.5/10DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.PROS + Graphics are phenomenal. The sunrays the lighting its all just perfect. The depth of field and the blur is enough to make it tastefuly instsead of nauseating. (NOTE Shadows can be a bit dark game needs a flashlight)+ The animations are SMOOTH as Can get a bit wonky sometimes but for the majority its easy to move in and out of houses pretty quickly.+ The sound is fantastic. The gun shot sounds are to die for (heh.. heh) like the way you shoot into a quiet area and you can hear your shot ringing out and echoing around you. Since there's no real in game music the silence can be quite intense sometimes. Especially when you hear footsteps in the building you're in.+ YOUR GUNS HAVE COLLISION. This is a bit of both a good and bad thing. When you face a wall you won't be able to pull your gun up to aim. But if you're in a position where there's a lot of physical objects/map assets in front of you you'll start to spazz out until you aim down or don't.+ Vehicles. There's 4 vehicles to choose from Buggy UAZ Motorcycle Car and they all drive pretty well for the most part. The vehicle physics can be real fun when you get the hang of it.CONS The hit detection is a bit Shot someone at least 5 or 6 times with a SCAR L and they lived enough to kill me. Some weapons are a little TOO inaccurate such as the SCAR L with an 8x on it and the AWM seems to be a bit off too though I may need to just adjust the sights. Getting run over by your own vehicle due to lag. Sometimes when bailing from a car the game will lag and I'll somehow end up underneath it and get killed. Has happened to me at least 3 times now. Have to restart the game every 4 or so games because after a while the performance begins to degrade. Still has a lot of optimization issues which has resulted in my ultimate death on much more than 1 occassion.OVERALL 9.5/10DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,174,True,Recommended,Game is pretty fun when it all works. I watch streamers play it pretty often and a lot of times they get killed they write the name down to get the guy who killed them banned because they assume it's stream sniping like 40% of the time. Sometimes you'll be fighting someone so you go behind cover and die behind cover because of desynch (in their game you weren't behind cover so they were able to shoot you even though in your game you appeared to already be behind cover) and that's stupid. I've walked into a bathroom saw a guy with a shotgun sitting in a corner got shot once backed out into the first room I was in and died from a second blast from the shotgun guy in a completely different room. But I guess it being in Early Access is their excuse for any bugs.I mean look at The Culling. It's had an alright following went in decline and then threw it's fan base out the window all while in Early Access which they're still in a year and a half later. It's an okay excuse for bugs I guess but it can't save you from being labeled a bad game.That being said PubG is fun and it appears that the devs are listening to the fan base in a much more productive way than the Culling devs which is great. And I assume desynch will always be somewhat of an issue with 100 player matches. All in all I guess I'd say buy it because it's fun but don't expect the best game ever.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-02,0,0,523,False,Not Recommended,Review based on current build as of 21/12/17.Now then What to say about this game. I think it has gained an insane amount of popularity which is hard to deny. I think that it has spent far too little time being worked on in 'Early Access'. The popularity burst has caused the Devs to implusivly update the game to a full release. I don't think this should've been done as there are a lot of tiny details and large details that have been ignored and instead main aspects of the game have been adressed and simplified for a console release I feel. One main example of the little things being ignored is in a sense a big thing but the servers being the backbone of the game and what we all use to play it with or without friends. Considering that factor I feel they have cheaped out on servers massivly. From someone that has worked for some of the biggest server companies in the UK I can say with confidence the hardware on their servers is lacking. I understand they're running 100 people per session and multiple sessions on one server. But bare in mind this company made hundreds of millions in their first few weeks of release. So where has that money gone? Not the servers. So far out of the new update I have played 5 games. 4/5 of those games I played I died to lag. Lag being an instance where I have been unable to move because I keep getting rubber banded backwards and other players are for some reason uneffected and by the time I am able to pickup and reload a gun I am already dead. They did try to address this issue by adding a ping cap. But that ping cap was only set to 200 really meaning little to no difference. Considering from the UK I can get a ping of under 200 playing on West coast US servers. So utterly useless. I think they have underestimated what their servers can handle. Because they keep adding features to the game and making things work smoother for clients but ultimatly not allowing the servers hardware room for these increased amount of features. I still stand by my previous review. I also stand by a none recommendation of this game. That is after 300+ hours of gameplay. I do admit I am not the best player in the world. But I am certainly not the worst. So there it is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-02,0,0,177,True,Recommended,The game is amazing in that way that you feel like you're playing a really great mod for a game that was ideal for it. Things are a little broken graphics are a bit routine and gameplay is certainly rote at this point but it doesn't matter because it works for what the game is.If you haven't played or read about it (which would bring me to wonder how you got here) this is a custom designed version of the Battle Royale/Hunger Games mods for other games. 99 people drop onto a map and find weapons/armour and last person standing wins. The map shrinks with magic blue fairy dust slowly killing anyout outside the designated area and there are random bombing areas to liven things up.I'm recommending this because I think it's a great game for just about anyone. Matches aren't too long so if you're an adult with responsibility you can play a quick round and set it aside and if you're a kid without anything you need to do there is plenty of room to replay and master the game. With the various rules and systems there's a bit of luck involved. In spite of having played only a handful of these military tactic convoluted control type shooters I was able to come in 3rd in onebof my first matches. I was lucky and happened tobplop into the right place and laid on the ground until somebody found me. I think that's great because it gives anyone a chance...othwrs may hate that their supreme talent loses to a lucky drop.Finally this is in early access so I'm hoping they adjust but when I created my character originally there was just a whole lotta white skin to choose from. There are arguments to be made for the ability to blend in with surroundings being a concern with this but for a game which offers clothing options in loot boxes...I think the ability for everyone to create an avatar which represents themselves could be added.That said it's an amazing game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is a jem. Amazing gameplay and the guns feel nice to use. The game can use some optamazation but other then that it is a amazing game. It will give you a adernalin rush that H1Z1 cant give you. I made a post on a comment comparing the two games so i dont wanna re type all of that so here is the basics of what i said.H1Z1*fun sometimes *better optamazation *Unblanced guns *You have to grind your life away to get anything for your character.*Overuse of the shotgun since it can mostly one hit from any length. *the overuse of players useing head shots. (no really its insane. With a hand gun from across a open field? come on.)*no use of tactics at all its just run and gun*the Devs do not give a about the game.*slowly dying player base. Battlegrounds*Blanced guns *better gameply *Gunshots matter (meaning if the gunshot is close someone is near if its soft and far away people are far away. Same thing when rounds hot the ground next to you.)*muzzle flash matters (players can see it if they take they time and look for a shooter.) *you dont have to grind you life away to get stuff for you charater. *Yes there is not the best optamazation at the moment. The Devs are Activily fixing this. *A litter higher learning curve then H1Z1. It makes it a litter harder at first.*You can add atachments to your gun in game. *map is good easy to learn.*to win it really helps to use tactics. *the Devs are still working on the game and seem to love the game.

I also know this is a pre release game and I shouldn't expect much optimization but I have to say this was a far less than stellar experience. I started the game with high detail it immediately loaded &gt 4 gigs of data into my ram and used all the disk space (I'm assuming this was just VRAM). I then settled for Low as Medium detail gave me horrible input lag. Finally I got into a game found a gun and pressed tab to open a menu. The game then crashed and I was informed I needed to install .NET 3.0 runtime. For the life of me I don't understand 1. Why .NET runtime is necessary to run a video game and 2. why these necessary files weren't Included on installation. I was really looking forward to this game but this turned me off for good. that noise.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Because of the laggy servers combat early in the game is extremely laggy and it is completely random if you will win the fight because of lag. Some players will shoot you through walls because you are outside the house on their screen.Don't fall for the early access bait and don't buy the game it will save you a lot of time and rage.EDIT Game has updated but nothing was changed.

2017-09-03,0,0,324,True,Recommended,It's a really fun game taht you can spend hours on end playing especially with friends. Running around trying to get to the border can be boring but once you're in a fight it gets really fun. Sometimes I don't even bother fighting I just grab a motorcycle and screw around. But this game does have problems. First of all the vehicle physics are crazy and unpredictable especially motorcycles (you can do a flip and crush your head and take no damage but hit a pebble and die). Another problem is if you are doing good and get to the top 15 ish you'll just get die from somebody who found a sniper rifle and got to the zone way before anyone knew where it was gonna end which makes the game kinda unfun. It didn't used to be like that and I did fairly well back then but now I havn't won in a long time. If sniper rifles were way more rare and not lasers then it might be a bit more balanced. My final problem with the game is that its damn near impossible to figure out where you're getting shot from unless they're out in the open and 1 You have a 7.1 surround sound headset (which thankfully I do) 2 There's no other noise at all 3 They keep shooting without moving and 4 They're close enough so that you can see them without a 8x scope which are extremely rare. But all in all it's a quite fun game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It has that tactical and survival part from ARMA then spiced a little up with some stuff from games like H1Z1. ARMA II is by far one of my favourite games to date so being able to play a game like PUBG that has some of the same aspects as ARMA is amazing.I can nothing but recommed this game but then again at this point I think we all have it(I even own 2 copies) of course the game has it's flaws like any game does.The thrill and the overall experience of being top 10 makes this game so unique feeling your heart pumping faster and faster as people get picked of one by one is one of the greatest feelings in the world and then the storm calms down when you finally get that sweet marinated chicken dinner.Me and many of my friends cannot wait to see what devs and future modders have in store for us I'm mostly hoping for an survival mode or do i dare say an DayZ like mode o Just buy it already. mDriveUnit,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The controls are a little bit different from your basic shooters but after a few games i pretty much got it down. The load times are fast and i didnt expierence much lag. The clothing and cosmetics were a bit basic but they are probably going to add more items.

For a company worth approximately 4 billion I would expect you to focus on optimization physics (vehicles and weapons) and server support instead of a new gun with a different skin paid loot crates and banning these ""apparent stream snipers"".Things that need to be fixed Optimization. I guess that is what we get when the assests are similar to those that are available for free on Unreal Engine and Unity. Bugs/glitches/rendering Tons of problems with building rendering/other assests. Fix these first instead of pushing for more unoptimized content Servers low tick rate and dsync problems. You can shoot someone standing still 6 7 times with the m16 see blood each hit and they turn around and 1 shot you. Hackers There has been a huge increase lately. I have seen people running as fast as a vehicle killing people while they go. Solution HARDWARE BAN THEM and take legal action against those who make the cheat client. Look at how Gears of War 4 encrypts their files so they cannot be accessed. You don't hear about people cheating in that game.

Simple bugs like just starting your game in the lobby aren't ever fixed 3rd person aim is honestly useless and parashuting mechanic is abominal. Maybe this game will get better over time but honestly I dont think it will any time soon. Company that took it on are very small and likely have much experience with this sort of stuff.

2017-07-27,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,PUBG is special in how thorough and well developed the gameplay is. But technologically it does not hold up. Poorly optimized and becomes stale after a few rounds. I run graphically intensive games such as Witcher 3 at 60 fps yet get extreme stutter and fps dips below 30 with PUBG. It was awful. Even on medium graphics the stutter and delay makes the game frustrating and unresponsive. Also after four rounds I started realizing how limited the game experience is with only one map. The map is large but on it's own offers little diversity and becomes familiar fast. Can't recommend this at all but will keep an eye out for future updates and optimization.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-01,0,0,43,True,Recommended,The game is very good and fun to play with friends. It has a very good anticheat and the map is big and fun to explore. The servers are very good. I play on EU server. It is fast and easy to play with friends when you invite theam they join the lobby instantly. There are some bugs It is not big bugs its a big map and it will always be some bugs there. I think this game has a good future becuse it is the most played game on steam right now. The reason it is so many negativ recently i think is becuse in the game is so big so many players who get banned for cheating for example get very angry becuse the anti cheat is very good in this game. In this game you are about 100 player that jump from an airplane. On the airplane you can jump when you want and plan where you want to land with your parachute. When you have landed you want to find fast guns and other items so you can kill many players or win the game.

2018-04-30,0,0,440,False,Not Recommended,"Seriously? These devs will complain about Fortnite for ""copying them"" like some passive aggressive schoolgirls (read their last update its hilariously childish) but can't seem to do their job of optimising a game to where it's playable. It's honestly the most ridiculous and immature thing I've seen yet. The very least professional developer I have ever witnessed. I honestly think PUBG is the psycho ex gf that can't get over Fortnite even though Fortnite has clearly moved on so PUBG texts all of their friends about some gossip no one cares about and blames them for everything wrong with world. If you can't handle competition don't be a producer in the market. I mean did you really think that you would have a monopoly on the TYPE of game? There's a movie called Hunger Games btw its VERY similar to this if you really think your supposed feud with Fortnite wasn't enough. Get over the fact that Fortnite made huge strides to make themselves different and more popular (because their game is somewhat playable compared to PUBG) and look at how you're copying CSGO with the weapons and equiptment skin system instead of making a game that YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN NO LONGER PLAY BECAUSE THE SERVERS ARE SUCH TRASH!!!In fact it even took months of updates just to get rid of SOME of the hackers. It's like they dont read their reviews and take their jobs seriously because the community is trying to tell them what's wrong. But clearly throwing a hissy fit towards Fortnite/any competition (funny becaused they loved everyone else's ideas to use for themselves) is too important to these soap opera actresses.

2017-10-22,0,0,62,True,Not Recommended,Here's the thing about this game it's a great game idea in it's current form even if the whole battle royale mode isn't. That's it though it's just the same battle royale over and over and over and over with nothing but some stats to show for all the time you put into it. Cosmetic clothes that don't do anything for you as you must find all your gear on the map. Now with friends it can be an enjoyable experience but only if you don't get picked off early and have to spend the next 20 mins being your teams eyes in the back of their heads. Solo I do not find at all enjoyable. There is nobody to get you back up. I know I suck compared to most people that only play PVP shooters but when solo and I'm waiting in ambush behind a chair in a room and somebody else can run into my room and headshot before I can even get a shot off is total ttery! The game is fun for it's idea but with only 1 map (another being added soon) or even with the upcoming 2 maps it's still the same over and over with no tangible rewards to speak of. Added with the horrendous performance this game runs at given my system specs It's just not the game for me. Some people like games where you're constantly spinning around twitching the out I just don't. There are other games out there I can get more enjoyment from that just reward me better. My opinion is to stay away for now. If you are a masochist you're gonna do it anyway because it's all you hear these days.

But the thousands of bugs and glitches make it even more frustrating I can't even begin to list the number of times I was flabbergasted by how bugged the game was. And do you think the developers are trying to fix the bugs and improve the game ?? Well you're 100% wrong they'd rather spend their time finding a new way to ruin the game add some fog on the map so everyone is lagging even more and can't see a damn thing... This is truly a pathetic way to launch a game try and improve the beta and release the game for real before ruining it with this kind of update.The worst part is that it is actually quite addictive so you'll end up playing a lot even though you hate it.The real question is ""why was this beta released for 30 euros rather than be free and help the developers improve the game before it could actually be released without looking like a scam ???""PLEASE don't buy it even if your friends pressure you into doing it !!

BTW FOR RECORD I WAS AT 1 FPS PER SEC AFTER TWEAKING MAYBE 30 FPS. not recommended.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you would ask me if game is great? normaly i would say YEAH I DO RECOMMEND IT but with that KILL GAME BUG i shouldn't pay a full price for a gime which is BROKEN and DEV's are TOO LAZY to even fix it! Edit With a new update game been even more unplayable as the server lag is terrible I'm forced to drop playing till PUBG Corp. gonna fix the problem...#edit2 new update at 11/10/2017 makes game TOTALLY unplayable... delete it ask for reimbr. as this game is just a trash...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-21,0,0,1537,False,Recommended,Okay after 700+ HRS of gameplay here's my take on the game.It's fun. Really fun. If you got 30 dollars and some decent knowledge of FPS gunplay go ahead and do yourself a favor and buy this game.This game has given me so many moments of pure joy adrenaline anger commitment excitement basically everything. I don't think I've ever gotten bored and the new content in every update every couple of weeks to a month make it really exciting. With the new 4x4 map that I have tried coming up I only see prosperity in PUBG's future. You can see the devs actively interact with the community at r/pubattlegrounds and they listen to us. They fix almost everything the community complains about.The gunplay is amazing with so many modifications to weapons I haven't even tried every combination for every gun which could be a good/bad thing on how you place it. With a confirmed shooting practice range on the way players will have an even chance to practice and get better.Holy crap does this game get fun. I've met many friends from all around the world who play this game. They can also testify the greatness of this game.If you've got the money buy it. If you don't save up. If money is a big issue for you in a couple of months you can get your cash back from selling the free crates you earn for playing games. I myself have profitted 200 dollars from opening them by pure luck. Won't garuntee the same for you.Try it. You won't regret it. It's really fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-29,0,0,132,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I played this game while on early access. I had fun and most of you also had. This review is about PUBG a battle royale game in a abandoned island and many loot which you gather when you drop down but after that you're against 99 other people fighting for your life. Pubg is a really good game. many updates and options to play. skins were also added a while back. Skins in pubg is really good and depends on your luck and money. When you get a good skins pricing above the price of pubg you got a profit and thats what i really appreciate on this game. Also no transcation on this game on BP so its good. You get Bp when you play the game. Each week you get a random crate that you can purchase. and if you get a good item thats rewarding. The Future is bright for PUBG but it depends on us gamers. Many more battle royale gamers are on store. like fortnite and many more. I hope pubg can still survive,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-10,0,0,91,True,Recommended,I Highly Reccommend this game. Though very time consuming and addicting its still a great buy. Im very satified with the game and the graphics considering its Early Access and large scale. It stead of me making a huge story I'll list the Pros and Cons.PROs Extremely easy to learn and play Firing and Health fetures are extremely accurate (Unlike many games based on this) Large scale map warfare Theres a gun in almost every house with loads of ammo (Unlike DayZ and H1Z1) Sound is very clear and accurate You can hear gun shots across the map (Im using Bose QuietComfort 35s) Vehicles Invite your friends to play squads of 1 2 and 4 Camping is too easy Roadside sheds make perfect top 10 hiding spots until the map swallows you of course There aren't no BS kills or deaths its LEGIT Using a Nvida 1080 theres no issues with lag quality or visiblityCONs Driving is buggy and 3rd person camera is too close (Feels like COD made vehicles or a worse Battlefield) Divers are impossible to shoot (20% is my aim) Your first five games you get a jump scare from the campers and snipers Such try hards griding pc... buy it on xboxRemember Its standard that the community is terrible on these massive multiple player games so you wont find anyone that will spare you.

2017-09-24,0,0,87,True,Not Recommended,"I've been a large fan of the Battle Royale genre in all sorts of mediums including games shows films books etc. and upon first hearing about this game I was quite excited but it seems this is not ""the one"" we're looking for in the Battle Royale genre.Gameplay wise I find this too fast paced and too short. Games usually last 30 minutes and the circles constantly closing in speed it up moreso and ruin some of the fun for me. It feels like a nomal free for all with extra mechanics thrown in not really a battle royale. I'd expect them to last at least an hour or multiple for a really epic fun game. Playing by yourself is completely boring too it's only fun if you're playing in a squad with friends. If there's going to be solo play make sure it's fun if it isn't just don't add it. Outside of the gameplay this is doing everything wrong. There's microtransactions people getting banned for nonsense the release of the game has already been delayed (Early access survial game's release getting delayed? Haven't we heard this before?) updates are coming slower and the situation is evolving. PUBG thinks too highly of itself. It's just another temporarily popular EA survival game not something special. Another studio is going to eventually come and make a polished battle royale game possibly some AAA companies and no one will remember this.3/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-26,0,0,986,True,Not Recommended,This game is SO clunky. There is no consistency with how it runs. You cant even mimimize it most of the time The client is trash. You can't reconnct to a game WHEN it crashes all too often. The servers are very far from being optimized and they were promised to be several months ago. Their servers struggle to populate items the first time you run through and there is so much server desync. The idea of the game is awesome and it is fun but i dont know if its worth the BS you have to wade through to play. They are making more money than all other games on steam (maybe more than any other game) right now and they still cant polish a game or deliver to their promises. I cant wait for someone else to create a much smoother and user friendly game like this so we can actually play it rather than deal with it. For the moment it looks like there will not be a polished release for a really long time with the rate they have been making updates. I dont reccomend getting this game unless you are a very patient person.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
