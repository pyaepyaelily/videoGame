With all the cool mechanics inherited from the previous versions, and also a much more developed operating system, this game should have been one of my favorite real time strategy games. However, when I came down to the real playing part, I always found it(the vanilla) disappointed me a lot. The campaign is nonsense, all of 6 different campaign sections, without any story line or lore, share the same mission design, making the single player part vague and boring. Then I turned to LAN, I honestly didn't have a hard time fighting with actual players, but I just never find it funny to win without any modes or addons. However hard I manage to beat them, I just feel like the process always being a pain in the butt. 

That's everything about my own experience about the base game so far. My suggestion is NOT to touch vanilla anyway. If you want to, don't even buy any of their DLCs. The Workshop will have all the fun you need. They have missions for single & coop, and also tons of fantastic mods for PVP and mission packs.

The greatest top-down-view, direct control, WW2 rts strategy game-play style ever made. 

The current version is not-playable / not enjoyable for me since Patch 7 September 2014. 
The sound engine was really f fuck ed-up ! by the Gem engine developers, DMS indie game developers or by the sound engine maker Miles. 

They ruined basic stereo in a game for 1st time ever in the series since Faces of War. 
Stereo separation sounds like it is set too wide for starters. 
You have to put the game onto 5.1 to get close to correct stereo image with headphones & they added a stupid distance sound filter that muffles the sounds artificially which sounds s hit !

But lucky I was able keep playing a patch 6 version with superior stereo because it would have been un-playable as it is today, 4 years later.  

I have a quality gaming desktop computer, high quality headphones & 
appreciation of sounds & graphics. 

I have been playing this series since Faces of War.
Faces of War demo won the play prize over that stupid Company of Heroes arcadish junk.
Next came Men of War, MoW Assault Squad then MoW Assault Squad 2.

For Men of War Assault Squad 3 they could upgrade it to 64 bit, fix the sound engine to correct stereo, fix those stupid skinny soldier models since one of the last patches, improve all the old tank & unit models & environments textures & graphics & sounds to current high digital standards. 

This game could be made perfect. 

I only play single player. This is the only game I play & enjoy. 
I still play the same battles that come with the game. They never play-out exactly the same, + there are many extra mission mods in the Workshop.

Cons:
- Boring campaiqn 
- Same mission format/types for each nation
- Same old textures and models from the previous games 
- A bit overpriced nowadays
- Units actions feel delayed at times or clunky  

Pros: 
+ Ability to play with mods: Makes the game worth playing years later  
+ Much more fun with friends
+ Community is still there and in well shape 
+ Your not limited to how many units you can put in one battle 
+ Can run a potato 
+ There is an editor

Rather, you can either play a campaign mission or spend hours trying to learn the editor and create a custom battle. Almost every RTS that i can think of has custom battles against bots in the base game, and i find it disgusting that the developers think it's ok to nickel and dime you ten dollars for the airborne DLC which includes them.

 You can get so addicted by the gem editor in this game and thats why i recomend this game i think the base game is ok but the gem editor is why to buy it i would say. The modders make it even funnier with for example star wars mods and american civil war mods which you can use in the gem editor so you could make huge star wars battles or civil war battles.

 The diversity is awesome in this game there is  5 factions and that is the Germans, Japanese, Americans , Russians and Commonwealth, Each and every faction together  has more then 200 different soldiers and as you could see in  the trailer more then 250 different vehicles.  You may think this game has outdated graphics but its still very epic to see and very detailed and if it would look better i think that would lagg more if you have 100s of soldiers and tanks fighting eachother so thats good.

50,73266150,english,"[i]Men of War: Assault Squad 2[/i] takes the amazing micro-intensive RTS gameplay of the original [i]Men of War[/i] into multiplayer. In this game you also micromanage every single unit and have to deal with realistic logistical problems on a tactical level. However, instead of a dumb AI, you are against a human opponent who must do the same. No other multiplayer RTS has infantry and vehicle combat like this. 

Just like in the original game you control every individual soldier's equipment and actions. With good micro you can use a single soldier to wipe out whole squads or even multiple destroy tanks. Surprise attacks are insanely deadly as soldiers have realistic HP and most tanks can be destroyed with a single anti-tank grenade.

You also control every vehicle and must deal with their historical limitations. Vehicle crews must be protected, fuel supplies must be maintained, and each part of the tank must be repaired when damaged. The game's point system and large maps encourage the use of light vehicles and medium vehicles instead of just a stream of heavy tanks. No other game highlights the  historical strengths of these lighter vehicles like this game. However, the game's realism makes infantry with the right positioning and equipment a hard counter to vehicles. 

The game is not entirely historically accurate. Vehicles that never went past being blueprints exist in the game and the game does not use unit cost or modifiers to represent the historical productivity or quality of the troops of the respective countries. The game bends reality to create a balanced experience. This can be fixed easily, because the game supports mods and has many of them. 

The first [i]Men of War: Assault Squad[/i] no longer supports multiplayer and does not have a good single player experience. The single player does not have a story and most missions are the same 5 missions but reskinned for each of the factions. You should not buy the first version of the game because this game is basically the same game, but with functional multiplayer.

WHY THOUGH? then the part that final made me say""FUCK THIS! i need to quit this game"" is i cant tell you how many times i've KNOWN i clicked on LOAD just to have it overwrite me into a shit position.... so now i ethor have to deal with the 2 tan ks i DID manage to take being MAGIKED off the board or io have to go through the meat grinder again.... and thats not even including how many times you FORCE THE SHOEHORNING of stealtth missions that have NO PLACE in this game, yes you can skip them but thats not the point, you shouldn't be FORCING this game to do things its not meant to, like when you FORCED me into driving a tank that was SUPPOSED to be a HEAVY tank that acted like it had the armor of a stewart, and THAT'S not including the fact you REFUSED to put a first person view in the tankso i can BARELY aim the fucking thing for shit...",1594962946,1594962946,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False,76561198269150376,16,2,6378,0,6210,1597433615,,

I got this because it looked like it would really capture the essence of world war II, and in a way it does, but unlike the shooters, this game just requires way too much strategy (ironic, because this IS a strategy game). Yes that's the point of the game, but you really have to have a serious in-depth knowledge of world war II to accomplish your tasks, beyond just knowing that the Soviets liked to suicide rush en masse, the Japanese LITERALLY suicide rushed, and the Germans just had superior tech. You need to know how to counter specific armaments in the battlefield in real-time. I went on the Workshop for this and got cheats to allow me to hopefully just enjoy the game by rushing in large amounts of troops at once, however, in some situations, the AI will counter you perfectly. This is good for someone who is hardcore, but for me, I didn't want a super hardcore experience and to instead just blast some people as whatever faction using the cool troops and tanks and stuff. Instead, I was spamming so many units into the field, with the AI also spamming so many units, that all the dead tanks and troops on the field would tank my frames per second (FPS).

Los graficos realmente no avanzan tanto si los comparas a 2008, aunque no es su punto fuerte, la jugabilidad mejora cada entrega, tenes muchos accesos directos que hacen que fluya muy bien cuando guias tropas, pero creo que opinando por varios, una historia haria que el apartado offline se luzca mucho mas, no hablo de nada muy elaborado, pero si que nos incite a queres jugar primero el modo historia completo y no saltar directamente al multijugador.

77,72332358,english,"This game is a peculiar sense of fun.
Most games you boot up and expect to be assured any amount of fun or satisfaction. This game however, this game is different. No, you don't boot this game up and expect fun, you boot this game up and gamble on fun but not only that, because your sanity is also part of that deal, oh yes, you're always doubling down on this game. Here is a rough transcript of a game going downhill:
""Alright boys, I'm gonna side armor his SU-100 with my Veteran Tiger, get a sniper to spot infy for me...""
""...my Veteran Tiger's tracked but I got the SU-100, put some infy on me while I repair...""
""...hey... do you guys hear that?""
""OH MOTHER OF PEARL THEY HAVE A SUPER PERSHING DITCH THE TIGER, DITCH THE TIGER!""
And then subsequent to your foe's purchase of an outstanding counter-buy and your teammates' reliance on your expensive buy, your economy is crippled for the rest of the game and you resort to infantry buys that stand no match to your opponent's stronger economy and supply of mechanized ordnance.
When these things happen, you feel absolutely hopeless, to lose important units and realize what position you've put yourself in provides a near harrowing feeling.
But on the other hand, when this game goes well, it goes damn well. When you side armor that Super Pershing that was giving you such a hard time with your Panzer 4H, and you're the one to send your opponent's economy into hell letting you walk away the victor... believe me, there is no better feeling. You can be down 0-99 and turn a game around, there is always room for a comeback and plenty of it. And while you may feel clueless when you start playing, there is noticeable improvement day by day if not hour by hour when playing this game. You learn to buy and move troops around fast and safely, deploy sandbags, direct control infantry and vehicles, swap weapons, know when and why you use what kinds of ammunition and utility, navigate unit inventories, cook grenades, pickup items, etc. It sounds tough but is picked up easily and improved upon quickly.

So back to what I was saying about this game being a peculiar sense of fun. When this game goes bad, and you lose 3 matches in the same night and you feel like you're the damn worst at the game of all of the people who have ever purchased it, no game is worse than this one. But when this game goes good, and you win all 3 matches you played that night, not only that but you absolutely WIPED THE FLOOR with the fellows you played against... oh lord, it doesn't get better. No amount of illicit substances nor illegal services can ever liken itself to the level of serotonin released when you have a good time in this game. It should be a talking point in quantum mechanics for it is both the best and worst game in my entire steam library.

So, in conclusion, if you have the money and this game is on a fair sale, I recommend buying the War Chest edition, but don't stress the wallet if need not be. The replays DLC helps greatly if you ever want to work on improving your gameplay or play-style or in my case, admire the moment I sent a Super Pershing to kingdom come out of pride.",1594255597,1594255597,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False,76561198123445165,114,29,6969,28,3832,1601268230,,

84,72294430,english,"Extremely irritating mechanics and absolutely bizarre default hotkeys, map control, etc. I hate it when games do this.

The absolute worst part of this game is that there is LITERALLY NO OPTION TO ATTACK MOVE your support weapons. Want your mortars to fire at enemies at their maximum range, then keep up supporting their team instead of just sitting there...? Too bad. You literally CAN NOT. Period.

You will instead have to manually set up, unset, move, and then manually attack ground or the enemy unit. Then repeat for all your other support weapons on all the enemies you want to attack. Oh yeah and there's no freaking control groups, AND you can't move units on the absolutely useless minimap. Seriously? It's like playing a 90s RTS title waving my mouse around to control units manually. Frustrating and annoying to play. I was very disappointed and I don't want that frustration of not having control over my own units. 

The minimap is extremely bizarre. There's no reason to make the right click the option to see the part on the map. That should be for ... MOVING YOUR UNITS?..... Duh...?

Bizarre mechanics and obvious oversights by developers in basic unit control makes this game unplayable and the battles just look stupid and zany without constant micro attention. Like some of your guys suddenly forget there's a battle going on because they don't move a few inches to help their dying bunkmates.

Maybe when Men of War 4 comes out they'll figure out how control groups and attack move is supposed to work in other RTS titles. No unit control.

In fact, it's extremely ironic how UNREALISTIC certain parts of this game are. Downright wonky seeing your mortar team just sit there and let his bunkmates he just had breakfast with just die in front of him.... because he CANT move like 3 feet in front of him to support his guys. You can't order him to do that. You have to unpack manually and do it yourself.

Now if that happened in real life he would get court martialed or something. It's hard to feel the immersion of the game when your soldiers are fucking dumb as hell. Dumb as rocks, because the developers failed to put in a few standard control mechanics and details expected of every RTS title. Like being able to create control groups for your units, and moving units on the minimap.

When your troops run up to the enemy to gun them down, they must come to a COMPLETE STOP like there's a cop waiting to write them a ticket somewhere, and then let their friends die before they decide to take cover somewhere you didn't specify, then shoot. Because their arms are paralyzed while walking or running with full auto weapons, which are specifically designed to be used that way. Your MG team will suicide walk to the enemy if you attack move them, not set up and attack.

I mean... this game can really beat COH2. I wish. But it's more zany than realistic combat if you ask me in its current state. It doesn't do enough respect to the men who actually served. Idiot bot troops who just stand there while their buddies die, or suicide walk unless you specifically tell them where to set up. At least they take cover which is realistic like CoH2. But there's not enough realistic detail or control over your units. You are commanding human beings who can get scared, need ammo, weather protection, food, etc, not bot troops. The closer these guys come to achieving that level of realism the better. I'm just so disappointed in how badly this game plays.

CoH2 is better until this is fixed in their next game, but honestly I'm waiting for something to finally dethrone them. Maybe MoW3 can?????? Hopefully. Please fix.",1594211818,1594218116,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False,76561198388532195,30,6,67,0,67,1594211216,,

Men of War AS2 is one of the best RTS games in the WW period I've ever played to date, even now.
While it has small problems, it's some of the best tactical and strategic gameplay in this setting.

It still looks amazing, plays very well and I appreciate having cooperative options for my friends who are not inclined to play pvp...

it's closest competitor is Company of Heroes last I remember and that's like comparing checkers to chess, both complex but the other offering far more variety.

Assault Squad 2 does have one weakness, a big one...
You require the Origins DLC in order to have a decent campaign because the devs were honestly lazy as hell and didn't bother making an interesting one; The vanilla AS2 campaigns are rubbish and excessively repetitive and tedious.
Also, because Origins remakes the original MoW campaigns, the missions can be more difficult at times when it comes to stealth and sneaking due to the infantry having greater awareness and sight.",1594158885,1594158885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198129202356,37,9,5244,0,4751,1599927752,,

The direct control is also good for more precise movement... if a little janky. The variety between factions is OK with special units but mostly boils down to pretty much identical standard units with different voice lines and weapon skins (with a few exceptions here and there) the game looks and sounds fine too, but the biggest weakness is in the campaigns. there are several campaigns to choose from including axis and allied factions but all missions are repetitive ""capture 10 identically placed zones in some maps that often feel uninspired"" or ""defend 3 identically placed outer defenses and one central defense"" that's all the mission variety with the exact same objectives in each level for each faction, with changes in maps. e.g. the British second mission is the capture 10 objectives in North Africa, the Americans do the same mission on a European map, the Japanese in a jungle and the soviets in a city. There are also DLC missions where you can use a stealthy infiltration or be in direct control of a tank. Both are dreadful. The tank is clunky and hard to control and the stealth is so poorly done, the devs give you an option to skip it all together.(in fairness the section of the mission after the stealth has slightly better variety) I would not recommend this game if it weren't for the excellent modding community.

14,72061855,english,"I cannot in good conscience reccomend this game for anything other than using the editor & modding scene to create interesting scenarios. 

The game feels extremely unpolished, even more than six years after initial release. There is very little feed back on your actions, including feedback on why you often can't fire a weapon (More on that later)

The game is initially fun and fascinating, especially if you pick up mods for the game, or are particularly interested in WW2 simulators or wargames.


Pros:
-Lovely art direction and well done models.
-Somewhat interesting singleplayer missions, until you realize that several are copypasted between campaigns.
-Modding scene has some decent stuff such as 40k, Vietnam, and various overhaul and content mods.
-Pretty cheap when it's on sale. The only time I would reccomend buying it.
-Decent editor for creating and filming AI scenarios. There's some pretty cool video content on youtube.


Cons: (long ones explained in full at the bottom)
-Extremely unintuitive UI.
-No real tutorial, so everything must be learned yourself, via guides, or via a friend.
-Annoying inventory management system.
-AI is sold to you as a DLC, and it's a DLC that doesn't even work properly. 
-Poor damage models.


The UI has far too many buttons spread out across the keyboard, often needing you to press multiple buttons to perform a single action such as using anything in the inventory. Information is spread out across your HUD, and a lot of it isn't properly explained, even with tooltips. The inventory management system is very nice and interesting for singleplayer, but serves next to no purpose in multiplayer, other than refilling ammunition. None of your infantry will survive long enough to scavenge off of bodies, and ammo refills are automated when you have ammo trucks.

Dozens of units and abilities have missing names or tooltips, only showing the filepath of unit's information/name in the game's rootfolder. Am I supposed to go treasure hunting for these?!

AI is sold to you as a barely functioning DLC. The game won't tell you what content someone is missing in the lobby (""Resource desync detected""), and many maps & co-op missions are locked behind DLC. Aside from being a DLC, the AI doesn't even work properly. The nature of the resource system means that the AI will just bumrush you with any units it spawns, and eventually just run out of units and start spawning them very infrequently. Oh and the AI only has one objective: Attack the flags. It'll never ever flank or do anything remotely interesting. Won't even patrol between flags. This has been confirmed by modders & people poking into the code.

Damage modelling is often horrific. Some units have absolute pinpoint accuracy and damage in comparison to units of the same 'slot' on other factions. Sometimes infantry will just lazer eachother from halfway across the map, and sometimes they'll stand there and be unable to hit, or even shoot, at someone sitting 3 feet away from them taking potshots. Both the passive AI for units, and direct orders, often lead to ridiculous situations like the AI running through a building only to throw an Anti-Tank grenade right into their squadmates.

Tank combat is horrific. The devs 'balanced' a lot of the vehicles by altering their historical armour values and gun ranges & penetration rates to accentuate their purposes. Weapon range is directly tied to calibre and ammo used (Bigger gun longer ranged, APCR rounds drastically reduce range); However it is done so in such a way that you'll have US Tank Destroyers that outrange almost every other vehicle, and are practically unkillable without being snuck up on by infantry.

Direct Control is an interesting, but poorly implemented, feature. It allows you to 'take control' of any unit in the game, and manually aim where they fire. This is pretty much the only way to use most artillery units, as they'll refuse to fire-on-location, and will only free-fire at units inside of an arbitrary range that is well below their actual range. Unfortunately the Direct Control  UI provides absolutely no feedback on why you won't be able to fire a weapon. Yellow means reduced effectiveness, red means out of range, and green means well within range. But outside of that, you'll be faced with dozens of unexplained reasons why you cannot actually fire your weapon, and the top-down perspective makes it doubly difficult to determine why. On the flipside, a master of Direct Control will absolutely ruin any other player in the game with a ridiculously high skill ceiling.

Vehicle damage is often silly and seemingly RNG, except we've been told that these run on statistics and not RNG. Which means some of these are at the very least, deliberate choices.

Here's some examples:

-M12 GMC's which take 7 rear point blank Panzerfausts, 3 german AT grenades, and a belt of ammo from an Ostwind to permanently destroy.
-Jagdtigers which get completely destroyed in one max-range shot from a Bazooka
-PzIII's who get fired on by SU-85's for five minutes straight with no damage inflicted, bouncing every non-angled frontal shot.
-PzIV's who bounce M36 Slugger 90mm rounds multiple times in a row with no angling.
-Rounds inexplicably overpenetrating or bouncing off of a target and causing absolutely no damage to a vehicle or it's occupants, despite the UI telling you that you have a clear and effective shot.

The mods for this game are incredible good ✓

This are the things that sucks:

The DLC's are expensive and some are really useless and just a waste of money ✘
They should take a better look at their missions and vehicles ✘
Some mods are better than the game himself ✘
You have to buy a DLC before you can do skirmish ✘

Conclusion:
It's definitely your money worth it, but you shouldn't buy all of the DLC's, I recommend to buy the
Airbone DLC cuz it adds 5 new cool missions and you can play skirmish with it. You should wait for sale to buy the game and the DLC.

Also download mods for the ultimate fun you can have, I strongly recommend to download the following mods:
Red Rising Mod
The Great War
COD Modern Warfare mod
Robz
Valour
Cold War
Old Boy's U.S Battalion
Old Boy's German Battalion
Men Of War Vietnam

92,59735888,english,"Time for a serious review. My previous review of this game was just the words ""good enough"" and after 1,500 hours with this thing, I think I can give an ok opinion.

Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a mixed package. There are so many blessings and problems its hard to find a place to start.

First of all, its important to clear up the fact that I don't play multiplayer much, or at all. This is due in part to one of the major problems with all Digitalmindsoft games, and that is Netcode. The networking for multiplayer is, in simple terms, shite. My laptop isn't exactly butter smooth when it comes to playing, so part of the blame can be put on me, but just know that to play multiplayer with this game is to accept the fact that your performance (hardware wise) will be downgraded to the level of the player with the worst setup, and that you will experience constant crashes due to memory allocation or etc.

A blessing that this game has is probably the best modding community I've seen for games. You can't overhaul the game and make new mechanics (some people have but they're relatively unpolished) but you can modify the entities within the game (vehicles, soldiers, weapons) which really are the things that matter. From mods like RobZ realism (good for immersion), #Valour (the best way to reach the vanilla experience) or my personal favourite, the Cold War mod, you can do a lot with mods and the maps some people have made.

Possibly the biggest problem with this game is the memory issues, and the fact that it was built for 32 bit OSs, and while it still runs on 64 bit OSs, you'll have a LOT of memory allocation crashes, barring you from playing many missions or multiplayer matches.

The game is also lacking in polish. Animations are janky, sound effects are old, graphical effects are kind of low res, and most of all, the textures for a lot of things are odd to say the least. There is a huge inconsistency between vehicles in the game, with the new Ostfront Veteranen faction having very high quality models, and the Japanese faction having vehicles that are borderline pixel art.

The culture around the game is built from youtubers with clickbait thumbnails, and apparently some russians are hacking now.

Do I recommend you get this game? Hell yes, I got 1,500 hours out of it for what its worth.
Is it 100% guaranteed you'll enjoy it? No, its probably more guaranteed you won't.
I get my kick of dopamine from creating things in the editor. At it's core, I feel like the game is just the GEM editor with a semi polished base over the top. The GEM editor is simply put- think of toy army men when you were a kid. You'd set them up, enact battles between them, you can do that with the GEM editor and even make them kind of autonomous. Watch them fight, control one side, that's the magic of this game.

So should you buy it? Yeah, give it a try. I recommend you do.If you don't enjoy it, I don't blame you. Its not everyone's thing. But by god if this isn't my favourite game of all time.",1576190301,1593274927,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198344474526,20,4,93992,0,80539,1599417509,,

56,13703949,english,"Assault Squad 2 is a great and very complex RTS game, that is very unlike all the other RTSes that I played outside the Men of War series, especially if you play on higher difficulties. The learning curve is rather steep and as you start to learn the game there will be frustrating moments. But as you learn how to play you will be rewarded with a great feeling of accomplishment, when you see how you grew with the challenge and win your first skirmish on ""heroic"" (hardest) difficulty. When I started out I failed many missions on ""normal"" and thought ""how is this even possible to win on 'hard' ?"" Well it is - with knowledge and skill. I know few games in this genre that give you this much power to change the outcome of a battle with pure skill. You can take direct control of every soldier and vehicle and for example aim that one important grenade throw just the way you want it or position a tank precisely behind the ruins of a house, with just a window to shoot through etc.. Replayability is great, buildings can be destroyed, which makes for a very dynamic battlefield and you can hardcore micromanage every single soldier down to picking up equipment from fallen enemies. 
It has its flaws and will drive you mad at times, but still I highly recommend it to anyone looking for skill based RTS with a lot of micromanagement, complex mechanics and all around rather grim and realistic feel to it. Also check out ""Call to Arms"" once it is released. I'm having high hopes for it, although I haven't played it yet.


Update on 2020-06-20: 
Just thought I should add that over 5 years later this is still hands down the best WW2 RTS and my favorite RTS in general.

In ths game every unit, even every foot soldier has a fricking inventory! and this becomes relevant when they need to carry supplies. Infantry need ammo, medical supplies and other stuff while vehicles also spend fuel so you need to think in the supply chain which is something I haven't seen any other game address before. models and animations are also well made and while ammo, for infantry at least, is not that historically accurate (submachine gun ammo, rifle ammo, etc. instead of .45 mm, 9mm etc) there's a mod that adds accurate ammo (only bad thing is it doesn't work with campaign because all the generic ammo the units appear with will not work). The vanilla game also comes with a silly censoring on a flag (you can guess which) but is easily fixed with a mod.

[i]Men of War Assault Squad 2 is one of my favourite RTS game, if not my most favourite. After all these years MoW AS2 is still good and playable game, but it has some negative things. I own Deluxe Edition.[/i]

The game offers single-player missions and multiplayer. Missions are good, I think. You will enjoy few defence missions, skirmish and stealth too. Skirmish is about capturing zones on a map. The new captured zone will unlock new units and give you more points to call reinforcements. One skirmish can take more than an hour. Its dependence on difficulty settings. You can control units of Russia, USA, Britain, Germany and Japan. The game engine is old and has only 32 bits support but the game run relatively good.

Multiplayer offers serval modes. Assault Zones, you must capture more zones than an enemy. More zones you have, the more points you will get. Combat, destroy more units than an enemy. Frontline contains two rounds. In the first round, one team is defending positions and others try to break the frontline. In the second round, sides will switch. Who defends in the first round will be attacker in the second round. The game offer coop too, but there is a strange reinforcement calling system. If you have more units than your coop partner and you call a new unit, then the game will give this unit to your partner but he can give this unit back to you. This balance is for to everyone have the same number of units but sometimes it's annoying, especially if you call a tank and the game decides to give that tank to another player. Performance of multiplayer is sometimes bad. If one player in the lobby has potato PC, you will see lags and even pause during gameplay. This the worst thing in this game, but nothing horrible.

Now, the best thing in MoW AS2. It's Direct Control. It makes the game special. You can control the whole squad of soldiers or you can control one man by using WASD keys and mouse, just like in 3rd person shooter. Of course, you can use DC in vehicles and tanks too. You can aim better and destroy tank faster than automatical aim by AI when you order your unit to eliminate an enemy. Vehicles have many parts which can be destroyed or damaged. For example, you can destroy the main gun on a tank, destroy engine or damage turret to prevent it rotating. Have always a few soldiers around your tank because an enemy can use the advantage of the lonely tank and destroy it with one soldier by an anti-tank grenade. Very frustrating sometimes, so be careful.

Another nice feature which makes this game unique and great is the editor. If you bored of single-player or multiplayer you can enjoy a lot of fun in GEM editor. You can make own maps like in other editors of games, but one thing is unique here. You can play with all units like a child on sandbox with toys. Load up a multiplayer map, spawn some units and start a battle. You can look at units how they fight each other or you can control them. This can be incredibly funny.

Do you like modern vehicles? Do you like realism? Do you like the USA Civil War? Do you like Star Wars? You can find everything in the workshop or Mod DB. My favourite mod is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=455424236&searchtext=valour]Valour. [/url] It adds new factions like Finland, France, Poland and many more. It changes textures, models, sounds, effects, damage system, etc. Valour adds new features and makes the game more realistic. Modders keep alive this nice RTS game. The modding community is big and active.

[b]It's 6 years since the game was released but MoW AS2 is still good and playable. You can still enjoy the game without mods. I prefer to play with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=455424236&searchtext=valour]Valour[/url] mod. If you want to buy MoW AS2 take Airborne DLC too. You will get bots for multiplayer Assault Zones mode. Do I recommend Men of War Assault Squad 2 to you? Yes, but wait for a sale. You will like this game if you like RTS games and you want something special. Direct Control is the best thing. I never see this in other RTS games except for Men of War series and Call to Arms.[/b]",1589893691,1590520803,True,31,1,0.753526926040649414,0,True,False,False,76561198091110242,94,38,15235,7,9748,1601555708,,

That being said, it's more difficult to engage in this game but not because of its more deeper mechanics, it doesn't have the same level of detail and UX as company of heroes or other RTS, the interface does not give proper feedback on certain progress like repair, or how the fog of war show territory as visible(colored) but enemy units could be still hidden because units doesn't have direct field of vision, that idea it's not bad, but many games does include rings of ranges of vision and shows if the line of sight it's disrupted.

It's still and interesting concept, and i'm glad i tried it but i do believe you have to be warned, it's not really the company of heroes experience i expected.

The Depth too this game is near impossible to rival, every soldier and vehicle has an inventory. 
You can Steal enemy STG - 44. Arm your Conscripts with helmets too keep them safe. 
Tank combat is fantastic, and crew inside have dynamic elements that always make very refreshing engagments. Grenades and direct control of your soldiers adds a bit of immersion and gaming elements that may challenge new players but give experienced players the edge.
Flame throwers can be dangorous but if you employ them right only for your enemy! 
Snipers take some time but can be as just as important as a vehicle for the success of battle. 
Cover and maps some of best I've seen in RTS, 

Amazing game very stable and can be a fantastic community playing with vibrant modding.

51,68758218,english,"Micromanaging and attention to details (penetration chances, damage zones on vehicles, different types of shells, individual inventory on every soldier, ability to pick up enemy guns etc.) are on a level not found in any other RTS, you can even choose to control any unit on your own. However, micromanaging and direct control are not optional. Failing to understand and master these mechanics will end in failure and frustration on harder levels. In fact, even if you manage to master these mechanics they are still frustrating and having your soldier taking a scenic route through enemy fortification to jump over a fence in front of him is a daily occurrence on the battlefield. Controls are clunky and AI knows no cool tricks to help you with managing. I imagine those aspects of gameplay weren't touched since very first games in the series. If you can stay sane while learning how to not get your infantry wiped and having your armor one-shotted you are in for a challenging world war 2 RTS that offers a different approach with more ""realistic"" feeling to it.

And you can make make a war hero from a random infantryman by stealing an MG. You can have an entire squad carrying heavy machine guns mowing down everything in their path as well. That is, if you manage to find time to manually get every single one of them to pick up some of the machine guns scattered around while there are waves of infantry pushing on your positions and enemy tanks advancing.",1588890638,1588894026,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198005170182,214,43,1005,0,667,1591489787,,

I wanted to check out a forum post today and also read if something changed in the game and saw a red part on the top of the Men of war: Assault squad2 forum:

"" You have been permanently banned from the Men of War: Assault Squad 2 Hub.
You were banned by a Men of War: Assault Squad 2 developer.""

This is extremly bad behaviour from a developer because you are asking logical questions of why there is a problem with the game, That they just prefer to permanently BAN you from the forum. It´s really horrible.

DO NOT BUY!

I have had lots of fun with it but it´s really a buggy mess, if you use mod that is. Vanilla game is perhaps fine, I actually dont remember since I think this game is a much weaker game than MOWAS 1 since it has less vehicles. Only reason I bought it was for the official modsupport. But sadly it´s quite often it doesnt work and each time the game gets updated, the mods stops working until someone releases a patch for it or you go into each individual folder and edit in textfiles to make it work. So without mods perhaps its still a good game...I cant remember that actually.

--------------------

- Update 2018-09---

Waiting time with mods between 20 minutes and more so do not subscribe to mods then you will get stuck in "" Mounting resources "".

Then if u get into the game and press ""options"" you have a wait time, when you go into ""LAN"" games you have to wait also.. Its still a buggy mess.
-------------

It´s completely broken now. I think the devs abandonded it, It does not 
work to start in anyway. Save your money and buy ""Men of war "".
I tried veryfying files, starting in safemode with no mods, starting with
safemode only. Nothing works.

I wrote on the forums about the problem that it doesnt start 
but have not gotten any answers, and so have no others that 
asked about it.

If you buy it be sure to ask for your money back before you
 had it installed for 2 hours
then it´s not possible to refund.

3,57123308,english,"I'll preface this by saying this game is fun when it ""works"" (balanced teams, good performance, etc). But with randoms it only works about once every 10 games or if you have friends to play with.

For singleplayer this game is fine but I'm not sure why you would buy it for singleplayer. 

The core of this ""game"" is the PvP multiplayer, but the multiplayer is so broken performance wise that it's an insult to other game developers to call the multiplayer a game. Unless you can ensure everyone in your lobby has ~50 ms ping then the game will run like a slideshow and you will be able to count the number of seconds of lag between you sending out orders and your units reacting. It's somewhat more bearable if you have friends to play PvP or modded missions with because chances are your ping will then be reasonable, but if not then I don't recommend you buy this game. 

The actual game aside, the community is also a$$ when it comes to multiplayer. Not only is the community dying, but it's of very low quality too. Randoms will leave if you're beating them (sometimes I can't even blame them if it's because of lag or unbalanced teams, because then it's just 100% not fun to play), and it takes ages to find an actual game. I have never seen a host make an effort to balance teams, and it seems I'm the only one who tries to do this when I host. Again, if you have friends to play with these drawbacks are mitigated somewhat. 

It's really a shame because in theory the concept is really good. The game just runs on decade old technology with shitty netcode and for some reason still with a 32-bit executable because apparently this game was developed in 2005.

I found it difficult to get through a full campaign for any faction as I simply got bored with the predictable enemy AI, over-complicated micromanagement of units and frustration of constantly having to micromanage my units in a way that was too complicated. 

See how I said the same thing, twice, in a long-winded fashion? That's what it feels like to have to select a squad, choose an individual squad member, have them look in a disabled vehicle, open their inventory, move the jerry can over, select the jerry can, walk them to the friendly tank out of gas and fill it up to 3%, return to the disabled vehicle and fill the jerry can, return to the friendly tank to get it up to 6%, and so on... Meanwhile, the enemy sniper has killed the other half of that poor guys squad and I can hear the distinct sound of a Panzer coming from my left flank which I have't had time to reinforce because I was getting gas for my Sherman.

It's an amazing game to play with friends and I've loved every moment with my friends playing this, all the laughs, anger over BS, and sh*talking. But after the games you play and think about the game itself...... Yeah it's not the best nor optimized game around, and there are also some marketing practices in this game that really makes me mad. 

 FIRST of all, you have to buy a freaking DLC to fight A.I. in skirmish! This game is not for you if you don't have friends or enjoy competitive matches every now and then. The campaign isn't very good and the mission concept are the same for each faction, neat to go though first time though. Because you have to buy a DLC for A.I. you have to learn the hard way and join multiplayer games so you will either lose hardcore without learning too much or get kicked for being new to the game but that's not a big things anymore. This game can get really competitive so hosts wanted better players. You won't be helpless though, I wasn't but I'm just saying what could happen for some people. 
 And second is the game isn't optimized well and the game even tells everyone to restart their games often to prevent crashes especially if you use any mods but they were too busy making the disaster which was the Cold War version of this game. 

 Now if you have the A.I. or don't care about the issues I put above then this game is the right game for you.
The game has so much going on in multiplayer and I love it so much and...... If you use mods like ROBZ Realism mod.... You just made yourself a better man. Holy crap the mods in this game are absolutely fantastic and they all work in multiplayer to have fun with friends or just in online sessions you can host. A big majority of online games usually use the ROBZ Realism mob because it essentially adds onto the game and adds so much more including game elements, the game is a lot better with it. I highly advise getting this mod in the steam workshop but a little warning that the A.I. won't work in mods but that shouldn't matter. The modding community is insane in this game, you could be fighting in a modified WW2 to insane battles between STAR WARS FIGHTING WARHAMMER FACTIONS with your friends! You can probably tell that I've talked about playing with friends, I've personally enjoyed this game far more than anything just goofing around with my friends than anything else.

there is countless amounts of glitches and just mass amounts of repititive missions with samey units for all factions,all the missions are the same for each campaign only diffrence is the map the misson takes place on.

On top of that any of your units no matter how powerful always roll the dice of being killed out of the blue especially in the 3rd person tank missions that are GAWD AWFUL. 

Half the time you will have trouble exiting the game and you have to go into the Task Manger to turn it off sometimes because the game feels like it.

There is no point to even using anything larger then a light tank  because enemy tanks and AT guns have the same chance to kill bigger ones anyways so your hull and armour dosent' matter the special abilitys or tanks are completely useless other then the British arty strike or the American Air attack the rest are a waste of cash. Yes, even the Goliath.

The game isnt really that hard just complete and utter bullshit when shit like one Panzer 4 just eats 8 APCR 4 T34/85's and the only time it is difficult is on the stages where you have to do an infiltration which take god damn forever and are really unfair (looking at you Ostwind)

in order to play this game you need to either A. know how to turn your brain off or B. think about other things while playing it because the gameplay dosent give you a sense of being rewarded for doing that secondary objecive, taking a key point, or killing a big threat. the only place it is even good in is online multiplayer and you will be lucky to even get a match let alone with someone who is not salty as hell.

i got this game a while go off of many recomendations but by god i just cannot play it anymore it seems much better on the surface like vanillia ice cream but the longer you eat it the more you reget it

[h1]Men of War: Assault Squad 2 Review[/h1]
Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) and Tactics game set in the second world war. It is developed by Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Entertainment. The game fully released in March 2014 exclusively for Windows on Steam after leaving a small period of early access. It is the sequel of Men of War: Assault Squad with a substantial engine upgrade and a new revamped multiplayer system.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
If you are new to Men of War, it is not like any other generic RTS games; it's more of a Game of combat rather than resource management. It incorporates everything from its predecessor, so AS2  has a truckload of content and missions. You take control over one of the five distinct armies with their unique vehicles, personal weapons, and camouflage. Each mission has the same mix of objectives; what differs is the faction you play and the map. Some of them include infiltration, defense, skirmish, and Tank skirmish. Your primary goal is always to suppress your enemy, call more troops, and finish the objective or eradicate the enemy in any manner possible.
The game features a singleplayer skirmish mode that can be played alone or with friends. But the game lacks an AI, and bots require a separate paid DLC; hence the game is best enjoyed in multiplayer. The multiplayer features 1v1 to 8v8 modes, each designed for strategic battles and different experiences.
What differs in AS2 that there is a self-learning curve rather than the game just flinging tips at you, which leaves you open for experimenting with every feature in the game. There is ample micromanagement that even steeps down to individual soldiers. Every single unit has its separate inventory, which can be sorted & scavenged. If your troop runs out of ammo, it displays a red ammo clip over its head. Similarly, you'll have to manage ammo, bandages and grenades, and trenching equipment of every soldier on the battlefield. But this micromanagement can be avoided by the timely use of supply crate that automatically replenishes the ammunition of soldiers, but the game doesn't tell you that straight up and forces you to learn it the hard way. Not only that but also, learning to resupply squads with a single click, how to rearrange and organize shattered units after an attack, and how to gain ground without exposing troops to enemy armor; such strategies and tactics will be useful in multiplayer because fire and movement make up the basis of most of these tactics.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Realism and detailing in AS2 makes the game very engaging. Vehicles don't have hitboxes; instead, their essential parts break down, unlike having a general health bar. Tanks can get stuck, run out of fuel, become immobile, or get wrecked by AT guns. Every unit can counter and be countered as is expected in real life. E.g., Anti-tank guns are excellent against tanks, posing a threat to even the tougher ones and knocking them out of action. Machine guns are useful to rip apart enormous waves of infantry but will do nothing against armor. Mortars do severe damage at enemy positions but are entirely unpredictable & inaccurate. Overall you'll have to command each of your men to prone, crouch, stand ground, fire, and control their movement and position as this isn't a game where you can just place troops and just forget about them. 
Apart from that, AS2 also features a 'direct control' mechanism by which you can trigger control over any troop or tank as if it were a third-person shooter. You'll automatically lock over the shoulder of the unit and can control its rifle/gun, move around and shoot.

[h1]Graphics[/h1] 
The graphics haven't changed majorly in AS2. But they shouldn't be the primary concern either as you'll be watching the game from a height. The maps live up to the thematic element of WW2 and are vividly designed to be fully destructible. It is almost satisfying to watch buildings crumble after getting hit by a shell, seeing tanks break down, etc.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
The game is very strategic and skill-based. The singleplayer is lackluster, but multiplayer makes up for it. The game supports modding, and you can have endless hours of fun with that, its dedicated steam workshop, designing your custom missions and mods. Note there aren't any updates of late, and some bugs still exist along with server sync issues in multiplayer. But still, it has a great community until the date and definitely worth the buy even in 2020.

10,66872280,english,"Of all the WWII RTS games out there, this one has to be in my top five most satisfying.  A wide range of units, no shortage of awesome visuals and strategies, and one of the only RTS games that let you take direct control of a unit.... or redistribute ammo and weapons between units.  There's a layer of complexity here that's not mandatory to fully explore, but it gives the game that extra omf other WWII titles just don't have.  A classic reworked into a modern masterpiece for its time, and it still keeps me coming back today.  1C Entertainment, you done did good.

Basic MDA Analysis:
Aesthetics: Challenge, Abnegation, Fantasy.  This is one title that will have you coming back again and again, especially thanks to mods and base game replayability.  There's a layer of challenge involved in taking on players and higher tier AI opponents.  Live the fantasy of being a commander in World War Two, or take to the front by taking direct control of soldiers, armored cars, artillery pieces, and tanks.
Dynamics: With complex array of units, weapons, and tactical options, players are challenged to come up with unique, abstract ways to overcome unique developments against an AI that's not gonna play nice at higher difficulty levels.
Mechanics: Summarized by efficient RTS control scheme with a twist.  Weapons, ammo, and equipment can be picked up from the battlefield or interchanged between soldiers through accessible unit and vehicle inventories.  Objective is field control, player who takes all command posts wins.  (Primary game mode is a Tug of War).

Let's face it, this little analysis of mine doesn't do the game justice from a player's perspective.  Just try it out for yourself.  For you devs out there, you might get what I did here.",1586330616,1586330616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198021998137,143,26,7381,0,6900,1587289834,,

The Good: 

-It has better graphics than Men of War 2009

-The fact it can run on my Intel GPU makes it amazing in itself

-Improved Combat Mechanics

-Medics

The Bad:

-Still has the same kind of interface as the 2009 version and it hasn't aged very well

-A hand full of Campaign Missions, i guess the DLCs and Mods make up for it

-Austrian Man's Army

Buying the normal game, you will be... a bit disappointed... There is no private verse AI option that isn't the preset missions (Which are mostly waiting missions), and the only way to play with the normal skirmish modes is to play online (Unless you are lucky enough to have friends that own this game). Worse yet, the AI verse function is locked away by a $10 DLC...


... well, geezes, so, why do I still recommend it?... Well, it's because it's an excellent game otherwise.
Compared to it's younger brother, Call to Arms, the base game comes with 5 factions, fully worked on. This means mutliplayer is basically fair playing grounds for everyone. This is before we include mods.

Of course I understand the $30 price tag is daunting... especially with how the game is sold, with it's somewhat cash-grab DLC (I mean, one DLC is actually a $7 achievement), though that should not stop you from enjoying the game. Even the missions alone can give you 100+ hours of gameplay if you play the game completely base.

81,66498714,english,I'm a big fan of the RTS genre and I don't know why I waited so long to play this game. It's like company of heros but utterly chaotic. Once the shooting starts it does not stop till the missions over or you die. It does not have a traditional fog of war and you can only see whats in the direct line of sight of your units. This makes advancing really challenging since you are forced to think about every angle every corner and cover every turn. The game does not have a tutorial so it's worth having a look at the controls since some key bindings are different to traditional RTS which can be frustrating till you figure it out. You can always play the missions on easy to learn but even on normal the AI puts on a decent fight. The controls can be frustrating and its not always obvious what you have selected but it's still worth learning for the sheer pleasure of the challenge this game puts up.,1585918507,1585918507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198021758699,56,3,6764,0,640,1592910458,,

13,65648409,english,"Before I give my review of the game I should let you know that I am an enormous World War 2 history buff, with that in mind there aren't many video games video games that are as specific as this one. Believe me when I say that I have spent hours searching for realistic WW2 games. When I stumbled across MOWAS2 (Men Of War Assault Squad 2) I didn't think it would be so detailed. I'm used to seeing games advertise themselves with super cool graphics, crazy realism, and exciting game play when really they just added filters over the video and made it look better than it actually is. After spending so much time looking for a realistic WW2 game I thought ""what the heck, why not give it a try""... and boy would I be surprised. Being able to manage troops on a decently sized map is fun. Especially when you have plenty of options for which units to choose from. I personally enjoy using infantry. Being able to send a squad one place to distract the enemy all while I flank them with another squad. I will admit that the AI can be pretty derpy and overpowered at times. Especially when I have an entire veteran squad and they end up getting mowed down by one crewman on a flak 38. I do recommend playing the campaign first before jumping straight into multiplayer. Even though the campaign is almost all the same material, it really helps teach the mechanics of the game. 
Overall I think this game is great. It has a very active community and there are always lobbies to join. 

Hope to see you on the battlefield!

The bad:

First of all, the developer's expect you to buy a £6 (Airborne) DLC just so you can get AI bots to play simple skirmishes against AI on a level playing field. The singleplayer doesn't feature this but instead gives you scenarios for different nations, the scenarios never change, the maps are simply switched. This means that without paying for the DLC, you only have the option to play the same 12 scenarios, with limited units, or play PVP against other players. If you want to skirmish against AI, you better hope you have a friend who owns the airborne DLC.

The developers also expect you to pay for another £6 (Iron Fist) DLC... just so you can view replays. If you want to see your own replay or a friend's replay, you better cough up £6.

On the multiplayer itself, you'll be wasting a lot of time. Most of the people in multiplayer are veterans, there are a lot of decent guys but many will kick you for being new or just completely stomp you out if you don't learn the game quickly. You will rarely be able to actually finish a multiplayer game because rather the host will crash or you will crash, which happens to people in 70% of my games. People crash a lot, so enjoy. It's not even just when you're playing, you'll probably crash while in the lobby because the developers refuse to fix a 4 year old bug which makes players freeze in lobbies (can we get a £6 fix-this-game DLC?).


The good:

On the actual difficulty aspect, this game is pretty rough. If you're not very good at micro, play Company of Heroes because this game is absolutely brutal on poor positioning and such. Though this is one of the reasons I enjoy this game, infantry have tiny healthpools and vehicles have modular damage which means you'll have to repair different parts when a vehicle is hit, if it hasn't been completely destroyed. Individual soldiers can be easily split from their squad and manipulated individually, which means you can reform squads if you need a specialised team or if some of your guys have been blown up. The game is unique in this aspect and you can enjoy some flexibility.

Another saving grace for this game is the modding community. There are tons and tons of mods, some small and some a total overhaul mods which are pretty good. WW1 mods, realism mods, Vietnam and even modern era mods mean that content is not an issue.

*note I have played several of the Men of War games and the previous Assault Squad game*
Men of War: AS 2 is I assume the sequel to the previous Assault Squad game. If you don't know the Men of War series, pretty much it's you control various squads of units throughout the theaters of war during WWII. The Men of War games are known for their fully destructible environments, as well as the ability to directly control units, manage ammo types, commandeer vehicles, and make your own tactics to deal with obstacles. While the other Men of War games are objective-based and have some story, the Assault Squad games are significantly focused more on strategy and controlling armies. In fact, on most of the maps you actually have a currency system that you earn over time as you capture objectives, allowing you to call in more units to help you proceed forward. Unlike the other Men of War games, there are little to no allied units, you are controlling everything. 

The missions are all parallel to each other for each of the factions, which means that for the first mission you will be doing the same thing for each faction, just in a different environment. Despite this, having new vehicles and units that have their own unique weapons provide for different strategies that prevent the maps from feeling completely the same for all factions. The main missions consist of you controlling your squads moving forward and taking over capture points, which unlock more types of units, until you reach the end. The enemy will also send units after you based on how many points you control, so you will be having to defend these points as well. The other missions are varied, from stealth-focused to fortress defense and this kind of variety is much-needed. You'll know what to expect when you play these, and the replay value comes from trying out new strategies and playing on the harder difficulties. If you want a Men of War game, there is no reason not to get this. In fact, I only recommend getting this one. It's an updated version of Assault Squad, and workshop content allows you to play most of the other Men of War games. If you want a squad-based strategy game faithful to the era with chaotic battles, this is for you. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Fully destructible environments with tons of vehicles and weapons to experiment with
[*]Each of the 5 factions are different enough to make you want to play all of them, leading to a lot of content
[*]Significant replay value thanks to it mostly being unscripted 
[*]It's a ton of fun taking control of individual units and making them be COD-level soldiers
[*]Usually competent AI
[*]Good and varied level design and missions
[*]Bots for multiplayer
[*]Workshop content allows you to play almost all previous Men of War games
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]As the fights expand out, managing a larger number of units may become unnecessarily difficult, especially since the auto-move and attack isn't as good as it could be
[*]Technically, every mission is identical for each of the factions, which means no surprises when playing a different one for a different faction
[*]AI can be stupidly incompetent sometimes, specifically with your allies 
[*]It's annoying having new units arriving at the beginning of the map when you're all the way at the end
[*]Little difference from the previous Assault Squad game
[*]Too much water on the Japanese levels
[/list]

The replayability of this game is just incredible and I find myself picking this game up every few months for the last couple of years.

Sadly, 1C Entertainment doesn't know how to replica the success of this game anymore and they just churn out weak ""DLC"" that doesn't add much besides reskinning some units, I really wish for a proper Assault Squad 3 with more different objectives, more in-depth story telling and perhaps even deeper combat.

Well, this game is not really fun.  It's excessively punishing, for one.  Even on the easy difficulties, the AI is pounding you hard and always has the tools needed to, if not outright defeat you, make your afternoon as stressful as possible.  There's no in-game tutorial, but the game doesn't even tell you that.  It just drops you dead into the scenario and waves ""good luck"".
Choosing units?  You best figure out fast which is which, because you get no information about the units until after you've called for it and it's on your screen.  Didn't know that tank was designed for anti-aircraft?  Too bad, it's yours now.

It often rarely gives you the forces you need to hold the enemy off, expecting you to call for reinforcements.  Which is fine, except the AI has an unlimited amount of them.  Pause in your advance to reorganize and plan your next step and you'll get overwhelmed by exactly whatever enemy unit is the best for killing your current forces, which pushes you back and makes it even harder to get more reinforcements.

And the Editor.   What a train wreck this is.   There is absolutely no help anywhere here.  I spent 20 minutes clicking on the screen with ""grass"" chosen, and seeing nothing happen.   So I can't even figure out how to make a clear, empty field.   And the game doesn't care if you don't know.

But now, it really need's new engine, and updates! Graphics are disgusting in comparision with new games similiar to men of war, even there aren't animations. The AI is worst of all, soldiers just stay on the place when enemy throw a grenade, when ammo is out, they just stay on the place where they were and waiting for death, missions are absolutely lazy made. Almost every mission is same, once you defending, once you attacking and that's all. Nothing new! Game design is also a pretty shit. I feel like I am again in 2010 and playing this as a kid.

There's *A LOT* of YouTube content too, which can vary from mod reviews to custom maps/scenarios. Of these, I recommend DiplexHeated and theShermanator, as they're the ones that originally had me interested in this game.

16,60133023,english,"TLDR: Unless you like WW2 and got lots of patience to handle disproportionate stupidity in the battlefield, I cannot recommend this game.

MoW 2 is great on many aspects. It's fun to play with friends, factions are fun and somewhat balanced, and overall entertaining RTS gameplay. However, I cannot recommend this game for the sole reason that the AI can be very incompetent on its own and it becomes unbearable on the long-term playthrough. To give an example, I have played MoW Assault Squad 2 with friends since I bought it. It's a blast playing with friends, but something always perturbed me, and that being how the units' AI behave sometimes. I ordered one of my soldiers to throw a frag grenade in a reachable nearby trench, for example, but what he does instead is he unexplicably runs straight to said trench and gets shot to death.

My other gripe is that the DLC is spendy for what it is imo. And from what i have heard you need a DLC in order to play a game mod that should come with the base game.

This game has a level of strategy that could work, but i feel like i am fighting the game any time i try and utilize troops in a building. or when i try to have my troops facing a certain direction. Maybe it is to simulate how you can't give exact orders to someone, and they will always have a different interpretation? 

I feel like the balance is realistic, as a player who is at a normal skill level, i feel that the German army just seems better across the board, while the other nations are niche strategies. This is just thinking on the most basic level and for what this game is portraying.

13,59115833,english,"Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a real time strategy game set in World War II where you can play as five different factions, namely, the USA, the Soviet Union, Japan, Germany and the Commonwealth in various missions while attempting to manage the chaos unfolding on the battlefield and keeping your units alive.

Depending on how you play the game, you might find yourself micromanaging every aspect of the battle, down to the equipment that your infantry is using and even directing their fire yourself through the direct control feature. This is especially useful for units such as AT Guns and Mortars as they may require a little player intervention to help guide their aim.

I play this game primarily as a single player/co-op game and you can play the singleplayer missions in co-op with up to eight players in the co-op Skirmish mode. Co-op has always been one of my favourite parts of the Men of War series and it has resulted in some fun moments such as teaming up with my friends and role-playing divisions, where each of us took command of a bunch of units and split ourselves into roles such as fire support, infantry or mechanised infantry. I also had a friend who wasn't a big fan of the RTS genre but liked that he could command just one unit while transferring everyone else to me.

It is also possible to add bots to some multiplayer modes to enhance your co-op/bot game experience, but they are included in the paid Airborne DLC which is a bit of a bummer so if you want, you could pick it up for cheap when the game goes on sale like I did.

I would recommend this game to fans of World War II games or those who are looking for a strategy game that takes a more realistic and tactical approach to the genre. Additionally, with Steam Workshop integration, you can install a variety of mods that can change up your overall experience and the developers have provided development tools that you can use to create your own scenarios, missions and content.

If you're coming from Assault Squad 1 like myself, look at 2 as an upgrade. For new players who have never played Assault Squad 1 before, get 2 instead. It can be overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of things, it's a pretty fun, yet challenging RTS to play.",1575368128,1575368687,True,4,0,0.561597108840942383,0,True,False,False,76561197993765276,462,38,872,0,377,1592064225,,

After Soldiers: Heroes of World War II this game ... hell no. I was a bit confused about it. But then i got it. (I`ll be talking bout story and avaliable companies , i will not touch upon online part of the game because i havent tried it)
There are campaigns for each nation - 8 missions in total (ALL THE SAME for each nation , the only change is units) , if you try out one campaign , you basically have played them all. Each mission , (excluding a couple) is just a massacre. Most of the game scenery is just THE MORE UNITS THE BETTER. On one hand it looks good but on the other its kinda lame, and thats what i hated the most, because my first acquaintance with this series started at Man of War: Diversants 2, where you had a small squad at hand and you had to make due with it and thats what i like the most. Going back to Assault Squad 2 i can also sau that every mission was dragged for way to long. If you want to buy it then by all means Wait For A Discount. If you dont have Soldiers: Heroes of World War II then id suggest you buy it.
///После Soldiers: Heroes of World War II эта игра... ну уж нет. Я был немного в недоумении чего и к чему. Но потом понял. *Далее пойдет рассказ об компаниях, сетевую игру не расматриваю ибо не довелось.*
Компании для каждой нации - это 8 мисий(ОДИНАКОВЫХ для разных наций, просто в разной обвертке в виде техники и юнитов), если поиграете в 1 компанию увидите их все. Каждая , по своей сути за исключением 2-ух, мисия - бойня. В этой игре большинство всего сделано на массовость. С одной стороны это не плохо и смотриться... Но для меня это был минус, ибо началось мое знакомство с серией с игры В тылу врага: Диверсанты 2, где у тебя были небольшие отряды и ты должен был выкручиваться как мог и это мне нравилось! Возращаясь к Assault Squad 2 можно еще сказать, что мисии довольно таки затянуты. Если и покупать, то строго по скидке!

Maybe a tutorial mission of some sort would not go amiss, and a ramping up of difficulty rather than throwing you in to the thick of things would make it a bit easier to enjoy.
If you're really good at company of heroes already and want something even more in depth, I think this would be good for you.

Pros:
-Excellent mod support (Simple and easy)
-Great micro-management that is optional that adds much depth to the game
-Multiplayer really brings out the game
-Large variety of weapons
-Wide ability to interact with the environment
-Has much potential to do anything you want with it
-GEM editor

Cons:
-Universally copied and pasted missions from MoW:AS
        -Singleplayer is not enjoyable to the extent it could be
-Engine not funny optimized
-Developers are getting closer to forgetting the game (No updates, which makes sense)
-Overall could be improved

MoW:AS2 is a great buy, just take into account these factors before you do.

One of the perks that comes with buying this game is the great community/player base that releases amazing and well crafted mods, missions & maps that make MoW:AS2 feel new and fresh every month or so. 
Only gripe I have is with the AI pathfinding that can at times make weird travel decisions, so some babysitting while moving tanks and other vehicles is required. Other than that, the game runs perfectly smooth, looks stunning and will most likely keep you busy for years to come, as it has with me.

Small unit RTS with tanks and fairly accurately portrayed armor penetration over distance and through obstacles

Time to kill is potentially instantaneous quick for everything, keeping you on your toes.

The importance of positioning and ammunition rewards fast and decisive engagements.

Line of fire, line of sight, concealment and fog of war. You sneak through foliage, and so can your opponent.

Looting and inventory: Wanna trade a bren for a .50cal? Do it! Desperately need an AT grenade? Go find a dead SMG soldier!

Multiplayer and co-op!

Some impressive mods!

Downsides: absolutely no in-game explanations, single player missions are essentially copy pasted for each nation, plethora of features are way too complex for the AI to handle, buildings get damaged extremely easily which can throw off map design by reducing available cover, smoke grenades are a missed opportunity.

Also it seems like the team behind this project don't understand the meaning of respect to clients..

Hint - look at DLC's and what they add.. and then look at their price... or say something ""bad"" about their project in comments and wait till you get banned and your comments vanish :D

GJ devs just the right strategy to gather fans - thumbs down!

Just got back to this game to see how bad it is or is it still. And what I see? 
MoW: Cold War as a stand alone expansion from beloved (not) Digitalmindsoft comming soon! (What about the mods? Players already have it in the mods, for free..)

At this point I'm still dissapointed but not surprised, it's been a while, I got used to this.

But I guaran-fucking-tee you, dear readers - I beeg you pardon -  that there will be people praising them and throwing cash at them, once they release that retextured money grab (hell, they are already defending them in the comments in the news section, when someone mentiones mods) :""D

Pity the game and it's unused potential, but I admire the modders - they are doing the heavy lifting, even fixing bugs - shame. Game's good, just devs are bad.

Speaking of quality, did you know that original developers of this franchise are in fact - creating a remake, focusing on multiplayer skirmishes with impressive tech trees to unlock by players?

Want your guys to build sandbags to sit behind? Sure, set it up on a hill with a machine gun behind the sandbags, and watch him mow down platoons of enemy infantry.

Want some puny Sherman tanks to take out a Tiger 1? That's do-able, just re-enact the movie Fury.

Needless to say, I haven't been impressed. In fact, my experience with AS2 has been beyond disappointment. Given the time from the early beta stage to now, and including the push-back of the release date multiple times, I've found that this game has not only been a waste in terms of what potential it had, but you are literally paying for a $34.00 overhaul patch by buying this game.

The biggest improvements since AS-1 have been:

1. Multiplayer, which lags often, and depends on who is better at storming a place with infantry and light vehicles. Tanks are, very rarely fielded. The gameplay is repetitive, and balance issues come and go.

2. The Super-Pershing and a few tank models. Yeah, they look a little more ""smooth,"" but then you can take a peek at everything else. Everything else is literally recycled from the previous game.

3. Multi-core support. I haven't noticed a difference.


The things I'd thought I was going to see:

1. A little bit of variety in the infantry. Yeah, they don't even have new models or textures. It's the exact same thing from the previous title, rehashed a bit for a few more ""Breeds,"" which you can make by simply opening the editor and reassigning a few traits, weapons, and items. There are a few more voices thrown in for the American and English soldiers, but there is still plentiful cut-and-paste from the previous game. Oh, and the voice acting is horrific for the most-part.

2. Better textures. The dirt looks beautiful. A few tanks look better. But, for everything else, it all is recycled from the last game. The buildings aren't different. The uniforms aren't different. The mass majority of vehicles aren't different.

3. Better gameplay. Yeah, no. In fact, they took away the feature where you could unload your guns. The AI is a little more ""Cover-seeking,"" so they are no longer inherently stupid. However, you still have to pack up millions of bullets so they can fend for themselves without running dry.

4. Differences between faction weapons. I'll admit, I was expecting more realistic performance out of the guns for each faction. But, all rifles are pretty much the same, the Thompson isn't much different from an MP-40, the Grease-Gun is treated like a 9-mm, and overall, you're just going to go for an MG-42 if you want rate of fire; the browning if you want less reloading; or the BAR/FG-42 if you want less unloading. There isn't much of an accuracy or damage difference. Line up soldiers with every faction's rifle; they fire and reload at the exact, same times, with the exception of the enfield rifleman. There should be a difference. The action on a Mosin is completely different from a 98' or a Springfield.

5. Models and textures. Yeah, about 10 vehicles look better. But the mass majority of the others still look copy/paste. If I wanted to copy/paste vehicles, I'd make a mod for that.

Can I say I recommend this game? No. For $34.00, hell no. It's nowhere near being worth that kind of money, and I'm losing to faith to tell myself that ""yeah, it'll improve as they get closer to the full release."" It's been in Early Access for quite some time now. Before that, there was beta. They have had the time to improve the game. Yet, I have only seen them trying to get it into a playable state every few weeks, while leaving us high and dry in every other aspect. Maybe if it were $10.00 DLC for AS1, it'd be worth it. But as a standalone game, let alone a Sequel, it's not just a cheap re-release with nothing new to offer, but it's a complete waste of money.

I've already learned from one other game that pulled the same ""Beta limited-content"" trick. ArmA 3. Overall, that game was a complete disappointment. There was very little content added into the beta, there was very little content added into the main game, and countless patches treated the post-final release like it was (and still is) in the early-access stage. AS2 is mirroring this tactic, and foreshadows disappointment.

I have a feeling they're going to just decide to ""leave it to the modders,"" as ArmA 3 did, and while mods are often well done, they are not only far from uniform in quality and not designed by a common party, but that's a cheap way of copping-out of extensive work. Work that this game seriously needs if it is to hold the number ""2"" after Assault Squad.

A better name for this would be ""Assault Squad: MEGAPATCH."" If you feel like disagreeing, then pull up the AS1 editor and the AS2 editor. Put down one of every model. Test the game, see what happens; you'll learn that I'm right, because this is exactly how I tested it. I'm not making these claims without evidence. There is no difference between these games except for the mulitplayer.


Do keep in mind; this review is for a $34.00 product. It is intended to reflect and aid you, the viewer, in determining whether or not you will ""get what you pay for."" The answer to that is no, ""No, you won't.""

I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE FINAL RELEASE PROVES MY FEARS TO BE WRONG, AND RENDERS THIS REVIEW TO BE OUTDATED. SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE, I WILL GLADLY CHANGE MY REVIEW AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GAME. SHOULD MY FEAR THAT THIS GAME OFFERS NO ""CHANGE"" WORTHY OF A SEQUEL BE CONFIRMED AT FINAL RELEASE, I WILL NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH DIGITAL-MIND-SOFT.

Do know; I won't be alone in that regard.




[July 19, 2014] UPDATE!

Ok; so since the game's release, there has been little to nothing improved upon since I had written this review. The ""priority"" for the team has only been multiplayer. There has been no increase in content. There has been no more bang for the buck. Digital-Mind-Soft has charged their community for a mere patch, and has done nothing to back the quality of the game except tamper with multiplayer mechanics, and not even to the extent that significantly alters gameplay in any way.

Do you have money to waste, and want to support a dishonest development project? Then don't spend money. Please.

Stop giving companies the motivation to screw over their customers and to default on their promises. It's been months, and there aren't even any new ""Humanskins"" in the game. Let me say right now: It takes 10 MINUTES OR LESS TO CREATE A NEW ""SKIN"" USING PAINT.NET.

With the time they've taken to add ""boards"" to Multiplayer, I could have created the entire Italian Army with a modeling program; sadly, that's 3DS-MAX, a program that the 2014 edition of, costs upwards of $3,400 to own.




[August 26 2014] UPDATE!

Playing through the editor a bit, one of the first things I checked were the models. What can I say about them? Three new models; all Crusader Tanks. The model has been significantly improved, with the Crusader looking more streamlined and smooth than before. It looks good. Not only that, but there are 2 more Crusaders; a 40mm Anti-Air crusader, and a 20mm Anti-Air crusader. These, too, look good. But nonetheless, Japanese vehicles still look as though they are made out of cardboard, and there haven't been any other model updates added.

Most importantly, the soldiers still have the same skins as in the previous title; the lack of effort in this category is appaling. Do bare in mind; Assault Squad was a 2009 game. This means that the soldier's skins are 5 Years old. You can learn to create professional 3D models in half that time. Given that this much time has progressed, one would and should expect more from a company charging full-price for a ""patchwork"" game.",1562693253,1566313692,False,1,1,0.392857134342193604,0,True,False,False,76561198373502045,104,144,47,0,29,1573851851,,

21,54594146,english,"Me and my mate bought this after exhausting our pointless lives and any reasons to sustain them on Company of Heroes 2, and that's the game I'm comparing it to.

✔️WHAT I LIKE:

- Good variety of units.
- Tends to be more fast paced unlike CoH2.
- *autistic screeching* holy sh*t you can actually take control of individual soldiers and tanks and shoot enemies yourself!
- Infantry seems to be more deadly and pose more of a threat to tanks than in CoH. Firefights go by quick. Although the soldiers do seem to instantly die from a fly landing on their shoulder.
- Explosions actually kill infantry. It always annoyed me how in Company of Heroes 1/2 a blast from a 150mm howitzer would barely scratch enemies 2 metres away from the explosion. Mainly only units directly in the explosion would get killed, not the tw*ts around it. In this game the explosion actually has a blast radious, at least against the infantry, and it actually feels like a threat against infantry. Your howitzers do not feel underpowered. 

❌WHAT I DON'T LIKE:

- It looks mediocre.
- The UI is terrible and ugly.
- The dodgy controls in this game make it feel like it's in alpha or something.
- The mortar feels very weak and incredibly inaccurate. It's like throwing firecrackers during a tornado.
- I had times where my 122mm tank would struggle to penetrate the side of a standard Panzer, so the 'hit detection' feels dodgy.
- The German and American tanks seem to be noticably better which kinda leads to unbalanced gameplay.
- The British seem to not have a good heavy tank? The most powerfull one is 77mm I think. Seriously? I guess it's historically accurate but it seems to put the Brits at a considerable disadvantage. This leads to even more unbalanced gameplay, where you struggle to kill asingle Tiger with your dinky little 75mm Cromwells.
- All maps feel exactly the same. Every map is very open. There are no maps with islands you can cross to only via bridges, or tight crossing etc. for some cool chokepoint gameplay.

🏁VERDICT:

All in all, I like the game, it definitely is a good alternative to Company of Heroes, but ultimately it lacks the overall quality and polish of CoH so I'd go for that anyway.

I give it ...

23,54580598,english,"TL;DR;
this is just MOW: AS with some extra maps. only get if on sale, you're interested in learning how to mod and don't know where to start, or want some decent multiplayer. 

easily one of, if not the, most overrated WWll strategy games out there. i have countless hours on the first MOW: AS, and i think that game is ass. I copped this game for about $3 on sale and I have to say that if I paid a penny more I would have refunded after the first hour. This game is what MOW:AS should've been and isn't even much of an improvement. 

If you have played MOW:AS, or any other MOW, don't waste your money on this one. I was expecting many improvements based off of the first game, but the devs don't even attempt to reskin the game at all, they use the exact same maps and throw in some ridiculous missions where there are new (but mostly unimpressive) maps. Same exact skins and uniforms, same exact voices, and for the most part same exact maps and missions. RobZ Realism Mod helps a good bit in the skins and uniforms, and there are some pretty good map mods/mods in general which I will talk about in a sec.

SO, maps and missions. As I said, there are new maps and unlike the first AS the missions on the maps vary. Many of the missions have different parts, such as the first USA mission, you defend for a bit and counter attack. This was very enjoyable and kept every mission from being the same, boring thing. However, a couple missions in and everything gets boring. I know this is a thing in every MOW game I've played, so maybe the series just isn't for me, but the AI has absolutely no real AI. They just mindlessly fart out and throw their resources at you, you just have to learn the pattern at which the big bad tanks and howitzers come out and where to put your men and how to use your special abilities (airstrikes etc). The difficulty setting only changes how much damage your soldiers take when they're shot, not AI strategy. If your goal is to attack, they sit there, reinforcements come and attempt to counterattack periodically, and for every ""line of defense"" captured, the enemy throws more of their advanced stuff at you, and the more big guns you have to get through. Not only speaking of AI strat, but this is hardly a strat game period. You can sneak through bushes, pop up and shoot everybody, maybe drop some airborne behind lines and make some chaos while you send an assault squad up, but that's about it. The maps are far too narrow to do any real flanking manevours, and this was a problem in AS1 too. It was a problem in every MOW I've played, so maybe the series just isn't for me. 

I CAN SAY, however, the multiplayer in the game is fun, the community is still bustling, and there are plenty of mods out there to make the game a tad bit enjoyable, however good luck finding many mods that are compatible with each other. I can also say that the editor for the game is very extensive and imo it would be great for any novice modder or somebody who wants to try it out.  If you have never played a MOW before, want the experience, and this game is on sale, go ahead and give it a go. 

Also this MOW is still far superior to MOW: Vietnam. That was probably the worst game I've ever played.",1565606347,1565606347,False,2,3,0.532233893871307373,0,True,False,False,76561198048993430,54,3,1825,0,465,1599008199,,

Some downsides are AI pathing is a little weak. You can order a truck to go across the map just to find it got stuck on a fence post, or for some reason just stopped halfway there.

Missions are fun, not in any order, some are stealth, some are more capture the point style, but the latter wears out easily since its capture the first, second and third line of defence but the 3rd line of defence is normally always guarded by arty and heavy tank guns, meaning its a slog every time to get to the end, sending units into the grinder. 

Basically never send infrantry in without support, and never send armor in without support, or it will be pretty easily killed, since most soldiers have AT grenades. Repairing vehicles for use is a great mechanic to have in a game, playing as Russia for example you can build up an armor devision by fixing all the broken down German tanks you find still servicable

It looked like the WW2 game of my dreams! Instead, the controls were overly complicated and the one tutorial mission was hidden under bonus missions and the control tips went away way too fast. It was just a regular mission on which they slapped some text over to quickly tell you controls. Also, the in game tutorial videos won't even load, which is a problem others had on the discussion forums, leading me to have to find them on YouTube. Between watching the videos and testing stuff in game, it'll take me hours to actually learn how to play. By then, I'll be out of the refund period without having actually played the game whilst knowing the controls to see if I like it!

WW2 Strategy game that allows you to command and direct control a large variety of interesting units. (yes, DIRECT CONTROL)

Singleplayer missions aren't very interesting, more of a tutorial and a showcase of the units, rather than a campaign. This game shines in multiplayer PvP, or against bots with friends.

You do not receive the ability to use bots in the base game, you must purchase the Airborne DLC in order to use them. Fortunately, you don't need to have the DLC to play games with bots in them, it is only needed to host matches with bots, which is useful if you are short on cash and a friend already has the DLC.

its a little hard to get into if you haven't played the first game i assume. The menu doesn't make much sense. Campaign just throws you into something unknown. Like you cant just start from new you have to press continue? even though its your first time.

the tutorial is a little lackluster. But i have an easy time learning mechanics of games quickly so it weren't really an issue.

if you buy it on sale you make a great purchase. Now tbh. it feels a little unpolished in especially the main menu and when selecting ""missions"".


But when you do get access to skirmishes you can have hours of fun. 

pros.
lots of units
good graphics
lots of features
somewhat realistic battles

cons.
unpolished main menu
a little frustrating to find stuff in the menu

59,53463216,english,"I can go on for hours why I love this game, first of all its a WW2 strategy game, which in of itself makes it perfect, you can play as the USA, UK, USSR, Germany, Japan, or the DLC faction (another Germany), and the differences for each faction shines bright in the game, especially with the faction specific special units that cost medals (10 medals per game in vanilla), and the huge workshop with way more mods to be found, the game is perfect for WW2 and Strategy lovers out there. Controlling your units puts you straight into the combat (not a first person perspective but you can manually shoot a selected soldier or vehicle) and commanding a huge group of soldiers and tanks is great fun. But its not without its downsides.

The Ai in the game can be buggy and sometimes just freezes and stops spawning things for awhile, but other times it runs fine (some mods fix this issue, but some make it worse so I wont touch too much on this) and another problem is that you need to learn what each unit is in order to use it proper, but this can be either researched on the internet or from trial and error, and you cant have to many mods enabled at the same time, but most times the pros outweigh the cons, I have great fun in this game and I'm sure many others do too, and I felt I needed to express some downsides to the game before touching on it deeper.

This game is great fun, with some friends or online players you can turn the game into serious competitive plays, or stupid fun or even messing around, there was this one time where me and a friend of mine built ""The great wall"", made entirely of sandbags, we set the score to the max with no timer so the game lasts as long as it could, and tried our best to hold it against the Germans, us being the Americans, we threw everything we had to keep the wall up, repairing damages and constantly restocking troops, armour, guns, etc, we had a blast, with friends the game can change so much, you can get a lot of laughs out of it, after ""The great wall"" was finished we kept joking that America was completely ""out of half-tracks and ranger squads"" as we used so many during the fight to keep the wall up, I loved that match and plan on making more stupid challenges like that in the future, while also playing the game normally time to time, to get the original experience again, I recommend this game not just for fun gameplay elements, graphics, and the fact its a WW2 strategy game, but for the funny, abnormal, and weird experiences it can offer, especially with friends at your side.",1562213280,1562213280,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198308776237,80,9,9058,0,6275,1598938080,,

Hard game aswell since the AI will certainly kick your ass the first skirmishes. I highly suggest finding some good workshop mods since that's what Assault Squad 2 really brings out I must say.

I myself havent played much on the multiplayer side of things but each and every battle needs to be planned out, angle of your tank, range of the shot, HE shell dispersion amongs enemy soldiers. DETRACKING TANK THREADS... It is a nightmare and truly a different take on more arcadeish games like Company of Heroes, which I aswell liked but Men of War clunky but flexible gameplay really put a spin on things.

Excelent strategy option for those that are fans of WW2, incredibly fun and challeging when played with friends, requiring organization and a lot of thinking from all to find and pplay the best tactics. Campaign missions may take hours on harder levels, which will require effort and patient, but if accomplished, it will have been fun and even rewarding. 

[h1]Superior than other WW2 startegy games in my opinion[/h1]. Missions are well built and fun, DLC brings more missions for an affordable price. 

Multiplayer can also be fun if played with friends and players willing to put some effort in it. It may be very repetitive though, shifting the player towards the campaign missions as well as mods ([b]Another extra for the game, mods normally work well, and there is a fairly large number of them on Steam[/b]).

Loading screens may take a little too long, and the habilty of joining a match after it was already started, it's not present, which is a big negative point. [u] If your connection drops and you want to join your friends again, you will have to re-start the match.[/u]

Pros: 
A fun RTS where you can fight other players for hours.
Very interactive with stratagies, land mines, baracades, artileries and more.
Enjoyable Editor if you're bored and like to mess around or to test units.

Cons:
Not alot of updates to fix already known bugs.
Can not handle a crap ton of mods. (lol)

It's much more tactical than CoH, and each soldier has his own inventory, a name, and they can be placed individually behind any sort of cover. In CoH the land formation counts for nothing, as the enemy can shoot right through it, however, in MoW that's not so.

Men of War feels more like chess, while Company of Heroes feels like checkers. Both're very fun, but have different levels of depth.

Men of War, especially the Valour and Robz mods, are so incredibly enjoyable, they add even more layers to the vanilla counterpart.

Yes, this is basically what happens in Hearts of Iron IV when you turn off historical focuses and let the AI run amok. Except, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is the RTS version of the battles that happened in the field. Of course, those battles are not from the campaign mode, but the skirmish mode.

Compared to other similar WW2 RTS games, people might notice that Men of War: Assault Squad 2 might have clunkier and more unstable engine and maybe dated graphics. But, not all WW2 RTS lets you to take [i]direct control[/i] of your individual units from tanks, infantry, to artillery. Not trusting the AI to handle where the tank would stay and shoot from? Press E to move, aim, and shoot with the tank by yourself.

Also, bonus points for the volume of sound effects. If you're not careful, you might violate your ears because you forgot to lower the volume when the epic artillery duel between the 122mm Soviet guns and the American ""Long Tom"" starts, or a swarm of Japanese infantry charges on a fortified German position.

Not satisfied with the limited nations roster and some mechanics of the game? There's lots of mods in the Steam Workshop. The mod I'm using adds many nations and equipment to the existing nations' roster. Now you can recreate the British Invasion of France in 1940, the Second Hungarian-Romanian War of 1942, or the Chinese Invasion of Poland in 1939!

Not to mention the mission editor bundled with the game. Not satisfied by the missions and maps provided by the game or the mods? Make your own! Create your own maps, add building, place victory points and other objects, and just maybe, add those new objects and weapons added by mods for the editor!

Examples of this include the map Canyon where there is a centre to contest as well as the side chokepoints to battle through for the goal of winning. 

Men of War AS2 also has a good range of modes, including Assault Zones and Combat - Assault Zones is like domination where you contest particular flag points, combat is the destruction of enemy units to a particular score. 

I really enjoy the vehicle mechanics although I think that they are lacking airforce capabilities to bring out a full, WW2 experience.

The satisfactory components that are missing are:
Intelligent AI - The AI you command can do stupid shit resulting in their deaths like standing up to go somewhere instead of crawling and running into the open when you select a grenade target instead of just throwing it. 

GLITCHES: There are a number of glitches I have encountered including the inability to activate a mod (literally in the options you can, it just wont work) and sometimes the game randomly crashes saying ""File will be executed"" or something like that.

But it does have some bugs and glitches, but said bugs and glitches are sometimes very funny, like when you ram a goliath under a tank, especially a modded tank, because some mods dont have the correct weight on tanks, then detonate it, the tank will usually go to space, and me and my friends have had a good laugh with that, but there still are some cons, like the direct control, which could be better, especially with infantry, you can always tell if your friend is controlling a soldier because they will most of the time be moonwalking or walking sideways. Then there are the missions, singleplayer and skirmish, the tank defense mission and the normal defense missions are the best i would say, because i just like defending, but for every nation, they are pretty much the same, the only differences are the map design, and the units, but the goal and the point is the same. The price is also a bit much but this game goes on sale often, so i would recommend this game, but a lot of people dont like having random people in their games, but i usually dont have a problem with this because i only play with my friend (soon to be friends).

79,47289145,english,"I don't think I've ever played a game with so many possibilities as this underrated masterpiece of a strategy game. The mods alone allow it to be a hundred games in one: Star Wars, Warhammer 40k, The Cold War, modern combat, and so many more. One of the best features is the ability to revert to a previous save, which has made SO many mods available.

Now, I'm not a very avid multiplayer player of this game. When the game, on launch, gives you the ""editor"" option, it is NOT just a normal editor. There, you can actually play out battles, and in a format that's more or less the normal game!

Just a few tips for the editor: 
Numpad 0-9 is to switch YOUR team
F1=Gameplay Mode
F2=Editting mode
F3=Somewhere in between
On the menu on the left, below the part where you spawn things, there's a menu. It allows you to do such things as switch movement and firing modes, but MOST IMPORTANTLY it allows you to change the team of a unit you have selected.
(if you switch the team of a vehicle with the crew in it, the crew will bail and be the wrong team. God I hate when I forget that!)

Mods I would suggest are: Rising Sun, GSM Fields of Honor, Robz Realism, Red Rising, UMW 40kand valour. Some are admittedly better than others, but nothing is perfect.

Aircraft in the game are.. Well they suck. It's a shame saying it, but they don't even exist in most missions. There is a good, good reason for that. However, some mission mods actually do let air support actually work!

Basically, buy this game. If you want to use the editor, get good at it. It won't be much fun until you get the basics, but after that it's unrivaled.",1543920565,1559343678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198012785852,177,18,125306,0,98427,1594773072,,

  The base single-player missions in the game while not boring, are definitely a bit repetitive- 

so some will find find that the game has more to offer in the multiplayer and editor. 

 Whilst multiplayer is very rewarding experience with it's vast array of maps and mods, it can 

be annoying at times; Unbalanced teams, players with poor connection, AI bugs to name a 

few- but don't let this deter you as it's still a lot of fun! The GEM level editor is a powerful (And 

fun) tool that is a perfect edition to the base game that allows for a near endless amount of 

tinkering, map making and scripting. The workshop is filled with all kinds of mods such as: 

Realism, unit skins, new vehicles, missions, ect. (you can find even more on Mod db).

This is one of the best examples of a great modding community that has a lot of creativity and potential for good mods. I happen to play this game because of a niche star wars mod, ""Galaxy at war"" which is probably my only reason that I'm playing it in the first place. 
By all means buy it just because it's got good mods. 

I'm just mad that they had the audacity to call this a completely new game. There is generally nothing changed from the last game besides making it more 'pretty.' During the first few months that Assault Squad 2 was out there was a ton of frame drops and stuttering and other performance issues that made it unplayable. It really isn't as tactical of a game that I would like it to be, infantry is just way too unbalanced. You can't really get a squad around on open ground without them being killed. 

Word of Advice: Unless you need the DLC for a certain requirement for a mod, do not buy them. It's a waste of money for nothing, all they do is give you a mission and features that should have been in during launch.

This is about engagements in a limited space, house-to-house fighting and ability to make a fast tactical decision. You have to choose the  right troops, vehicles and guns as the attacker or defender. Then you have to coordinate your different troops and guns into a battle force that has a chance of winning. 

In this game, 10 soldiers with rifles can die to a single soldier who ambushes them with a fast SMG. Give a longer range and two riflemen can wipe out a squad of SMG soldiers. You get the point.

2. Vanilla is badly balanced while interesting mods suck on this engine
3. Lack of communication about future related releases - just ad spam about early access products which never took off 
4. Lobby/game mechanics too basic - what if I want to ban some hosts? No such option - have to remember all the names of trolls, etc. No option to surrender in game. Have to be 1 out 3 remaining and still watch the things to happen (that's 20 minutes of life)

So the game is set in the ww2 timeperk wich is lovely if it wasnt for that damn russian conscipts that die so fast but are so damn cheap.

Playing this game is great but not if ur using a Potato pc D:

Altho the main game is very fun there are alot of mods that make it even better wich is why i give this game such a high ranking simply because of the community more like it.
the graphics arnt that great but the gameplay IS.

The best thing i can say about this game is that you can actuelly control the units in first persone if you like altho this is fun i dont recommand it because well simply said you dont have the map view anymore.

So while ur at it why not pick up this game in a sale or just pay the full price i would say its worth the mony.

If you like difficult, tense RTS style battles where you can command a squad of units, and slowly gain more land and man power over the course of the battle, MOWAS 2 has you covered. But, if you enjoy spawning hundreds or thousands of units and watching them fight, this game is also capable that.

PRO'S
1.) the game is a decent game, but it gets boring fast (in my opinion.)
2.) has an amazing modding community which makes amazing mods that seriously enhance the gaming experience.
3.) Interesting control scheme which, once accustomed to, makes you 
4.) AI is quite difficult on some of the harder AI levels.
5.) Ability to increase the MP and CP cap is quite flexible and allows for very interesting battles
6:) very indepth in a good way. Able to direct control individual units 
7:) Basic inventory management (if you want to be reallllly inventory clean) but it isn't a necessity
8:) Visuals are okay, not completely terrible but it suits the game well.

Neutral 
Combat could be decent at times although there are alot of problems with AI (see below)
Ai pathing on some maps are very...broken. Some maps have slopes that should be passable and is accepted by the automatic pathing system, so units get stuck until direct controlled away from that specific area. (easy fix, spam mortars and fill the area XD )
Occasionally units ignore commands but its usually easily rectified by getting into the habit of spam clicking to ensure they don't ignore the commands
CON'S
1:) Just before we start with the negatives, the ai. It doesn't come with the game. To be able to have AI, for some reason the developers felt it reasonable to have to buy the airborne DLC just to be able to access the AI. The game should have AI already built in, not have it as a DLC. I feel like that is a seriously unfair money grab. In my opinion
2.) Seriously unstable. I like to play with bots when i play with my mate and we just generally try and have fun. The bots are certainly interesting but we'll cover that next point. Game frequently crashes for unknown reasons. Game frequently crashes for stupid reasons. Usually crashes because the programme is unable to create a dump file for certain files.
3.) AI Bots just spams things. Unfortunately for the game, the AI bots are thick as pigsh*t. The way the AI attempts to beat you is by spamming as many troops as it can at you hoping to do the Russian victory of overpowering with numbers.
4.) AI Bots sometimes breaks itself. Sometimes the AI just breaks, nothing spawns in or is unable to spawn anything in which means you have to go through the effort of going back to the menu and reloading the game, hoping that the AI doesn't break again.
5:) Learning curve is VERY steep at the start, especially when you have no one who is able to teach you how to play 
6:) the multiplayer. If you are looking for a multiplayer game that you play with randoms, i dont think this game is for you, if im being honest. Whenever i tried to join a multiplayer game i just get kicked. I just gave up with randoms completely and stuck to playing chill games with my mate.
7:) the editor seems complicated to use (or atleast i cant work out how to use it) i've watched youtube clips, read up on wikipedias and still cant work it out.
8:) lets cover the campaign, every countries set of missions is literally a reskin of the exact same missions. It seems the developers ran out of ideas for each campaign after completing the USA campaign. Would be nice for differentiating missions from eachother to show off what each faction could do. 
9:) I believe that this game is entirely centred around the multiplayer aspect only. It seems a lack of attention was paid to the the AI controlled bots. 
I seriously love this game but it seems to be waning fast. If you want to make your Bots a little smarter then i'd recommend getting the robz realism mod and getting the RobZ AI Fix, the game itself is beautiful in the way the battles are portrayed. i think i will continue playing just not as often as i used to",1543245031,1552088501,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False,76561198198045666,111,53,15183,0,9491,1592865643,,

For those of you wizzing through the comment session here are the brief good/bads of the game and come things to note.

The good:
Realistic combat and physics
Equipment and vehicles are historically acurate
Multiple types of game modes
Tons of unique mods to use!

The bad:
Toxic and unforgiving community.
Texture on some vehicles and soldiers can be pretty bad.

Things to note:
If you enjoy taking you time in order to think and act out your tactics then you're gonna be in for a rough ride, success in this game relies on quick thinking and immediate action.
Even with a tutorial the controls are hard to get used to, but with time you should be able to use and understand all of the controls.
You should have some friends to play this game with...

So MOWAS is a great game and my favourite ww2 RTS game. That being said MOWAS 2 has one serious issue, the community. Holy hell, in all the games I have played the verbal abuse you get from players is vast and un-ending. When My brother and I bought the game, we completed all the campaign missions before moving on to multiplayer and we were pretty pumped to be playing with the community. However it didn't turn out well, people would kick us as soon as we joined and even if we joined and managed to stay in we would eventually be kicked later in the game. AND if somehow we weren't kicked in the middle of the game, the other players would spend more time insulting each other than actually playing the game. Some people just leave the game if it isn't going exactly their way. I'm not saying every player is bad, i'd say 1/10 game you can come across a polite group of players who can respect each other and enjoy the game. My brother and I gave up in the community and just stuck to private 1v1s and skirmishes, eventually we got a couple other friends to get the game and we enjoyed MOWAS 2 even more. All in all MOWAS 2 is an incredible RTS that's inhibited my it's testosterone filled, homophobic, racist and sexist community, best played with a friend.

32,49234230,english,"Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a slightly updated version of the first game. Most of its unique features, such as multiplayer ai or soldier veterancy, are locked behind dlc. The vanilla content should keep you and your buddies entertained for some time. However, the real reason I recommend this are the mods.

This game has GREAT mods. Mods that change the game completely (UWM40k, Cold War), games that make it more realistic (Robz, Great War) or mods that end an overwhelming supply of missions, scenarios and multiplayer maps (Valour). 

Assume direct control! In this RTS you can control a unit manually, aiming, deploying or driving as you would in an FPS. You can be flying an A-10, destroying a Russian armoured column. Charging with the Death Korps of Krieg infantry.  Aiming French howitzers and heavy mortars of the Great War. The versatility of this game creates its own genre of RTS dream fulfillment. 

All this being said, the game in its vanilla state is hard to recommend. My biggest problem is that the soldiers in this game also have no fear of death or morale.

There is no explanation for what the modes are so you have to figure out for yourself or google it and on certain maps there is cover that you cant place your troops behind, usually when you have a squad selected you can see the positions they would take when hover over a cover like a broken tank, sandbags or a building but some buildings/walls dont give you this option even though it would be game changing if you could get troops behind that one spot.

The default single player campaign difficulty is set to easy, which is great for learning, but ends up being too easy. After that, it goes way down hill. German campaign is nearly impossible. The enemy just sends waves of units at you as if they are not effected by you taking thier points. That's okay, I like a challenge. Learned that setting up a good defensive line after taking some points is key.  However, the enemy can take you out with one hit while they remain untouchable. There is a armor penetration system based on caliber of shell and angle of impact. This would be great if they allowed you to build the correct AT cannons while they can role out top tier tanks. Otherwise, hope you can get a lucky shot off before the one-shot your AT units. Apparently Sherman Tanks are invincible, but German Veteran Tigers are gone in one hit.  Historically, that's bullsh*t. But whatever. Got to up the difficulty somehow , I guess.

66,48849086,english,"I had this game for maybe 9 months before I gave it a solid go. The first time I tried the game, right after buying it, I wasn't too impressed. The visuals were really good, along with the soundtrack for the game - but I didn't spend a lot of time really delving into the game. So just recently I gave the game another try and after learning the the game some, it has turned out to be quite fun. One suggestion I would have for the developers is to add a tutorial with more detail. The introduction mission just throws you right into the action, which is all well and good - but on my first try, and being new to this specific type of game, I was left a little confused on where to go.

I really started gaining an appreciation of the game with the USA mission 'Bastogne' - you start with a small squad and that was the most helpful in really learning the in-s and out-s of this game. You can just throw units at the enemy, like the intro mission almost prompts you to do, but with some patience and application of a bit of strategy and tactical thought - you can turn a small squad into cinema-esqe heros! An introduction mission similar to that would go a long way with showing the depth of the game for new players. Blizzard was good with this in Starcraft and Warcraft; starting with basic units and putting the player in a position where the player needs to use all of the resources at the disposal of the small units to be successful/efficient. 

That being said - a new player might even want to give Bastogne a try to get a good feel for micro-managing their troops. Also a new player would really benefit from a controls based tutorial - I didn't realize for three missions that I could ""slow"" the game. This makes a dramatic difference. Perhaps it's just because the loading screens go by so quick on my PC that I don't get a chance to read them. The game performs and loads well, no crashes either.

One thing is could use however, is some refinement on issuing commands while the game is paused. I found it to be a bit buggy and either didn't issue orders properly when jumping from unit to unit, or at least it doesn't update the UI objects, like the mouse cursor and icons to confirm the order was accepted by the unit. The ability to slow the clock; however, does mitigate this pretty well.

The most annoying thing about the game is the in-ability to constrain the mouse cursor to a single monitor on a dual monitor system. There are some apps to 'fix' this, but it really should be an option in a modern game. 

In any event, this is a fantastic squad/RTS/tactical strategy game. If you play and really try to minimize your team's casualties, the battles can take some time - I find that to be a positive aspect as it allows for a high replayability level. I would highly recommend it for fans of squad-based/RTS games, especially for the price. Think of it as a mix between X-Com/Old Fallout/Baldur's Gate style games (due to the ability and almost necessity to micro-manage) and RTS like command and conquer or Total War.",1549639769,1549639959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042462865,77,2,2643,0,2283,1549943323,,

This game is certainly fun, and when you're feeling ambitious enough to try, it can be remarkably challenging. However, it is not what you should seek if you are pursuing anything more than a cookie-cutter tactical shooter.

The game boasts just over 50 missions, 10 for each faction of Germany, Japan, USA, UK, and Soviet Union. What it doesn't tell you is that each of the ten are identical. The first mission for the USA is identical in tactics and layout as the first mission for Japan. Move to X outpost, kill Y enemies, etc. The only change is the terrain and names of the units.

I have poured a fair amount of hours into the game; perhaps too many to complain that it's too simple, it's too repetitive, or it's too generic. But that's the honest part. The good news is, if you like tactical squad based shooters in the third person, this is a fun, cheap game that can scratch that itch...

Russia as my country 
Train lots of infantry
Rush middle of map 
Lose all troops to 3 Panzers
Build AT squads 
Rush middle again and scare the shit out of the enemy tanks 
Loose 4 squads to destroy 1 tank 
Realise your Russian 
Build tons of tanks 
Activate “for the motherland” (literally spawns 10 squads of 9 AI controlled infantry to rush a sector)
Blast Russian national anthem through your speakers and move your 30 tanks to the front line
Result 
Your loss: 29 out of 30 tanks, all but 1 squad of infantry 
Enemy loss: 4 tanks 3 mg squads and middle objective 

Stalin looks calmly at his generals (in Russian accent)

Before anyone cries river or condemns me of heresy, let me explain why. Men of War is an RTS simulation taking the simulation part extremely seriously. There is so much micro possible you wouldn't even imagine that it could exist in an RTS game. Tank plating efficiency for example is actually calculated by the factual plating at the hit zone and the degree of the hit, meaning that there can be grazing shots as well as cases where shells bounce off and then proceed to something entirely different. Maps have destructible elements on so many levels and it is possible to customise almost every single unit as well as loot AND immediately use any and all enemy equipment which wasn't destroyed. Including weapons, ammo, grenades, unmanned vehicles and any and all other support equipment.

This makes the game depths absolutely fantastic.

I spent a great deal of time in the editor of this game, putting modded assets and vannila assets together in little custom battles.

But then I found the mods, the things that make this game 'better.'. And instead of finding great ways to enhance my experience, I was just met with incompatable files, crashing from said incompatible files, and a lack of any decent game mode that lets you fight the AI, a VITAL part of playing for a game like this. Unlike Arma, there is little to no way to change this and the only way to utilize mods to their fullest is to play with OTHER people, and the editor mode while existant, is very complicated for people who just want to play a scenario or a skirmish against the AI.

Despite the amount of mods out there  to use in this game, the lack of a vs Ai mode and the constant issues of mods being incompatible with one another has just ruined the entire experience for me. This game is NOT worth it unless you have a bunch of pals who play this game.

Almost every online lobby (of which there are few) is hosted by a group of friends who tilt the odds in their favor, to make sure they can not possibly lose. They'll pick an unfair map, they'll screw with the game settings, heck some will even kick one or two of your teammembers once the game starts to ensure that they have a tactical edge on you. Basically, this results in four fifths of all games being pubstomps. I suppose their simple minds find ""fun"" in this. A pity.

Hosting your own game is a solution, but you'll be stuck waiting for players more than you will actually [i]play[/i]. Why? Because everyone's in the previously mentioned pubstomp lobbies, because most don't know any better. The few games that aren't totally teamstacked, are reasonably enjoyable. But why should a game only be fun a quarter of the time, instead of always?

While the base game runs fine, due to the 32 bit nature of the ancient engine, the popular mod RobZ (which adds a lot of units, and makes the game feel more realistic) has a tendency to crash. When it doesn't, it makes for a thrilling experience. Alas, between the crashes and the stacked teams, not enough of a redeeming factor to rejuvinate MOWAS 2 in 2018.

76,47567287,english,"Great game! If you’re a fan of RTS games - especially World War 2 games - then this is a must buy. Unlike a lot of other strategy games, where sometimes it feels rushed, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 lets you plan your next attack, move up your front lines (Whilst still holding off the enemy) and forces you to try out new tactics.

This could be clearing out enemy forces; street by street. Digging in and entrenching yourself in captured foxholes or trenches, overwhelming the opposing side with a large tank force or bombarding them with mortars to make room for your infantry.

The use of mechanics, medics, AT units and Flamethrowers units are key, as you will have repair tanks and other support vehicles, steal enemy tanks and use their own armour against them. Clear dense, wooded areas, revive wounded men (As all units come with a cost) and prepare for surprise tank attacks.

Attacks can be costly, so it’s always good to hunker down after capturing strategic points, whilst you build up for the next push.

One of the key aspects of this game is also taking direct control of your units - any unit! So rather than just pointing and clicking, the game allows you to get stuck into the battle - rather than just observing.",1544961710,1544961710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197972707530,97,2,1142,0,922,1588960730,,

78,47549134,english,"To be honest. It is a horrible mess.

I like the level of detail and the intensive micro management, the game has to offer. But is full of freakish bug, questionable pathfinding, stupid AI (when it is your units of course) and much more.

Want to jump over a wall? Forget it. Your soldiers are too dumb to accept the order. They want to walk around it and get shraddered by projectiles the enemy has to offer.

Want to refuel a tank? Go to hell. No fuel canisters under ""Use item"", no chance to refuel the stuff again.

Want to throw grenades? Are you stupid? Instead of being able to throw a grenade into a window or a tank (WITHOUT standing right in front of it), your soldier is begging for being shot as he has to run into the house via door instead of the window. These soldiers are stupid grunts and they let you know that.

They always do and walk around not like you have ordered it. They suddenly throw nades without you stating it, they walk, when they should run. They stay, when they should lay on the ground. They lay on the ground, when they should run away.  These soldiers are more stupid than any drone.

The games balance is good but as soon as you go above medium, it screws you. You can think of hard as something, were every unit has less HP and stuff and makes it difficult by giving you little time to do micro mgmt. No. The game decides to make the AI unfairly strong: They got more HP than you, they insta kill anything you put infront of it,  they have aiming across the whole map. Go. To. Hell.

I have over 400 hours clocked into this game and I'm literally still addicted. The game never gets boring, you're always learning new strategies and fighting skilled opponents in multiplayer. Not only that, but if the game does get boring for you, there are hundreds of well made, detailed, and polished mods on the workshop such as red rising, cold war mod, BITFA, robz realism, etc.. The editior is fun to fuck around in, whether it's making a custom battle, making your own map, or just trying to master some new infintry/armour skills there is always something to do. I don't see this game getting old to me any time soon.

The two games are quite different though and I don't think it's fair to do a like-for-like comparrison. I would say Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is more of a simulation experience.

Steam workshop is a great addition for mods but only a handful of them are worth considering. Most of the mods add additional units/teams, lower kill times (which are already short) and more unit effects (weapon jamming etc) but I would not consider them mandatory.

It's worth noting that I haven't tried any of the other games in the Men of War franchise but I didn't feel I needed to. The game looks good and runs (mostly) well on a moderate system with only occasional frame drops. I've mostly just played against a friend but recently we have ventured into the online scene and aren't looking back.

Yes its much like the first MOWAS in terms of units. BUT its in BETA so not everything is in the game, But there are a lot of new engine improvements that makes the game look amazing in terms of graphics, i have not experience any lag like the first men of war had, there are a few new game modes like day of victory in which you capture the flag that is located in the middle, extreme assault zones which is just a bigger assault zones.

 I hear a lot of people complaning that its the same game, well in terms of units there isnt a lot you can add that was in world war 2, it isnt like call of duty were you can add a few more weapons, this game is based on world war 2, i do wish they could add everything from the German soldiers mod to MOWAS 2 because that had a lot of great units, and its only 21€ its not a 59.99€ release. if you arent sure that you like what you see right now, then dont buy it, wait until its complete, and remember its in beta a lot of things can still change...",1394385103,1543052278,True,11,0,0.559768795967102051,0,True,False,False,76561198029024684,229,4,9856,0,8751,1575681146,,

If you can get past the difficult controls and sometimes absolutely useless inconsistant AI, then you'll find an RTS with good pacing, lots of variables and replayability (based off the fact that it's kind of a sandbox RTS), intense and fun moments and realism. There's a lot of attention to detail in this game, the buildings being almost all destructable is incredible, and being able to burn bushes and having it spread to houses or tanks etc is very cool. The base system for armor penetration and unit inventory in general is more complex than most RTS's I've played. There can be a frustrating learning curve when figuring out how to deal with strategies, specific units, and the complicated direct control sequences you must sometimes perform to plant down an artillery unit, rotate it, aim it etc. It's a hardcore experience where you can lose games within a few mistakes, or even just a lackluster beginning. I think the fact that the game has some features in it that are DLC but should be in the base game is kind of whatever, since it was cheap enough to warrant buying them.

Jokes aside, the Men of war series is a “hardcore” RTS, where mistakes are unforgiven and easy to make. The campaign is fun bud the multiplayer is the core of the game, it takes time and patience to start enjoying it. 
At first, you will hate this game to the guts and chimp out watching your troops being decimated within a split of a second, bud once you learn how the game works, it turns in to a challenging and satisfactory experience that only this series has to offer.
The game is all about making the most out from what you have, spending resources wisely and spreading your units with purpose. 
If you just brought it, I highly recommend that you go look for the “strat29” channel on Youtube before putting this game aside. It has some completive matches that will teach you a lot, and tutorials to get you started. 
It has many good mods on the workshop, and a decent amount of people playing online. 
The main problem of this game is that the players host the MP matches, and the HOST has way too much power, he can terminated the match midgame and kick whoever he wants with no repercussions even on rated games, and that will ruin a huge chunk of the matches you will play, so consider playing with friends and hosting the matches yourself so that wont happen, and if you do host, please dont become one of those guys...

31,45727543,english,"I do recommend the game, but under certain circumstances. 

MOWAS2 is one of those games that falls along the lines of 'just playable enough'. It's biggest strength is it's engine's map editor and mod compatibility. MOWAS2 is like a badass war diorama where it's just fun to play around with the weapons and test things out. But.... that's kinda where it ends as the coneventional SP gameplay is super wonky thanks to an interesting game mechanic. The ability to directly control and aim the weapons of units and vehicles is awesome, but I don't want to have to rely on it. Well... it kinda forces you to use it, often. As great as the engine and concept of MOWAS2 is.... the AI at work here is ABYSMALLY bad. Most definitely an afterthought in the game's development. You will often find yourself HAVING to take direct control of your units as the AI often doesn't understand your command. Vehicle pathfinding is horrible and again you will often find yourself having to take control of vehicles to move with the WSAD keys as the ai can only understand simple movement. And for a game which claims to be more realistic than WW2 games like Company of Heroes, you're gonna have to learn to deal with the fact that.... units often can't shoot down from an elevated angle. Even non-fixed units like bazooka troops. They can't aim down. I know, I know, it makes absolutely zero sense. Sometimes your infantry acts intelligently and indivudally, and sometimes it'll sit there as a grenade cooks right by their feet. Maybe you'll get lucky in one of the rare occurences the ai actually picks up an enemy grenade and lobs it back at them. Who knows.... All I know is the poor ai makes the micromanagement(this game is super micor heavy) damn near impossible. 
The ai is SO BAD that the skirmish ai, often doesn't even work. You'll start up a match with the ai often to realize 5 minutes in that it hasn't even spawned in a single unit. Like why even put it in the game if it doesn't even work properly? I believe there's mods to fix that but come on... the devs should've taken care of that themselves. As fucking cool as MOWAS2 and everything it's presenting is... I just can't let the devs slide like everyone else. The ai is almost non-existant which in an RTS game is no bueno. It really does hurt the experience.
At least the MP isn't so bad. The mp gameplay is satisfying and often brings out the best elements of the game's engine. In MP you're given command points which limit the amount of units you can control at any one time. This makes the gameplay more balanced and tactical and it makes the overall micromanagement more possible. And the realism elements which actually work in this game, are pretty cool. Cause even in MP, the maps are almost entirely destructible. Every building you see can be blown up and levelled. The physics at work are actually quite nice.
All in all I still love and (sorta?)recommend this game. Just know if you're looking for conventional RTS gameplay it won't be found here and it's often better to look at the SP as more of a sandbox experience than anything else. And you still gotta give them credit where credit is due. Not everything may work properly but MOWAS2 sure is one ambitious RTS game.",1541794840,1541794840,True,0,0,0.470085442066192627,0,True,False,False,76561198045611787,273,9,4990,0,3417,1565244607,,

This game is just the BEST, YES i really mean it. The Editor in this game helped me A LOT in spare time, Like creating a random map, making an objective, doing random stuff, and ect.
The game mechanic is focused on realism battle (For vehicle only, it doesn't have HP bar and you can one shot enemy tank just like real life) but for infantry it still using HP for game balancing. The AI aren't that smart tough tbh (my only complaint).

The multiplayer is not really that dead, you can play MP with Mod!

Mod? yes this game has many good mod like Map, Skin and Game Tweaking. And it still alive until NOW!

Sorry for my bad english, I really recommended this game. 9/10

Its been a while since I had fun with a RTS game. These days, RTS is less about strategy and more about quickly and furiously clicking like an epsorts match. MoW breaks that mould. Instead of using muscle memory and maximizing clicks per second, it requires you to carefully position troops, create chokepoints, sneak attacks, distractions and so on. Best of all, you can slow down the speed which allows you the time to actually play strategically rather than just furiously clicking a button.

The Single Player missions are pretty great as well. They is enough variation and complexity to keep things interesting.

The main downside for me was some excessive micromanagement in some aspects like reviving soldiers and restocking ammo. This can get tedious in a large battle where you have to find a medic and revive each guy who is about to die. I wish unit AI would do this on its own. Ammo resupply is also a chore. 

Still, I prefer it over whatever cheap click fest/ MOBA passes for RTS these days. It reminds of World in Conflict and Company of Heroes 1 which were both amazing.

The game is pretty unique game that isn't produced on a large scale like first person shooters.
I will talk and summarize a bit about what the game has to offer and what's it lacking.

PROS:
-Very Historically accurate with its units. 
-The large and Detailed maps can give very different gameplays in each session.
-The Campaign is very broad letting you play 5 diffrent factions which include germany,
japan, Soviet Union, America and Great Britain.
-The textures and dynamic changes are numerous, You are able to plow up almost anything from buildings to the DAMN ANNOYING BICYCLES BLOCKING YOUR JEEPS(ARG, bicycles vs Armoured vehicle; Bicycle wins).
-Losing the entire battle when you forgot your units at the back that you ordered to come but wher stuck on bicycles.
-The workshop is huge and it has many missions and units to add e.g. Want too play italy or france there are enough mods, even china is added.
-Multiplayer battles are nice and quick paced lasting from 15 minuts to 45 minutes. 
-The community isnt toxic and really try to help you learn(do not enter Multiplayer right after installing the game the it turns toxic)

CONS:
-Multiplayer is slowly dying out
-Updates and patches are getting very few lately
-New players have a very steep learning curve
-Hanze always gets ze flammenwerfer.
-NEVER LET HANZ GET ZE FLAMMENWERFER.

57,44548981,english,"Some RTS games are great. They makes you feel like a commander supervising its troops on the battlefield, but none of them equals MOW2 in terms of micro gestion of your units. Every single soldier, gun carriage or tank of your army has an inventory , an hp bar ( elements for tanks like war thunder) and are fully playable in third person. Infantry is gonna be the backbone of your assault, from the simplest conscrits only equipped with rifles and anti personnal grenades to the armored division of elite warriors , who can put sandbags on the battlefield, have multiple weapon, an anti-tank gear, smokes, sometimes molotovs, flamethrowers, everything controllable manually with the mouse and the direction pad by the player. This two-sided gameplay ( controlling units with orders like any rts game and manually taking control of a unit to make sure a job gets done perfectly) is the second strong point of MOW2. If you wanna have spectaculary wars, where armies align douzens of infantry units and vehicles,  artillerie pieces, ressuply trucks.... play this game. 
If you wanna have sneaky skyrmishes, where every single sodat counts, and only one or two tanks are present, every action being a breaking point in the game, each player ressources being scarce..... play this game.
I recommend playing with the multiplayer mode first with your steam friends ( together vs ia or one against the other) , it brings you a great source of enjoyment while not being to strict for a new player. I haven't played enough of the campaign to say anything about it. 
MOW2 is in my opinion the best RTS i've ever had ( i played Starcraft, warcraft, age of empire 2, warhammer 40k dawn of war, company of heroes, command and conquer generals, wargame). Maybe you want to wait for the steam sold though, this game being pretty pricey for low budgets ( 36 euros with all dlc , summer 2018) but with -75% everyone should jump on it.

Italy, Hungary, Romania, France, Finland, China, the list of possibilities goes on. I want to see more diversity in this game. The only way to play any of the other countries that participated in the conflict is with mods, and mods break up the community into smaller pockets that don't play with each other. This causes a decline in players. Lately my average wait time for a 3v3 multiplayer lobby to fill up is about 20 minutes. 

Another issue is the toxicity in the community, because this game is so cheap on G2A and other sites, people have no problem making smurf accounts, and using them to stomp new players. New players get kicked constantly, as some people refuse to play with them on their team. So you have a highly competitve and exclusive environment that drives away new players and keeps the community from growing.

+ Good RTS gamplay
+ Good amount of mods to keep you busy for a while
+ Has an editor (though not very intuitive, don't expect to make simple missions without watching tutorials)
+ Nice graphics
+ Really Good tank battles and strategy
+ Good amount of units in each faction
+ Nice mechanics

[b]CONS[/b]
- Abysmal AI for units (grenade in trench? let's jump out in machine gun fire!) made me rage quit
- Horrible copy paste campaign (each campaign for each faction is the basically the same, just different units)
- Have to pay DLC for bots in skirmish (total no no for RTS games)
- Really bad net code and not many people on multiplayer as a result
- Multiplayer isn't balanced very well (some units you should never buy)
- Bad fog of war

[b]NOTES[/b]
The game at it's core is really fun to play and has good strategy but it's really hard to enjoy with the terrible AI, though multiplayer isn't great either since servers are few and far in between and crashes a lot.

The fact that you have to pay DLC for bots in an RTS game is an absolute no no and isn't something I would like to see in the future whatever the price may be, with all this in mind I can not recommend this game to any RTS fan.

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]
Good game but plagued with horrible AI.

-the grapchis are still like in the original Men of War, basically pure shi.t. They dont want to spend a single penny on upgrading the graphics.

-they dont implement the improvements from the Call to Arms tittle.

-the matches are very long and in the middle of an online match, most times the losers leave in the middle of it, so you cannot rank up and unlock new units (the unlocking system is pure bul.lshi.t BTW), and enjoy the freaking game becasue they are rage quitting kidos.

- lots of cash grab DLCs that are shi.t that could be freely added to the Multiplayer. Even with the deluxe edition you still dont have a single DLC becasue the devs suck as.s. They are cash grabber thiefs that dont care shi.t about the Men of War series and only want more and more money from useless expansions. They also closed the servers of the original AS so you have to buy the AS2 for playing online yes or yes so that they gain more money.

-I also want to say how junky and buggy the unit controls are. You order your squad to move their fat asses and only 1 moves, the rest dont do nothing. It feels the opposite of responsive, being very rage inducing at times. GG devs. You clearly showed us you only want the money. DAYZ devs style hahaHahAHaHahha

-The only new thing compared to the AS 1 is the new UNITS managment system, which doesnt make the cash grab game worth it.

It could have been a better game, specially if the devs wouldnt be morons that only want money and dont play their own game for see the proms it has (oh wait, they know but why would they fix it if they only want money ;) ? A lost hope for many MoW fans.

21st of August 2018 update:
Fuck you devs. Seriously ??? Why do you fucking block AI in matches behind a 10 euros DLC. You bunch of greedy fucks. I hope you fucking burn in hell. It was not enough with this tittle itself instead of updating your game, you even closed the game for the first MoW AS 1. I am not going to give you 10 euros just to play with AI in my matches.

While difficult, it is definitely a strategy game that requires a tactical use of cover, and the supporting fire from the right units.

For a $30 game, I still really wish that this game had a hands on tutorial where the developers took you through a test mission.  This game has many tutorials and many small features that are easy to forget if you don't take hours just put toward LEARNING the controls as the tutorial menus are off of the main menu.

All in all, I have reservations about this game due to the learn it yourself tutorial videos, but I have no doubt that when I find the time between work to actually sit down and learn all of the videos, I will have money well spent.

42,43668828,english,"Two things first:
1) This isn't a strategy game. This is a tactical game.
2) If you don't like games where you can run out of ammunition and fuel, don't bother buying this. 

Pros:
+ Looks very good if you have a decent computer. 
+ The AI are never perfect in games like this, but this is by far the best I've encountered
+ In some of the maps you're pretty much forced to take the objective by storming the MG/artillery-nest, Hill 262- or Pointe-de-Hoc style. Even though you really care for your men, the mission comes first. 
+ Some really nice details, like the armor-placement on the MBTs. Don't try to hit the enemy tanks in the front, unless you bring some high caliber anti-tank guns.
+ The unique units each of the major powers possess' brings a lot of fun to the table.
+ You can't mass tanks and expect to roll over the enemy. Anti-tank guns will destroy your force. During urban battles the enemy infantry will use Woolworth grenades etc and take them out.
+ War is hell. At the start of the urban battles, you'll see a lovely small town. 15 minutes into the battle, and most of the buildings are either damaged or completely destroyed. PS: Use the buildings yourself, but don't put entire platoons inside. 
+ Everything that's left on the field, you can use. Fuel, repairkits, bandages, explosives, sand bags etc. If the enemy abandons a MG, take it. You can even repair enemy MBTs and use them yourself. 

Cons:
- Lost a soldier to artillery-fire, which normally would have removed his DNA from the face of the earth? Don't worry, a medic will patch him up in no time. 
- Can be a bit frustrating, especially when you try to control two-three advances at the same time. The computer always places the anti-tank guns etc at perfect spots. 
- Maybe some of the unique units are a bit overpowered? Especially the japanese artillery.

43,43668264,english,"Tl;dr: Recommended for people who like RTS style games and any of the following: World War 2, Mods, Tons of replayability, and a mission creating/ editing software.

Long Version: If you are the kind of person who likes Real Time Strategy games, this is the game for you. If you like world war 2 real time strategy games, this is most likely going to be one of your favorite games. If you dont like world war 2 games but still like real time strategy games, this game can be turned into a modern war RTS if you download mods. Basically, this game is for everyone who likes RTS games. With just the base game elements, no mods activated or installed, the game has a ton of content. You can play as: The Commonwealth (Britan/england/UK), The Soviet Union (the blyat bois), The United States (ameridudes), The Imperial Japaneese Empire (japan on drugs), and Germany (das waffen ss)
There are many gameplay mechanics and features in the base game. A list of these:
                Resources
Like many other RTS games, this game uses a resource system. The resource that you use is MP. I think it stands for man power, but i may be wrong. With the huge variety of units in this game, each of them cost different amounts. As an example, a small squad of inexperienced recruits may cost 50 MP, while a squad of battle hardened soldiers may cost around 100-150 MP. Even then, a light tank or armored personell carrier may cost 200-250 MP. Heavy tanks or Tank Destroyers may cost up to 400 points. And the most expensive units are special units. one such special unit is a veteran tiger tank,a heavy german tank with a battle hardened crew operating it. This costs over 500 points. 
                Units and Fire Support
There are tons of units and fire support types, its best to play the game and experience them for yourself.
>-Modding Section-<
 If you want the game to be alot more realistic, you can download many mods that enhance the game's realism aspects. One such mod i would recommend is Rob'z realism mod. The few things i noticed that changed or were added:
Added the ability for weapons to jam.
Added historically accurate armor thickness for vehicles.
And Made the weapons in the game historically accurate. (for the most part anyways)
These are just a few of many features of this mod. 
You can download missions for the game, and this just makes it even better


                                                             >>>CONCLUSION<<<
Just buy the game and experience it for yourself. Its not your average RTS, its not just another strategy game, Its not anything i have played before. This game is an experience, and a special experience that i couldnt recommend more than any other RTS in the world.

65,43492553,english,"I'd like to post this as a neutral, but that is not an option. 

I'll start with the good part. It's very indepth. In a good way.  You are able to control each and every member of a squad, the types of ammo used in a tank and even a bit of inventory management (if you so desire). But it's not required to paly. 

The visuals are ok, but they are not bad either. They suit the game pretty well.

Now the neutral part. Combat can be a lot of fun, but also a bit wonky at times. Units ignoring commands or pathing ai not being... smart. This is mainly on occasion and does vary when playing in MP matches.

Now the bad.
The game is clearly made with multiplayer at it's core. Which shows. The ai is dreadful, the campaigns pretty lackluster (every faction campaign is mainly a reskin of the same missions). Mission one is always defend a point, move up, a tank dies, go get it, etc.) Every single first campaign mission is this exact same formula. 
Another part is the fact that Multiplayer is very influenced by Latency. If there is one person with a bad ping, the entire game laggs out for everyone.

Now the worst part. The multiplayer. Over the past 10 hours (5 hours singleplayer) i've ran into 4 situations. 
The first is, just getting kicked out of a lobby. Join, say hi, get kicked. Over and over again. The second one is a lobby which is full, but you're stuck waiting because the host just isn't at his pc anymore. The third is finally in a game. Then getting owned by a pre made team of friends that actually coordinate, because someone apperantly forbid anyone from actually talking and communicating in game. (it's either russian or silent). 
The last situation, was that I was in a good game for once, pretty balanced. And a teammate just drops. He had a horrible connection, so the game suddenly sped up a bunch, but we were now down a player. 

Tl:Dr it's a game with some really nice details and combat, but is centered around a silent, unforgiving playerbase with the other option being an imcompetent and very lackluster ai.

94,43284664,english,"My MoW:AS2 (Complete Edition) ""review"" as a solo player + player of the first Assault Squad. 
AKA: Things I like, things I don't in my singleplayer experience. 
FYI: Haven't finished the entire game yet! Still playing through! 

Things I Like:
- They've added new levels! At least, in the complete edition they have. Regular version, I'm unsure. But these new levels are cool and more than welcome. On some levels you can even choose when the assault should take place! 
- It's much easier to resupply things now! Previously, you had to resupply each individual inventory with supply trucks whereas now they have a radius around them in which units will stock up what they need automatically! Thanks for saving us time!
- The new levels add more variety to the game now. Something I didn't like was spending hours on one level, pushing forward through the 3 lines of 3 objectives just to be met by another right after. Now there are plenty of stealth and defence levels which are great!
- Some new units on certain levels you can deploy special units to help out (or in my case, create a more realistic battlefield) Officers for example! 
- They've improved upon the UI and graphics a little, adding more options and effects to the game. That said, my computer can't run this as well as the previous one but that's not saying much. My PC sucks. 
- You have a profile rank. So far, I'm unsure if you actually unlock anything from it, but I do like seeing that I'm earning xp. I think it's mainly for show in the multiplayer but you can earn xp in the singleplayer missions too!
- They've kept in everything I loved in the previous installment. I loved some of the old levels. I love reinforcing positions. I love moving up my line of forces and...well...I love this game too! But...


Things I don't like:
- It's Assault Squad 1, but with a few extra things. I'd expect more from a sequel and so should you! A few new levels...a useless rank system...persisting problems...no massive changes...no redone levels...no multiple looks for all those copy and pasted soldiers...more effort next time. This is just AS1.5...not AS2. Disappointed. 
- Choosing when the assault can take place: This is something I only just recently found and it's becase I went off the level and chose it from the menu. You can't do this with every map, which is fine, but had I have not went back to the menu and clicked on it, I would have completly played through the level/campaign without this feature. 
- Some bonus missions from the last game like the christmas one aren't here...what gives? You already have AS1 in here? Why not it's bonus levels?
- The leveling up is cool but you don't get anything from it. It kind of falls flat if I'm earning xp for nothing and I'm 10 hours in as of writing this and haven't notice anything change other than my level. Multiplayer players may appreciate seeing how experienced I am, but I don't play MP. Useless. Give us alternate uniforms/camos/unlockable units etc.
(The following problems still remain from the last game)
- Being thrust straight into the next mission: Completing this mission took me 3 hours. It says congrats, shows kills/deaths for each side, then gives two options. Continue playing the match or load the next level. NO! Give me something for slaying the opposition! Give me an option to go to the main menu and leave!
- I don't feel rewarded by completing missions as much as I should do: In the last 10 minutes of a possibly hour long level, you can just tell you're gonna win. All you get for that is a window saying congrats, with your losses and theirs and some Steam achievements. If I've killed 3 times as many of their units and destroyed 3 times as many of their vehicles, you'd expect more than that! I think this could be improved upon. Maybe a system of upgrades or unlocks for your faction. Maybe this is where they could add those Officers and shotgunners in. 
- Units STILL being locked to what mission you are on: E.g. There is a mission for the USA where it's more infantry focused, airborne to be specific. They allow you to call in officers but they aren't on every mission. I feel like they where more prevelent than some of these tanks. Imagine having more super heavy tanks than officers on the field. It would be chaos!

That said, this game is great..because it's the previous game, which was great...but with more stuff. 
I plan on playing a lot more. 
In the last one, I completed the USA missions and tried some of the Commonwealth and Russian missions too. 
I think I'll end up doing the same here. 

Anyway, if you liked Company of Heroes and maybe wanted more depth and a longer experience, or if you liked Commandos but wanted it on a larger scale, then I can definately recommend this to you! 
If you liked the last game and are ok with playing some old levels again to get to the new ones, then go for it. They're quite fun and different from the last game!

28,43047509,english,"I really like this game.  To start off, if you're looking for a great single player story line,  you will NOT find that here.  All of the single player campaigns with different factions are extremely similar. I just wanted to get that out of the way. 

While i did say what i did above,  i still play this game solely for it's single player.  I don't play multiplayer at all so my review doesn't include an opinion on that.  What makes this game so different from other RTS's (which I usually don't like by the way), is that EVERY unit is an individual.  It's not like other RTS games where you have 10 infantry units all standing together,  but in reality it's just one unit,  the health for it slowly dropping and the ""individual infantry units"" dying one by one.  In Assault Squad 2, you can do so much more. 

 Let's say you have a normal infantry squad of ten.  Want to split them into two groups of five? Five groups of two? Send each  individual unit somewhere different on the map? Go for it! They are all individual units that you can do what you want with.  Here's another great thing.  Each individual human and vehicle has its own inventory. In it,  you'll see the weapons,  grenades,  ammo, and other tools they're carrying.  One of your soldiers run out of ammo? Loot bodies of enemies and comrades! A tank chasing your infantry? Didn't you kill an enemy with a RPG earlier? Go grab it! You can use the tools in the inventory to do things like plant or detect mines,  dig trenches to hide in or sand bags to hide behind,  heal people with medikits or bandages, etc etc. The list goes on.  

Also,  when combat starts,  it also feels different than other RTS games.  It's not always the case of the better unit draining the health of the weaker unit before it itself dies.  Cover and even luck matter in this game.  Your soldiers can take cover behind anything you would realistically think of taking cover behind.  Crouching behind a waist high wall,  back to a tree and peeking out to take shots,  lying prone in tall grass,  etc.  All of this makes it so,  for example,  three soldiers in great cover can take on a whole squad out in the open,  or make it take a good while to take the three soldiers down if the squad itself is in cover.  It can make a huge difference.  Also,  bullets miss.  A lot of the time.  Every shot doesn't hit every time.  Like I said before,  every unit is it's own individual unit.  That means every bullet shot is individual too. Just because 3 out of 4 soldiers missed their last shot,  that doesn't mean the 4th soldier has a higher chance to hit.  This opens up a world of possibilities instead of the stagnant better unit always defeats weaker unit.  Don't get me wrong though,  a better unit most definitely has the advantage.  Its just not as set in stone as in other games. 

Lastly,  what really keeps me playing are the mods in the steam workshop.  There are so many! They range from maps for single player vs AI and multiplayer,  mission packs for single player,  different skins,  even total conversions to make it look like the warhammer series,  or call of duty.  So much to choose from that I'm never bored. 

If the summer sale is still going on,  you can get this game AND the DLC for like 10 dollars total.  Even if not on sale anymore,  it's still a low price.  It's one of those rare games that you can keep playing for ages,  even just in single player. 

Call to Arms is the same kind of game,  only set in modern times.

34,42974321,english,"TL;DR: More of a ""mixed"". Good, but loads of small or small-ish things that annoy me. I generally play it every once in a while, but am hoping that I'll find something better one day.

One thing that pisses me off is how they have modelled [i]loads[/i] of different units and vehicles, but you only get a handfull of them. Like, fighting germany the AI will send motorcycle-troops to fight you - but playing germany you don't get any. You get a Tiger, Goliaths (remote-controlled self-destruct ""tanks"" to blow stuff up), Pz. IIIs and IVs, King Tigers, Panthers, armoured cars. But no bikes, even though they'd be usefull for scouting. You also don't get 8.8cm flaks, unless in some defend-missions. And similar stuff happens with all sides.

Both you and the AI get cheats. There are 4 difficulties: Easy, normal, hard, and heroic. On easy, normal, and hard your troops get more accuracy, health, and faster reaction times than hostile infantry - on the other hand, the AI will greatly outnumber you, especially on hard and heroic. It is beyond me why they didn't just remove those buffs, and reduced the number of enemies.

Some equipment you can only acquire by calling more troops, some you only get a limited number of. Demolition charges you get one per vehicle, 2 per supply truck, and I think 4 per motorised infantry - but if you want to tear down houses, that's likely not enough. Would be nice to resupply those from supply trucks (which have a ""supply"" bar, which magically produces the right ammo to supply surrounding troops - great case of ""gameplay over realism"", would be a pain otherwise). Mines are hardcapped, and you only get the ones you have at the start of the game.

Some stuff gets resupplied, but only in very limited numbers. E.g. AT-guns get 5 HE shells. Want more? Put them right beside a supply truck, transfer HE shells into truck. Wait until the AT-gun is resupplied (takes 2-3s), transfer 5 more HE shells - if you want your AT-gun to be able to effectively fight infantry, you'll either have to do that for a long time, or transfer the ammo from a tank.

Friendly fire doesn't seem to be a thing, or greatly nerfed at least. The above-mentioned demo-charges can blow up pretty much all hostile tanks, but even armoured cars will rather be flipped than blown up if you're trying to blow them up yourself. Can lead to that armoured car ending up indestructable cover for hostile troops.



That said, there are still some pros to this game. The AI for troops is ok (and I call AI absolute shit in 90% of all games) - they will usually run from grenades and jump for cover, and if they get thrown through the air they'll run back to get their gun. Squads also share ammo between them. Now the AI is not great - e.g. your own AI won't automatically retreat if running out of ammo, nor acquire ammo or weapons from the fallen - but better than what I'm used to. The AI of hostile factions isn't good though, it just throws waves of troops at you - and gets infinite ammo, 'cause it can't handle resupplying stuff.

Armour is a thing - usually it'll take only 1-2 pens to take out a tank, even with low-calibre cannons (AT-rifles may take more). So really, the only thing protecting tanks is armour, not magical hitpoints.",1529771400,1529771400,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198071627966,120,28,17230,0,9191,1590583384,,

Pros:
-Can equip your soldiers with other teams weapons. (This includes taking disabled tanks ammo and transfering it to your own tanks) 
-Soldiers arent equipped with 20k bullets (you actually have to resupply them)
-Your soldiers and other teams soldiers arent hard to kill (not 1 bullet = 1 kill but is close enough)
-No grenade spam (AI doesnt pelt you with them continually)
-Good modular damage for vehicles
-Good selection of vehicles
-Good modding community (Still active 2018)
-Good AI response (If you tell them to go somewhere they will)
-Amazing Editor (Can be difficult to learn)
-Anti Air actually targets planes.
-Para troops and air strikes are very pleasing to do.
-Nothing is really pin point accurate, except snipers, which make battles feel like a battle between soldiers rather than a ----battle between robot targeting systems. 
-Lighter vehicles manuverability is actually good and helps win battles. 
-Varying armor rating for diffrent vehicles (a sherman and a panzer 4 have diffrent weak spots and diffrent types of armor)
-Para dropping a squad to take over an objective is really cool.
-Individual units have individual ranks (xp and level ups are given to the soldier that got the kill, not the whole squad)
-You can equip a soldier with a .50 cal. Try doing that in CoH
-Destructible world. Want a building gone? throw some dynamite in it.



Cons
-AI pathing can be weird (Especially on custom maps)
-Micro-managing each soldiers ammo can be frustrating. (they do have ammo trucks tho)
-Ranges for weapons are wack: Most firearms can shoot somewhere in between 30-90ft. Some tanks with long barrels, like the m10 slugger, can be outmatched by an light German anti-tank cannon. 
-A lot of the singleplayer missions are defense missions that boil down to waves of tanks that get bigger as time goes on (There are 1 or 2 good defenses and the rest of the singleplayer is great)
-Its extremely rare but sometimes when soldiers are diving out of the way of a grenade they end up diving onto the grenade gibbing themselves.
-The Japansese kamikaze soldier is difficult to use. (Mods fix this)
-Flying a plane is incredibly lackluster. 
-Anti tank rifles do next to nothing.
-For whatever reason, tanks like to keep HE loaded even when they are fighting other tanks.

79,42372803,english,"This is a fun game and even better with mods.  

To address some of the neg reviews as I always read them to get a feel for what I am getting into.

1.  The tutorial is in the bonus mission and is called introduction, it is basically the first map of MoW A1.
2.  There are clipping issues, almost all games have some, you just notice them more here due to the maps and poor editing by the Dev.  Yes a true neg.
3.  I can not answer the clunky controls as I have played and own all of MoW games.  However, you can remap almost all of the keys to what you want and even macro some.
4.  I have not seen an AI soldier shoot through a building and one hit you, unless it was a bamboo hut.  If your trooper gets shot in the head he is dead, but most of the time they are not and can heal.  Plus if you have a medic you can revive almost anyone.
5.  Youtube has a lot of great information for new players, from basic fighting to full editing and making your own maps and missions.
6.  Workshop has a ton of great mods from Colonial wars to 40K and still people are making maps and mods.
7.  AI pathing sux plan and simple, there are mods that address some of these issues, but the original engine is the cause sadly.
8.  If you are not sure wait until it is on sale and get it, it really is a fun game and has a lot of replay value.
9.  The play style is not like CoH, you can only recruit units not build a base.

If you have an Nvidia card and this game won't play its the Nvidia patch not the game, just go back one patch, I have not had this problem with my 1080 TI

- there are the unfixed bugs  that would never be fixed probably after 2 years or more 

- Its practicaly just the copy of the precious version of the game ""Men of War: Assault Squad""

- Practicaly the same campaing missions 

- Bewary of the mods that you put in  ( may destroy the game ) 



+ It now has a colaboration with the community workshop 

+ Slitely improved graphix form the previous game 

+ More sound effects 

+ a few new units 

+ few new campaing missions 

* if your are new to Men of War: Assault Squad then you probaly should buy this game cause its got all the dlc from the last vesion , insted of buying all the dlc with the previous game buy this insted. (only if you are interested in phurchesing this game). But for Vets like i, i don't advise to get this game cause its practicaly the same. 

Note: I have been a Gamer and a world war II  historian for a long time, and viewing this is quite sad, it should have the best Rts ever. Sadly the developers did not pay attention to it too much.

86,41407640,english,"One of the best RTS's out right now, and in need of fresh players. Realism of units, physics and ballistics means that you actually have to take every rock, every bush, and every building on the map into account when choosing what forces to bring to a fight. A single infantryman with an anti-tank grenade can be a King Tiger's worst nightmare. One well-placed sniper can take out entire platoons worth of infantry. At the end of an MP battle or Singleplayer skirmish, theres usually nothing left on the map but craters due to artillery. Everything on the map is destructible. 

The game is brutal in MP, and there is a steep learning curve, however if you already play Wargame: Red Dragon/European escalation than you should have no problems picking it up. The game has assymetrical warfare; each faction has advantages and disadvantages. The Japanese have terrible armor, but the best anti-tank rifle in the game. The US has poor heavy tanks, but all riflemen carry semi-autos, while every other faction uses bolt-action. You'll have to learn these strengths and weaknesses and take them into account. 

I've found no RTS that is more tactically stimulating than MoW series. If you're new, I highly suggest beginning with single player to familiarize yourself with factions. Play Assault Zones against AI until you can beat one on the highest difficulty. It will take some time, and you will be scrutinized due to your low level when trying to find matches, but if you learn, it will become one of the most rewarding RTS's you will ever play.

Planes may be difficult to use as I personally find them to be useless unless controlled by me (I rarely use planes so I may not know how to actually use them)

Tanks and other armoured vehicles are in excess, especially when downloading mods (Try the more tanks mod, it adds a lot)

Man, was I wrong

[b] Pros [/b]

- It has some resemblance to COH 1+2 which happens to be game I have played and thouroughly enjoyed for many hours
- Many missions to choose from (as I bought the whole DLC package on sale)
- Enemies are somewhat sneaky, and constantly probing you for weaknesses, so you have to be vigilant all the time
- Decent graphics
- Lots of managing, if you are into that sort of thing 

[b] Cons [/b]

- AI is apocalyptically stupid. I have seen my tanks drive around and through enemies without firing a single shot. Basically every order you give is ignored as well. Makes you scream in anger and frustration, and subsequently punch a whole in your screen
- AI is blind as a bat. If the enemy doesn´t stand right in front of you, beggin you to shoot him, he is more or less out line of sight. Enemy snipers have taken many squads of mine cause the didn´t shoot back at a sniper firing at them
- Game seems sluggish. Sometimes it responds, sometimes it doesn´t. Like telling your antitank to fire rpg´s at tanks, take 3-4 tries. It becomes very frustrating after hours of gameplay
- Every mission is basically the same. Advance. Take points. Mission over. Zzzzz
- Enemy cheats. Several times enemy tanks shoot and kill me from outside the map, or from across the map as well. Furthermore some enemy vehicles are OP, and can kill my fiercest biggest tank in a single shot using a pebble on the ground

Overall the game seems very sloppy in design and execution, buy COH 1+2 wih DLC instead

Great and challenging game to play.

Takes about an hour MINIMUM to finish off a mission.

24,40967359,english,"Very underrated rts game that's shadowed by company of heroes. personally, after playing both of these games I believe that MOWAS is SIGNIFICANTLY, better. Each soldier in an infantry group can be manually controlled (and has his own name), different stats compared to the other soldiers in the squad, and has their own inventory, when you control a soldier you can manually pick up ammo off the ground, or switch weapons with another dead one. 


Compared to COH where the squad is just controlled as a blob, this game's a little more strategic. Manual control of soldiers, making individuals hide behind certain windows, pieces of rubble, in grass and other vantage points add a whole new level of strategy. Can't just rush squads in to points or tanks without proper recon, or support because a single soldier can take out your most powerful tank if he has dynamite, or a rocket launcher, and he could wipe a whole infantry squad if hes hidden in some grass and ambushes you.

Vehicle fighting is based on the parts of the tank you actually penetrate ( track shots detrack and immobilize, turret shots make it so you cant swivel, and engine shots destroy engine) Each tank has their own type of mm tank shell, and each tank has a different thickness of armor, depending on what it is each tank has its own weak spot. 

Multiplayer imo is where the game really stands out. The game's really competitive and theres kinda a pretty heavy skill gap between the vets and newer players. ( completely in the sense of micro management ) No advantage from being a higher level, just knowledge. If you're a quick learner, youll pick up the game quick and the tactics better players use, and what types of vehicles counter others, and for each scenario. (tank destroyers, AA tanks, light, medium and heavy)

TLDR: really good game, crazy amount of detail in micro management, can control a huge battle up to hundreds of soldiers while taking control of one individual tank or person to micro manage your fights, and VERY detailed tank combat.

27,40953305,english,"I feel like there's a great game waiting just under the surface here. The effort put into the maps is amazing, and while the mission types are a bit repetitive then it's not like there was much Capture the Flag in World War Two anyway. However, every campaign has at least one, what I call ""fuck you"" point. When you reach the ""fuck you"" point, you're essentially tasked with breaking through an enemy line that is designed specifically to fuck you over. A good example is in the Normandy map in the US campaign. You break through the town and then you have open fields and a river to cross, you get access to air strikes (which are expensive and have a long cooldown) and paratroopers (which aren't much better than regular infantry and take a while after landing before they become selectable) but the German counter-attack involves seemingly endless infantry, tanks, stationary guns and possibly mortars. I don't know for sure because I can never find whatever it is flinging shells at me from miles away. On top of that, your soldiers have limited ammunition and if they run out then basically they're fucked (enemy soldiers do not run out of ammo, by the way), your tanks will always seem to move into the sights of enemy gun emplacements which -will- one-shot them even if your tank takes half a dozen shots before getting a shell on target and that's assuming your tank even decides to shoot at the one thing present that can fight it, but it won't, because fuck you that's why.  
  
With some tweaking for the sake of balance, maybe an enemy that didn't summon quite so many soldiers and tanks quite so often, and didn't get quite so lucky with its' artillery and field guns quite so often this could be a challenging, addictive  game. Instead it's just a grind. It's fine in intervals of an hour or so but if you find yourself bogged down then maybe set yourself the target of only doing the first half of any given mission because don't worry, you can select any mission from the very start from any of the campaigns, there's no restriction there.

Difficulty

There is easy, medium, hard, and something else that really hard.  Also you can turn fog of war on and off.

Prior Knowledge 

You really don't need to know anything about World War Two to play it I just suggest learning some tips before you first mission

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZg65KAMSk 

Mod Support

There is the steam workshop with plenty of good mods to keep you busy.  I would suggest Valour and the Cold War Mod.

Learning Curve

Not much really to learn just the basic game mechanics.  All I had to learn were the controls.

Content

There is are great missions included and you can play as, germany, japan, united states, commonwealth (UK), and my personal favorite the soviet union.  There are plenty of vehicles such as trains, tanks, cars, aircraft, and a few ships.  There are lots of differnet guns for soldiers giving each nation a different play style.  Did I mention there was a map editor?  Also there is multiplayer and AI if you want to play by yourself.

Price

During any major sale like the summer or Christmas sale you get 75% off so why bother with the original price.

My personal rating.

There are a few games I played that I think should get a rating above a 6, this game is 10/10.  It is the opposite of hot garbage.  Just buy the game.

If you have any questions please ask me.

Any of you that have played the original men of war multiplayer will find the AS 2 one to be extremely laggy and slow like driving a car with the handbrake on. While the graphics and visual aspect of the game is great, the gameplay is severely lacking with little to no innovation and basicaly doing nothing for someone to be convinced this game was even needed. The lagging is so severe that there are no games with more than 4vs4 players.

I have been playing this series from 2004 but sadly the young generation will not understand as they have never played the old one to make a comparison and not to mention the GameSpy shutdown that force us to play Assault Squad 2 that have horrible performance online due to the broken netcode.

DMS to not only enrich their content by adding new stuff but also remove many old maps and the much loved ""tanks only"" mode that had proved to be the life of the original Men of War.

If you wonder why I have so many hours in assault 2 that is mostly because of modding stuff.

Now play as the Germans….the Tiger was slow unreliable junk but fire power it was top dog…that is until you have control of it and lasts seconds before being blasted to crap what gives?

British 1943 Churchill tank had some of the thickest tank armor of WWII,  frontal armor had reached a staggering 6 in (152 mm) to the Tigers 100mm, while the minimal thickness (bottom) was raised to 0.98 in (25 mm), with sides up to 102 mm (4 in). Only the rare Tiger II and Jagdtiger surpassed it on this matter, the Churchill VII used the 75mm gun, and carried much more armor, 50% thicker at the front than a Tiger I, giving it the ability to withstand massive amounts of punishment…..so why does a Tiger take it out with one shot at the front or the Panther with a 75mm gun!

The Sherman Firefly was a feared tank to the Axis and yet it lasts seconds almost not even managing to fire a single shot, I’m sorry it’s poor balancing at best, maybe these idiots should do a bit of research first.
Fast becomes boring all this dying and restarting, this is why I can’t recommend it even though I love the game, shame really.

MOWAS 2 is the tube towards the GEM Editor, easy to mod and create content for, but it all comes down to the creative power of the editor, which has stolen my heart. Don't get me wrong, the base game is good, I find it fun to play the missions on Co-op with some friends, but the editor is where it's at.

The GEM Editor is seemingly limitless in its abilities, I've created a plethora of a scenario, an ISIS ambush of an Iraqi convoy, IDF guerilla specialists fighting palistani insurgents, a U.S. marine platoons last stand against seemingly infinite japanese soldiers, I could go on and on describing what I've done with my time in thsi game, but I would like to see what you could do with yours.

Shit. Welp I guess i won't be able to satisfy my hard on for writing way too long reviews this time. 

Lets start with the negatives of which there are 3 and all of which are tiny nitpicks that arent even big deals. First, atleast the American and Commonwealth Campaigns follow the same mission setup (i feel like it's highly likely the other campaigns follow the same setup) I wont go into the mission setup because i havent even completed two campaigns, basically this isnt even a full criticism it's a specualtion of something that might be a thing. WELL ANYWAY, the second thing is that the most common mission (assault missions) are laid out the same way, 10 objectives, one at the top middle of the map, and three sets of three in diagonal lines going up from left to right but due to the great map variety this never felt repetitious and i dont see it really becoming repetitious for me because you never return to a map. The final negative is the only one that actually bothers me and even then it barely does, the price text on the reinforcements panel is white on a light gray background making it hard to read but if you focus on it slighty you can read it fairly easily but still bad design on the devs part. and that concludes the negatives, and now because it's taken so long to do this im just going to do the positives in bullet points becuase FUCK YOU CONSISTENCY.

POSITIVES:
-5 campaigns (America, Commonwealth AKA the UK, Soviet Union, Germany, Japan)
-Good Looking graphics
-Good controls 
-Plenty of challenge 
-Great map variety
-Each campaign comes with unique units,
-Active modding community

WELP that's all i can be bothered to say right now, this would be longer and generally better if i was actually bloody thinking and didnt accidentally delete what i had typed so far. If you want a rating for the game I'd probably give it a 9/10

What I Wish This Game Had:
Because im a sick bastard I wish this game was more graphic, like if somebody gets hit by a tank round they get blown to bits, a grenade can blow off legs n shit, basically i really want this game to be incredibly gorey because im just a sick bastard. Maybe there's a mod.

SO, a few minutes after finishing the writing this i went to have a look at the mods because i hadnt properly done it until now, only took glances and GOD DAMN the modding community is amazing, seriously it's amazing.

The Japanese units are why I bought the game, and they have authentic voice acting (in Japanese exclamations and comments from the troops in-game, not the pre-mission English narrator of course) and the vehicles they have to play with are a good selection if slightly outdated in some cases where their units are literally 10 years older than the US equivalents.

The downside to this game is that the engine has always felt a little clunky. It simply lacks the ""smoothness"" you get in some other similar war RTS games. But on the flip side you can do much more with the units in the MOW series. Your troops can pick up inventory off enemy troops -- so they aren't just pre-built - if you want a flamethrower guy or to stea; an enemy tank you just make do with what's on the field.

Men of War: Assault Squad 2, I’ll just call it MOWAS2, is the Arma of strategy games. Seems a little far-fetched at first, but there are some amazing parallels in between the two series. Decent single player campaign that gives you a good idea of what you are doing, multiplayer that’s relatively active, editor that can pretty much be your game if you learn how to use it, and a workshop page that is incredibly active.

I love the game, as you can see by my 600+ hours, but the fact is that it isn’t for everyone. 

The average multiplayer gamer won’t stick around forever for a good bit of reasons. The first being that the game modes are lacking to a certain degree. The game modes of multiplayer, just as any other game, get tiring after a while. Most multiplayer games end up in the same regard with the process of first contact->offensive->counter-offensive->repeat several times-> someone comes out as the winner. The game still has some balance issues regarding multiplayer, and the average gamer probably will be indifferent to the multiplayer overall. If you love WWII stuff to a certain degree, you will probably find multiplayer to be pretty fun, with the gameplay being more accurate rather than balanced.

Single player gamers can enjoy the campaign, but only so much. There are 5 sides, each with at least 8 missions, all with the premise centering around a modified multiplayer game mode, particularly the famous assault zones. The battles are spectacular at first, but the more you play the more you realize each mission is just reissued to another setting under another name. It gets boring after a while, but that is what the editor is for! 

If you have a good amount of spare time, take it and figure out how to use the editor. About 80 percent of the time im playing this game, it’s on the editor simply because of how limitless it is. With the scale of the game being so large, you can recreate the actual entire battle of Bastogne if you wanted to. And with the mods that the workshop can bring, it just makes the game all that much better. 

The actual gameplay is pretty f****** amazing. Again, people who are particularly invested in WWII games will appreciate this game more than the average strategy player. Then again, this is an epic strategy in scale, so the average strategy player will appreciate the MAJORITY User Interface.

The A.I. and micromanaging within the game is a slightly different story.

Each little infantryman has his own little inventory, name, kill count, and even a counter for how much combat he has seen (veterancy). But, managing this feature when it comes to a battle with 1000 men on the field is tough. This can come in to play particularly when repairing field equipment and vehicles. If you have a downed tank in the middle of a battlefield that can be repaired, it is a NIGHTMARE to repair said tank. You have to take a man, go up to the tank, look in its inventory, grab the repair kit, and then you can start repairing it. It sounds like a little issue, but the venerability that the infantryman owns when repairing that tank is very high, and the height of it comes when he tries to grab the repair kit. There are only a few little issues like this in the game. The A.I. can be bad at times, but doesn’t that just apply to most strategy games in general?

I have almost nothing bad to say about the graphics, pretty amazing in general. You will need a big computer to play this game at a normal pace. For how amazingly big the game is, the graphics surprisingly go beyond what you would expect in an Epic-RTS.

For those who love WWII games, strategy, and creating missions in editors (ex. Age of Empires) I encourage you to click that add to cart button.

For those who like strategy RTS games like Age of Empires and Command and Conquer, this is a little more complicated than the average RTS, but it can be fun once you get used to it.

For those who have never played any game in any category I mentioned, I really don’t know why you’re even reading my review, lol.

64,37845248,english,"Sorry my playtime is not showing good enough for the reviewing but im writing it because of a problem we have here, and i played men of war years ago but brought it on the steam and started it again after the engine update.

[b]First of all lets look at the main game it self:[/b]

[b] + Extremely detailed on the small details[/b]
For the obsessive perfectionist characters, it may be a best. many details on everything, i finds some small details after hours of playing, for some people it may not be a big deal but for the obsessive perfectionist persons its sexy !

[b] + Its realistic[/b]
For example we have a 7 soldiers at the start, find out about the armored vehicle scouting around, if our soldiers havent a good stuffs for taking it out we can try to ambush it from behind by some granades, then the enemy's soldiers will leave it to try to run or use their hand guns to defend, take them down too and hide there bodies somewhere, find some repair tools and try to repair it if its not destroyed, then by put someone to drive and 2 more for the guns and leads its all fine and yours, yet we can carry more soldiers depends on vehicle but runing it without the supporters means we will loose it in the same way probably if not worst by the anti tanks and other possible dangers. its just one of the things we can do in this game.
Also im so glad this game have no digital neon marks around the fields or saint lights on the soldiers to show the owns and the targets, but we can find our lost soldier in the woods by the mini map easily

[b] + Its like a Chess Virtual Reality[/b]
Its not a turned base game but many of the ""Strategy"" games i played wasent actually Strategic but they had a grinding mechanism, gathering resources in the base, send a waves of units like a bugs, grow like a Mushrooms till capturing the whole map. these games are fun, perfect for killing time or meditation, no feeling for the units as the numbers and sizes are all the matter. but there are a few other kinds (and i think men of war kind started with the commandos and desperados) where the ""Strategy"" is the most matter, like in the Chess, even wen we have all the Chess pieces, at the start of the game with the one wrong step we can loose heavily, on the other hand with a few Chess pieces (unites) and wen the other side have much more unites, with some good moves we can win.

[b] + It have alot of hours content for playing and thinking[/b]
The campaigns of each side in the WWII from USA and britain to the soviet and germany, each campaign have a missions and mostly each mission will take a hour(s) to finish. also we have a multiplayer mode were we can play against each other or co-op with each other against AI.

[b] + System requirements & Performance [/b]
Simply it can run verywell & beauty on very old system, with the level of the details, with the nice special effects, i havent enjoyed this much from visuals in the others of this kind specially with the system it ask for run. no need to mention (as you know) today there are some visual novels and pixel games asking for the same system requirements, if not asking for heavier.

[b] + Good developers and publishers[/b]
As i said, this kind of games may started with the commandos and desperados and i loved them. yet Men of War developers not only tried to perfect this genre but they care for their child, they update the game, updated the engine for free and keep working on it. also i think it have a good price and good sale off.

[b] +/- recommended to who[/b]
Its not a game for the hack and slash lovers or other kind of fast paces, its not for having fun with rushing like a COD games in the isometric view, its not for the killing time, its a heavy game with the pure strategy needs, even it may not a game for the people who focus on just one game to finish then go for the next, but personally i think its a perfect game to finish one mission time to time between other games (like the Chess again), its not going to finish soon, it a brain sport for a long time.

[b] - Negatives?[/b]
I see many reviews used to be as [I like it or I dont like it] but im not ok with the personal taste reviews, i think the reviews should forcus on the technical and art matters. so in this case the thing i like to see more in this game (& these games) is more narrative and personality even by stupid conversations between the soldiers, as i said in this game the unites are not the bugs, they can die easy by one wrong step or do a great jobs by the good moves, still in this game we have a hours with a few soldiers in some missions and with some characteristic elements it can be more fun.

[b]And finally about the Problem of Assault Squad 2: Men of War ""Origins""[/b]

[b]Its the remake of the First Men of War But...[/b]

There are some things about it is, and one of them made a problems.
One if these problems is, many people like my self cant put a review for the Origins as its standalone in the market and ask for a play time to allowing a review but wen i brought the Origins it become a DLC for my MOW:AS2.

So the thing is if you buy the Origins without having MOW:AS2, you will see the Men of War: Assault Squad 2 with the Origins DLC in your library but as you just brought the Origins, you have a Original Campaigns of Men of War.

If you have MoW-AS2, Origins will become a DLC and Plus to the campaigns into your rest of MoW-AS2 Campaigns menu.

So why if you just want the Origins, still you will get the campaigns in the Men of War: Assault Squad 2 menu in your library?
Seems the Developers/Publishers done it to make a better experience in the multiplayer/co-op, in this way the players who just brought the Origins can play with the people who have a Assault Squad 2 + Origins DLC.

About the different between MoW:AS2 and AS2-MoW origins, in short i can say Origins mostly have more missions like a comandos Missions were you have a few soldiers for a special missions but AS2 have a heavy Assaults mostly. 

For my taste, with the MOW:AS-CE + Origin i have all the bests in the series but [b]the Vietnam[/b] in this remastered package to complete my collection/selection.",1511837262,1514245232,True,19,4,0.622403800487518311,11,True,False,False,76561198275079256,169,1,1405,0,1405,1509259754,,

Pros:
- Highly tactical
- OK Graphics
- Historically acurate vehicle design
- Infantry can ""strip"" enemies and vehicles of weapons, ammo ect
- Enemy weapons (MG's AT) can be stolen by infantry or ""towed"" back by vehicles (ally weapons can as well)
- Units can be directly controlled for more tactical aplication of firepower (or if the AI is being retarded XD)
- All nations are playable from the start.
- Decent length campaigns.
- Individual infantry can be moved between squads to modify weapon loadouts.
- Two small squads can be combined into one with a single click/drag.

Cons:
- Very far engagement ranges, especially for tanks and AT guns
- Vehicles VERY vulnerable to AT weapons (often only two shots max is needed to destroy your vehicles)

88,37760390,english,"Men of War: Assault Squad 2 was a game recomended by a friend that took me pleasantly by surprise, despite me not being a RTS-crazy gamer. Going for a Company of Heroes-like economy, it saves you the hassle of base building and quickly brings players straight into the conflict. The game is pretty friendly to new and veteran RTS players alike due to it's simple Skrimish modes as well as the ability to play Co-op against enemy AI which I've spent hundreds of hours on.

On a tactical level, I quickly realized that many real-world concepts work here too; infantry works best in squad-level engagements, with MG teams covering an assault group, lone tanks or vehicles easily falling to sneaky anti-tank troops or even normal grunts with AT grenades, and the superiority of combined arms assaults. The immersion and environment sounds are simply amazing.

Replayablity is defintely a plus due to Steam Workshop compatablity. Community content allows players to set up their own missions, port entire campaigns from previous games and custom scenarios from other time periods such as modern warfare, hypothetical cold-War conflicts, other IPS (e.g. Star Wars, Warhammer, etc.) and I s#!t-you-not, the [i]American Revolution/Civil War[/i] black powder conflicts.

[*]Faantastic RTS gameplay
[*]Realistic physics and immersion
[*]Ability to micromanage to the individual level and even take precise control
[*]Realistic tank penertration physics on par with the likes of War Thunder or World of Tanks
[*]Lots of historical units, weapons and vehicles for WWII nerds to appreciate
[*]Sizable single-player content as well as multiplayer/co-op
[*]Mod support and great community content

Alright, now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me begin my review. 

This game is awesome, and for RTS lovers, a must buy. The detail is great and the options for battlefield tactics are unlimited. I haven't played a RTS that handles combat as well this does. If you're a Star Wars fan, get the Galaxy at War mod. It'll completely blow away the land battles in Empire at War. 

Lastly, this game runs very well on my laptop. I have a Nvidia GeForce GT 640M (1GB Dedicated GDDR5) and I'm getting 60+ fps with little action and 30+ when the fighting is heavy on medium settings.

Pros: 
Great graphics. The amount of detail is superb.
Strategic gameplay, such as manually controlling where shots go. 
AI has some good tactics.


Cons: 
AI has unlimited resources, this makes combat dull as the victor has more firepower (tactics do play a part in this, until you remember your troops are out of ammo from the last fight). 
Routine find-destroy-repeat gameplay.

Gameplay wise it is incredibly good. The atmosphere is always intense, there are no boring battles. You can manage your army to the last detail if you want to. Every vehicle, every single soldier has his own inventory and you have the freedom to manage every single detail of troops. By that you can turn a fight around even when you are totally outgunned, just by making the right decisions. It`s all about tactics/strategy. Only cons I have read so far is: it`s too difficult and units die too fast.  To the first I woul response: Get gut. To the second: how slow are you? I am no master RTS gamer by any means. But at least on normal difficulty your soldiers can survive quite long even being under fire from enemy infantry. But if you expect them not to be mowed down by an 20mm gun why bother with a realistic RTS game anyway and punish it for being realistic? Do you vote  a puzzle game down a because it has not enough hand to hand combat in it? The only con I can think of is, that your field of view can be a bit small at times and that you have to scroll around a lot  because of that. But apart from that, this game is just great!

I've played Star Craft, Command & Conquer and Empire at War; but this game tops all of them, it has a mediocre 'vanilla' campaign of the different belligerents of the second world war (The major Factions Eg. the USSR, Germany, Common Wealth, US & Japan). The mods on the workshop and the community made missions make it more versatile and engaging (Eg. Robz Realism & Valor). The Online community in multiplayer matches are fun to face off with, however check that you know the gist of the game before delving in head first, as it can be irritable for more knowledgeable players. 

- Great to play with friends
- Different types of Game Modes (Skirmish, Assualt Zones, Combat and Frontlines) Each with different attributes and challenges. 
- Can control individual units (Eg. Tank's in terms of angling, ammo selection and positioning)
- The Positioning of troops is important, as you cannot just rush through like a bunch of Zergs, but need to use the environment of the map to be able to either attack of defend successfully. 
- Realistic weapons ~ However there are mods that make the damages and the ranges more historically accurate. 

Overall A great game with great traits! When buying this game I would recommend purchasing the Men of War Origins DLC, that unlocks more missions and has a more engaging (less bland) campaign's than the plain 'Vanilla' Game. Do Buy it on a Sale as it's somewhat pricey when not. Its the Player that makes the Commander and skills are required rather than brute force.

The only Dev support I've had has been a suggestion to ""turn off autosave"" which isn't actually an option anywhere. Not to mention that ANY sort of save causes the game to crash. 

I've done rollbacks to previous patches in the hopes that would fix the problem (it didn't), I've spent more time in long dead forums or trying a dozen different ""fixes"" that had no effect or were no help.

If you are new to the series, and have patience, you are in for a great game.
If you are paying full price and you have previously played MOW:AS1 i wouldnt recommend the game.

I'm a massive fan of the series and personally have got my monies worth, but lately the dlc and subsquent rehashes of the game under a different name feel like a cash grab. It's painful for long term fans as, i'm sure most would agree, would love some more content rather than an era reskin and another game released for full price. 

AI was never fully finished in multiplayer (not a massive minus, but it was moved to a DLC!! absolutely terrible practice here...) but on the whole the game is QoL changes over Assault Squad 1. 

I'm actually updating this review as i've nominated it yet again for the steam awards. I'd love to see an assault squad 3 with a complete engine overhaul, probably hire the developers of RobZ realism mod too - that mod just takes this game to another level.

tl:dr if your into the multiplayer scene of the first game buy it, if your new, buy it on offer. If you played the first and didn't enjoy it... move along theres nothing to see here.",1479936525,1511395583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999410435,812,5,9409,0,8288,1599970633,,
27,11745064,english,"EDIT: This review was made before the shut down of gamespy so therefore it was obvious that we could just go back and play Assault Squad 1, however we can't do this anymore. So unfortunatly the multiplayer is still quite 'broken' in AS2 compared to predecessors. However they have improved it a lot since launch, for example you can manage to play a least a 2v2 now. 

I have always been a huge Men of War fan. I own and played every single Men of War released and never got tired of them. Even when people were dissapointed with Men of War Vietnam I still loved it.

When I saw a Men of War Assault Squad 2 coming out I was so excited. I already pumped 400+ hours into the first Assault Squad cause I loved playing it so much. When I got AS 2 and started to play, it was a disaster. The game only adds two or three new units and is a horrible remake of the original Assault Squad. Due to random lag spikes the game is barly playable more than a 3v3 in the multiplayer and lets not even mention the de syncs! Getting disconnected mid game is simply unacceptable for a full fledged game in 2016! With the new implemented idea of units needing to be unlocked once you reach a certain level makes the game unbalanced and unrealistic. Also the graphics are a tad better only for mainstream factions. For example, the Japanese vehicals look like they are ports from Assault Squad 1, same with a few other vehicals in the game, not retextued at all. 

I can guarantee this is not worth it's current price. Getting it on sale for $10 or under sure. Nevertheless, it is an alright game game, it has to be because it's the exact same thing as the first one. But overall, I don't know about you guys, but I wouldn't pay $35 for a reskin. 

Coming to a conclusion, I realize this game is a step in the wrong direction. The unit lock by levels, the auto resupply, the WAY overpriced DLC... it seems DMS is copying the ways of it's rival, Company of Heroes 2. We are losing what makes the Men of War franchise unique and this game shows it. At least we are not to far gone and can still make a return of the original feeling of Men of War.",1408228096,1511390766,False,20,1,0.510093271732330322,0,True,False,False,76561198018765811,201,5,21799,0,17435,1600665470,,

It takes time to learn shortcuts, commands, and various controls, but it's well worth and fun at the same time.

Proof.  http://imgur.com/a/OGl1l

Can't tell the difference? Good.  You're paying for the 'privilage' to use multiplayer since gamespy shut down Digital Mindsoft stopped supporting the superior first game and used this sad excuse of an 'upgrade'  to make a quick buck.   Multiplayer uses some halfassed steam support which has no inclusive chat lobby and therefore cannot retain a playerbase which was a concern for the first game but a killer for this one.  

Design decisions made such as unit locking/leveling and obvious timer displays for grenades were implemented to cater to CoH players and make the transition for them easier but served as an annoyance and dumbing down of the core game for me.  

But,  don't dare criticize the game or you will be censored, hard.  Observe ban reason.  http://imgur.com/a/gFufq 
    
Update 06/10/2014 decided to give it a go again for posterity.   During 'early' access the game was laggy, it still is.  There's a reason there's no one online playing it right now.
 i7-3770K  NVIDIA GTX 670, 8 gigs of ram, no reason for it to run like this other than bad coding.

oh, want to save and watch game replays?  cough up another $12 for the DLC that allows you to do that.

It's just shocking. I don't want to slate the game because I'm a fan but basically your army are lemmings, especially trucks towing artillery, they are incapable of making their way somewhere on the map, you literally have to click every point on their route, otherwise they just beach themselves on something or drive into a brick wall, I mean seriously come on!?

Expansion packs brought some interesting new theatres and models, which was welcome, but I've been experiencing some bugs which are awful to the point of unplayable! Basically if you can look past the fact this is a very ropey and unfinished product and just enjoy the combat and looks, then it's the one.

I am Very Very split about this game. 
I have men of war (oringinal) , Assualt squad (1) , and obviously the second
I am very disappointed in this sequel..

Missions have no variety , Same mission different skins. Same with weapons. 
 *Note the m1 grands have 5 shots unlike the oringal 8.
This is Basically Assualt squad 1 copied and pasted with some bug fixes + Auto ammo resupply with truck (which is nice) . I have noticed im not playing for the game but more so for the multiplayer.

The game is impressive in world detail, effects, and lighting. You can manually control (in third person) the AI and do the aiming/shooting yourself. The destructible environments make battles a blast to experience, win or lose. Tank battles are incredibly fun and you can lose a tank or two in the blink of an eye if positioned incorrectly, rolling up towards a hidden AT gun or facing a much more powerful tank. Tank guns have AT, HE, and various other round types to deal with specific threats.

I'm terrible at this game, to be honest and find more fun scripting large battles in the game's powerful editor which is, in my opinion, one of the best out there in the market. The sky's the limit when it comes to your imagination and the ridiculous amount of custom mods and maps in the workshop expand the game's longevity exponentially. So, consider this an alternative to enjoying your money's worth if you find the game too difficult or too much of a drag to play competitively.


===
Pros:
(+) Decent graphics that still hold up to this day
(+) Fully destructible environments
(+) Detailed hit mechanics for realistic and detailed tank battles 
(+) A huge variety of WW2 guns, vehicles, tanks and soldiers of various nations
(+) G.E.M.2 Editor for building your own maps, orchestrating your own battles and the ability to seamlessly transition from editor mode to gaming mode back and forth. You can even place more units during an ongoing battle.
(+) Workshop mods and custom maps.

===
Cons:
(-) Overall difficult gameplay: Damage values are realistic and soldiers each have their own inventory and ammunition to consume. As for vehicles, they have limited fuel and ammo as well. When playing missions involving a lot of units, it becomes a clusterfuck of micromanagement hell
(-) Outdated animations: The game still uses old animations from previous Men of War games
(-) Bad voice acting and soldiers sometimes say random unrelated things (""Quite unexpected"", ""Very suspicious!"")
(-) Outdated Engine: Large battles and detailed city maps will gradually cause lag no matter how powerful your PC is.
(-) Wonky AI: Sometimes the AI responds to your commands to the letter, and sometimes they have a mind of their own. Remember to toggle the ""Hold Fire"" and ""Hold Position"" commands to ensure their complete obedience.

When you run out of missions to complete you can add all sorts of mods to make the games feel different and enjoyable again.

-Nice visuals, game looks great

-ALOT to this game <-- Negative side of there being so much too learn to become skillful, but most likely worth your time
-Lack of tutorial/intro, especially bad for real noob RTS players like myself lol
-Weird mouse issue that may just happen to me. Described Below

I have no Middle Click configured on my Logi G602, it is the control 'back' like how some mouses have the 'back' and 'forward' wheel tilt so anyways I just went to assign it and cliock it and the game added the assignment just like that. So anyways sometimes it stays 'pressed' well it's not and then I have to press it again to fix it and rarely it gets ridiculous weird not wanting to work and in which i have to click it like 3 or more times or so or until it wants to work right, but doesnt happen often and not game breaking, just annoying. Hasnt happened during any real competitive moment though so..

[h1]Rating: good (7/10)[/h1]

[b] Introduction [/b]
Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a real time strategy ""Blitzkrieg"" type of game, where you get limited amount of troops to finish the mission. Since you do not have the ability to build a base like in most other strategies, Men of War provides some challenge at higher difficulty settings if you try to finish it quick.

[b] Gameplay & Story: 6/10 [/b]
The story is based on 2nd World War events where you try to fulfill different objectives to gain some advantage for your fighting side. The campaign is seperated by single missions that do not have any connection to each other, besides some story description. The story is supported by some details about the events that supposed to have occured during WW2. The gameplay consists of only managing your squads and units that you receive to finish the mission, alongside using some special functions like air or mortar strikes, that fulfill your weaponary.

[b] Combat & Challenge : 7/10 [/b]
The combat itself is simple but some missions require micro-management to use your units in most effective ways. There are some different types of equiptment that units can use, so adjusting to different objectives and situations helps with progression. If taken slowly, the game does not offer much challenge since you can always re-draw units, heal them up and re-capture strategically important positions or simply camp for more points to produce a real huge army that simply rolls over the enemy. At higher difficulties howerever, the amount of units the enemy throws at you gets challenging so you have to micro-manage your units even better to not let them die in vain.

[b] Graphic & Interface : 7/10 [/b]
The graphic and effects are far more enjoyable than in most Blitzkrieg games, especially compared to the older Men of War titles. The interface has been adjusted for the better aswell and you can modify some of the UI for better squad management. Most of the actions provided are still somewhat needless, but since you can simply move them out of the center of the UI, they do not disturb that much like in previous Men of War titles.

[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 6/10 [/b]
The whole progress of the game is still done by slowly fulfilling the objective inside single missions, but it feels satisfying in Assault Squad to finally move few meters on the map. The battles are packed with some action, the town and other surroundings do look destroyed and impacted by the fire fights, so the progress inside single missions feels good.

[b] Audio & Immersion : 7/10 [/b]
The audio gives a nice feedback during the battles where the biggest fire fights happen, where the heavy weapons and tanks are placed. The music provided a nice background sound without being too intrusive. The immersion during the missions was definetely on a high level in Assault Squad due to combination of visual feedback from the battles aswell audio feedback from the gun fights happening mostly on multiple places at same time.

[b] Side-Notes [/b]
[list]
[*]This game is single player only.
[*]This game contains steam achievements.
[*]This game offers mediocre replayability if you want to try same missions at higher difficulty later.
[*]This game is often sold in bundles or being discounted.
[/list]

[b] Summary [/b]
Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is an enjoyable blitzkrieg type RTS game and will most likely gather your attention for at least few missions. It is quite fun to fight in each single mission since the environments do change a lot and you get to destroy some towns and farm along your WW2 progress. I would recommend higher difficulty settings for some challenge since else you roll over enemies rather quick.

48,34506562,english,"A luke-warm recommend.

Let me explain:

This game is great. The multiplayer, at least. I don't buy games for multiplayer. The singleplayer ""campaigns"" in this game are not campaigns. Essentially, it is a collection of 10 missions, either attack or defend, with a simple reskin for each faction. There are 10 for the Germans, the English, the Japanese, the US and the USSR, and they all play the same. The attack missions consist of fighting your way up what seems like fifty miles of ground against the same enemies, capturing a few flags along the way. The defense missions consist of holding a spot for twenty years against an enemy hell bent on getting passed you, damn the consequences, like the old RTS games of the early 2000's era. Just bad mission design in >current year<. The only missions worth a damn is the tutorial mission located under ""bonuses"". It's from the original MoW: AS and is just as relevant.

These are extremely boring. I have put these on easy so many times simply because it takes so long to get through the attack missions that I'd rather not develop a strategy because that only increases the time I'll spend staring at Gazala. It *could* be fun to have simplistic missions like these, but in such an absurd, unchanged amount at such length. The pacing is way off. Similarly, the defense missions take longer than an unanaesthetised tooth pulling, and can be just as painful staring at the hordes of light tanks trying to swarm your heavily entenched Jagdtigers.

Where this game actually excells is in the multiplayer. There are so many maps and modes I can't keep track, designed for 2, 4, 6 and 8 players. I wont go into too much detail, but it essentially removes all the pitfalls of the singleplayer. A realistic, squad-based, WW2 RTS is what is advertised and the multiplayer fits that perfectly. Custom games, matchmaking, etc. It's good.


Equally good is the editor. Custom maps, missions, campaigns and so much more are constantly posted to the workshop it's ridiculous. Most are quality by virtue of how easy it is to edit once you learn how to do it. It's not even limited to WW2. Clone Wars? Of course. A billion D-Day/Sea Lion maps? That's a given.

Point is: if singleplayer is your temptation here, avoid this like the plague. This is the equivelant of those team-based shooters with ""singleplayer"" that amount to simply having the multiplayer maps put in a chronological order. Go get the original Men of War, it's got a proper campaign, though the voice acting is a bit laughable. It's essentially an older version of this. Not much changes between the games other than fine tuning and graphical touches.

*However*, if multiplayer is your poison, look no further. This game is the premier WW2 RTS right now. Don't be put off by the ""realistic"" angle if you're a bit weary. It's extremely easy to learn.",1503758777,1503758777,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198020236511,204,26,4351,0,4342.0,1505020973,,

games are difficult (but that is my opinion)

difficult for new people to create maps

and some in game items will crash your game even if they are not mods

I approached the game from a cooperative viewpoint and those who are in the coop circle and enjoy the more tactical oritented games should enjoy this quite well.

62,33359068,english,"I'm not an expert at reviews, so don't expect masterful judgment from me.

TL;DR: An extremely fun, if mind-numbingly rusty game, the former especially so with mates.

So I played the very first game's demo and I loved it. This range from big-scale RTS to micro-managing individuals is quite a large achievement. As a result, I decided to buy this!

I found it difficult to discover that there exists a tutorial mission and other kinds of help, so I spent the first hour or so milling about in the first campaign mission, attempting to familiarise myself with the mechanics. The UI is atrocious, so it took longer than expected. After I got it all down to grips, my enjoyment skyrocketed.

After finishing the American campaign, I moved on to Germans. I was a bit disappointed to find that the first mission was virtually a reskin of the first American mission. I feared that the rest of the game was the same, so I put down the campaign and set out to fight in skirmish.

Much to my surprise it was locked behind a DLC: ""MoWAS2: Airborne"". That was extremely disappointing, but seeing as it was on sale, I shrugged.

It's really fun. Really fun dude. Despite the AI cheating to gain more manpower and resources, it genuinely impresses me. Infantry can be both Godlike and cannon meat, depending on where you place them. Different units feel different; I scarcely felt outmatched when putting my special forces against their regulars. At the same time, if you are to run the special forces (as I have done many times) into enemy machinegun fire, your trained dudes will die like flies.

However, the AI for the individual infantry units is absolutely horrible. What kind of an SAS soldier peeks out of cover, gets shot at, hides, only to peek out again and do nothing? Infantry cannot fire on the move, which means that any soldier assaulting entrenched enemies becomes a sitting (standing) duck whilst attempting to annihilate the defenders.

The cover system is great. Hide behind that pipe? Sure. Corner of the house? Behind the door? You got it. In this piece of rock that was blasted away from a bigger rock formation by a tank? Hell yeah boy.

However, taking cover inside buildings is somewhat counterproductive. It seems like the AI has a very limited line of sight within buildings.

Vehicles is where it's at. Directly controlling even light vehicles feels really fun. Triple that with tanks, where direct control means that you can aim the shell exactly where it should go. Whilst the computer just aims 'at a tank', you can be careful to target, say, tracks or the engine. Your shells can bounce and ricochet and hit something behind it! You can directly fire through a whole bloody house and destroy the armour on the opposite side. Hoo-wee, it feels wonderful. Repairing vehicles whilst in combat is intense, and the fact that a stray AP shell can kill your crewmembers means you have to be extremely aware of enemy combatants.

For better or for worse, a sneaky infantryman can single-handedly blow a tank to sh*t by throwing an AT grenade at its engine. And the stealth system too is much more robust than expected. Each individual has a line of sight: basically, in front of them. Which means that you can get single dude, outfit him with mines and grenades, crawl him past the enemy lines and sabotage the roads or whatever. Whilst this hasn't worked out against AI, playing with my friend and hearing him yell ""HOW!?"" when his precious Tiger tank blew sky high at the hands of some special forces, made me laugh out loud.

I haven't tried proper multiplayer game. It seems pro-infested, and I fear death threats if I suck. Maybe one day.

All in all, a solid 7.5/10. Extremely fun at times, infuriating at others due to its clunkiness. The sequel - Call to Arms - is not worth your time in my opinion.",1499475307,1499475307,True,1,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False,76561198026190996,185,13,3112,0,2038,1550025584,,

First, there is no story line.  If you want strong story, try instead Age of Empires III (3). It involves pirate characters and a female lead. [b]Men of War Assault Squad 2[/b] is not technically an RTS, but an RTT  (real-time tactics). There is no base-building, and the only diminishing resource is ammunition ; which must be obtained during missions by hook-or-crook or by a supply truck ordered in (which seems to never contain ammo).  There is no regular RTS arithmetic involving the number or size of your armies. As the name suggests, [b]Men Of War Assault Squad 2[/b] is a succession of assaults by a squad, which you control by careful micromanagement of individual members. Individual fighters have inventories, and the game is intricate enough to qualify as a military simulator.

[h1]fomer players of Company of Heroes franchise __[/h1]
The look/feel of MOW:AS2 will make you think you are playing COH again. You're not. This game is very different and some adjustments are required on your part. Gameplay is best with the camera squeezed close to the ground looking forward. This allows you to understand the line-of-sight of your fighters. Interactions with the environment and with cover is a central aspect. The micromanagement of infantry is completely new. You will be repairing enemy tanks and then comandeering them for your own uses.   

[h1]Pace __[/h1]
I used the word ""military simulator"" earlier. By no means does this mean slow gameplay (like ARMA).  Missions are unbridled pandemonium. Your squad fighter will get thrown by a grenade, and drop his rifle, losing it in the weeds, after which he will be running around with no gun. You grab an enemy rifle and his ammo instead, or maybe take up a crew-served .50 caliber.  Zoom in always, and be on the look-out for what look like sticks : those are the rifles dropped by the wave of enemies you took down during the last assault.  You can move up a supply truck and hop out in the middle of the road. The enemy shoots out the tires, but now the husk of the truck serves as cover.  You send your sniper onto a grassy knoll at the flank of the enemy position where he rains death. But he is discovered and becomes surrounded and low on ammo. If he can hold out long enough, support can arrive from the rear to save him -- a field gun, mortar crew, or maybe even a heavy tank.",1499257624,1499261037,True,2,1,0.511213302612304688,0,True,False,False,76561198394949063,28,8,715,0,232,1592014057,,

Pros

good selection of units

a nice description of each unit

Stats on what armor they have and where aswell for penetration

inventories in general

Moddable this game is great for mods i mean you see ther multiplayer and the most popular one is Robz realism check that out in the steam workshop valour is pretty good aswell

If you can meet some of the right people that are online and play alot such as myself you can really has some fun

It doesnt have many cons...really it doesnt

Goes on sale often

easy to learn

Cons

 hard to master...this is from a Robz realism stand point

there really isnt any people on multiplayer in the morning but thats to be expected

not much to single player without mods theres alot of levels but it does get a bit tedious

Result

Anyway i would for sure recommend this game it is amazing i love this game and you really should get it i suggest you get it when its on sale though it can be a bit pricy for some people but all in all its great game but i do suggest one thing dont get too many mods installed...having too many causes long load times

7,23133077,english,"This game is perhaps the closest a WW2 game will get to perfection.

I'm serious. Nearly everything about this is perfect.

You want diversity? This game has diversity. Dozens upon dozens of units to choose from 5 different nations. You want action? Hell yeah this game has action. Both Multiplayer and Singleplayer are choc-full of people/AI that will destroy you if you allow them. You want challenge? As I just said, set AI to the highest or pick some guy out of Vietnam on multiplayer and you will definitely be challenged.

Maybe you don't like multiplayer? Maybe you don't like getting your ass kicked in 17 different ways, or you just want to be alone? Then play singplayer. Unlike most games where the singleplayer is tacked on, and nobody cares anyway because SHOOTEN OTHAH PEOPLZ the singeplayer for this game is damn good. Every nation has like 8 or so different missions, that are /somewhat/ copy-paste between, but they're all pretty good in their own right.

And if that's still not enough? Step right up to the workshop folks, we got literally everything you want. More units? Hell yeah. More nations? Definitely. More maps/missions? I shouldn't even have to answer that.

TL;DR: This game can satisfy almost any WW2 enthusiast's dreams. Singleplayer, multiplayer, doesn't matter, they're both good. Not satisfied with what you have? Head down to the workshop for even more. You're literally making a mistake by not buying this game. Fucking do it ya pansie, 30$ is well worth it for a game of this quality.

9,33003629,english,"Its great for a little while .
 
Pros .
1. Its great, the gameplay, the amount of historical accuracy is just great.
2. The controlls are good but they can be a hassle though.
3. Alot of the mods which are great, fill in the gaps of the game.
4. It can run on normal computers, i have the newest model of the HP Pavilion 510 and on custom settings with good graphics it hit's around 30 to 21 FPS, not the best but still good.
5. Great if you want a good WW2 sim like strategy game with some good action and it can be a little challenging though but thats what i want a good fun challenge.

Cons.
1. The game by itself is not great, all five countrys (U.S.A, Germany, Japan, USSR, U.K) campaign missions are just copy past, if you want a great WW2 strategy game experience you will have to download a shit ton of mods
2. Cant play multiplayer with A.I, if anyone finds out how to play with the A.I on multiplayer please message me 
3. The A.I can be stupid, say you have a tiger tank and tell it to retreat it will turn all the way around and expose its ass to the enemy tanks then boom you just lost your tiger, but you can manualy control the tanks to back up not turn around 
4. The tanks guzzle down fuel way to fast, i was half way across the map when my tiger just ran out of fuel, i had to wait 3 minutes in order to get a supply truck from base to the edge of the front then refuled it, it pissed me off a little but thats realism for ya.
 
  I do recommend it though its one of the best WW2 strategy games i have played and its just fun to play, but i recommend once you get it, get Robz realism mod so its a true WW2 simulater.",1498760621,1498760621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198375501697,44,2,7380,0,1847,1600503698,,

36,32754497,english,"I could smell jerry on the other side of the sandbag. His breathes were deep and constant, woven with whimpers of german. Although I couldn't translate what he was saying, the emotion was deafening. 

As I was finishing rummaging through his dead comrades, I cursed as I only found SMG rounds when I had a bolt action. I could swear he laughed at me with an accent. We both knew one of us was going to die, maybe even both. Call it telepathic or natural instinct, but we both knew each other knew as well.

As I was about to make my final push, the rground rumbled. Sand shoke violently off the sandbags, the ground shaking with impending  doom. Was it friend or foe? Was it a thundering elephant on a loose, or a german tiger? Do they have tigers in germany? Concentrate you fool! The rumbling intensifed, seemingly coming to a head, but silence. Was I imaging it? No. Earthquake, in the middle of a battle? Doubtful.

As scenerios clouded my mind, a blast went off like a cannon from hell. The shell carved through the air laced with heavy grey smoke. When it reached its destination, its hard to say if it met its intended target. As I gazed to my rear, I could tell it had. A sherman sat in an ackward position, disfigured and destroyed. One crew member managed to get out. He promptly pulled out a wrench and got to work repairing. It was odd to see but for some reason I believed. I believed he could repair that tank. And I had to give him a chance.

I moved like a striking snake, one seemless movement. I stood, I killed the confused german laying prone in the opposite direction. The hell was he doing? The turret started moving my direction, but I was fast. I blitzkrieged that god damn tank. For some reason I was too far away to throw my AT grenade, so I got close enough to know it was gonna blow my ass away too, great design. Here I am about to be the hero and some jackass decided this distance was reasonable to take out this monstrocity of german engineering.

64,31405047,english,"Having put more than one or two hours into this game, I think it is about time that I write a review for this game.

Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is one of the best WW2 RTS games that I have played, and in my opinion, it is much better than its competitor, Company of Heroes, in many ways (*cough* no shooting through hills *cough*).

[h1]PROS[/h1]

+Decent AI. I found that the AI in this game, while not the best, definitely puts up a good challenge. Infantry controlled by AI seek cover and can sometimes be difficult to root out of a defensive position, and while micromanaging can give you the upper hand, player controlled infantry will automatically duck behind cover and heal when necessary. While tanks are generally a bit more janky when controlled by the AI, they still tend to get the job done.

+Realism. While not the most realistic game ever made, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 can be much more realistic than other games at times, especially with mods such as RobZ's Realism Mod. Infantry out in the open don't last long, as a few rounds is all it takes to drop somebody, and the armored combat isn't based off a cheesy hitpoints system; rather, armored vehicles either deflect incoming projectiles, or they penetrate the armor and damage any crew members or parts of the tank that may be behind.

+Intuitive Editor. Many editor programs for games can be very confusing and difficult to use, but the GEM Editor for the Men of War series is by far one of the easiest I have used. There is a learning curve to it as always, and scripting missions can be a bit harder, but making maps almost can't be any easier, and it is especially fun to make small scenarios and edit it in real time, as missions can be started and played in the editor.

+Mods. I have to admit that many of the official missions aren't the greatest, and it is largely a port from Men of War: Assault Squad 1 (More on that later). However, the amount of different mods and missions on the workshop make up for this. There are excellent missions on the editor along with complete game overhauls and added content that helps mix things up and keeps the game interesting.

+Graphics. Men of War: Assault Squad 2 has decent graphics, and are well optimized as well. Several textures look very pixelated and smudgy, unfortunately, but the vast majority look relatively good.

+Inventory System. Each unit in Assault Squad 2 has their own inventory, allowing you to adapt to an evolving battlefield or plunder the enemy for ammunition and supplies. For people who are less fond of micromanaging, supply trucks and boxes will automatically distribute ammunition and bandages to infantry and vehicles, in some cases, within a given radius. However, those who are willing to put more time into their units find that they can scavenge for grenades, ammunition, and tools to build fortifications, as well as abandon their weapon for a more exotic enemy weapon. Rifleman with an M2HB machinegun? Check. Mount an MG42 on an American halftrack? Check. Send a suicide bomber into enemy lines armed with nothing but dynamite? Check.

+Direct Control System. If you are always furious at AI doing stupid things that generally get themselves and others killed, then a direct control system may be of benefit. In Assault Squad 2, you can take direct control of any unit, able to move and shoot yourself, but in a top down perspective. This is extremely useful when you need something to target a specific enemy, or need a unit to be more precise in its movements and engagements.

[h1]CONS[/h1]

-Men of War: Assault Squad 1 Re-make. Apart from being a little shinier than its predecessor with a few extra campaign missions tacked on, Assault Squad 2 is largely a paid update, and a major kick in the teeth for those who owned Assault Squad 1, whose multiplayer no longer works. If you didn't own any of the original games, this doesn't affect you, but it was very frustrating nonetheless for those who supported the series earlier on.

-DLC. Every game has DLC these days, but the DLC for Assault Squad 2 is both appalling and overpriced. The Iron Fist DLC adds some extra missions for a whopping $10, and the Airborne DLC does the same thing, while also locking the use of AI in multiplayer behind a paywall. The Deluxe Upgrade, coming in at $7, is more geared towards supporting the developers, though it doesn't offer many benefits at all, giving a free achievement and a small XP boost that doesn't really matter.

-Physics. Physics engines are hard to get right, but the physics in Assault Squad 2 is downright bad at times. Some objects like small rocks can stop tanks dead in their tracks, even if they have momentum and should realistically be able to go over it. As for light vehicles like jeeps and motorcycles, expect them to flip over frequently, like when you accidentally nudge a wall and your jeep slowly tips backwards and over before exploding.



Men of War: Assault Squad 2 has its downsides, but overall, it is an excellent real time strategy game that combines many unique elements to form a game that stands out from others.

73,31224282,english,"[b]Men of War Assault Squad 2[/b] is an [b]rts game[/b] that has touched a part in me that no other games apart from [b]Call to arms[/b] that has never really come that close. As a teenager I used to make models using [b]Airfix[/b] and once when I was 12/13 years of age I built a model in school from using paper mache. 

The model representing a typical no mans land of [b]World War 1.[/b] I constructed the map on a large oblong wooden board. I used matchsticks for designing the wooden floors inside trenches and very thin wire scrunched up for a barbed wire effect with painted matchsticks that would ideally serve as wooden poles for keeping the barbedwire together creating an appropriate realism. 

When I would take the model home I would sit there for hours repositioning my plastic soldiers and vehicles that I had bought or made using [b]Airfix.[/b] The fun times I had then thinking back now makes me realise much more how grateful I am to own such a wonderful creation in my games library. My imagination then as a teenager is exactly the same now as when I build my [b]maps[/b] for the [b]Men of war Assault  Squad 2 Workshop.[/b] As I always get that exact same blueprint thrill now as I did when I was much younger. 

The best part about [b]Men of War Assault Squad 2[/b] is the [b]Steam Community Workshop.[/b] The amount of goodies on there is basically a [b]gamers paradise[/b] for updating their [b]MOWAS2.[/b] 

Think of it like this.

If the games updates suddenly ceased on the developers side, well the [b]Steam Workshop[/b] carry on the updating process for many years to come like the new generation of gamers say 20/30 years from now. I always like to think how my [b]workshop maps[/b] being still appreciated by the future generation of new gamers to the growing compilation of [b]Men of War.[/b] 

Also the whole point of the [b]Steam Workshop[/b] is that the [b]modifications[/b] there is a great contribution for keeping [b]Men of War Assault Squad 2[/b] alive & strong for many years to come as they serve as updates for the game anyway. Check out the [b]Steam Workshop[/b] here http://steamcommunity.com/app/244450/workshop/

[b]Men of War Assault Squad 2[/b] is a game that has saved me so many times when wanting to feel that old feeling again as I did when building my models as a teenager all those years ago. As I said up there no other game has ever really come that close.

The highly detailed combat experience is very unique: looting wreckage and enemy supplies, refueling tanks, picking up your favorite weapons dropped on the battlefield, putting each individual soldier behind proper cover to maximize their usefulness, or, more interestingly, penetrate enemy tank by firing an AP through wall...
However, I think more could be done to make it more epic:

1. Add more faction-specific music. In the whole gameplay, there is just one or two BGMs. The BGMs are not bad though, but makes the atmosphere slightly plain.
2. Add some historical intro content to each battle. Like operation battle Axe, battle of Kursk... If the designers could add a 20 to 40 seconds movie clip introducing the historical background before the game loads, it could be very educational and elevate the immersion to a higher level.

There's no need for good single player when you CAN MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE PLAYER! The editor mode is the sole thing I do with this game, and I've had more fun designing my own missions/throwing thousands of dudes into a meatgrinder than I ever would have trying to play what the devs made. 

My recommendation is to get RobZ realism mod immediately as it turns the game into more of a realistic experience (not to mention makes the character models look better/gives weapons actual ranges instead of maxing at 60-70 meters. The only downside is that the FoW is still present with sky boxes so depending on what skybox you chose you won't see some of the dudes you're engaging but that won't matter when you just watch the armies clash and take pictures like I do.

- Tanks have realistic reacting armor which can deflect / make engines burn or shoot of wheels and such.
- Good physics in the game, if something blows up and lands on a soldier, they are squished.
- Tons of hours worth of content.
- Really pretty graphics and lots of settings for you to play around with.

Cons.
- It does not function that well under load, lots of units and such going on.
- The combat can be strange without mods, soldiers can be bullet sponges.
- Difficulty settings just floods you rather than attacking you smarter.
- Co-op does not function that well, when you buy units it splits em 50/50 so you have to manually 
give em over to your friend.

Different from men of war assault squad there is a editor mode where can create your own battles/scenarios to play with friends, just to have a bit of fun or post it on the workshop to share with many other people so they can play you Scenario.

50,30677324,english,"If you're like me, and you've always wanted an rts game that felt as realistic as possible, without making it boring, then have I got a game for you!
First off, units have a limited supply of ammunition, grenades, first aid kits, explosives, etc per soldier. Now, this IS NOT a bad thing, as it adds an air of suspense when it comes to pushing your attacks forward or defending, you have to keep your weapons firing, and your men in good health. To do this, you can loot ammunition, and supplies from dead enemies (or friendlies), capture a control point and resupply at the large cache of crates there, or bring up a supply truck (keep it covered by buildings and decently far away from your front line, you don't want it exploding while you've got two squads resupplying). And your troops will always share ammunition between the squad automatically as long as they are close enough to eachother.
Second, vehicles have crews in them. If your tank is destroyed, the crew may still be alive and able to fix it and get it back in the fight! This is especially handy, because anti-armor weapons and tank rounds ACTUALLY work in this game and vehicles can effectively one shot eachother a lot of the time.
Third, you can actually save your men from an untimely demise with medics in this game! Most times if one of your mens health reaches zero, he'll be incapacitated and start bleeding out. From there you have a limited amount of time to get a medic to him to revive him. Just make sure the rest of your squad is covering the medic while he does his job! I've probably saved a battalions worth of troops just by always attaching one medic per squad.
Fourth: There's a kick ass Star Wars mod in development for the game that you can download and play, and a TON of people have made maps and mission packs for it!

All of these were things that I personally always wanted in a game, but... It wouldn't be a review if I didn't mention the bad too...

1. German tanks are OP. They have much better armor and weaponry than most tanks in the other factions. Typically if I wanted to take out German tanks, I either needed an anti tank gun, or I had to hide troops somewhere the tank was about to pass by and hit it with AT weapons and AT grenades. Reason being, as I mentioned earlier, tanks and vehicles can one hit eachother. There's nothing more frustrating than using your dwindling funds to call in a brand spanking new Sherman from battalion HQ, only to have it get demolished as soon as it reaches the front lines, and your crew that managed to survive and crawl out of the wreckage can't repair it.
2. Missions repeat eachother. Basically the first mission in the American campaign is the same as the first in every other factions campaigns. Same goes for the second mission, and the third... You get the idea. The maps aren't quite the same, but they will follow the same basic layout, and have the same objectives.
3. Machine gunners in each squad don't carry enough ammunition and always run out WAY before anyone else in their squad will. The only counter measure to this is to loot dead enemies for their precious machine gun ammo.

Even so, the cons I've stated are really only minor gripes compared to just how good this game really is. I HIGHLY recommend it, especially if it's on sale.",1490226364,1490226364,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198013536145,97,2,3523,0,1400.0,1581229173,,

1.)The Single Player ""Campaigns"" are fun the first time through, after that they are basically ALL copy pasted.  For instance the 1st mission as Germany will basically be a copy paste of the first mission as the Russians.  So ya, very little work went into the ""Single player aspect"" from the devs, but there are some AMAZING mods that add a ton of content. 

2.)This game makes it's name by being ""Realistic"" to some extent, but what really turns me off is how fragile the tanks are.  Sure your Tiger/IS-2 is pretty much impervious to other tanks, but heres the deal. One infantry guy sneaks up to them, they are dead. One AT Grenade is enough to snuff a tiger, rather than just blowing off the tracks or causing superfical damage, no one AT grenade is enough to kill an IS3.

Battles can take more than 1 hour to win and there is non-stop action throughout it. You can get very tired and stressed without pausing. Victories are incredibly rewarding even at normal difficulty.

Community is fairly nice and helpful.
Even lower graphics seems great.
CONS:
This game can lag like hell
The AI us fucking stupid
The tutorial is mediocre at best It really only teaches you how too move units and spawn newer ones.
the physics can be stupid(such as touching a destroyer truck and having your tank becoming a ballistic missile)

You can play through numerous single player missions which are great fun, and also play skirmish mode and set up your own scenarios.  There's no meta or overpowered strategies, everything has a counter - the most elite infantry squads can be wiped out in seconds by a well placed machine gun, and the strongest tanks can be annhiliated with hidden soldiers with AT grenades.

The game features multiple unit types and kinds with their own strengths and weaknesses. There is a campaign, however there is no story connecting battles so one might as well discount story for immersion. In game audio provides some aide to immersion, though it also can be a detriment to immersion due to inconsistency of performances. The game includes aspects of it's combat system which contribute to difficulty and immersion, and will be addressed in that section(5/15)

DIFFICULTY: The game has basic difficulty options, though how these affect gameplay are not adequately explained. One  option is the ability to toggle ""fog of war,"" which has seems to have more impact than other difficulty settings is not included in difficulty. To the game's credit, the user interface does not contribute to difficulty. Logistics are a concern in the game, which contributes to difficulty, though some units seem immune to it, while others are not. Players will also notice battle maps contributing to difficulty in substantial ways, though it may not be clear to newer players. Overall the game is incredibly complex and any attempt to encapsulate the extent of the concept of difficulty as applies to this game would miss something.  5/15

LASTING APPEAL:  The game lacks variety, battles will either be assault or defense and counter-attack. Factions have different units with slightly different stats, but ultimately there does not appear to be substantive difference among them. What it lacks though in variety it compensates for in simplicity, the game may not survive extended play sessions, but it does seem to provide a quick infusion of RTS gameplay. Players thereforce are strongly suggested to play one battle at a time for maximum enjoyment. 5/15

OVERALL: MoW:AS2 seems to do what it says on the proverbial tin. It's not a terribly engaging with complex story game, it is a quick RTS distraction, and should appeal to RTS players. The unexpected depth of the game may not appeal to all gamers though.  Subjectively speaking, this sort of simple, play a battle here and there game is a lean market, and additional games set in different periods would be appreciated.

Now, there is a LOT of modifications to this game, and one that i couldn't avoid was ""RobZ realism mod"", now this one in particular makes your game have an incredible ambient, realism and immersion, some features of this are: New units, improved damage system for tanks, changed sounds, and overall a really good immersion, for being an ""strategy"" game.

-Many units to choose from
-Soldiers can pick up grenades or pick up fallen weapons
-You can make a soldier loot a dead body for ammo
-Realistic tank damage (hull damage, tracks hit, ammunition rack on fire, etc)
-Fun multiplayer if you play with friends
-Workshop is full of maps, missions and mods to further improve your gameplay
-Theres a editor where you can create your own maps, missions and battles

It's very graphicallly detailed, and even more can be brought out from Steam's Workshop community. Everything from new missions to maps, and from infantry to vehicles. There are some very talented poeple still working on this game.

You can play solo, or with friends, and from small skirmishes to fully blown out campaigns. You can also choose many countries to play as well. Along with this, you can micro manage your squads to varying degrees, according to your comfort zone of management. It's a very detailed game.

One warning though, there are no hand-holding tutorial missions, so if you're not adapt to playing these type of games, then you have your work cut out for you. Fear not though, I did [i](after a couple of hours playing)[/i] find an in depth tutorial section in the game. They are done in categories with videos to [i]""Show & Tell""[/i] how things work.

The game has a couple of DLC's that I think are worth getting, and playing with. All-in-all, I think this is worth a shot for you WWII fans out there.

This game just lacks the spit and polish to make it great. There are the solid foundations of a good game here, but it's let down by a unintuitive UI and your units' bad, helpless AI. All the foundations are there, but the game is very often too frustrating to play. 

As an example, you very often give one of your units - Usually this happens to tanks, cannons, and other long ranged units - The order to shoot at a certain area, because you know there are enemies there. Your unit will then aim it's at the place, and then just not fire. The reason is that there's some obstacle, usually a small hill that you didn't notice, between it and the target. This is not indiciated to you in any way - If you tell a unit to fire at a spot it can't hit, it will just stupidly aim it's gun at the spot and then not shoot. 

The UI is clunky, and it's very hard to manage more than a couple of infantry squads and a tank. Late in the game, managing all your stuff becomes a huge chore. Half your guys are out of ammo, half your squads are depleted and you need to merge them, your tank over there has lost it's tracks and needs repairing, and all these things take multiple clicks and lots of manual orders from you to resolve. 

There's also a severe lack of missions - Only a handful of missions for each nation, most of them the same across the nations but wrapped in new terrain.

So - In spite of all this, there are the foundations of a genuinely good game here. Buy this if it's on sale or if you just really like WW2.",1483914990,1483914990,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False,76561197970608393,315,18,444,0,374.0,1519730811,,

This game - and its retarded blind fanboy following - is simply incredible!
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
Its not actually even a game!
Its a very poorly made, clunky, unrealistic simulator of AI controlled units fighting eachother.
You open the game, click single player, and it says ""Continue"". Continue what? Its the first time Ive played the game! Yet there's no other options, just ""Continue"" and ""Load Game"" (even though there are no save games) and ""Chose battle"" (which I found out takes you to the same mission as ""Continue"". (The devs obviously cant speak english - otherwise they might call it ""Start Campaign"")
So you start a mission, and it immediately has your units fighting other units. No explanation. No introduction. Just ""pew pew pew"".
Yet you cant even control more than 1 of those units - and giving instructions to your units does nothing. They dont listen, the controls are clunky, and moving them just results in losing the mission anyway because they die if they move.
So just sit back and watch the fight. Dont do anything (you really cant anyway).

THIS is what you losers call a GAME?
A bad graphics, bad voice acting, bad sound quality, clunky joke of a simulator?
Then I write this negative review and what happens? I get downvoted. People leave comments telling me ""you shouldnt play the game, you should play the editor"" --- WTF?! PLAY THE ""EDITOR""?????????????????

You walk a group of people up a corridor.  You gradually encounter slightly heavier enemies.  You disable but repair every enemy vehicle you see so that you can use it yourself.  You walk to the end of the corridor, it is now your ""field HQ"".  You will at this point have 1 Sherman, 3 Matildas, 1 daimler armoured car, 1 Pz I, 1 Stug, 1 Ostwind, and about 40 assorted infantry.

You get assaulted by at least 2 Marder III, 2 PzII, 4 PzIII, 2 Stug III, 3 Pz V, 2 Tiger Is, assorted halftracks and maybe 100+ assorted infantry.

Everything you have dies prettymuch as soon as it is shot at (Tigers so no surprise really).  Basically the game at that point comes down to crossing your fingers and hoping the bizzare damage system lets your tanks survive a shot.

One big issue I have with the game is the direct control mode. It seems neat at first, but really it's just a way to force you into micromanaging everything your units do, which is a bit tedious in an RTS. Animations in this game are dreadful, and it's horribly obvious when doing certain things like moving in direct control or when your units are swimming.

I do like that you can pick up weapons from dead enemies, the inventory system, the ability to change different types of ammunition, and the lack of base building. Reinforcements come from outside the map, which is pretty realistic. I was never a fan of the base building in CoH. Being able to tow certain heavy weapons such as the flak 88 is pretty neat too.

40,28510068,english,"Men of War Assault squad 2 (or just MOW) is in mine and many other Men Of War fans opinion the best RTS ever made and especially in comparison to games that got much greater acclaim (company of heroes) -criminally underrated. It is very much a realistic RTS in that tactics are very similar to how they were on a real WW2 battlefield.  I have 520 hours on the game and bear in mind I have been playing this game since the first Men of War was released.   

MOW is at least compared to games such as company of heroes very realistic.  On tanks  for example there are no silly health bars to pound away at, and if you want to destroy a tank that is too powerful there are a number of options. Get behind him, flank him, or send in a commando with a rocket or grenade. That one man slowly crawling towards your hated online enemy (and in MOW while playing and especially losing you will despise your enemy!) can decide the whole outcome of the battle. Winning a battle especially against a smug but accomplished friend can leave you on a high all day and losing make you feel terribly bitter! Infantry is realistic too each soldier will have his powers and weaknesses but all soldiers caught out in the open will be obliterated if they come up against an enemy who is well dug in. 

In MOW it pays to be patient and keep calm but as the anger rises when things go wrong people tend to lose their heads and just charge their enemies neck throwing everything they possibly can at their opponent. This is a sure-fire way to lose and although fortune does indeed very often favour the brave and daring initiative you really do have to carefully think about what you are doing and surprise your enemy.  Very much like real war a good commander will have a good temperament and not be irritated or angered by his opponent keep calm and react well to his enemies’ choices.  I on the other had am more prone to raging buffoonery! 
One of the most important things in MOW is to control the map and have eyes everywhere and therefore know in advance everything your enemy is up too. A good opponent though will know this too and you will probably end up in a bitter struggle for every inch of earth! When you start up a MP game you will know very quickly the sort of opponent you are up against. Noobs will stay in there one precious flag attempting to turn it into their own personal Maginot line but good players will attack everywhere at once. Playing a good player can be soul destroying and you will think back lovingly to the last noob you crushed belatedly realizing how hollow your own sense of omnipotence had been. In MOW there are some seriously good players and a thousand different strategies.    

MOW is a game in which you must make choices and react appropriately to your enemies’ choices. There are countless variations of playstyles -aggressive and defensive- and online you will encounter many different people and nationalities who will employ many different styles of play and battle tactics.  For example Chinese players play very well and very defensively. Defensive tactics work terribly for many of us MOW veterans but the Chinese can make it work. They have a system of which each step seems to have been meticulously worked out before hand and they don’t tend to deviate from the plan seeming to have a fastidious understanding of the tank positioning they are using as well as the armour and penetration statistics etc.   

Honestly it’s the best RTS ever made in my opinion but online it’s also one of the most white knuckle and tensest gaming experiences I have ever had. A real heart in the mouth experience especially when playing a close friend it can often actually be a little bit too tense, but when you want to relax and have fun you can play 2v2 or 3v3 with other people.

If you have never played this game before I highly recommend buying Men Of War Assault Squad origins as you will get the original single player campaign (an excellent campaign btw) as well as all of the MOW AS 2 multiplayer components but upgraded to the modern graphics engine. 
In short despite the fact it was always ignored by the mainstream media best RTS ever made and many people in the community agree with me. If only more RTS developers would follow its example.

I've read many reviews of the game and it seemed to be a good game, ""mix between blitzkrieg and coh"" with some realistic things like penetration mechanics... So I decided to buy it.

I got dissapointed af.

-Camera control is terrible (why moving it up and down is so freaking slow?? cursor goes out of the screen on sides 1/2 times)
-The game is absolutely NOT noob friendly (atleast to me...)
-Multiplayer battles are a mess (1h to get in a working battle above 150ms)
-Multiplayer battles feel like 10fps even if my client is 100
-Why can't I get same units as ennemies online (no tanks no AT and they have mortar, tanks and AT?)

The only good thing about this game is its multiplayer components:
With mods
With MP tournament

The rest of the game sucks:
This game depends upon AI to do basically 99% of all tasks in game, the 1 % is when you are tired of its shit, and take direct control of which is highly recommended during the whole game. Babysitting everything.

The Enemies AI however, are outrightly cheating with Bonus resources for them as well bonus Infantry health. They also have unlimited Ammo as well as map hack. You often see enemies armor coming in through a well placed ambush; but you can't actually ambush it because they know you are there, and will turn around running circle the mid map where they can find through wall hack a place where there are no ambush. AKA you infantry defense.

The difficulties in this game is non-existent:

There are 4 in game Ez-Med-Hard-Heroic

I would say there are 2: EZ-PZ_LEMON difficulties (EZ-Normal) Where you receive bonus like the AI
And the FKING INSANE difficutlies (Hard-Heroic) where you receive penalties such as Less health, Less Reinforcements Points, Less Visibilities. And the AI received extra bonuses as well an unlimited number of armor to chew through your lines of Infantry only. You can't get past this if you are playing alone. It is even hard to 4 people. 4 GOOD people. 

--> The AI also know what you are doing, for example: If your screen is facing the northern part of the map, they will send waves after waves to the south knowing you are not microing such line.

They also know what you are directly controlling as the enemies armor would often focus, through fog of war, on your armor knowing you are directly controlling them. Thus making it difficult to distract them with infantries while you armor flanking.

They also know how to use infantry to go near your infantries in the bushes, to reveal it. They don't do this to normal bushes but only to bushes they know have stuffs in it. They can't get mined.

Many more.

Absolutely loved this game, controversially, the best WW2 RTS game out there, on par with COH.
MOWAS2 was a masterpiece, a game worth investing over Several Hundred hours into playing. 

Only downside, is the fact you have to purchase downloadable content that I found very unnecessary. 
But it all levels out in the gameplay
The game runs smoothly on my computer, and looks Amazing, drawing very close parallels.
Multiplayer works perfectly fine, with a minor downside with the Lack of Variety, due to a majority of the people online have preferred to use 'Germany'

In total, MoW AS 2 is a very rewarding tactical simulation and relatively easy to figure out for beginners while still demanding for advanced players. The only downsides are relatively linear levels/attack waves, but there's lots of fun to be had with the 5 available factions and their respective units. Different game objectives/setups for the different missions help shake up things, too. Your troops usually act pretty realistically, and the restrictions on inventory/ammo/fuel and the simulation of projectiles and hit chances add to the realism.

This game is about micromanagement in a ww2 battlefield what it does very well. 
It is just a thrill to capture a whole base with just a few soldiers. But when not acting corectly you can lose a lot of soldiers. The game is build around realism, it is posible to repair tanks when they are knocked out but not destroyed completely.Tanks in the game do not have a hit bar it is a chance that a bulit hits on the vulnerable places, because of this your tank can be destroyed when the first bullit hits (taking to accaunt the armor thickness) or can be completely functional after loads of hits.

Men of War as2 does not give much improvement over men of war as1. 
But it is better than as1, runs better and has new units and other small improvements.
If you have as1 and you like it a lot buy as2, but keep in mind that it is't a whole new game.

As a conclution the game is a very good world war 2 strategy game with micromanagement.

I've always wanted Men of War Assault Squad 2 and have just recently bought it whilst it is on sale. To be honest, I think that it is a bit rich to call this game a sequal of even a bit stupid to call it Men of War Assault Squad TWO. This just feels like an expansion pack for the first game seeing as they have bought maps back form the previous title to make it look like there are more maps. It just feels a bit cheap for them to do that. The visuals have ever so slightly improved, but there is the same voice acting, menu screen, HUD, death animations, basically look at the last title and everything from that is in this game. I really do fail to see what makes this a new game from the old one. There are some slight differences like the character models and.......actually, I can't really think of anything else that is actually different.

Pros:
1. Good action gameplay with lots of nice little particles everywhere.
2. AI is reminiscent of Basic First-Person Shooter AI: Shoot, Take cover, spot enemies and react accordingly.
3. Ontop of already good AI for an RTS, it also has AI that knows when to retreat or use stealth.
4. A partially ok stealth system, is based on shrubbery or hiding behind walls.
5. Every single unit/vehicle has its own grid-based inventory, meaning you have to take ammo and equipment into account.
6. Accuracy is actually existant and wont just do predefined dps like most RTS's, so the cover system exists.
7. Accuracy/Damage is based on units using the type of guns. ex sniper is good with rifles, Gunners good with MG's, Civilians crap at everything.
8. Vehicles. Also no ""1-man Tank"" bullcrap.
9. Destructible (almost) everything, yes.
10. Bullet lead/gravity.
11. Direct Control System, to inefficiently pretend you're play a Third-Person shooter.

Cons:
1. The damage system is based off weapon damage and not hitboxes. So instead get RobZ Realism Mod to change this.
2. AI can be spastic at sometimes.
3. Some vehicles despite looking like they could hold 8 soldiers can only instead hold 2. *GMC*
4. Some CARS drive like tanks...
5. Inventory isn't realistic but hey, you can have a civilian carry 20 boxes of HMG ammo.
6. Infantry feels ""Sped-up"" and not realistic in terms of movement. Vehicles are fine. (The new update now feels like it's slow motion in order to match the reload times)
7. New update sucks, downgrade back to 3.205 for a better experience.

(Editor)
8. The Editor's ""Stuffing"" search bar does not usually display what letters are typed in. Searched up STG, got assault rifle ammo instead (STG Ammo)

And I'm done, I've spent more hours on the editor than the game itself.

50,26498844,english,"Background: Having just come off of 150 hours on Company of Heroes 2 this game kicked my butt. Like seriously there are not many games that I review that I highly recommend to Follow the Tutorials to the T.  I also never played the First one or the HD Remake of the First One.

The Take on Realism: You have to worry about ammo, medkits, and form infantry columns that are able to tackle a variety of situation from assaulting in CQC or disabling Armor. Repairing damaged vehicles actually takes Real Time Minutes to complete. Individual units within your formations can be targeted and taken out. Nothing is safe out there. On easy difficulty I found myself overwhelmed sometimes with Management that a single MG can pin you down and seal the deal.  To add to this each unit has its own manageable inventory. Like a single rifleman will have 250 .30-06 rounds on him, his M1 Garand, Helmet, Shovel, and maybe a grenade. Your Russian officer will have a pistol, 70 rounds, officer hat. Don’t worry equipment can be transferred between units.

This realism also extends to Line of Sight Mechanics. Most RTS we are used to our units having to rely on sight lines combo’d with a set Range they can fire. Well with this game, your tank can literally shoot in whatever direction if your mouse lets you. So go nuts, shoot across 3 wheat fields into the dirt if you’d like. (See Armor Mechanics below for your True Ranges)

Note: they do give us one freebie with Ammo management and that is a single 8 man unit that you form by mouse dragging Automatically Shares Ammo.  This is great because you can click on one man run him to the ammo truck, load him up with 5000 rounds, run back to the defensive line, rejoin him to a unit and bam, the entire unit is rearmed. 
The Campaign: There are a nice array of factions to play. Though the campaign is a Copy Paste for each faction, it gives you a great way to learn each Faction’s strengths and weaknesses to ultimately prepare you for Online Matchmaking.  The Campaign Scenarios are actually built well to teach you LOS, Direct Unit Control, Defense of an objective, Flanking, Sniping, Armor Control and Field Guns. 

Direct Control: There are a few other games I have seen in recent years that allow Direct control over units within an RTS.  There are a couple on Steam but I fail to remember their names.  Direct control happens in a 3rd person Top Down view. Note that this is a Single Unit. A Single Man, a Single Tank, etc. 

In this mode you control all aspects of the Unit, aiming with mouse and movement that you can modify to be the Arrow keys or WASD. I highly suggest getting used to this mode as it is invaluable at all difficulty levels. Direct control of a tank is superior in all ways and will help you survive online and in the Scenarios.

Armor Mechanics: I’m going to distill this down to as simple as I can. Scoring a hit on any Vehicle is factored in by a number of ways. Your unit has armor penetration values applied at 3 different ranges. This is to say how much armor it can penetrate at a given distance. This is then compared against glance values and Armor Values of the Target to determine if the shot glances off with a visual market, or penetrates the Armor and scores a hit. Now in addition to kill hits, there are track hits that cause you to be unable to move and turret hits which cause you to be unable to rotate the turret. 

To add to this you have ammo types that can modify their target values and properties. HE for Infantry, AP which you have very few of for Armor Busting, and general shells.  Armor values are also generally weaker on the sides and rear.
What all this means is that your angle, gun values, and range all factor into your success in Armor vs Armor fights. What this also means is that if you’re going up against some heavy Panzers in light British armor you’re going to have a bad day if you don’t Flank immediately. 

Infantry Mechanics: Infantry can be given 3 positions, standing, crouching, and prone. They are outfitted for their role on the field as general Riflemen, Snipers, AT crew, Tank Crews, and various Specialty units per each faction. Gun accuracy values are compared to the target’s use of cover and range from your position to determine hit factor. When you direct control a snipe get used to being able to quickly identify enemy AT carriers, it’ll make your life 10 times easier. 

Final Thoughts: If you can survive the super realism (On the scale of video games) and the micromanagement aspects. Then this is the WWII Simulator for you. However if you are on the fence about RTS in 2016 and want a more straight forward more forgiving game then I highly suggest Company of Heroes 2.

I never play public games because I am a scrub, but if I did, I certainly would get my ass handed to me by the more experienced players. 

I have been playing this game with a friend a lot recently, usually on hard/heroic difficulty, and here is my review. 

To start, the menu/interface is fairly simple to navigate. Whether it be online or singleplayer, but the gameplay and game mechanics are certainly confusing. To the point where I had to seek out guides on how to do something, or how to properly manage my troops in game. This will need work in any future installments, perhaps an official guide with the release or some form of tutorial/introduction mission to get new players used to the controls and how to micromanage certain units or objects.

Secondly, the multiplayer mode where you have to capture certain points is fun and all, but I've noticed that the AI enemies rush the capture point, and then seem to lose all their MP (Man Power) halfway through the match and simply stop sending out units altogether. The same can be said for the players as well, it's as if the Manpower stops rising completely, this is very confusing and makes the matches way too easy at the end. (Even on heroic difficulty)

77,26290380,english,"I've now managed to rack up 136hrs on this game, yet I haven't regreted a minute of it. The extensive detail in the models, landscape and particle effects, enables this game to come to life with its realistic qualites. The game has also a good length campagn with multiple missions for each of the 5 factions. Each of these missions will take up through my experince a minimum of 30min. MoW have also included online gamplay adding more depth to the game if you enjoy the more socail and interactive parts. The multiplayer is similar yet different where the gamplay is more fast paced. I find it is more stratigic as you are competing against another person and relies more on points you earn via holding objectives. It reminds me off other games such as Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, yet I would argue this is a far better game.

MoW have also included an Editor section of the game where you are given the power to do what anything you want whith the extense options and diverstiy of viechles and units. This is where I have spent most of my time and probably my favorite part of the game. This 'sandbox' is what I think distinguishies this from any other similar genres. And this alone would be a reason why I would urge you to purchase it. The game was launched in 2014 and boy it could have been launched now and still I would be inpressed by what the creatures have done with this game. Definatly worth £19.99 and as it is the halloween sale whilst I'm reviewing why ould not spend £4.99!?

However their are aspects which I do not necessarly agree on, this includes: The fireing range of the figures and their awarness to their surroundings (hopefully this shall be worked upon in future MoW games), the programing and use of planes and boats and the hitpoints the figures have been programed with. 

- Firing range and awarness. If you find this slightly anoying as I do their are mods such as Robs Realism mod which perfects the game (in my opinion) giving greater firing range and awarness to the units. However I do feel that the MoW need to work on how the units use the environment to flank, hide behing cover and retreat/advance.

- Planes and boats.
This is another aspect of the game im slightly upset by as this would of been revolutionary if they managed to pull this off. If they made using planes and boats as easy as using tanks and units it would of made this game even better and definatly a must buy (not saying that its not). For example if the ai could controll the planes or boats, and maybe a deeper and more critiqual look to the detail in the sky maybe a view where you can see dog fights happening and another view like the one there is already installed in the game?

-Hitpoints and Hitboxes.
This is my last criticism of the game, even though this is a minor point I would of prefered if the units had hitboxes for certain parts of their body. e.g. Headshot = double damage and leg = half damage etc... However these are minor things and shouldnt sway your decision for not investing your time and money.

I hope this has helped any prospective buyers or anyone just interested or have the game.

I am soooo tiered of games that the units engage in combat with auto hit system (al la starcraft) so it turns into a health bar drainage with not to hit or miss possiblity. Basically an rts water balloon fight to see what unit counters what and drains health bars quicker than other units as the main focus. The person who click manages the build system is the one who comes out on top usually. 


None of that here...each unit is spawned based on objectives like coh but more realistic. Each unit has a personal name, gain experience based on performance, and have attritional statistical values that contribute to a hit or miss attack as well as variable damage. Each section of the map is an all encompassing campain, not a region that loads once you arrive there trigering the ai at that monment to take action. 

THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC ...HOWEVER....

Biggest complaint tho with this game....WHY IN THE HELL Do THE UPDATES KILL THE PREVIOUS SAVES!!!
EFFECTIVLY THIS GAME IS BROKEN! you will never get through the campain before they pull a mandatory update again one day and render all of your previous saves unreadable! its the single most rediculous thing ever. In fact I dont know a game that does that. But yeah, You will continually have to start from the beginning with the way its set up. loose all your  hard work and experienced units that carry over to the the next fight becuase they dont know how to code the saves to work with new versions of the game once its updated. so you just loose it all!",1477248196,1477248196,False,6,0,0.583781123161315918,0,True,False,False,76561198032091093,196,12,1356,0,896,1512379121,,

Great WW2 strategy game.  Not a 4x type game, but you can easily slow the battles down to a speed that your comfortable with. Not like most strategy games where you have an overall map and decide your path.  This game has 6-10 different maps for each of the 5 major factions of WW2 except Italy for some reason.  Do you want to have 1 soldier be Rambo and do everything?  Do you like being a sniper and picking off your enemies from relative safety?  Do you like playing tanks and smashing/blowing up anything that moves?  You can do all these and more.  Command large armies to conquer the map.  The physics are surprising well detailed and thought out.  Bounce Anti-Tank shells by angling your tank.  Toss a grenade on to a tank's engine for fire/explosion.  This game has tons of potential and a modding community that really takes the game to its true goals.

Improvements - Hate that a year after I bought the game, the Company changed the minimum requirements so that my old computer can't run this anymore without crashing.  I mean, if this was a MMO, I can understand, or something that was constantly getting DLC or expansion packs.  But this game had been static for a very long time, and except for the mods, didn't need its requirements changed.
- Missions, unforunately, you pretty much do the same 5 missions on each of the factions, like maybe 1-2 missions are truly unique to that faction.
- Ammo resuppy is still messed up.  Unless your able to move soldiers to just hang out around an ammo truck for long periods of time to get them to resupply 1 stack of ammo every minute, what is on the truck is pretty much all you have to pick from.  I mainly get most of my soldier's ammo from the dead, thankfully, there are only 2-4 types total in the game.  Biggest draw back is using tanks that don't have that same option.  An enemy tank may have the same size caliber of gun as your tank, but the ammo still doesn't work for it.  Ammo trucks worked great until they changed it in a patch a long time ago.

All in all.  This is a great game, for a great price now.  Mods really make this game stay alive and fun to play as well as the multi player option. Recommend 9/10.

This game also has a very avid modding community with a lot of cool mods to add maps or missions or even new factions to play as.  You can play by yourself or with friends, the singleplayer campaign (which has no story cus its an RTS) is ok, most of it is just reskinning and copy and paste, but i didnt notice it for a while so its not to bad. Also the single player autosaving is great because if you fail you can keep trying different tactics and approaches until you have a breakthrough. I would definitly recommend buying if you are looking for a quality RTS or a way to hone your RTS skills.

30,25573283,english,"The game isn't bad if you like a game with sand box and mods so you can make your own scenarios but the AI's are so f*cking brain dead that its not even funny anymore.(I'll get in to this later)
Also the fact that this game keeps rapidly updating not giving mods a chance to work and people who have the mods don't get a chance to play it!

Now on to AI. The AI is so damn brain dead its unbelievable. first of all the units.
When breaching a building you send a squad in to the building to clear out a squad of people first thing 3 oout of the five squad mates are killed by a guy with an SMG and once they've progressed in the building its a stand off and everyone who goes up to the top floor instantly gets killed.
What I also hate is the fact that you tell a soldier to throw an anti tank grenade at the tank and it runs right in front of the tank and it takes five god damn seconds before the guy actually throws the grenade and by the third second the guy is already dead.
Now the ability to control your unit. It is so broken due to the fact that when you try to aim at the enemy the soldier aims a completely different way plus the fact that when using the bolt action rifles they do jack sh*t to the soldiers.
The AI is so brain dead that they think an enemy is still alive when the enemy has been dead for 10 minutes and they waste a whole mag on the corpse.

Now the vehicles
The vehicles are so annoying due to the fact that they ram through everything. You try to get them to migrate round a corner NOPE JUST GONNA RAM THROUGH THE BUILDING BECAUSE F*CK LOGIC :D! Plus the fact that when you send them to a location they give ZERO f*cks if there is a friendly soldier sitting there, they just ram over the guy completely turning him in to nothing but a helmet and a pool of blood.
Plus the fact that the actual rounds the tanks fire are fucking nerf darts as they do jack shit to a tanks armour even if it is a tank destroyer and also the act that they shoot a tank in front of them point blank and miss.

Now I personally like this game cause I love the fact that you can make your own scenarios and I don't really mind the AI and such as I have a mod to fix that. But if you are a person who likes a realistic strategy game that the AI acts perfectly.

-You can mod it up the wazoo

-Games can be extremely long, some upwards of 1 hour

Instead of researching technologies or building barracks, Men of War allows you to get reinforcements through ""mp"", which is steadily gained no moatter what. The rate can be improved by capturing ""strategic points"" which are usually marked by a flag. This will show the controlling team's flag as well. Soldiers then run from outside the battlefield into a team's spawn, and then you have reinforcements. Likewise, actual gameplay mechanics diverge from standard rts. The focus moves away from the types of units used and towards what you actually do with them. For example, you can move units into cover and buildings, allowing them to gain protection in certain directions respective to where you put them. Medics can also revive fallen units for a certain time, although (and correct me if I'm wrong) I believe there is a certain number of times a medic can revive a soldier before the soldier stays dead.

Let me say that I was only interested in this game after watching a YouTuber play this game and pit squads of men against each other, and I thought it would be cool to edit the maps and use the mods to do so. But I was wrong. The map editing is incredibly complicated, and to understand how to even conjure up a simple field with a house you need to read a guide online somewhere. I am a casual gamer and I like to play simply and easily, but this game's map editing is not like that. It isn't meant for simple casual gamers like me. However, the game itself, the missions and what not, are enjoyable. But I don't want this game for the missions because I have so many RTS games for PC and console that are better, (Total War, Comman & Conquer, EndWar). I wanted the games for the mods and map making, but I should've done more research beforehand. The game's AI are all scripted and don't react to the player's action, unlike Total War, where enemy movements are based on player movements. Another big reason I don't want this game is that the game is sold to you in DLCs. There's the regular game and there's a deluxe edition. I thought the Deluxe was the one to buy because I was thinking back to Rome Total War II and how they released an Emperor's Edition which was actually a step forward, but the Deluxe Edition of this game isn't anything special, it's just better looking. The biggest reason I dislike this game is that the game does not come with a custom battle mode, whre you select troops for both sides and fight. This game has a skirmish mode that can be bought with a DLC however, which is really stupid. You can't fight AI bots unless you buy a DLC which lets you fight them in multiplayer. This game really isn't anything special, its the mods that make the game, and if you have the time to create a map, edit files, and have money to buy all the DLC, then I'm sure this game is great.

37,24710079,english,"One of the finest games ever made. 

This is a large review of the game so go to appropriate sections if you do not wish to read the entire thing.

***Brief Overview of the Game****

Well there are 5 factions. On the Allies side is UK, Soviets and USA whilst on the Axis Japan and Germany.

You have staple ""skirmish"" missions for each factions each with a different emphasis for example defense missions, tank only missions, stealth/sniper missions among others. However I won't go into too much detail into Singleplayer because Multiplayer is where the game shines.

In Multiplayer there is no grinding to unlock certain powerful units, everything is unlocked from the start from a M20 to a King Tiger.

 Now you receive a certain amount of set Manpower each game which on competitive settings is 3000 base manpower plus ""payback"" which usually comes to around 800-1000mp. There is no base building or collecting resources it is a set amount per second until it reaches 3000 with extras coming through payback that is dependent upon how much MP you have already lost and how much CP you have on the field.

CP (command points) is a value that every unit in the game also receives. You are limited to 100 CP on normal settings which obviously means you cannot completely overwhelm the map with inf or tanks. Heavier tanks cost more CP, so not only are they expensive in MP but they also limit your ability to field infantry to cover LOS and attack flags.

***Key Features/Strengths of the Game***

The physics mechanics of the game of completely unique. Unlike most RTS games which work on an arcadey system of hitpoints with certain values working well against other other values ""unit X has 10 pierce damage and 5 blunt damage"", Mowas 2 is quasi-realistic. 

Whilst counters in most RTS are static and predetermined (you know exactly how much damage your unit will do the enemy unit) in Mowas2 that is not necessary the case. It is very possible and does happen that a tier 1 Volkstrum Sqaud can ambush and kill a tier 4 SAS squad if it is ambushed out in the open. 

This is particularily prevalent in tank combat where even an 240MP Damier amoured car 2 pounder gun can penetrate the side armour of a 1250MP Che Ri or even an KT at 2400MP. Of course this requires the Damier to get to point blank range on those tanks in order destroy them and the KT and Che Ri can ""max range"" penetrate the Damier with ease at 140 range. It is this uncertainity regarding counters that adds a great dynamic to the game as not only does allow players to make comebacks if they are behind on MP by using sneaky inf to destory heavy tanks or using superior tank play yourself and killing a superior tank.

Direct Control is the other great strength of this game. The game engine allows you to 3rd person mode control any unit in the game. That is, if you press left Ctrl or E you can manually take the place of the AI and take matters into your own hands. So if you feel like your MG is not doing a good enough job of mowing down an enemy sqaud you can ""DC"" the MG yourself. This is mostly applicable with tanks though (as they are your expensive purchases) as often you will know the weak spots on an enemy tank armour to aim for. 

***Weaknesses of the Game***

A very steep learning curve. This is not like TW where even relatively newby's can put up a good fight and find other relative newby's quickly. Even 30 hours in this game makes a huge difference in your ability. You will get beaten, and beaten badly in a lot of games. There is a lot to manage and consider in this game and you will be overwhelmed at the start. Bear in mind though the better players you play with, the faster you will improve (even if you might lose a bit more). The rewards for getting good at this game are huge though. Close, tight games on Mowas2 are like nothing else, spoken from a guy who has 1350 hours :p

Although the game does look great on high settings, it is very poorly optimized and puts a much greater strain on your graphics card that it should do. Also if one player has poor performance in a game it can lag the game for everyone else which is very frustrating.

The developers have only limited resources. Digital Mind Soft (DMS) are a limited company at this point in time and are spending much of their time working on Call to Arms Mowas2's Modern Era Sequel. It means they are limited in providing support to Mowas 2. Bugs can take time to be ironed out and balance patches take a bit of time. 

***Overall Personal Summary***

This series captures that perfect balance between fast paced gameplay and serious strategy. Unlike many more traditional RTS's this succeed in this game you do not need to have absurd twitch reactions (although of course they help) yet it is not a time consuming slug fest or 'grand strategy'. 

It is the brilliance of the engine the game physics were this game is so unique. The ability to directly control anything you own in a quasi 3rd person mode offers so much more than most RTS's. Especially when given the WW2 focus and the vast variety of tanks you can play with, it is like playing a lite version of WoT or WT except there is incredible amount more depth with combining arms of many different facets of the game - you have to simultaniously manage infantry, tanks, anti-infantry and anti tank assets. 

It was this game which allowed me to get into competitive gaming. Of course I would never put 1300 hours into a game if I didn't have that extra element of motivation namely competing yet still this a quite superb game and I would thoroughly recommend it to anybody.",1470326731,1472212715,True,50,6,0.705327272415161133,5,True,False,False,76561198011893101,71,1,156602,507,80640.0,1601679672,,

50,25081078,english,"I loved the original ""Men of War"" game and played it for hundreds of hours. The only reason I even play this is because the multiplayer doesn't work anymore. The single player in this is a joke, any title in the series that does not have ""Assault Squad"" in the name is actually enjoyable in single player. 

Multiplayer suffered as well. The only maps in this game that are not absolutely terrible are ones that were in ""Men of War"". Most of the maps made for Assault Squad and Assault Squad 2 are horribly designed. Most of the new maps reward retarded gameplay such as boring, symmetrical maps that offer little in the way of tactical planning (since they are exactly the same for both teams) and maps where the first one to reach a certain point almost always wins. Examples of this include buildings placed on one side of a capture zone, giving one player an almost perfect way to protect their men, while the other player has to stand completely exposed.

Artillery in this is stupid. They heavily nerfed artillery's ability to target important enemy positions because of the stupid ""bombardment"" feature where they fire a few shots in a short time with a long reload time instead of single shots. This ""bombardment"" feature makes the artillery pieces that use it quite bad because they waste ammo and the enemy can easily move their men to avoid the shots after the first and they can easily destroy it since your artillery is locked into firing the entire barrage, preventing you from relocating it. The accuracy of artillery was decreased as well. This nerf to artillery means that tanks and tank destroyers play much too big a role in the game. The exception to this is rocket artillery, which has been buffed so much that it can reliably destroy tanks, meaning that USA is overpowered (they have a tank with a rocket launcher on top that not only fires more rockets than any other unit, but is mounted on a tank making it hard to destroy from long range unlike other rockets and allowing it to quickly move back to safety after firing).

Something about the game also allows players to act like complete idiots and somehow succeed sometimes. Time and time again I have seen players simply flood a capture point with men and hide them in a building or behind some cover and it actually works. Tactics like this are absolutely retarded in a game that is supposed to be about realism. Even with a handful of men, you should be able to kill plenty of enemies if they are just running in the open, but they always reach cover and shoot all of your men. Artillery being nerfed means that if the enemy puts a shitload of men behind a building, you have almost no way of killing them except for sending a tank right to the frontline (which is a stupid idea). To try something as ridiculous as that in Men of War would result in all of the men running in the open to be killed very quickly.

Overall, the game feels arcadey and unbalanced. None of the problems from the original game were fixed and none of the new features added make the game more enjoyable. If you want to play single player, just buy ""Men of War"" instead of this game. If you only want to play multiplayer with friends, buy ""Men of War"" and play multiplayer using GameRanger.

It's basically a downgrade of the old Men of War and even to the Assault Squad.
Poor game engine makes everything laggy and even on low settings it stutters a lot. It doesn't matter though, we love this game, so we tolerate it. At least I do.
What did not pass at all, was the developer's sense of originality during creating of single mission/coop. They are awful ctrl+c ctrl+v missions with half being infantry action all the way. YAY. No Single Player campaign we all loved, all along with zhe gorgeous voice acting, none of that 'ere! 
Bunch of things were removed from the game like ability to go through all the boxes, lots of infantry tasks (focus fire etc.).

90,24780851,english,"The game just isn't all that good compared to the two other RTS I play as well (Blitzkrieg 1, Company of Heroes 2)

1. Graphics/Sound
Graphics are not good in this game. Don't listen to reviews that compare this game to Company of Heroes 2. Some textures are sharper, that's true but everything else is worse. The animation system is atrocious, everone looks stuck up, there are no ragdolls or realistic reactions whatsoever. When your troops get hit by an artillery shell in COH, some will die instantly and fly through the air, the rest hits the ground, and the announcer shouts at you that your men are getting attacked. In Assault Squad 2 there is nothing of this, no realistic troops reactions and this takes lots of atmosphere out of the game.
The reason for the shitty animation system is the antique game engine that has been overloaded with effects it can't handle. Some of the other things it's responsible for:
- very low draw distance. It goes to 80m or so and behind everything becomes ugly blue fog
- frequent FPS drops as soon as more stuff appears on the field
- robotic and lifeless looks on everything thanks to crappy animation that is on the level of RuneScape
- flame effects and explosion that look like taken from quake 3
- a camera-perspective that is glued to the ground, you can't zoom out far enough
- confusing interface + orders are often hit and miss and get frequently ignored
- slowing down time will make the whole engine run slower including interface. Pausing makes it impossible to give orders
- attaching units looks very buggy and unrealistic
- really bad music/voiceacting/sound effects

Now when reading this keep in mind that the first COH came out ~2007, that's 10 years ago and this game looks worse in pretty much everything. Actually I think the graphics are worse than Blitzkrieg 1 which is mostly 2D and from 2003, because there the graphic style was well rounded and worked with game.

2. Singleplayer
The singleplayer is horrible compared to both COH and Blitzkrieg. MISSIONS ARE THE SAME FOR EVERY COUNTRY. The 5th mission for the Russians is exactly the same for the Germany/British/Japanese... The whole layout is one exact copy. The map is pretty much the same with a few assets replaced, that's it. Those ""skirmishes"" have no introduction or historical information.
Also the whole setup is super-horrible. If you play on normal your own infantry get an 80% bonus or so over the AI troops. Somehow that's only true for infantry, all AI-guns and tanks are just as strong as yours. To counter that malus you are starting with next to no troops in every level. And the AI has tons of equipment placed already on map.
Now they could have done it like in Blitzkrieg, where you had to break their defenses with limited troops through smart use of combined arms and counting on local superiority. And that's also what I expected from the Single Player, since this game emphasizes micro-management and perfection so hard.
Instead you have to capture victory points that give you better vehicles and more points to call this equipment in.
AI gets 4 infantry squads and 2 tanks (that are always one rank higher than yours) every 5 minutes that charge directly into your lines which forces you to call in lots of infantry because tanks are way too expensive. That makes the whole thing superhard, while at the same time it feels like cheating because of your boni over their infantry. No idea who thought of this concept but it's superfrustrating and no fun.

3. Gameplay
Now I only played singleplayer so far, so I can not say anything about multi (which seems to be much better from what I hear). Gameplay in Singleplayer is a buggy mess and I don't even know where to begin. The balancing problems I wrote above not counting there is so much more stuff just wrong with this game.
Every order you give seems to be an attack mover order. I can tell my infantry to move to run over that field into cover, and they will stop right in the middle of the field stand there and shoot onto some lone infantry men hidden somewhere. Double clicking seems to solve this issue but it's still very frustrating. Because your troops can't shoot while moving they will get annihilated by some hidden mg-gunner, again without any reaction.
It is at no point clear in the game what the visibility of your units is or why they engage some troops and ignore others entirely. At first I thought this was a line of sight issue because the map somehow makes every terrain look flat so it's easy to miss hills. But I also had troops not firing on enemys for absolutely no reason and I had to give them an extra order to do it.
Pathfinding for tanks and vehicles is very bad. The nonsensical paths they use aside, they will often get stuck on insible walls or obstacles like other tanks. Instead of driving back and retrying, they will just cancel the order. You can order a supplytruck to the front and it will get stuck at the base for no reason and just sit there until you repeat the order. Direct control is not really a feature but a necessary tool to make your tanks move again. 
Tanks themselves are also very unfun to play because 80% of the time one of their tracks is damaged rendering them immobile. This happens so damn often in this game it's just frustrating. Sure you can repair them, but it takes forever and 10 sec later it's damaged again.
The interface is very clunky and unresponsive with important information hidden from the player. For example: The inventory is opened in a seperate window similar to Fallout 4 or Skyrim. Now you can guess how well that works with 100 infantry-men and 10 tanks waiting to get their supply managed by you. 
The supply system is a mess as well. To resupply infantry you just have to place them around a supply truck and their ammunition fills up. To resupply tanks with ammunition you have to drive your supply truck to the tank and open both inventorys (the inventory of the supply truck is 30% outside of the screen - great interface!). But if you want to refuel a tank you can't just do that even though you see the barrel in the inventory screen. You have to open the inventory with an infantry man, give him the barrel and have him go up to the tank to refuel it. Just one example of how contradicting and unnecessary complicated the game mechanics are.
Neither your infantry-men or your supply trucks have any initiative in keeping the supply chain alive. You can have an one men without ammo just 1 meter away from the supply-zone. And he will just stand there, aiming and trying to shoot his empty rifle [->I know I have complained enough about the shoddy animation, but seriously, When the soldiers aim it looks like those aimbot hackers in Shooter-multiplayer, they just instantly turn around and fire]. 
Same with medics. For people who don't know the game: 95% of the time your soldiers don't die when shot, but are instead bleeding out with a symbol above their head that you can revive them. Now you'd expect that the medic in a squad will handle that himself, but nope, he will just stand there and do nothing.
Sending squads into buildings is also a pain, because of course you want them to stand at the windows and on multiple floors, but you have to click a tiny spot in the building that's impossible to see and sometimes seems to be missing entirely.
And another thing that is really bad is squad management. Squads or cohesion between units doesn't exist. As soon as you click an individual infantry men he is unattached from the rest. Squads don't even do anything apart from sharing a common ammunition pool. Some units don't even appear as squads, when you call in in motorized infantry and unload it, they get out as individual soldiers. How f***ing lazy is that from a game that calls itself ""Assault Squad 2""?!?

Conclusion
The game is not the COH-killer like some reviews here suggest. It's not realistic, it's not fun, it is buggy, frustrating and looks bad.",1470679229,1470679962,False,1,0,0.435931295156478882,1,True,False,False,76561198083539535,72,2,1744,0,1081.0,1542581141,,

But thats just my opinion, some people will be into that some won't. Gameplay is repetitive too which is a bit of a letdown. I'd also like to be able to have better control over enemy ai settings- I turn my back for 2 minutes (literally) and they have spawned 3 tanks and swarmed my positions.

-Low FPS during big fights on beefy systems
-Overall pretty dated graphics
-Small maps
-Low unit cap

The ability to take direct control over each of your units is fun for a while, but in the end it's completely overrun by everything that's just plain bad about the game.

There's a decent tactical edge to the singleplayer campaigns (within the confines of the map and how they designed it for each specific engagement), but multiplayer is just a rush based slug fest for the most part.

Overall it comes together to make a pretty badly optimized, mundane and underwhelming WW2 RTS game. It aims for more realism than the Company of Heroes series but fails, adding ontop of it a bunch of issues that CoH simply doesn't suffer from.

With that being said, the models in MoW:AS2 are well made and the ability to take control of your units adds a new level of playability that some may find more appealing than similar games in the genre, but I can't recommend it based on my experience.

Overall rating: 6/10

Balance Issues exist. AI tanks are OP as hell. I faced an AI with 4 tanks vs his one. 2 of them were recovered tanks that were the same type as the medium tank i was facing. He wiped out all of my tanks, while my units (and an AT gun) blasted away at his weaker side armor from a stopped and stabilized position. There is realism. And then there is absolute lunacy.

Any veteran of RTS games is going to find himself just fine, at least in terms of controls and main gameplay features. 

Diffrences between MoW and its more arcade counterpart *cough* CoH *cough* are quite huge, but the biggest two are realism level and gamemode types. To be fair they are two completly diffrent games.

 You shouldn't just rush with a T-34 and expect to stay alive thanks to your high healthbar, you have to be carefull at all time, because even an Panzer II can wreck your tank in matters of seconds, if it gets you from the rear.
Infantry dies at least 10 times faster and easier than in CoH, it also is 10 times more effective and dangerous. Arty is OP.

As far as gameplay goes, there is no base building and unit production, most of the time you have limited resources or you can call units from out of the map, it depends from a gamemode.

Graphics are mostly good, there is not much to talk about. Physic engine is great and destruction is top tier.  Optimisation is just brilliant.

I strongly recommend this game to any fan of WW2 games and RTS fans. There is also a huge database of mods to choose from, extra nations, even more increased realism, and you can even turn it into a modern RTS with just one mod.

The only problems I would say is the controls, AI, and bugs. There are a ton of controls, some of which are a little wonky like the unit movement function, but I guess it comes with the fact that there are so many functions to use in game. The more serious problem is the AI. The AI don't even respond to your commands half the time, and they sometimes won't respond to an enemy that is shooting at you from literally 5 ft away. And sometimes one of your men will move to a different position without your command. This is particularly a problem in trenches, where sometimes one of your men will jump out of your trench without your command.

If you're looking for the kind of scale you get in a Total War game, you'll be dissapointed, but the fights are pretty much just as good, from my standpoint. It seems to be incredably moddable as well. I've not had a chance to really look into it but there appears to be alot of stuff to make i more accurate and add more difference between the units to make things more interesting to look at.

It's a very pleasent way to spend some time, while it's kinda linear in a sens of 'capture the point and proceed up the map to each one' the need for some tactical fore-thought when trying to take each point is there. A well defended German flag can be a tough cookie to crack, especially if them artillary support and anti-tank guns. Does get a little samey though, because each mission *is* a case of ""Move from bottom-to-top of map, take points, kill enemy.""

Pros:
-Solid campaigns imho. Yes, it is a cookie-cutter of AS1, but I jumped in the franchise at AS2 so I didn't mind.
-Super detailed and modifiable unit inventories
-variety of vehicle types across all factions (Sturmtiger is my favorite)
-entrenching/cover system is very good 
-Artillery of all types is incredibly satisfying to use (especially direct hits)
-Mods
-cool vehicle damage system 
-destroy EVERYTHING
-make infantry squads 1 or like 20 just by dragging boxes (I forget the cap)
-satisfying unit request/purchase system (a lot of mods improve upon this)
-Mods
-multiplayer is fun, but has its quirks
-Mods
-the modding community is very alive and active
-and also mods 

Cons:
-campaign is very close to AS1
-sometimes my units will just die/vehicle disabled (I've experienced this through many updates with seemingly no round or shell hitting it)
-Some mods are clunky
-online is eh (but sometimes fun)
-will keep you up super late because you are hooked

The game can be a bit buggy, but these don't normally detract from the enjoyment you'll get from the game. It's good fun, feels very authentic, and can actually give you a decent challenge at times.

The game is really made shine by the level editor and community mods. These are what gives this game enough juice to give other major titles a run for their money. There are thousands of mods which add missions, others which add extra items, and more.

If you like RTS games and WW2 games this is one game for you, MOW:AS 2 is quite an enjoyable game but yet at times it can be a time consuming RTS game also a quick heads up here-->, (please note that this game is a bit CPU intensive). If you are new to the game some missions on the campaign will probably take you hours or even alot of minutes, but do not worry too much, with a reasonable amount of hours of playing the game you will eventually get uset to the game and you will probably be able to get through all the mission easily on the easy difficulty, also I do not recommend going straight into a battle that isn't matchmaking on multiplayer, otherwise it will be frustrating considering all the skilled players out there that play unranked games alot, but anyways this game has a wide variety of units if you looked in the trailer and 5 different countries to play as, (U.S.A,Germany,USSR,Britain and imperialist Japan).
With that said I do highly reccomend MOW:AS 2 to anyone out there that loves RTS games.

51,24347576,english,"Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a real-time strategy from Digitalmindsoft, a sequel to Men of War: Assault Squad. It's a micromanagement genre but ever since the first Men of War, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 has been reworked for more bigger battles and easier management while still giving the same challenge for tactics.

In gameplay terms, while not so much different from previous titles, not to mention the whole missions from the first Assault Squad are actually here as well, It has been improved so much since release and with patches. For example when your squad is out of ammo, you don't have to actually resupply each of them with inventory control anymore, you can simply call a supply drop with smoke grenade if available, or spawn in a supply truck, each has a resupply ability for your units, even vehicles, as long as it is the right type of supplying units of course. The American airborne drops has also been upgraded, no longer you paradrop a single soldier who will die instantly when he reach the ground, but an actual squad of airborne infantry. Coming with Airborne DLC, now you can play with bots in multiplayer! Even though the bots doesn't really give actual challenge, at least you can have something to play with. Though the bots only available on Assault Zones and Capture the Flag mode. You also get some extra skirmish missions from the vanilla and more from DLC. While there are some improvements, Assault Squad 2 still has much potential to get some extras.

The graphics, while at release is not that different from the first Assault Squad, after many patches, it has been greatly improved especially when it comes to unit models and textures like vehicle and tanks, infantry skins now has winter and desert version for their corresponding maps. Overall the graphics has been indeed improved a lot. The performances are not bad, but surely can see some improvements and fixes. While most of the time there is no stutter or lags, in multiplayer somehow the performances like to drop like crazy at sometime. But in singleplayer there is no issues. This is strange since singleplayer are the one who used more processing because there is scripts and more AI.

Things that Men of War are very great at are modifications! Men of War: Assault Squad 2 now support Steam Workshops for community made content so there's no need to find them on other site, or upload your creation elsewhere. This also makes downloading modifications more easier than before.

Overall, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is quite solid for a sequel, I recommend this!

COH2 is not so much a strategy game, more like a fast paced shooter where you have to simultaneously control 75 characters. Gone is the base building and fortifying and strategising that went into COH1, with COH2 it's basically Leeroy Jenkins time.

So why am I talking about COH2? Well I was searching the web to see if anyone else found COH2 so bad, and it seems I was not alone. And in one particular forum someone mentioned Men of War 2.

I must thank that person, because Men of War Assault Squad 2 is absolutely awesome. It is everything that COH2 isn't.

MOWAS2 feels a lot like COH1, except the graphics are slightly less refined. When I say that, the graphics in MOWAS2 are excellent, it's just that they are slightly less filtered and not so anti-aliased which gives them a sharp look. Not a problem at all, just a slight difference.

MOWAS2 gives you reallt fine grained control of your various squads, and also gives you the time to enjoy playing with them. If things are getting a bit hectic, just hit backspace and put the game in slow motion.

The maps in MOWAS2 are nice and big too, so you don't feel the game play is too linear. 

I'm still fairly new to the game, but have to say this is one of the best RTS's I've played and definitely the best WW2 RTS. If you played and liked COH1, you'll love MOWAS2!

Give COH2 a miss, MOWAS2 is the new benchmark.

Make no mistake. You're paying for a shitty UI change and worse performance just to get MP servers that work.

And to add insult to injury they added a fucking worthless level system. Thankfully the host can disable the XP system but if he doesn't you get to 'enjoy' losing because you can't field anything to counter shit like the Tiger until you level up. I'm not a fan of the special units like the Radio OP either though I can live with them.

It's like MoW with all the worst bits of CoH:2 added. Buy it only if, like me, you're desperate for more MoW MP and too weak to go without. If you wish to play SP buy MoW1 instead since it has actual fucking campaigns.

i made this review way back when i started playing the game.
many things have changed, there were major updates and absolutely insane mods that keep the game at its peak!

if you are the type of person that loves intense, dynamic, epic fights of wwii (and not only as the mods allow you to play modern warfare as well) then this game is for you, you will not regret it, some days ago it had a 1.1 gb update and it made the game a bit more smooth

I'd say this is one of the must-haves for military-inclined players. The modding community keeps the game fresh and exciting. Even though it was just a revamped version of Assault Squad 1, it's still worth a try.

If you're bored with single player missions, play the editor. If you're bored with the editor, try some mods, then try to play it in the editor. Sky's the limit (and the game's programming capability) on what you can do in the editor. 

- A massive Russian charge against an entrenched German position? Check.
- Crash dive a Japanese plane to an American tank? Check.
- Create a commando mission similar to the old Commandos game? Check.
- Make a large map with the AI clashing each other in a decisive battle? Check.
- Massacre an entire group of chickens using a Colt? Check.

The lists will go on and on. You will find some mods interesting that will make you play more.

27,23244836,english,"This game is my absolute favorite speaking of rts games. 
it comes with all the options someone could ask for.
great map/mission editor inclusive.

You can have massive battles with tons of tanks and arty,
you can also have infantry squad based, storydriven stealhgameplay in 
which you e.g. need to lead a group of airbornes to infiltrate a german flakbase.
You can also have both at the same time.

to top it all, the [u] [b] multiplayer [/b] [/u] is great. its possible to launch an 8vs8 battle, 
though, it can causeserious lags and performance drops - depending on the match's option ofc. 2vs2, 3vs3 or 4vs4 is no problem most of the times. gamemodes are 
battlezones (in which you need to capture flagzones, if you keep more than the enemy,
your team will gain points). combat (in which you get points for destroying enemy units)
and some variations of those. you can set the options like how high the pointscap will be, 
the maximum of how many troops someone can call in or lead at once, etc all yourself.

hundrets of different vehicles and units like mortars, mgs, howitzers are awaiting you. the [u] [b] content [/b] [/u] is amazing. mods will deliver you even more, high detailed units or even whole factions.

[u] [b] micromanagment [/b] [/u] is a big thing in this game, though you dont need to take care of each soldiers inventory (yes, thats actually possible). every soldier has a name, skills and his job. you would need to control a soldier to throw a nade into a good spot here and then, but most of the times you will find yourself controlling your favorite tank and hunt down others in direct mode.

speaking of [u] [b] direct mode [/b] [/u], its the thing which seperates it from other ww2 rts games most, imo. you can, if you want, control single units in WASD mode, use the weapon or other items (even throwing knives for the fun of it). nothing is more satisfying than hitting an enemy tank into its ammo depot (the game is doing a great job in hitboxes) in direct mode, causing a huge explosion which will destroy the buildings around it, including the snipers in them. mmh. feels gud man. 

if you want to make a map yourself, do it. the [u] [b] editor [/b] [/u] is a quite easy tool to make super detailed maps, waiting to get released on the workshop. there are plenty tutorials on youtube or on communityhub. i have created a few of them my own, its worth to get the game only for checking out my incredible beautiful maps.

the [u] [b] mods [/b] [/u] will let this game staying alive for long long time. star wars, realism mods, a mod in which you play the sp campaing of call of duty mw2, terminator mod schwarzenegger style, mods which will let you explore the modern war or just simple skinpacks or soundpacks - all available here on steamworkshop.
easy installation and setup.

if you now think [u] [b] ""meh, all i was asking for is a simple rts game"" [/b] [/u], its simple if you want. a simple rts game in which you can call in infantry and tanks to destroy the opposing
armies and conquer some ground. but you can go deeper if you like. 
alot more deeper. and its always better to go deeper no homo.

73,22770156,english,"The ""game"" is simulation. If you've ever wondered how a King Tiger provoked nothing but terror, what a Bofors cannon would do to a village, or how the MG-42 ambushed it's prey, well this game's for you. It's as graphically stunning as it is enlightening. I've learned more about mid century warfare from this game than any predecessor.  The amount of tools and tanks you get at your disposal leaves nothing to desire. Learn how mortars and MGs compliment each other and utilize single soldiers at the touch of a key. 

In this game there is ""no god"" or little to no random number generating. If you don't like how a unit is performing hit a key and micromanage it to victory. Hammer windows with high explosive tank rounds and push into crippled landscapes with your wily storm troopers. 

The games not at fault, the hick-ups lie in the animations and AI. These should not deter your purchase. This game is striving for the moon in realism. It's essentially a WW2 sandbox with a decent campaign and extremely fun multiplayer.

+many greatly detailed maps with differing terrain and setting (open maps, urban maps, desert maps, forest maps)
+every soldier can be a hero (this might sound dumb but hear me out), every unit can be direct controlled and has his own inventory, so when your tank crewman abandons his tank, you can make him grab some explosives and hide behind their lines, and use him as a saboteur to destroy high value units!

0,22562822,english,"This game is both the best ww2 title out there and the worst disaster of a game at the same time.  It holds some great game elements as well as some absolute game design disasters. It is sad to see so much potential getting wasted.

First, the good stuff:
[list]
[*]Let me begin by saying this: After playing this game for a bit, other titles like Company of Heroes really started to look like jokes.
[*]Both infantry and armor gameplay are awesome.
[*]The multiplayer game experience in itself is awesome. No other words for it. It has a very good tempo. The stakes are always high. So much can change in a split second. The balance between infantry and armor is top notch. The arcade element is there and it rewards good play. The best part is, this game is doing all this while keeping a very good amount of realism and detail.
[*]All the factions that the game comes with. Like, really. I see so many people complaining about AI not being free. Ok maybe thats wrong but you guys realize that this is pretty much one of the few ww2 titles that comes with five factions right? Thats gotta mean something.
[*]The mod support. There are mods featuring even the tiniest of ww2 factions. Wanna play as french in 1940? you got it. Would you prefer to play as Poland? Sure thing! You want the game to be much more spectacular and realistic? Tired ot the games linear and unimaginative skirmishes? Do you want to play with star wars factions? Hell, do you want a mod of a weeb anime about schoolgirls and tanks? You have it all. With all the mods there are out there, the vanilla game feels like a mere demo of the full experience. And make no mistake, the vanilla game still has a lot of content.
[/list]

Yeah, it sounds awesome right, Now for the bad stuff:
[list]
[*]Multiplayer matchmaking system. It's not just bad, it practically doesn't exist. You don't have any way to just hop in and play, you have to host a game, wait for people to join in (which takes so much as 20 minutes sometimes) and you have no idea if they are in your level or not. It can be a nice competitive match or just an absolute massacre. This is the result of trying to implement restricted units and having downright unimaginative stupid map designs for current ingame matchmaking system. A game like this shoud have had dedicated matchmaking for individual mods.
[*]Too many settings for multiplayer. This is not supposed to be a problem, but when the matchmaking is broken, some people will never learn about the proper balanced settings of the game.
[*]The skirmishes are linear and repetitive. If you want good single player content you have to go to the workshop.
[*]The difficulty setting of the skirmishes are downright ridiculous. I mean seriously, changing damage infantry takes? I mean how dimwitted you have to be for not realising doing that changes the game's mechanics completely? Being able to run at a mechinegun fire just kills the games experience and gives the beginners wrong expectations about everything. Not to mention that it defeats the whole purpose of having a single player campaign which is primarily educating the player for full multiplayer experience.
[*]Infantry animations look cheap. It is the first thing most of the newcomers will notice and it doesn't hold up with the rest of the game.
[*]Bugs and out of sync issues. Which is much better by now but having constant out of snyc problems for more than year after the launch is pretty bad. Along with the broken matchmaking, this is the reason why so few people play it today.
[*]DLCs are not well thought out. Seriously, mods are better.

24,22466663,english,"This is the most frustrating game I have ever played, but somehow I keep coming back for more. I love playing RTS games, and this one is on top of my list.  Every unit is important during the game play.  Each one gets their own inventory, with access other units as well.  While they start with limited ammo, you can search the dead for more.

Like any game, it has it's down falls.  The biggest peeve I have is with enemy units being able to see mine across the map, while I can't see them.  The more I play this, the more the AI for each unit seems to get dumber.  I had one unit run circles around an enemy as I clicked for it to attack, literally doing circles like a dog around your legs.  It has a lot of little things that make you scream at the game because it's so frustrating.  But it's so addicting, I keep going back for more.

Micro managing is crucial with this game, making it very difficult to master.  The enemy AI (Easy, Normal, Hard, Heroic) are all challenging, almost impossible to play without other friends.  Which is one amazing aspect because you can play every mission with up to 7 other players LAN or internet.  Don't expect to beat a good mission in a short amount of time this game takes lots of time.

I don't like the personal leveling for this game.  You have to beat an entire mission to get an exp., this counts for first person controlling of a unit as well.  There could be an actual storyline for each campaign, not just the same ten missions for each country.

Every unit is extraordinary. The detail, the movements, even the gunfire immerses you.  The sounds and feels of the game are amazing.

This game still has quite a few bugs, as I cannot load a saved game right from the main menu.  I once had an invincible enemy unit enter the field, an every unit I had could not take it out. So I had to restart the mission, very frustrating since it was the largest tank at the end of the mission.  Also many times main mission objectives don't activate, making you restart the mission.

THE UNIT AI IS HORRENDOUS!! They are always standing up by themselves, which in turn is a death sentence in this game.  Medics do not do anything but create another target for the enemy, same with units that have AT grenades/ rockets. 
I wish there was tutorial missions to get you into the flow of the combat, that way you can use every aspect of the game.

Tank battles are far more realistic than they are in other similar games; vehicles can be crewed and uncrewed, damages depend on the kind of shell, on the distance from the target and on the hit part. Covers are nice, and it is possible to control the soldiers' stance (standing up, prone and so on) manually. Enemy vehicles, if abandoned and not completely destroyed, can be recovered and stolen. Anti tank guns are really effective against tanks, but there is always a certain amount of randomness which makes everything unpredictable and suspencing. Every action has to be planned accurately, and unreasoned and silly moves are very likely to cause disastrous outcomes; there is a nice reinforcements mechanism which depends on the controlled checkpoints, and new weapons are available on the field after a new checkpoint has been conquered.
The only bad thing is that, during multiplayer battles, reinforcements are automatically split among players, causing messy situations (""who called this sniper?""

impressed... just be ready to do some homework and getting you rear-end handed to you on a regular basis, dont expect to be causing mayhem right if the bat.. this requires some time to get things down...

if your into your RTS's this is a MUST BUY!.. 

ADDITIONAL:::

Im running this on a toaster of a rig on medium and have no issues at all, so for you guys wondering if your old rig will run it here ya go...

E8400 CORE2DUO running at 3.6mhz
5 gig ram @800mhz
GTX260 1 gig video card
an old seagate HD thats about to explode...

im getting around 40-50 FPS on this dropping to mid 30s if things get mental..  biggest thing to watch just like any RTS is player pings, keep em under and 100 and your rocking... 150 and above you start getting a bit choppy.... good thing the community very active and getting low ping games is not an issue, and i play late UK so im usually playing with US folks...

hope that helps those on older rigs",1460652182,1460652182,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198011984425,110,17,1451,0,1081,1500846470,,

I charge my tanks into battle thinking I'll overrun the enemy all my tanks are blown to hell...Well shit...

I change my tactics, I send my men from cover to cover sometimes going prone 50 to 100 meters just to keep them alive long enough to sneak attack my enemies! Killed a squad of Germans!!! Owe shit! Other Germans are flanking me....Owe crap they have support! Tanks and mortars firing now...Owe crap were cut off Nooo my troops NOOOOOO! Well shit

So after many, many loses and deciding I could play on Hard mode even though I've never played a Men of War game before I've decided this game is awesome!

I have noticed the AI is a bit lacking at times especially when the enemy is literally right infront of my guys and they don't fire for some reason? (Yes I have ""fire at will"" enabled) . But other than that the game seems pretty solid just as fun as COH's but in many cases actually better. In my last battle for example I had 2300 enemies killed with 230 loses in a massive battle! I've never been in battles like that in COH's. I'd definently buy it if I were you sale or no sale you'll be glad you did.

80,22151738,english,"Okay I really do have to recommend this game. Im sure by now you've seen all the positives about this game, and I dont think i can lay out any more than what has already been said. With this in mind, lets take a gander at some annoying things you have to deal with if and when you decide to buy this game. 

Number 1: The Out of Sync errors and Lag issues. 
Now, this game's way of dealing with lag between users and with the server is downright obscene. If you do not have a 100% secure (and sometimes this doesnt help) connection to each other, one of you will lag. When one of you lags, the game decides it's best if BOTH of you lag. This also can lead to an ""Out of Sync"" error which boots you from the server, even if you're the host. (Out of Sync may be patched because it hasnt happened in a while for me.)
Number 2: Updates.
This game updates FREQUENTLY. Ranging from map changes to bug fixes to overhauls of completely new systems. This isnt necessarily a bad thing. Every game needs an update or two to keep it going. However, if you are a modder, expect the game to nullify your mod in the blink of an eye. With mods, the ""Max Game Version"" has to be set to the current version in order to enable the mod. That means,  no matter how hard you try to get that mod working, the devs will probably release a bug fix that will completely void the mod. This is irritating when you wait hours getting a mod to work only to have the devs break it 2 seconds later. (This can be fixed by editing the Mod.info in the mod folder and setting max game version to the current version, so this isnt to much of an issue, more of an annoyance.)
Number 3: Unnecessary Updates/DLC.
These game devs are notorious for providing literal SHIT for updates. It could range from adding maps nobody will play (that are horrid) to fixing 1-2 bugs. As mentioned above, these also break your mods. Their DLC is a bit questionable too, as one of them you have to pay 10 dollars for to play AI in multiplayer. This most likely shouldve been a part of the standalone game, but maybe its just a marketing scheme in order to rake in as much cash as they can. These devs do not give a shit from what i can tell. Despite numerous attempts from the community to inform the devs what they're doing wrong and how they can fix it, they just ignore it and continue pumping out ""new features"" when the old features are bugged to shit.

Now that we've looked at these flaws, I want to take a second to say this: THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT!
The layers of strategy required to play this is phenominal. And i would venture to say the positives of this game outweigh the various negatives. Give this game a while, wait for it to reach maximum potential and see if you can get it on sale. This game is worth every penny i've spent. So give it a try.

85,22078529,english,"Men of War Assault Squad 2 - in my opinion the current best (and hardest) RTS game with a  WW2 setting.

The game features a lot of missions split up between the 5 different nations. Germany, GB, USA, Japan & Sovjet Russia. While the pattern for the missions is the same they do play entirely different due too the different maps & nations. 
Defend - attack - defend is what the first mission, more like tutorial mission, is like. Every other mission is either attack or defend. You have to capture outposts, reach waymarks and defend hills & important places. Easy, yet challenging.

There is no base building involded - you gain new units via reinforcement points or by capturing enemy tanks. Yes, capturing enemy tanks. Each and every one of your units can be split up, managed individually, forged into a new squad, has his own inventory, can be used with manual aim [...]. 
Including tanks! Tanks can be used with minimum manpower - the driver only. Or you can fully stack up and even place infantry on the back of the tank for faster movements. Its entirely up to you.
You units can switch weapons, ammo & special items, you can loot dead enemies to gain new weapons and ammo [...] the possibilitys are endless.

What is the challenging part of all this? Sounds rather nice, doesnt it? 
The challenging part is the micromanagement, map awareness and realism. Tanks who get to close to trenches full of infantery - one AT grenade to his engine and hes busted. 

Infantery running over an open field - on mg salvo, all dead.

You have to invest your points in the right units, know how to use cover, and give your troops good lines of sight.  One mortar shell will kill and entire squad if you bunch them up behind a sandbag because, well, that’s reality.  Remember that veteran tiger that you saved up all game for?  You didn’t support it with infantry so it died to one AT grenade in less than 2 minutes.   It’s not CoH 2, or rather a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors, you actually have to think.

3.Single player missions are all the same no matter what nation you play, Which is just lazy.
4. The difficulty of said missions come from the ai's ability to send waves of infantry and tanks in numbers you just can't match. making mission more of a race against time than strategy.
5. This the biggest complaint. You have to pay extra for skirmishes against the ai leaving you with just the cookie cutter missions which is just downright scummy.

It's clear that this game is built on SHOWWII (I spent +200 hours on it already), and although this game came 10 years after SHOWWII .. it's NOT as good.

This game rushes the gameplay, and doesn't let you absorb it. While SHOWWII gives you many chances to inspect units, 'feel' their power, and spread your influence on mission .. I can easily think of like 5 ways to achieve a mission objectives and have fun manipulating the plot.
But Men of War would take the game play from you and commence a battle, leaving you helpless watching the course of battle hoping that your unit will do well.

Also the importance of items like barrels and repair kits has been reduced buy offering them with every unit. I don't like the campaign, who thought it was good idea to copy a mission over all campaigns switching the sides ? Do you call that mission design ?
I personally enjoy campaigns and long missions more than multiplayer.

Narration voice is not strong enough, and not sure what is the value of all blur and shines on the screen , does not look real.

I love how AI is smart enough to make you worry about getting into troubles, also I like the greater focus on vehicles.

31,21612685,english,"Men of war is hands down my favorite strategy series. It offeres much more depth than most, allowing you to control individual unit's inventory, and with everything having ammo counts. This may seem overwhelming for many, but they've added features to help, like the ability to group units into squads wnen you select multiple, and by adding ammo trucks, so you don't need to individualy add ammo to every soldier. 

The direct control mode adds a great level of depth to the game, allowing you to effectivly use a unit as your personal spec ops or elite unit.

The final thing that needs mentioning is damage/health of units. It's one of the most realistic feeling games in terms of unit health, where as some games (i'm looking at you CoH) feel like your units are armed with pea shooters, where the damage seems sometimes random, on MoW, it feels dangerous, and although your units have health, a machinegun will mow them down with ease, and a tank shell will take them out easily if they're not in cover. Which brings me onto tanks. There damage models are great, with no health, but rather a realistic damage scheme, with round deflection, penetration, and just about every part, even the crew, can be taken out. They are also great fun to use in direct control mode.",1457055108,1457055108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198022429615,843,12,8161,0,5907,1597506635,,

There is also multiplayer which is fun with friends or randoms which offers a competitive experience on regular or modded maps.

 pros:
 -Good gameplay
 - fun co op online experience 
 -good amount of content in base game  
 -modding is amazing and has a great amount of content to offer from the great commuity

cons:

It's true, this game was made with multiplayer as the core focus. Thank God, the developers integrated steam workshop. There are tons of options years later for single player. One of the best mods for me, has been the Dymanic Campaign Generator, which I have not found on steam but I believe on ModDB.

I love kill counts and longer campaign play for single player. This allows for that. Persistant units throughout a campaign is awesome! The system isn't pretty, but it works great and adds a ton of replay value to this game. It's too bad the devs of this game don't contact that goup, which also supported their earlier games with their generator. 

Otherwise, the amount of customization and tactics in this game are pretty cool. With the help of the modding community, I can now recommend this for single-player folks that love the world war II era.

Positives:
+ Every unit is important, everyone has his own inventory, ammo, grenades and bandages for wounds.
+ Manual control of any unit.(Yes, you as the shooter to run on A/W/S/D to shoot and aiming with the mouse!)
+ Damage system great equipment, the tank can damage: tracks, engine, turret or gun, and can kill crew - further damaged tank can be repaired and used against the enemy - great!(But nobody cancelled the explosion of the fuel tanks against fire and explosion of the ammo rack)
+ On the map can contain a huge number of units.
+ The developers did not throw the game out a major update every 3-4 months.
+ In multiplayer you still play :3
+ You can share with friends to pass the mission.
+ Open access to the mod from steam workshop.
+ The longer units alive and the more enemies they defeat, the more experienced they become, making them even more important.
+ Excellent voice for every nation.
+ 414 in-game achievements!!!

- OMG 414 in-game achievements.........
- The clumsy animation of the infantry, the graphics are not bad, but not the best.
- Sometimes there are bugs with the physics (but they are extremely rare, although it may be already fixed)

All in all, i recommend a playthrough on the easy settings but stay away from hard or hardcore. The coding errors and blatantly broken ai make it a save/load torture. I mean where is the common sense that an enemy infantry runs infront of a 2x10 squads and nobody shoots/hits. Seriously.

   For someone looking to experience an authentic World War II RTS, this game is for you. The developers at Digitalmindsoft have been blessed by the PC gods and have managed to bestow us this masterpiece. Why do I like this game so much? I think one of the major selling points was the GARGANTOUS range of options. I am specifically referring to the mouth watering stash of firearms, light tanks, medium tanks, HEAVY tanks, fighter planes, destroyers(big boats) and the diverse types of ammunition that accompany them. Not convinced yet? Then take a look at the cover system in place, allowing the player to cleverly place infantry so that they can take advantage of their surroundings. But forget all that. Who even cares if you can control every freaking infantry, vehicle, and weapon known in this game? Who cares if you can dump 20 hours of playing time just in the editor mode making crazy scenarios and reenacting battles? If you're not convinced by now, then my words haven't done the game justice. Check it out for yourself if you won't take my word. Chances are, you'll be as impresssed as I was and still am.

Absolutely no idea how to make a proper realistic RTS, so they just decided to make operating the game the hard part.

It's so amazing how much it has improved in terms of AI and graphics in the game. (Even though the AI is still flawed). Sucks that I didn't watch it grow with the previous games over the years... :(

I really like the workshop support for this game as gamers like us can put in and share our own missions, mods in the game (and there a really some talented ones at that). The 'direct control' function in the game sure is unique and really helpful in some situations, although I hear some people complaining about the 3rd person missions DLC. Hey, what's wrong with devs trying new things? The game isn't that strong storywise and all the factions have practically the same missions but on different maps, so singleplayer is pretty bland overall. However, being able to play them cooperatively with a buddy pretty much makes up for it. Haven't really tried multiplayer yet and I'll give it a go someday. Till then, co-op for days!

Will recommend this game for WWII lovers as well as RTS lovers. It's really unique in my opinion. Give it a go!

While the visuals dont have tonnes of JJ abrams fx about them, the attention to detail in the landscape, the buildings
and wartorn towns is excellent.
Especially when all of your men can take cover behind the smallest objects.
The cover system and how its represented makes CoH games look very outdated indeed.

Each unit has its own inventory.
A tank will have its MG rounds and various AP and HE rounds inside of it.
A soldier will have his medikits, ammo, weapon, grenades etc and each unit can increase in experience with the equipped weapon too.
There have been concerns of a lot of ""micromanagement"" when it comes to these inventories.
Surprisingly its no more stressful or difficult than anything else.
Ammo for example, can simply be replenished from supply trucks you call in that you stand next to.

Each unit can also be controlled directly like you would a 3rd person shooter, which is great fun with tanks.

The units themselves are very accurate as well, right down to uniforms, damage system and historical balance.

Theres are very strong multiplayer community here too, which is great to see for a lesser known title.

There are hundreds of top quality mods to get from the workshop as well.
They can add units, maps, modes, whole country's and balance changes.

Highly recommended

Intense and realistic missions, I like the emphasis on infantry, cover system and tank damage system that is challeging to keep the tanks safe,
Unit vocals and sound effects are good. I especially like the German soldier voices.
Good map design.
Ok soundtrack
Lots of modding possibilities. 
Well done co-op mission support
I like the editor just look at the movie I made using it:

Cons
What are the real advatages of buying deluxe version? I still had to by DLC to get AI for multiplayer.
All single player skirmish missions for every side follows the same pattern and sence of deja vu is always present. 
There are many buttons in the game for unit controls but none of them have description of what they do. I havent played Men of War games befoe and this version has no tutorial.

There are bugs and issues to mods caused by flash updates, but overall this is pretty good WW2 tactical RTS.",1454865734,1454865734,True,0,0,0.469987004995346069,0,True,False,False,76561198051865716,350,23,3340,0,2626,1560695325,,

[list]
[*] United States of America
[*] Nazy German
[*] England - British
[*] Japan
[*] Soviet Union
[/list]

All the Campaigns are highly entretaining and hard if you don't know what you are doing, myself i haven't been able to win a campaign in Hard difficulty and i'm experienced in RTS (Real time strategy)

This game has Multiplayer and plenty of people it, this is one of your ""dads"" games so to speak, only buy the game if you enjoy RTS games if you don't they it will be very boring for you.

One of the best features of this game is the [b]'Direct Control'[/b] which allows you to micromanage a single unit in third person (so to speak) its very usefull for tank combat and to trhow granades at the enemy.

AI wise the game as its share of bugs but still there isn't alot of games like Men of War, the Micromanaging is insane in this game.

In short, this just seems like a money grab attempt from the developers at DigitalMindSoft in order to fund their new Assault Squad 1 reskinned mod called Call To Arms (Seriously, just try it).

Though if you had never had played Assault Squad 1 (AS1) then yeah AS1 was and still is a great game, though if you want AS1 but with Online functionality since Gamespy shut their servers then AS2 is for you (else just use gameranger with AS1 since AS2 is poorly optimised) but as a sequel it doesn't warrant a purchase , it's too lazy , badly optimized and very disappointing .",1452895901,1452895901,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005527192,622,4,190,0,190,1452973719,,
74,20546023,english,"First off I would like to say the game is fun, I have enjoyed the game so I will list both the pros and cons.

Pros

1 The game is in depth Rts with and interactive environment you can repair damaged or abaoned equipment.

2The Game seems to have alot of different period units I like the fact that the Soviets have the Anti Tank Rifle things of that nature

3 The Graphics are great its well put together

4 I like the Fact you have to think about supply versus other games where you can shoot all day without a worry

Now for the Cons

1. One huge problem I have with the game is the lack of single player missions and the skrimish for a single player  doesn't work basicly the AI is jacked up its doesn't seem to perform on any level

2. I have played most of the missions but in whats frustrating is if your on the attack you have infantry and heavy weapons, thats it. Some during your attack you will no doubtly be attacked by armor. So you will be out numbered and you have limited access to the tools you need to continue on effectively. 

3. I hate this about the Game I am playing a Late War Arnheim mission as the British they only man packed anti armor weapon you have is the anti tank rifle. Heads up they had piat teams where are they. Then the Russian have anti tank rifles and bazookas news flash they used faust and anti tank rifles.

4. The average anti tank gun is way op a German 37mm anti tank gun can wipe out a squad in seconds thats a very small rounds for such a huge kill rad. 

5. Multiplayer lets go there my first multiplayer game I was hosting I explained I was new the first thought someone was to kick me thats always nice the trolls are everywhere.

On the whole the game has great potienal but falls very short of the Mark I cannot reccomend this game at any point.",1452888238,1452888238,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198054741630,144,7,35119,0,6890,1588791964,,

Now the review...

MoW Assault squad 1 = MoW Assault squad 2

It's basically the same game (no exaggeration) with the same problems...

a) Lot of crashes,

b) High ping,

c) Desync issues,

I bought the game exclusively to play GSM (German soldiers Mod) but it was a rip, the game is exactly the same.

Anyway... (with the mod installed), the game is so so so good that I recommend it to anyone interested in a deep and demanding RTS,

Sadly I'm changing my review to negative, honestly paid bots and making us to buy the same game for second time it was too much, sorry but you have lost another fan,",1452376311,1452376311,False,3,0,0.473915815353393555,0,True,False,False,76561198083620900,77,26,33901,0,26815,1468981399,,

It felt as though the devs took advantage of the Gamespy shutdown to market the same game again, and honestly they made a crappy job of rereleasing a fine game (AS1)
Its  just a re-branded AS1, but worse. This release was a step back and from the moment I first played I think I knew. Silly little things that had balance issues (in AS2's early days the willy's jeep was flat out ridiculous, it was pretty much bullet proof and pople would buy it straight away and decimate the enemy). And I have no idea why they hell they rank locked units, just another silly 'upgrade'
I had hoped over time It would be fixed (mainly multiplayer issues including connectivity and balance issues) but as for now I do doubt it'll ever be salvaged.
Now I'm not saying AS1 wasn't without it's issues, but when AS2 was announced I thouht it was going to fix AS1's problems. I was wrong. Dead Wrong. 

AS1 for me was fun but AS2 is just frusterating, because it is supposed to be the successor but if anything you'd think it the predeccessor. AS2 has left a bitter taste in my mouth and as much as I would love to get into Call to Arms, I will give it a miss.

The AS community would be infinitely better off if AS2 was scraped and AS1 was reinstated and a multiplayer function was reimplemented. But alas that would never happen because too many people have paid money for AS2.

We also got a lame leveling system to unlock units and lost hundreds if not thousands of players in the process.

This should have been a free patch because the only reason it was ""created"" was the old multiplayer hositng was shut down.  There is nothing in this game to make it a sequel or version 2.  It is the same game, but worse in numerous ways.

68,19850033,english,"To be honest. From my experiences, this game isn't all that bad. Multiple people say they dislike it because it was a re-release of AS1 but with little differences besides textures and a small trinket here and there, and also multiplayer. While I agree completeley with this statement. On it's own though, it isn't a BAD game.     Let me explain. Yes it is basically a re-relase of AS1 but with multi. But that's comparing it to AS1. Quite frankly, I could also say AS1 was bad due to the fact of it not having an amazing set of missions that MOW or MOW:RT had. Now, if this game didn't have steam hosting, I would not reccomend it. But it does, which makes playing with your friends a whole bunch easier. And that's my next point.

I play it with my friends, and have a good time.

... Well. One of my friends, and he basically hates the defense missions (Which I somehow adore). But I still have fun with it regardless. Alot of the arguments against the multiplayer I see always include something along the lines of ""-Did I say lag? well it should be here twice "" (From Winterwolf's negative review) or something about optimization. I can't exactly prove them wrong, as I don't play random multiplayer matches (Because I'd get rekt). But when I play with the one friend, honestly, I don't have a problem. Nobody (Or atleast nobody I've seen) that writes a negative review ever accounts for playing with friends. I'm sure that they do encounter issues when playing with random people, but if you play with friends, it's a completely different story. And is probably leauges more fun. And although I cannot personally say anything about the developers and their refusal to fix stuff, since the majority of the people say they don't, I can only be inclined to believe so.
     I'm not saying you should like this game because I said so, but I'm also not saying you should hate this game. Honestly it's pretty okay for me. If you're thinking about trying it, play Men Of War (The original). If you didn't like it, then don't get this. But if you did like it, and thought ""Oh man! This would be amazing with friends!"" Then you should probably get this game! But please keep in mind you should probably get it on a sale (Like the winter sale that's going on at the time of this review) because it not worth 30$ when you could just get AS1 which is the same but without multiplayer for 10$.     All in all, this is a pretty okay game in my book. Sure it has its ups and downs, but at the end of the day, playing it with friends provides the best experience.

70,19837613,english,"The game is very fun.  The graphics are pretty decent and you can see substantially further on the map as compared to Company of Heroes 2.  It takes awhile to learn the game and get proficient at it, but it is worth the time.

Items that could be improved include:
-The AT grenades are far too overpowered.  They tend to do more damage to tanks than AT guns and other tanks.  An AT grenade in this game can destroy a heavy tank after the tank has taken numerous shots from AT guns or other tanks.  It is frustrating to lose a tank to an AT grenade in this game.  Not to mention that it is very unrealistic that standard infantry carry around heavy AT grenades and are able to run through fields and throw them onto a tank without getting mowed down first.  It is one thing to have a special unit that carries AT grenades but this game puts them on standard infantry.  That part is pretty ridiculous but the rest of the game is quite good.
-Wish there were more players playing multiplayer.  Sometimes it takes awhile to get a game going.
-The AT guns appear to be quite underpowered.  A tank can generally shoot accross the field and take out the AT gun while the AT gun is shooting the tank.  This is a minor issue as you can avoid it by ordering tanks and other items rather than AT guns.

Im a big fan of the company of heores saga but believe me, i really enjoy kill a tiger tank with a bazooka unit hahaaha.

Only 3 thing:

1) No dedicated servers for automatch.. only custom games.. i think this is the most powerful issue of this game, this game hasn´t inspire a competitive gameplay..  and for that, this game never gonna be better.
2) its really bother me the animation of the infantry, come on guys, we're in 2015... really? the animation is really poor.. 
3) sometimes lag and sometimes the control of the units in the interface.

But, ok i really want to play this game, im playing with my friends and its really fun the change, for example, here a mg42 really kill infantry not as COH2.. spamming infantry doesn´t work here hahaha even spamming tanks.. its really fun for me.

Your soldiers will bleed out. When a soldier is hit it appears the AI ray traces a path to cover in the direction of the bullet, and moves the soldier there, sometimes making them take more fire.

I have been playing MOW a long time, and have enjoyed it quiet well. AS2 on the other hand I didn't like. It's trash. Plain and simple. Campaign is litterally the same as MOWAS with the DLC missions included. You have to pay money to get new campaigns and features that they should've implemeted when the game came out. Multiplayer is the same way. No new maps, and you have to pay to get new ones. Out synce errors that they have said they have fixed MULTIPLE times, but never have. The gameplay is garbage compared to MOWAS. Then theres the workshop. It was going really good, until they made some patch, that required mods to update when every minor patch came out, that didn't even affect the mod. The only reason I have so many hours in this game, is due to mods. The mods, made this game good, plain and simple. Honestly, all this game is a money horder.

So would I recommend this game?

Unless you plan of doing single player only. (Trust me, there's plenty of mods and missions to make it worth it in at least that regard.)

46,18843916,english,"I know more people that have played Company of Heroes than Men of War, which is a shame because Men of War is to Company to Heroes what Arma is to Battlefield. [h1]Gameplay[/h1]First off: Men of War is a squad based WW2 Strategy Game. The game does not offer any base building but is centered around capturing command posts, which give you points, that you can then use to request squads of soldiers, tanks, airstrikes and the likes. [h1]Infantry Combat[/h1] Every soldier in Men of War comes with his own inventory and his own weapons, which makes micromanagement a must. Troops need to remain supplied with ammunitions, bandages and grenades throughout the engagements which can either be scavenged from fallen enemies (or friends) or vehicles. Furthermore every weapon has its own advantages: SMGs are for medium and short range engagements, rifles for long ranges, LMGs to supress areas, sniper rifles, flamethrowers, pistols. You can move units individually or group them together in a squad depending on the situation.
[h1]Vehicle Combat[/h1] Like infantry tanks have an inventory too. Unlike infantry, tanks also have different armor levels on all sides. Distance to tank, angle of shot, projectile used, and where the shell hits all make the difference between an AT shell that deflects off the tanks armor or disables one of its critical systems (turret, main gun, left or right tread, hull or motor). Remember that scene in Fury where the crew outmaneuvers a German Tiger? This game lets you do that.
[h1]Personal Control[/h1] At any point in time you can push E and personally control a unit from the strategic view using WASD and your mouse. I personally wished it was in third person, but whatever. So if tank-mc-gee isn't doing what you want you can just take him over and position him yourself. Which brings me to my next point:
[h1]The environment:[/h1] Men of War features very detailed countrysides, cities, and industrial maps which are all completely destructible. Tanks can drive through walls, explosions will destroy windows, vegetation can burn to the ground. A house can shield the flanks of your tank until a cannon lands a shot through the kitchen window. All vehicles, whether destroyed or not, can serve as cover to your units. Same is true for trenches, trees and sandbags (which will provide cover until they're blown apart).


Overall I think Men of War is the best squad based RTS out there. The level of realism is insane, the campaings are fun to play with friends (up to 8 player coop). Men of War 2 is more of a re-make of Men of War 1 but definitely adds some things like shared ammunition among squads and new scenarios. I can only recommend this game.",1446493011,1446493118,True,3,0,0.538461565971374512,0,True,False,False,76561198027094096,158,16,556,0,396,1525028007,,

I've never seen any other like it, but then again i haven't really looked once i found this gem.
And the mods to the game are great!You will have to check them out! 

THE CONS.

1,Might take a bit to get good(don't give up)
2. Need to LEARN how to direct fire with certain things
(direct fire is where you control the person/tank/arty yourself)
3. finding a game online at certain times is hard. sometimes its a lot of russains, sometimes its more experinced people (not always bad but if they stack and you're new you wont learn a lot.) but try and copy what they did! it will work sometimes.
4. playing on lower setting when online. if you want to run smooth and not get kicked. make sure your performence is the best it can be. i have a good computer and i still play on medium settings just to have 4 bars of performence(which is best)
MAIN CON (5. OUT OF SYNC Errors. i've only have these errors about 4 times and 3 were when i was playing mods. i might just be luck to not get these every game or what. But i've finished most of my games,) and this con makes a lot of people hate this game

These are the top cons i think of, but you can overcome 4/5 of them! And this games a Great experince i wouldn't pass up. 
and if you are scared to spend the money, just wait till the pack is on sale to buy it.

Still same game engine, no graphical improvement, if there is I cannot tell. Nothing real exciting as a whole. And to make the game ""better"" they start releasing ""DLCs"" such as Iron Fist [Tank Combat] which ads 2-3 missions in which all it does is lock your camera view, and Airborne [Self Explanitory] in which the almost same thing occurs, a small hand full of missions is released, as well as ""bots"" bearly functional AI which should've been in the base game not labled as DLC and getting people to pay for it just for extra money. The only semi-decent thing this game even has is mod support, some of the mods are better than the base game itself, and are even free.To me this game is unplayable without mods.And do yourself a favour, if you already have Assault Sqaud, don't get this game, but if you don't mind numerous bugs, crashing multiplayer, underwhelming graphics and single player campaigns, DLCs aimed to make you pay MORE money to get features which should've been in the base game and a overall disappointing game for any REAL strategist out there.

75,18410405,english,"Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a good and solid WWII strategy game. The campaign is solid, clear and fun and so are multiplayer games.

One big thing is that you can actually use mods in Multiplayer mode to spice things up a little. You can make basically sandbox multiplayer games where everyone spawns in huge armies and just starts this huge battle. Perfect for re-enactments too.

Graphics-wise the game is not really standing out, but it's definately not bad either. The interface of the menu's, mostly the main menu look like it was made in 1998, which kinda scares you until you start playing the game itself.

Another big advantage is the large amount of units you can build. The game is often compared to Company of Heroes, but it's gameplay differs mostly in the fact thay in Men of War: Assault Squad 2, you don't need to make any buildings to get progress. Also, you get to your unit capacity much quicker than in Company of Heroes, this can be solved with mods though.

There is one MAJOR drawback (depending on how you see it) though: The Soviet Union. There was one game where I played with my friend (Mreetbaar12) and he was playing as the US army and I had the Soviet Red army. He had a whole army just absolutely slaughtering me. I was getting points by just waiting until I had enough for buying an IS-1...

Well, he had like 8 tanks just killing all my soldiers before. I sent my IS-1 to his army, it barely took any damage and his whole army got absolutely wrecked. I ended up just putting it next to his spawn point and just spawnkilling everything he brought in. Even tank destroyers were useless. He thought I was cheating, but afterwards we both found out that the Soviet tanks are just EXTREMELY OP. This is fun for the one playing the Soviet Union, but can be very frustrating for the other players.

Aside from that, if nobody picks the Soviet Union, other countries are more balanced to eachother. The US army can beat Germans at even chances and so can the British armies.

Short recap:

+ Solid Campaign
+ Lots of different strategies possible
+ Lots of units
+ Descent graphics
+ Mods can be used in Multiplayer
+ Multiplayer works well

- Soviet Union very stronk
- Main menu looks very old
- Unit cap without mods

There is 1 rather obvious flaw, that is the multiplayer aspect of the game, from time to time, you or players from the match can and will get OOS(Out of sinc), at the moment there is somewhat of a hotfix implemented which maxes the game playable but does not remove OOS completly, something which I think will happen in the future as the game still gets updates.

After the last few updates, multiplayer finally runs smooth, the frame rate issues have been fixed, and the game is performing as it did after it was fixed on launch. Even on my fairly rubbish computer, I don't suffer frame drops from viewing huge explosions or whatnot, which is a massive step up considering me and my mate (who owns a top notch rig) both played on what seemed to be half a frame per second previously. Despite the fact that I can now enjoy the game, regardless of the copy-pasting that went on from AS1 and the sub-par scripts which leave no real replayability, I still have to point out that the devs have released payed DLC for AS2 which contains features which come stock standard with CtA. Pretty rubbish in my opinion, especially considering one of those features is versing AI on multiplayer maps, which just about every game out there has on release. Nontheless, I'm changing my recommendation for this game, and hoping it stays that way. 

**EDIT OF MY EDIT (Because I can)** the connection is still rubbish. I've seen a host of other people complaining about it too, but by all means 1C, lets keep on releasing pointless DLC which has already been done in an assortment of mods. 

**EDIT** - The most recent update seems to have solved some of the optimization issues. The game doesn't freeze for stupid amounts of time anymore, it is just a little choppy (but still playable). Not enough game time has been invested to check how solid the connection is between players though, so I can't comment on that. Everything else, however, I still stand by. 

Having played the hell out of AS1, this game came as an over-priced, copy-pasted piece of unoptimized garbage. On release, there was a plethora of performance issues which the devs eventually fixed, only to go back and unoptimize it once more following the latest patch. Co-op seems unplayable, with the game constantly crashing out/going out of sync even though the connection is 100% fine. And when the connection is fine, the game runs at no more than 10 frames on a good day, which makes it even more unplayable. What's left then? Single player is essentially a bunch of copy pasted scripts with the nations and maps altered, leaving absolutely no replayability whatsoever. The AI is predictable on easy-normal, and on hard and above, it is just a total AI spam-fest.

I love the possibilities. In fact, I grew an interest for this game after I became disillusioned with War Thunder; and the video of the Ratte mod that was posted to YouTube by the RakcroyBrosGaming channel sold me on buying this game. 

I really wish I did my fucking homework. 

Game play mechanics are solid. So far, all that I have been able to play bits and pieces of the single player campaign/""skirmishes"", no mods. The gameplay itself is all combat; with little to no bullshit concerning economics in terms of building factories, barracks, [b] *MUST ACQUIRE MORE VESPENE GAS* [/b] etc, save for the occasional supply truck run to give ammo and/or fuel to single units that have run low. 

Very straightforward. No need to break out an excel sheet to figure out 'optimal output' paces or anything, that's what I like to see in an RTS. 

The game play is fairly driven by 'stats' too, especially on the subject of vehicle combat. Armor thickness, type, slope, all taken into account as to whether a vehicle will survive or not, and not one vehicle is truly 100% safe from the other due to this level of detail. I love it.

The game play also allows for plenty of organic ""whoops"" moments on both sides. AT infantry attacks an OPFOR tank, kills the driver. Tank keeps rolling like nothings happened, you the player become hesitant that the attack was effective; until you notice it's going to roll straight into (and through) 3-4 houses filled with OPFOR. Said houses collapse on tank, which also blows up from the drop. 

Absolutely horrifying and breathtakingly awesome at the same time. 

That being said, the fun stops there.

This game is an absolute nightmare to run. Bugs that are laughably persistent, and affect the most basic of functions. I'm not talking about hardware optimization, as this thing (while still looking dated, graphically) looks fine, not much in terms of framerate drops or anything of that nature. 

No, I'm talking about an over-abundance of file crashes. 

No other problems with any other games. I haven't had any files mysteriously disappear, and my drives seem healthy as can be.

But every single fucking time I know autosave is about to occur, I hold my breath like a person playing russian roulette. Manual save feels even worse to me, because it's 100% self inflicted. Why? Because every time a save occurs, there is an unnacceptably high chance that the save will fail; and I will be greated with a string of text/code telling me things like ""NOT SDL FILE"", or ""Failed to save thumbnail/screenshot"". 

It is also likely that when these errors occur, the game will fail to load unless you manually delete the (now corrupted) save. You will also (likely) need to delete some combo of files, like keys.set, options.set, settings.set, etc. Otherwise, the game will not run. 

Now, these are solutions that are posted on the game's FAQ, written by the developers. 

The only problem is that it's only a cure for the symptom, and it never solves the actual *problem.* It only brings the game back into ""can now run/execute/playable"" status, but sooner or later, after another half-hour/40 minutes of gameplay; you will have another save failure that will crash the game, and you will not be able to play it again unless you delete some combination of files mentioned above. 

Steam-cloud sync is turned off. No mods installed. No interference from an Antivirus. This is all from the game, latest update and all.

With these errors, the longest gameplay session I've ever had was somewhere between an hour and an hour-thirty minutes. The game is lost. The files deleted. Progress gone. Back to square one.

Infantry can search other infantrys corpses, taking their weapons, helmets and even bandages (or dynamite from a armoured vehicle)...
Tanks dont have health bars, they have damage modelling, so a panzer IV wont take out a churchill, unlike CoH...
Units are made in favour of realism rather than balance, if it was bad in real life, its bad here...
Surprisingly active multiplayer community...
Great freedom in what your units can physically do, you can send your men into an allys tank if one of his crew died, for example...
You can take control of a single unit/vehicle at any time, controlling how it moves, where it fires, what it does. You can cook a grenade, conduct a charge, take control a single man with a flamethrower, scorching the enemy trenchlines, angle your tank armour so enemy rounds bounce off, aim for weak spots of enemy tanks, etc...
Your tank crew can escape a inoperable vehicle, and blow it up with dynamite to prevent it being stolen, (Or even used in a last ditch effort to take your enemy with you)

Well first of all I would say the game is a rts game but where you do not have to ""rush"" from a-b.
You can often take your time to scout and plan your attack or defence.

What I like about the game is the amount of detail.
For example you can drive a tank and your self shoot the enemy.
One of the really cool things about the game is that every vehicle are different.. For example it does matter where and how you shoot the enemy tank.
Another thing i like is that your troops can pickup different weapons if the for example run out of ammunition. Yes you can even use the enemys AT gruns and even tanks if you are lucky enough that the crew bail out, then you can sometimes repair it and use it.
Defensive possitions and the world in general also offer various advantages or disadantages.

In general I like the game and it is pretty cool.
I have so far only completed the introduction mission 1 and it took 1 hour 45 minutes. I did not count the amount of missions but I would say 30+ so there are many houres of combat if you like to just play against the computer.. If you like there is also multiplayer but I did not yet try this.

Edit..:  If you want to play against ""bots"" in your own multiplayer skirmish mode, then bots AI are not included as standard in the game ( dooh )  But when buying ""airborn"" then the ""bots AI"" computer player will be unlocked... Just thought I mention this.

I hope the future of the series might evolve into a game with a virtuel 2d map where we can move troops arround on a strategic map, and then fight the entire war in a kind of virtual campaign taking place in zones that look like european contrys.. .. Well the campaign system should work like in ""wargame dragon"". For examle if you move an infantry unit to ""denmark"" and the enemy move inf+light tanks then you as the player have to fight that battle with only infantry avaliable... The amount of killed units should after the battle be updated on the campaign map and once example the enemys infantry battalion is destroyed then it should be dead for the rest of the war.... however taking various key points on the campaign map should allow the player to get a fre units of reinforsment during the campaign, and the enemy vise vesa...

Men of War: AS2 is a game of your own experience. There are no heroes to follow, no stories to be told. Unless you say otherwise. You can watch as your US Paratroopers land, commanded by Alan Smith or whoever make there way to a German MG post that's been slaughtering elements of your frontal unit. You create the story in the mission of your choice. Plus, everything is usable. Every individual soldier has ammo, a gun and a helmet, alongside maybe a fieldworks or repair kit, and all these can be taken. You have no more ammo for your rifle? ""Soldier, grab some SMG ammo and that MP 40 from Jerry"". Require a tank, but can't afford it? ""Jackson, see that panzer? Repair it and get it back here"". Every single firearm, every mortar, every AT and howitzer gun, every armoured fighting vehicle, is capable of spewing death upon it's previous masters. Provided you keep them stocked with fuel, ammo, and keeping them intact, of course. 

Another addition to the game is the veterency system. Individual soldiers, once they kill someone, will gain some veterency, and gain better stats, more HP, more stamina, better weapon handling, better tank control, everything. 

If you're a sucker for WW2 RTS games, then I'd recommend this one. There might be a lot to learn, but it's all compressed neatly onto the screen, while also allowing you to seen what's happening.

81,17576484,english,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]

If you're into WW2 RTS games, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is probably worth full price. Plenty of content, a fairly active multiplayer scene, an abundance of mods, and rock-solid mechanics. There are some issues - mainly engine and online stability issues - but they don't necessarily ruin the game. DLC isn't spectacular, but Airborne is worth the buy. MOW:AS2 is definitely worth the price, especially if it is on sale.

[h1] Graphics & Sound [/h1]

Functional. Not much to write home about but the game looks pretty and it doesn't eat your framerate. Sounds aren't terribly impressive but they work well enough. Voice acting is iffy, with a lot of it being recycled from previous MOW games.

[h1] Core Gameplay [/h1]

Incredibly fun. MOW:AS2 adds a lot of nice additions to Men of War's already awesome gameplay. Although it can be micro-heavy, infantry combat is enjoyable and the inventory system gives the players much more freedom than similar WW2 RTS games. Vehicle combat is also a lot of fun, thanks to the ability to directly control your vehicles. AS2 also adds plenty of helpful UI elements and mechanics that just build on the classic MOW gameplay.

[h1] Single-Player [/h1]

Not brilliant, but not bad. There isn't a campaign to speak of - just a large number of individual skirmish missions. They all tend to be very similar as well, which can be problematic if you get bored by samey missions. Despite the similarities, the skirmishes themselves can be pretty enjoyable, especially the defensive skirmish missions. However, stealth missions are flat-out terrible, in my opinion, because of the game's AI. Skip them.

[h1] Multi-Player [/h1]

Pretty good. Balance-wise, the game isn't brilliant. At least, it doesn't beat Company of Heroes in terms of balance. Still, Germany vs. USA games and Soviet vs. Germany games are well balanced, and thus quite popular online. However, the matches themselves are a lot less predictable, since there is high capacity for shenanigans thanks to the gameplay mechanics. This can be good or bad, depending on your play style. Still, the competitive multiplayer is enjoyable. 

Also worth noting is the ability to play the single-player skirmish missions cooperatively. If you have a friend or two that like WW2 RTS, playing the coop skirmish missions on a higher difficulty can make for a really good time. You can also play modded skirmish missions cooperatively, so there is actually a wide array of coop content.

As of me writing this review, the game's online has a number of stability issues, primarily the ""Out of Sync"" issue, which can disconnect a player and ruin the flow of the game. The devs have said that they are working on it, but it should be mentioned, especially since it is a fairly common problem.

[h1] Modding [/h1]

Men of War games have had good modding scenes for quite some time. AS2 is no exception. In fact, I would say it has one of the best modding scenes out of the entire franchise. There's a lot of total conversion mods that can completely change the game, adding a lot of replayability. There are also tons of custom skirmish missions and multiplayer maps. The modding scene is active and adds a lot to the game.

[h1] DLC [/h1]

The DLC for this game is not particularly great. For starters, the Deluxe Edition is a complete ripoff. The XP boost is pointless, since a lot of servers play with unlocked units, and unless you REALLY want that fancy nametag, the Deluxe Edition is not worth the $7. ($5 when bought with the game.) Iron fist isn't great either. It adds some War Thunder-style tank missions that give you direct control of a veteran tank. Problem is, you can directly control your tanks in the vanilla game, minus the fancy camera angles and the mission flavor. Not worth $10 - get it on sale if you want it.

The best DLC out of all of them has to be Airborne, which adds five very enjoyable skirmish missions. The missions are focused on infantry combat and defense. They also give the option of skipping the stealth section, and the maps are quite unique. It is debatable whether or not the multiplayer bots should have been added into the game for free, but the DLC is already out. To be honest, the bot AI is actually a bit disappointing, especially when it comes to vehicles. Still, the bots might make Airborne worth full price. Depends on your standards.

Overall, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a good game. It is an essential for anyone who enjoys WW2 RTS games and I can honestly recommend it. The price is reasonable, especially when you consider the active modding scene and the solid multiplayer.",1439777147,1439777147,True,4,1,0.524933576583862305,0,True,False,False,76561198019153444,237,5,5006,0,4436,1459236032,,

The factions however are pretty well balanced however each has their own advantages 
USA
-Strong Early Game Tanks
-Standard Infantry has Semi-Auto Garands
-Pershing is a good late tank against every other faction but the Germans.
-Suffer Late game due to lack of heavy armor.

Commonwealth
-Very strong mid game
-Infantry has rifle grenades
-A large selection of Cruiser Tanks
-Suffers Late Game due to lack of heavy armor.

Japan
-Exotic Weapons such as a massive rocket artilley piece
-Many Selections of Light Tanks
-SNLF are some of the best infantry in the game
-Has horrible Medium and Heavy Tanks
-Armor is worst in game.

Soviets
-Best All Around Faction
-Strong all games
-IS3's main gun wrecks pretty much anything but has an extremely long reload time
-Best Special Infantry
-T60 is OP as ****
-Weakest Arty selection

Germany
-Best Tanks in late game
-Amazing Artillery
-Mediocre infantry except for PanzerGrenadiers
-Light Tank selection is great
-Early Game Medium Tanks are horrible
-Hero units are some of the worst (minus the Goliath).


Pros
-Great Unit Variety
-Fun Multiplayer matches with friends

Cons
-Constant Stuttering
-Unrealistic penetration values at times (A Pershing Oneshotted a King Tiger with a shot to the frontal armor.)
-Horrid, Horrible community that is extremely toxic for new players.
-Some unbalancing such as USSR tanks being extremely weak compared to Germans with their infantry being just as bad.

Pretty much, your in control of a small miltary force, you then must fight to take control of capture points and such.
Really fun when your moving your small squad in a flanking manuver and they get slaughtered by the machine gun you didnt notice.
One time, in a epic battle, i had my 2 of the most powerfull tanks (and some of the best in the game i think) charge the enemy, and there tracks were both destroyed.
No other reinforcements could reach them, so alone, they took out over 20 enemy tanks. Eventually i got a squad to them, the squad managed to repair one but the other was destroyed, killing all but one solider, I then had the last man help man the tank, and drove to base. Only to have that tank finally get detroyed
End battle:
I had 1 man left, no reinforcements(all dead), the enemy had 1 tank. My soldier had no Anti-Tank genades, and the nearest body was in the open, where the tank would shoot me, I ran for cover in a building, where there was a dead solider, i looted him and got a gernade.
I then charged the tank and threw it, right as the tank opened fire.
My solider managed to survive :)

On a whim I fired up MOW AS2 today and had an absolute blast with it. This is a must play for WWII and RTS enthusiasts. It's challenging. Absolute tons of micromanaging to be done here but when you start getting it and making combined arms tactics work it is thrilling. Honestly, it's a difficult game to master and I'm not there yet but if you want a challenge this is your game. The graphics on ultra settings are very very nice and the game's presentation is more ""realistic"" if I can use that word than Company of Heroes. Performance is a little uneven which is understandable with everything that's going on. It's crazy how many moving parts there are here so a respectable processor is recommended. I have what currently is the flagship AMD APU the A10 7850k OC'ed to 4.5ghz paired with an R9 285 and 32gb of ram (design) and when there's a lot of concentrated artillery, infantry and vehicle movement it can run in the low 20's though I wouldn't say it makes the game unplayable. I probably should mess around with the shadows and post processing to see if I can improve that but for the most part the game runs well. Obviously your experience will vary and if you're on a laptop or older desktop then be prepared to make serious sacrifices in the graphics settings. I should probably mention that there's no proper campaign, it's more a series of disconnected battles vs. the CPU but I didn't feel the game suffered because of a lack of narrative.

First things first, There is a basic tutorial that doesn't teach you everything about the game, so you need to experiment.

Second off, it's not your average strategy game. There are many different things about this game compared to other games around, like no real bases that build units.

Third off, Vehicles are strong. Very strong. If you want to counter a tank, you actually need grenades or rockets, or another tank to fight it off.

Now to show off what I think are pros and cons.

Pros:
-Great for quick RTS games (Usually)
-Vehicles feel strong or scary, a German Tiger is a terrifying sight in this game.
-Graphics aren't over/under-prioritized.
-Cover is Prioritized.
-Continually updated.

Cons:
-Infantry AI needs some work.
-Sometimes it gets a bit frustrating fighting with a unit's pathfinding and such, in a way that your infantry always run into machine fire and die.
-Vehicles might be a little too broken.
-Cover is sometimes a hard thing for the unit Pathfinding to comprehend.
-If you are a solo player, AI battles are DLC.

Neutral:
-Mods sometimes work, alot of the older mods are out dated, and those that aren't crash on high-settings (Just drop settings, even if it IS ugly)

I'm going to try and cut this short, so i'll skim over some stupid things, and focus on the big things.

Men of War Assault Squad 2 is an action/RTS with a large focus on battles and less of a focus on building bases. Now those of you looking for a base builder shouldn't shy away, as you can organize with your friends and set up locations on the map that are deeply fortified. Anyways, The game has Five sets of missions, each focused on one of five factions, that feel really different than each-other. The biggest focus is those giant battles where its mostly chaos. Honestly though, me and another friend found it hard to have any kind of battle when you could just be spawn camped, then repeated on some maps, so rules need to be set, as well as it is almost impossible to control the AI. Truth be told, the Infantry AI is terrible, just absolutely Terrible. half the time they run to their deaths, other times they don't move for 3 seconds with a grenade under them, then finally move at the .3 second mark. it's really crap.

On the bright side, MODS!

Single player
Good a lot of fun, difficult and interesting campaigns and you can add more with the workshop. Might be worth buying the core game. 

Multiplayer [Disastrous]
 Reason being that you need to rank up to unlock new units aka you have few units to use to fight users that have all the units unlocked. Also to rank up you need to win [see the issue?] because of this you never rank up and you lose all the time unless you find a game with someone who is the same level as you [they probably already gave up on the game though]. However even if you find one of these games there is a bug in the game that will never go away. This bug is a game killer that strikes at almost random times and will just crash the game.

I waited more than one year before reviewing this game, as a sign of respect for its developers and to try write a complete and honest review.  Now I think I gave them enough time to fix their game and to prove they care about their costumers, and I'am sorry but they failed...

What to say ?  AS2 and its developers for me in 3 words ?  .. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !

On AS1 I had lot of hours of fun, even if to be sincere 95% of my hours on AS1 were spent with the German Soldiers Mod, a realism mod, so I give credits to DMS for making the basic game (wich is a modified version of the originall MoW by Best Way) but if was not for Blubork's GSM and all the MoW modders, I'am not sure about how many hours I could have on AS1.

So in general from MOW to AS1 for me nothing big changed (not that other MOW titles brought bigger changes) if not improved graphic and other little details, main improvements arrived thanks to the evolving of the German Soldiers Mod and other mods, but all in all I was happy with the AS1 platform, they even released free updates with new models, and from time to time I could have fun with the vanilla game too, even if nothing serious.

Main problems of AS1 vanilla for me were the artificial weapon datas and in general the lack of realism, not that MoW was realistic, for example regarding ranges AS1 was a step forward, but with AS1 in my opinion the gameplay went even more fast paced and more CoH oriented.
 I always disagreed with the payback mechanic introduced by DMS, I find that rewarding a player for wasting units doesn't fit the Real-Time-STRATEGY genre, to help new players you need to make in game tutorials (still absent in AS2).

So when AS2 was announced I went on AS2 forum and asked personally to devs if AS2 was going to be a more realism oriented game, not a sim, just more realistic, and they put there the fact that they were going to implement realistic weapon datas, I also asked them if they were planning to implement a territory mode like I suggested in the past and again they answered me that something was coming to satisfy this suggestion too.
So as I'am a positive person and I like to help who deserve it, I was super happy and I decided to help in the funding of their future CTA title too, even if I was not really interested in a post WWII era MoW.

Then the big day to try AS2 arrived...

...and this sadly was my first reaction after trying it (was obviously in italian but I'll try to translate it:) )


""What the fuck ?? are you kidding me ?!""

Yes, it can sound rude but this sincerely was my reaction when trying AS2 for the first time.

Performances were terrible (but it was beta so at that time I still had hope here), improvements compared to AS1 ? little to nothing , and it not ends here....

Ranges were reduced and the gameplay was damn fast paced, maps had a terrible artificial arena look and were damn small, nothing  like my suggested territory mode,  instead an extreme battle zone mode that had nothing to do with what I suggested, even the realistic weapon datas were not that realistic as the Tiger tank could ""360 non scope"" in one second with its famously and historically known SLOW turret traverse.

Regarding the vanilla game a total disappointment, however the full steam implementation was a nice thing and my thought was that performances could improve as promised and once GSM was released then I could just play that and avoid the CoH like vanilla gameplay, even if having to always rely on mods to enjoy a game to be sincere is quite annoying.
No less I even created an AS2 thread on the most famous Italian tech forum, I was still supporting the devs despite the problems and failed expectations.

After months of waiting I realized I passed more time on the AS2 hub than in game as the game performances were terrible and the vanilla game gameplay a total rush and grenade spam that I was unable to enjoy.
Again, I tried to stay positive and give my best to stay present on the AS2 hub and give suggestions, I invested my precious time there but what I discovered was just that, even with their community the Devs were doing a terrible job, threads locked, people banned, not a sign of listening to player suggestions, even Devs replying to suggestions in a quite arrogant way or over-defending their product and ""vision"" at all costs, making you feel like a shit and totally impotent toward the series future.
I was speechless, I was no more able to recognize the devs I used to like and I helped by being backer and always preordering their products.

At same time of this hard blow by AS2 devs, on the other hand, I had Arma 3 devs with their feedback tracker and a forum that is more like a virtual office, where players and devs collaborate to make a better game.
And Arma series too started small and niche, for A3 they kept on the realism way so one can think they sold less compared to the more arcade AS2 that tried to follow the mainstream arcade way, but no, this is an outdated way of thinking IMO, now in 2015 you sell more if you make a quality product and you stay HONEST and HELP/ LISTEN to PEOPLE, that's what matter to make an healthy game and business, we are no more in the 20th century, I like to think that people evolved and started punishing the soulless greedy business. look at the paid mod for Skyrim, people must be heard or they revolt.

Back to AS2, last but not least disappointment, that ultimately made me quit with the game in December 2014, was that basically if the AS2 vanilla game already had problems in MP, Big mods then were totally unplayable, just crashes, desync and horrible performances, mods that were able to run fine on MoW, now on AS2 years later were unplayable.
The OOS issue made us crash 75% of the times in games bigger than 2v2.

Basically the only thing that right now work in AS2 is the SP or MP below 2v2 (if both players have a great PC).
But if you want to play SP then what's the point of getting AS2 ? yes thanks to workshop you find mods easily but for SP AS1/MOW are good enough and still have SP mods putting there new stuff for free, right now I can't find any good reason to suggest you AS2, specially with this dev behaviour toward their customers.

Positive things yes, the auto resupply, veterancy and like I said workshop, but is it enough ? I let you judge on this.

Luckily the MOW series is not dead, now we have Battle of Empires that is very promising and where Devs really listen to their community as well as the future Best Way game ""outfront"" on the new engine, in the hope they will not commit same DMS mistakes, like developing two games at the same time as an indie company with low budget ?! I would say maybe better to concentrate your effort to one game per time and listening to your community, or not ? 
AS2 in the end proved to be a mere way to fund CTA.

This MoW series has an huge potential to become the best RTS ever and an awesome sandbox platform, for now to be sincere all MoW developers failed to unleash its full potential and make it a really successful game that, like Arma III in the Tactical-FPS genre, can become a milestone of its genre and make PC gamers proud of it.

Let's see what the future will reserve to us MoW players. I know some things are going behind the scene that may surprise us in the future of this series,I'am not going to talk about them right now, but I'am positive :) 

godspeed


PS: my 400+ hours are mostly beta testing GSM, all time wasted as GSM is a MP mod and it wont work on AS2 : )  (even if according to Devs and workshop there is mod support)

So I even went ""light"" on this review, I could write worst, but unlike DMS I'am a gentleman.

Also ranking up in this game is hard because developers implemented a new feature called Dsync probably the only feature that affects games the most other then the new GUI.

-Steam integration and Steam workshop
-New player logs and info tracking
-New skirmishes and new types of skirmish
-Camo changes according to the season of the battle is taking place in

-Horrible optimization and performance issues
-Bollocked up netcode
-If there's one player with a bad PC everyone lags
-AI still bollocked up
-New multiplayer maps are half-assed unfit for competitive play
-Terrible voice acting
-Paid for replay and bots DLC
-No actual gameplay improvement or changes from AS1
-One new unit for UK and Germany
-Rehashed maps from AS1
-No R6 map pack integration
-Suffered from a prolonged period of OOS that made the game broken and unplayable online and still don't know if it's truly resolved?

There is a large number of different vehicles, artillery and some infantry, which both have fully interactable inventory. (Yes, I gave all of my soldiers MG-42's) I cannot describe to you how great this game is in terms of single player. But lets get to downsides. First of all, this is a very demanding game in terms of performance, since it needs a minimum of 4GB ram to run smooth. That may not sound like that much, but to people with low-end PC's, this is a problem, as it will cause very low framerates, crashes, and just flat out capping memory. This also ties into the multiplayer problem, as people with bad PC's will cause everyone in the game to receive the message-""Performance drop experienced by player (name)"" This causes all other players' games to completely stop and have to wait for that persons PC to gather itself. Overall though, multiplayer is balanced and runs quite smoothly if everyone has a good PC.",1437253261,1437253261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198120597159,82,6,35168,217,16978,1601485962,,

28,14575858,english,"Edit: Changed recommendation from ""yes"" to ""no"" due to the persistent and long running out-of-sync bug in multiplayer and DMS bad community management that's banning videos from dedicated players.

Set in WWII with Japan, Germany, the Commonwealth, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. as factions, the game contains single-player missions and multi-player co-op or several team or 1vs1 modes. It's not an easy RTS but if you like a challenge, just turn up the difficulty and have fun.

This is an RTS where the level of detail is astounding, the complexity and the multitude of possible actions are amazing, as are the scenarios with destructible buildings and objects. Many WWII units are modelled and vehicles have armour and ammo penetration calculated for each hit. You even have to watch your ammunition expenditure and re-supply men and vehicles accordingly and even consider ammo types. Unit ""experience"" and other performance changing stats have now also been patched into the game and evolve per-unit (as in each single man!).

Another differentiating factor from similar RTS's is the direct control option in which you can control the movement or aim/fire of a unit just like in a third-person game. This is very useful for armoured vehicles because sometimes the AI is lacking and they end up destroyed if left on their own. You can even ""cook"" a grenade before throwing it at your enemy, leaving him little or no time to escape its blast.

Despite some bugs and occasional AI failures it's still very supported by the developers as the massive February 2015 patch demonstrates and has some very interesting mods and even spin-offs (e.g. modern wars and WWI).

From the previous iteration of MoW:AS, not much has changed but this is still worth a buy when discounted.

In sum this is a very realistic and complex WWII RTS with a lot of replay-ability from itself and the many Steam Workshop mods. Its only downside are the occasional bugs and AI, but nothing show-stopping.

A must for realistic/complex RTS fans.",1424524857,1437224527,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198037548576,1001,69,4630,0,4344,1452815368,,

35,12296617,english,"Overall gamplay is good but worse than AS1. The lag and the inability to fix it since it's release is mindboggling. See strat29's comments.

Edit: The game has been updated since early October however the update has not drastically changed the game to differentiate it enough from Assault Squad 1 (AS1). It has fixed the lag issue for the most part but it seems rather strange that the game was originally launched with such a blatant, arguably unplayable issue in the first place. There are no new factions, very few new maps, inability to play the large maps (8x8 for example) and a game that essentially replicates what AS1 does. Worth a buy? Maybe. Worth the supposed upgrade from AS1? Nope.

Edit #2 (Version 3.115.0): In the last few weeks a new update and new features via a DLC were issued through steam. They've ironed out some of the issues that plagued the game since the latest series of updates but the game still has some relatively large issues that continute plague performance and multiplayer gameplay. If you're relatively new to this game and you're looking to experience multiplayer and ultimately test out your strategies, you may not have that great of a time. While many players will experience the following, it is new and casual players who will experience the following in a more frustrating fashion. Multiplayer is not ""smooth"", in fact many have complained it is essentially broken. Crashing (out of sync, random black screens, random dropping) is very common. Second, lag is an issue, period. Whether the lag issue is due to bad PC performance or latency issues, it is a problem for many. Third, multiplayer often requires you to connect with other players and form regular teams which can and is often frustrating for new and casual players (although I'm quite fine :)). 

A few more notes on the latest series of updates:
- No 8v8.... yet?
- Replay via the DLC is great but arguably a tad expensive considering what you get. Plus the replay feature does not have any control functions like pause, fast-forward, etc. Further, it is bugged. 
- Spectator slots are a great addition but it is also bugged and likely causes out-of-syc crashing issues.
- Steam overlay is all messed up. The latest updates have rendered it useless which is a step backwards and quite surprising that it was not looked at before the release. 
- This company seems to think it's cool release release notes several days after an  update. 


I can definitely understand why new and casual players find the multiplayer aspect of this game frustrating. Not only is there a steep learning curve, it has a number of other issues which I noted. I should also note that the overall gameplay is still not better than AS1.

Edit #3 (Version 3.122) as of May 23rd, 2015: This game has been updated several times since I last looked over my review of this game. I would like to note the following:

- SOME Out-of-Sync in-game crashing has been fixed but it still occurs enough to delay a 2v2 tournament and was the direct cause of cancelling the 3v3 league (which I assisted in administering).  It is a MAJOR sore spot in the competitive part of the community. 

- Replays still crash as much as before. 

- I began a campaign for new maps to be implemented in a future version given this game's focus is primarily on multiplayer. I hope this is done because this game has lacked new, quality maps ever since it's release. I have no idea why this didn't cross their minds before hand... It now appears DMS may very well be including it in a future paid DLC pack, which if true, is a joke given that the maps they're reviewing are available FREE as a MOD (unfortunately too many AS2 players are ignorant of this).

- Performance issues still exist (lag, PC performance). Still worse than AS1 in terms of performance. 

- Steam overlay is still completely broken, about a year since it's release.

- Matchmaking, I finally tried it. It's been plagued with issues from day one, no end in sight. It is also not taken seriously, at all, by us in the competitive community.


Edit #4 (Latest version as of July 16th, 2015): It's been almost two months since I updated this review to outline the latest version(s) so I'd like to note a few things:

- Many people still play this game, albeit the singleplayer part of this game. Unfortunately this game, as all RTS games, is geared towards multiplayer. With that being said, the crashes I've noted early, among a new crash since the end of May and the out-of-sync errors that still occur have really hurt two communities: the more experienced modders and modding community and the competitive community. As of three weeks ago I stopped playing due to the sheer amount of errors in multiplayer and overall instability in the game's performance. 

- DMS has struggled to provide a smooth, stable multiplayer ever since it's release. I've been cautiously optimistic and hopeful but I've decided to move on generally and wish everyone good luck playing the game. Out-of-sync issues has decimated larger multiplayer games and as I've noted, the competitive side of the community. It's virtually impossibly to play consistent, stable 2v2, 3v3 and up games. With that being said, It's a game that I truly enjoyed but it's become too unstable to continue forwards.",1412046962,1437063632,False,40,0,0.601809322834014893,4,True,False,False,76561197967932936,82,5,93615,0,51586,1599092432,,
36,9221551,english,"As of right now in beta. It isn't looking good. The game looks like a direct copy of its predecessor in looks and gameplay and i personally definitely hope this is a NEW game not a copy of the old game with some added maps. As far as i see it needs work. Yes, it's in beta. But i see no evidence of any new features of anything significantly impressive about the '2' in the game. You can play the two side by side and hadly be able to tell the difference between them. Except that this second version's maps are broken and the AI can be a lot stupider than before. It looks and plays fine on difficulties easy and normal. But is lacking the realistic aspect this game is going for when you play on expert mode. Bushes do not give you cover and the enemy AI have aim that you can only beat when you take direct control of a unit. As im going through the game this is my initial opinion based on the completion of the first campaign. I have high hopes and i love the first Men of War. But when they released a sequal i was hoping for something better. Like maybe more focus on the Vietnam era? Or the Korean War? As the second world war seems to very extremely overdone. But no matter what i will always buy and play the sequals to any Men of War title as it's an amazing game overall. As of now, if you are interested in the game buy it now while it's on sale and enjoy it when they start shelling some patches. But if you want the buy this game as a newcomer of the Men of War games go for the first game as it's a lot more fun and enjoyable.

EDIT: 2:18 PM One hour later
Game ended up crashing on me a few times midway into a mission. sequence error. Ive seen people having this problem constantly as well in the reviews including the one that the developer team deleted themselves. Which out of context, i think that review had been pretty honest and the developers' flagging response did seem pretty petty. But otherwise this game has many more errors now that i see. And it still is the same game as before. Same mission plots as well. Such as Germany Mission 1. A defence mission exactly like MoW 1 US mission 3 where you defend the Phillipines. Which by the way has an INFAMOUS history of crashing. The Phillipines on MoW 1 was unplayable in multiplayer. Which brings me to suggest you may need to readvise how you put together your defending missions, as of right now the reveiw is still for people to wait until buying this game if they want the full experience.

EDIT 2/25 8:02 PM 24 Hrs of gameplay
I enjoy the game and it's a great game. Still do not recommend to people who are just getting into the men of war games. But one thing i definitely keep in heart is ""If you want to have the best possible Men of War experience we strongly recommend to wait for the full game. Playing the beta is at your own risk and you will very likely encounter issues that are not present in the final version."" From the developers news of the people preordering getting open beta access. I agree 100% and i definitely appreciate the honesty because it basically can sum up my review, being wary that it is a beta, but one thing i would like to reiterate is the fact that they need to make sure it has a significant difference in gameplay or AI rather than something people can claim to be a 'copy and paste' game.

EDIT 2/25 12:21 AM
Game is finished, Looks good, Plays good, But i still say that you should buy the first one and play through it first. As in my opinion it is better, and or the same exact game. If you already have the first one. Definitely buy this, specially if it goes up for sale.

EDIT: 7/16/2015 1:34 AM
They're releasing overly priced DLCs to make up for the fact that the game was an exact copy of the first game even still. Yes i love Assault Squad. But i disagree with the cash grabs that the developers are choosing to go through with. I have to pay $9.99 to have a feature that should have been in the base game. AI players? Third person mode? Base game tanks? MORE singleplayer missions? PLEASE stop trying to take my money and give me a game I will enjoy and continue to play even past it's time. I sure hope the developer comes to their senses and stops charging people for features that belong in the base game. 

My OVERALL opinion. Don't buy this game. Buy the much mroe completed first version for cheaper, and if you like that version, invest in this second version because this still remains to be a large DLC of the first game.",1393093063,1437025305,False,108,0,0.564439058303833008,2,True,False,False,76561198079517808,1011,16,13279,0,8296,1591382994,,

Some pros:

-The ability to take direct control of any unit and unit type.
-The modding community is very much active and continue to make amazing maps, mods, and missions.
-90% of the time the AI actually do what you want.
-It comes with a mission/map editor.
-Unlike company of heroes, vehicles are realistic and need to be hit in the proper spot to kill, not just a heavy or weak gun/ front, back, and side mechanic.

Some cons:

-The graphics could use a little upgrade.
-Vehicles get stuck on tiny rocks, even if it looks like it isn't touching one.
-When the AI do glitch out it is usually fatal for them.
-Enemy AI tanks know exactly where to shoot to blow your tank up while your tank AI have trouble penetrating to even kill the driver, forcing you to do manual control.

42,17036004,english,"Im a big fan of the MoW series, and Assualt Squad 2 is no exception with its amazing gameplay, but the multiplayer is sadly the downfall of the game itself. The game, just like its predecesors, has a bit of a learning curve with it. The rewards of learning can be of a great benefit and makes the game a whole lot more fun.

Now lets talk about the single player aspect first before the multiplayer. The single player portion of the game is pretty good, with four difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard, and you can tell the difference from easy being a cake walk to hard... being just about impossible unless you know every little thing there is to know about the game. But man, can it be incredibly fun. You have five different factions to choose from with several skirmish missions to try for each. Each faction has thier own style making each one very unique to the other. You can play all of these missions by yourself or together on multiplayer. With single player you can pause the game, slow down the speed, or even speed things up. There are a few mods out there that can really spice the game up as well, which can be played by both single or mulitplayer. 

The multiplayer is possible the only bad thing about this great game. The community is very small and many games that are hosted are either locked by passwords, or your kicked as soon as you enter the lobby. This can make you spend hours just trying to find or create a game instead of playing it. Every blue moon you might actually find a decent group of players who like to play the game for fun and not competitively to the point where they kick you becuase your rank is to low or to high. 

When you do get a game you may find that it sometimes lags pretty bad. The ping can be horrendous at times even with just 2 people, but then again you can find a game where there is no sign of lag at all, even with a group of 8 people! The games themselves mostly rely on a individual's own internet connection and not a dedicated server.   

The multiplayer is actually a lot of fun if you can find a group or have a few friends that like to play, but going in alone with the community thats on right now is terrible. The multiplayer was one of the main factors for me getting this game in the first place, and im sadly disappointed by the outcome. 

If you don't care for the multiplayer portion or have a group of friends to play with on here, then its a great game that i recommend buying, but if multiplayer is a big deal, then you better pass up on this until something changes with the community thats on right now.

This game isnt to much of a change from Men of War: Assault Squad 1, but there are some small things that make it that much better. 

1: Graphics are a bit better and some bug fixes (some)

2: Better units. Example: In the mission Overlord for the americans, when calling in paratroopers a squad of 5 parachutes in, instead of just one trooper, this is a major fix in my mind, logically you would send 1 trooper in at a time and sending in squads would be a more ""rational"" amount. 

3: MAJOR FIX: mulitplayer is fixed and you can play online, unlike the other Men of War: Assault Squad that ran off of game spy (an unused and discontinued gaming network). This makes the game so much better, multiplayer, for players who has friends that don't own the game, or those who don't have friends (if you don't have any, make some!)

4: This isn't a fix but makes the game so much more fun, Steam Workshop, custom maps easier to get and mods the same! There are some great maps and mods on the workshop and i recommend anyone that has to check it out!

Sadly the devs don't do the game justice. Bug fixes are few and far between for a start. But because I love the game so much I didn't mind. 

But the DLC are just a ripoof. Adding bots to multiplayer and the ability to save and share replys should NOT ever be paid DLC. It is like buying a car and then being charged extra for the windows. They are such basic features there is no excuse. Other companies give basic features like that as a free addon because they know it hsould be included since release.

The 2 have some similarities, but there are also some differences.The units and tanks do look the same. They have added a few units but not very many. I know that this game is a sequel, which means that the game should be similar, but this game looks REALLY SIMILAR. 
Pros:
-The game has pretty good gameplay and quite a few levels.
-The game is very addictive.
-There are many different types of units and countries to play as.
-There are probably 50 different tanks, and each one feels very different from the others.

Cons: 
-This game is bascially a reskin of the first one. Some of the maps are nearly identical, and many of the units are the same.
-This game has some of the worst voice acting that I have ever heard. Since when did German field commanders have American accents?
-This game is too expensive when compared to teh first which is much cheaper and very similar.

Summary:
Although the game is good, it is basically a copy and paste of the first and seems to be a cash grab. I just picked the first one up and a whole bunch of DLC on sale for $5.

[b]Core Game[/b]
[list]
    [*]The core game as it is will give some enjoyment for a limited time, but most of the gametime will come from mods and community addons.
    [*]Multiplayer can be very fragile, but I have not had problems.
    [*]There's a fair few missions, however most follow a similar theme of gameplay, so can become stagnant.
    [*]The multiplayer is fairly empty, so if you wish to play with someone, it's best to get another friend to play against you
[/list]

[b]DLC[/b]
The game includes purchasable DLC, adding some extra features and maps, but that's about it. They aren't really worth it. You will end up paying for features that should have been included in the game anyway (see AI in the airbourne DLC)

[b]Community[/b]
There are many great people in the community working on workshop items, keeping the game fresh with new maps, modes and mods. The multiplayer remains fairly stagnat and empty.

[b]Editor[/b]
As previously stated, most of my time has come from the editor, where you can create your own battles, ranging from infantry skirmishes to anything you can imagine. The editor is easy to use and allows for great depth in creating missions and maps. Combining the editor with mods will allow for hundreds of hours of gametime if you have the imagination for it,

[b]Summary[/b]
If you are only getting this game to play the missions provided, I would not recommend paying full price (if it's on sale, go for it!), similarly, I wouldn't recommend the mulitplayer. However, if you combine the use of mods and assets from the workshop you can create an infinite number of missions and battles to keep you occupied.

CoH is extremly limited and simplyfied, MoW is the exact oposite, it takes a bit longer to learn the controls but this gives you the option of insane micromanaging, i mean in what RTS can you tell an individual solider to pick up a chicken and use it as weapon?
Or tell a tanker from a damaged tank to throw out the amunition and gas to create a bomb for enemy tanks passing by?
MoW has so many posibilities.
But yes it is true that this game WAS bugged, hence the many bad reviews, but they fixed most of this, i never had any big problem with bugs.
I would buy this game even if it was on full price, and if you find this game at sale you would be an idiot not to buy it.

However, if you already have Men of War: assult squad you might be disapointed because there is not much added, a bit better grafics, some small fixes and new sounds and explosions, thats about it. But i would still recomend you to buy this since this multiplayer is alive and well.

Another one of those games that seems to fall behind the category of potential ruined by a developer. These guys are very loose in their communication, and their responses on their forums tend to be unprofessional and hostile towards criticism. There appears to be no plan, and they just sort of wing whatever they want into the game. Which is unfortunate, because this is actually an entertaining RTS game.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me was they put AI (bots) for multiplayer skirmishes behind a paywall DLC. That is absolutely absurd, and I believe goes on record as the first RTS game to EVER do that in the history of RTS games. AI skirmishes is something that practically every RTS game offers, I mean Starcraft 1 and the first Command & Conquer had AI skirmishes in the base game. This game did not, and then they finally add it, BEHIND a paywall. Absolutely absurd.

An official developer's response on the matter:
""if you do not want it don't buy it.""

Well firstly Mr Smarty Pants, I do want it; good job reading the OP's post, because we are ticked because we do want it, and you decided to paywall a basic feature. However I won't buy it with that unprofessional attitude. Since my money isn't something you seem to want, then I will keep it to invest in a better product. I am going to say that I am pretty appalled by this move, this is honestly the first RTS I seen put AI skirmishes behind a paywall. You should really be ashamed of yourselves.

What is gaming coming to when basic features are put behind paywalls? What next, will I have to pay for access to graphics options too? If they decide to rectify this then I will flop this review, otherwise no.

Still enjoy this game.  There are issues that have cropped up, while others have been fixed.  The only big issue is OOS that started with the intro of dx10.

I dont get OOS in 1v1 or 2v2s.  But seems like 3v3's and bigger are getting them.

Singleplayer is working fine as ever.

DLCs: worth it? meh.  I got them, and I enjoy them.  However it's not necessary so I dont really find them to be worth it for the average player.  I do enjoy watching the replays to see what the other guy did and how they beat me.  I also have been using the AI bots to practice the nations I never use (USSR and Japs) and have been surprisingly decent.  So if newby, its worth it for practicing and learning for Multiplayer.


I still recommend this game.  DMS has been updating the game constantly, even though it's a tiny development team.

Sadly no improvment for this game: OOS (out of sync) since the last major update alongside with constant freezes in MP which DMS can not fix resulted in a more or less complet dead game. Most players have already shelfved it or moved over to BoE although it has the old MoW look but at leas ti runs smooth. 


Edit: Review update: 11/19/2014

More than half a year later DMS managed somehow to improve the performance marginally. 2vs2 is now possible but with more players you still face lag and drops. 4vs4 is still unplayable and the long time ago promised 8vs8 has never been delivered. Gameplaywise it is the still the same arcadish spam and clickfest on tiny maps  although the dedicated community has made a lot of suggestions how to improve it at least a bit. So far DMS decided not to listen to the community and treat the rest of its loyal fan base with ignorance. Slightest critisism result in bans and locked threads. Rumors say DMS treats its employees in a similar way, would at least explain why they fail to fix their game. DMS also has decided to sell the replay feature as paied DLC as it is ""new"" for them while it is for  other games an included  basic feature. So far  all arguments form the old review are sadly still vaild.

If you really look for a WW 2 themed game, grap CoH. It runs better , it looks better and it is just a bit more arcadish than AS 2. If you look for a realistic WW 2 go for Graviteam Tactics or the good old Blitzkrieg. In the end AS 2 is not even worth the 5 bugs when it is on sale especially with DMS's questionable behaviour.

Review 6/11/2014

As a long time player and supporter of DMS and the Mow series, I sadly have to say that  AS 2 is a big fail at its current state. The game has a lots of serious issues and it looks like  that DMS is not willing to fix their game or they  just can not.It seems AS 2 is more  a desperate attempt by DMS to grap some players form its rivial COH  and milk a bit the small loyal players with the result that the series was dumped down pretty hard.

AS 2 is in general a  copie of AS 1(same units same models) with  the diffrence that AS 1 works. The game engine has been updated so the game looks a bit more polished than AS 1 but now  it tends to lag as hell. Currently it is not even  possible to play 2vs2 lag free or without freezes. Matches with higher playercount (4vs4 max!) are more or less impossible as the players drop like flies due to heavy lag caused by the poor net code and/or engine. 

Besides the technical issues the gameplay suffers also a lot from some designe decisions. In AS 1 it was possible to have a nice tank fight or the chance to flank your enemy. This does not work in AS 2 due to tiny maps and ridiculus ranges for tanks. The current gameplay is only focused on spamming wave after wave of infantry. Tanks or emplacements like at guns are not really needed. The entire gameplay feels artificially  pressed in tiny maps  to create a CoH feeling. In additon DMS has also forgotten or did not want to fix existing problems like the strange pathfinding of  the units or the overcomplicated resupply system.

DMS has also introduced an unlock system for new players to getting them used to the units . Sadly this creates more fustration as locked units for all factions seem to have been picked randomly and creates very unfair games especially in matchmaking. But in general this  does not matter as the Matchmaking system does not work properly as well. Tutorials, or a real Skirmish (not the repetitiv SP Missions which they call Skirmish) would have been more helpful for newcomers as the game still explains nothing. It is even hard to say how many people play the game as there is no lobby anymore, only the steamchat which is pretty empty. Also the server browser is bugged as it only shows max 50 servers, most of them skirmish servers so not sure how many try to play MP.

DMS had a lot of time to get their act together. Closed beta for CtA backers (what i did), open beta, delay of the release as the game did not run but was surprisingly  ready for preordering, another dealy of the release and the unannouced move to Early Access without any compensation and several post release patches  should have been enough time to create a game  which offers a kind of enjoyment. The only good thing is the steamworkshop where really dedicated and talented modders can present their creations.

As for now the game can not be recommanded, even it would be on a steam sale.",1402504800,1432941501,False,181,0,0.748522937297821045,11,True,False,False,76561198007350445,50,2,13929,0,12018.0,1592924886,,

I do not regret my decision. The game has a fairly steep learning curve, and yes - each unit has their own inventory... but, after playing the game for a few hours and watching some Youtube tutorials it is no longer an overwhelming experince. For an RTS it does not require as much micro-management as other RTS games, also it's a bit slower paced then most; this is great because the game become more of strategy than Starcraft style ""who can click things faster"".

One of the most unique features of the game is ""Direct Command"" where you can grab any single unit and begin to control it via WASD/Arrow Keys. This is easy to use, and a great way to get the upper hand in a tank battle. 

The downside, being the indie game that it is, some of the models, and gameplay is not as polished as it could be, but 1C  and Digitalmindsoft seem to have a true passion for the games their making, and I anticipate bug fixes and meaningful expansions to be on the way.

The problem with Men of War Assault Squad 2 does not fall into either of these categories. It falls into a special one 

Now, when I first heard that they'll be releasing a MoW2 with Steam Intergration I was excited until I saw the price and notice that not many things changed. Paying ~$35 for the same thing is not really a good thing so I decided to buy on sale which I did. And from what I've experienced thus far, thank goodness I bought it from the sale.

At it's core, MOWAS 2 is a 'what if' Company Of Heroes 2 had much more micromangement and detail involved without the base building and includes mechanics such as managing an individuals soldier, tank or artillery inventory and even ASSUMING CONTROL of them when needed to fine tune your orders such as timing a cooked grenade toss or aiming a specific part of the target etc.

Armoured Warfare in this game puts CoH2's to shame because of how each (and there's a lot) and every Tank has seperate parts which can be neutralized to decommision a tank such as destroying its mobility with a shot to its track or destroying its main gun so that it can no longer fire. Note that they can be repaired should the inventory of the tank or crew have a spare repair kit. The way tanks are destoyed in this game is also amazing as tanks do not have health but instead, rely on their armour thickness and the direction from which the AT fire came from (did it hit from a sloped angle or the rear? etc) so you won't see funny things like a Stuart destroying a King Tiger.

The gameplay in this game is solid and rather in-depth which is the main reason why I enjoy this game so much.
_______________________________________

Single Player
--------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing too interesting here. 7-ish missions for each of the 5 factions which are basically reskins of one another. Luckily, there are mods that add interesting scenarios and SP (or Co-op) missions of their own.

However, Single Player Co-Op has this weird mechanic where person A can buy a Tank but the game decides to give said Tank to person B because he has a smaller army count. In addition, buying a 8-man squad can end up becoming a 2-man squad as a result of this mechanic. Though units can be given away to other players, for a game that has players speaking many languges, trying to share these units can be a hard unless playing with a friend in which case it's only a minor annoyance.

SP can be fun though doing the same thing over and over again can get boring unless you use mods by individuals such as Sir Hinkel.
_______________________________________

Multiplayer
--------------------------------------------------------------

Alongside the weird 'sharing units in Single Player campaign' thingy, multiplayer also has a weird mechanic which although can be turned off in an unranked lobby by the host, it cannot be turned off in ranked matches, period.

Basically, its a levelling system. If I'm not mistaken, the maximum level that one can achieve is around 20 if not more. At level 20, you can purchase any units during a ranked game. At level 1 which most people start as off, you can only purchase half the units at your disposal. Basically, your low level is preventing you from making any expensive yet powerful purchases such as Elite Infantry Units, Heavier Tanks and Heavy Artillery support including half of your special faction troops being locked.

How does 1 increase their level? Two ways. Either they play (and finish) more ranked matches or play through the SP campaign either alone or with a friend.

This levelling system is in my opinion, extremely flawed for players attempting to get their feet wet in ranked multiplayer. Aside from some toxic players which most game have, going against a level 20 opponent when you're simply level 1 offers the new player a huge disadvantage for them and removes the fun for him as he will basically get rofl stomped by superior equipment. In addition to this, most players who I've met in a ranked game tend to have double digit levels while I'm still level 3 and I fail to see how this create a valid and fair leaderboard let alone match when high level players are always going up against lower tier players such as myself. To me, this seems downright broken and makes ranked matches unplayable until I've played a countless number of SP missions for a game that emphasizes on Multiplayer. This mechanic is such a major turnoff that I regret buying this game, even though it was during a deal UNLESS players start getting paired against similarly ranked or levelled players.

One thing that this game has done to avoid players from dropping is by forcing you to finish a game by removing any form of concede button where only your ELO is affected. Instead, even when outnumbered in a 2v1, 4v2 or any other match where you've lost everything, leaving a game midway will do three things instead. Decrease your ELO, degrades your Ranked Trust Rating and finally, Negates you from earning any EXP you gained from that match neccessary to level up your army. And mind you the levels are factions specific. You can have a level 4 Germany army but a level 1 UK army.
So, do players finish a losing game where they get absolutely zero enjoyment because of getting owned hard? No, they don't. They either cut their internet connection, desync the game or simply use Task Manager to close it. Through this,  there would be no changes for their ELO, trust rating or EXP earned.

Stability
--------------------------------------------------------------

The stability for this game is poor. Playing with Local friends won't even mitigate the issue as I still get kicked out of a game even if said friend was living around my neighbourhood. The most notorious one of them all is the 'Out-Of-Sync' Error. 

This error freezes your game and happens at random intervals and can get very frustrating as it will not record down the online game you spent 45-60 minutes playing. Error dc:x are also annoying. 
From what I've gathered, Error dc:0 = the host kicked you mainly due to your ping which is a joke considering that only PC Performance matters while Error dc:3 which is basically the game being a jerk to you.

Keep in mind that this game was in EARLY ACCESS for a couple of months and after its release on April/May 2014, it still gets this kind of problems which is downright unacceptable considering how long of a chance they had to fix this. Heck, the developers are even releasing another EARLY ACCESS game which appears to be MOWAS with a Modern Era reskin somewhere this year which means there goes the technical support for the game.

Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------

Good game, great gameplay, great mechanic. Poor Ranked Multiplayer. Horrendous Stability

And as MOWAS 2 is a multiplayer orientated game whose only major difference from its predecessor is Steam Intergration with the price of ~$40, I can't recommend this game to anyone unless its on sale.

I am a master league sc2 player and my pc has a radeon 6850, just for clarification. I have also tested this on a friends pc  and everything is the same.

  I have noticed that if you issue commands very quickly they do not register and its as if you never issued them. e.g. If you select 5 groups of men and move them all by rapidly pressing the correct # keys then clicking with your mouse, often only the first group or two will have received the command despite you pressing each group key then clicking. This also happens when trying to rapidly click and drag over units and grouping them, jumping between several vehicles to change ammo, telling multiple artillery to fire on ground, telling a squad to throw several gernades, ect.
This will happen in offline skirmish with graphics as low as they go.

This just seems to be how the game is programmed, its like the game can only process APMs so fast and if you go beyond that it doesn't work. I suppose this could be a hardware problem on my and my friends end, perhaps our Cpus are too weak or something like that. But i dont know, in sc2/planetary annihilation i can issue commands as fast as my body will let me, i can rapidly hit group keys and issue move orders and everyone of those commands works and they all start moving. In Sc2 i can click and drag and make up 5 groups in about 2 seconds, in MOWAS2 this is just impossible.

I asked my friend if he noticed this and he said he didn't, i went over to his home and reproduced it, clearly noobs cannot see this problem; you have to be able to micro. I am an armchair historian and i enjoy this game because of that and also i suspect eveyone has this APM cap to deal with so its not like anyone has an unfair edge But still if you are a high ranked RTS player and you know how to micro, sometimes this game will make you want to stick a fork in your eye.",1404948935,1432184261,True,6,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False,76561198038691524,60,1,27267,0,20205.0,1468883022,,

84,15907113,english,"i literally have to give this a ""Not Recommended""... why? let me explain.... 

before? i would have said to buy it, even if you own AS1... sort of a waste of money, but at least no third party multi-player. ( AS1 should have been integrated into steam servers after gamespy closed all servers for all games they supported... but hey, screw that, charge the same players for another game if they want online features )

EVEN before i'd say buy this even with it being the EXACT same game as AS1, just ... horribly optimized? somehow my computer can play AS1 no problem. but AS2 dominated my computer....? when they're the same game? no, i don't understand either.

but then..... they did the WONDERFUL ""Game update 3.112.0"" and this has destroyed the game for me. not only does it run EVEN worse on my computer, to the point that any co-op is impossible even with having very fast internet.... but NOW???

NOW... you have NO supplies in trucks. no ammo, no anything. oh wait, grenades...? cool? yeah, not really...

i loved preparing for an assault, stocking my soldiers up with ammo then heading out. now? you can just put 5 grenades on each person and ... nothing else. i hope you like grenades, because that's all you'll be getting.

before, you could unload shells from trucks and make IED's. now, obviously you can't. 

your troops get a magical resupply of ammo from trucks. even the officer supply drop was ruined. no rifle ammo, no SMG ammo, no MG ammo. your troops can just fire all day and get resupplied from a small paradrop. it makes NO sense and just kills this game for me. the realism is thrown out the window. 

sir hinkel, as i'm sure anyone that plays AS1 or AS2 knows of... ( if you don't, he makes missions for the German Soldier's Mod, which is amazing as are his missions ) made scripts that resupply your troops with crates / trucks. you can watch the ammo going from the truck / crate, and going into your soldiers inventory. it only resupplies to a set number. so 100 rifle rounds, 300 SMG, 1000 MG....

yet the developers somehow did worse than..... a random person using Gem Editor? are you SERIOUS? someone working for free / fun made resupply amazing yet people making LOTS OF MONEY FAIL!?!?!

i've held off on this for a few months now. there's no difference..... i bought AS2 ONLY to support this company for making games that have realism. now? NO. ( stupid me, i even bought the Deluxe Edition to support this company )

sure, video games are all fantasy, even simulators........but this just destroyed it. this game is not ""early access"" or alpha, or beta, or ANYTHING else. it's the complete game, and they ruined it for me...

yes, yes... i know, huge long rant about one thing, but it offended me this much. i even posted to developers......no response. nothing. this is the only reason i waited for the negative review. in hopes they'd see and fix this horrible thing they've done.

because of this, i truly can't recommend that you spend ...any money on this, let alone 29.99$ ( as of this moment )

just buy assault squad 1 for a lesser price tag... unless you are REALLY devoted to multi-player and don't want to use third party programs for it.

seriously... AS1 is a master-piece and there are a lot of cool scripts and other things you can use to make awesome missions yourself. it's not hard, just need to spend some time on it. i'd be happy to help anyone learn how to use things in Gem Editor, especially for AS1. ( also AS1 will run better on your computer, no matter how good.... or crappy your computer may be )

hmmm also, if anyone thinks ""only 21.6 hours?"" or anything... look at my play time for AS1, 358 hours as of today, and it ""may"" be my favorite game...ever. that's why i know AS2 is a huge slap in the face to anyone who has played the men of war games. ( if not going even further back with faces of war and even further back... )

IF and ONLY IF developers put ammo into trucks and crates again will i give this a positive review, and i'd even suggest you pay 29.99$. it's really not a bad game, seeing as it's close to a direct copy / paste of AS1... just doesn't run as smoothly.

The enemy AI in all difficulties seems to be OK, but your AI seems to be totally stupid.

Not only can you steal enemy vehicles and guns, you can steal those vehicles' supplies and use them yourself, and then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL with E and turn the game into a third-person shooter. You can control the inventory of individual infantry down to their damn hats and the bullets in their gun. The environments are almost entirely destructable to a striking degree of detail, which leads to awesome moments like when the bomber you call in for an airstrike is shot down by enemy forces (Yes, you can do that too) and it crashes into a house and knocks it to pieces.
The only two complaints that I have about this game are that you can't commandeer everything on the field (Battleships, a German artillery piece in one or two missions, some boats, etc), and that it's far too similar to the original MOWAS - most of the missions are just ported from the older game, and there are very few engine differences - it makes buying the older game feel like a waste of money. I suppose this could stem from the fact that they're all taken from real battles that faction actually won, but I think the base game could stand to have a little more replay value.

The 50cal machine gun is still on the roof! Well guess what tank commander just got a new best little friend! Awww YEAH!

However there are some downsides, for instance your troops deciding to stop to take pot shots at the enemy no matter what movement you have them on, or the fact things like tanks are really at a disadvantage thanks to not being able to take cover normally. Or how damn HARD it is. But all in all these could be seen as good points too as your troops have minds of their own, tanks are not be all end all, and it is a challenge even if it is just more of the enemy.

59,15287141,english,"Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is probably the worst gay porn I’ve played. Though it looks exciting and sounds fun, and moves hard and rapidly, it rarely gets me off.

People have been saying that THIS entry in the series is supposed to be the multiplayer, coop one. And I (usually) love watching guys tongue each other’s dicks with my friends just like everyone else does. But what if I told you that the American scenes in this collection are basically the same as the German ones, which are basically the same as the Japanese ones, which are basically the same as the British ones, and the Russian ones? All five of the nations. What if I told you that the sniper (or optionally commandos) scene for the U.S. is repeated four times with the other nations? And also the same for the defense scenes? And also the advance-across-the-set scenes? What if I told you that instead of the 40, original group sex scenes advertised on this store page, you get, actually, just 8 that are (arguably) original? And now, forget the what ifs; because it’s true.

These 15 and 25 scenes are actually just eight. Different actors for each nation? Sure. But the interracial variety isn’t enough. 

What about the Steam Workshop mods? Well I played two of the top-rated ones, SirHinkel’s AS2 Missions and RobZ’s Base Defense ones. And they do suck ass, but not in a good way.

SirHinkel’s missions are his interpretations of famous man-on-man actions, including a very well-realized The Alamo orgy, from the epic gay porn film Saving Private Ryan. And though Italian and Hungarian men join the action during SirHinkel’s Stalingrad orgies, they’re almost all just long slogs. You can certainly set the intensity of the boning (Easy, Medium, etc.), but instead of more exciting moments of drama, you usually get merely longer scenes. And sure some people like long, hard sex scenes before the actors get so tired that, finally, they all just exhaustedly come onto each other’s throbbing penises. But let’s be real: the best gay porn follows the quality-over-quantity standard. SirHinkel DID put a lot of strategic thought into his scenes, with many good placements for many dangerous toys, but as for the great climactic moments, when you just want to ejaculate while the actors do: well, they rarely happen, and (strangely) they usually do so near the beginning of his scenes. So it’s just hours of repetitive hard fucking, until it’s finally, suddenly over.

As for RobZ’s base defense scenes, you look at their descriptions and think you’re in for a really good time. You start playing one and lay your initial men in comfy spots, waiting for the other nation’s uniformed-men to creep up and come on them. But it’s all ruined by what must be two bugs. Specifically: when you call in more of your dudes to join the orgy, they (infuriatingly) WALK, and unenthusiastically. And on top of or under that: these men will change their destination to wherever you tell the next boys you call in. So you have to manually look at the troops as they walk onto the scene and jerk them into running to where you actually want them. And on large set pieces, where the defenses are far from where you call in the new boys, it Just Makes Masturbation a Chore, as you move the screen across the map, clicking the walking unit, moving across the map to where you really want them, double right-clicking that spot so they run to THAT SPOT, repeat... 

No gay porn should soften one's cock this much...

And what about the player-on-player multiplayer? Is it fun to jerk-off with someone across the Internet, or with your friend next to you? Not compared to the Company of Heroes multiplayer it isn't. MoW: Ass Sqd 2 favors realism too much, and doesn’t understand something important about gay porn (or porn in general): Realistic Sex is not what we want to watch. I mean, for realism just go do the real thing. In pornography you want to see lots of herculean men doing all kinds of crazy shit to each other’s holes. It’s called FANTASY sex. This understanding is shown by Relic in their Company of Heroes (Vanilla edition). Men of War: Assault Squads 1 and 2 go too realistic, and thus make for undramatic man-on-man ""action,"" over and over and over.

In conclusion: for gay, WW2-themed cream pies and facials, play Company of Heroes instead.

The maps don't have much variations.

This is the best RTS i've ever played. The realism is astounding (for example andgled tanks deflect shots better, like in world of tanks. You can manually control anything, for example you can use the wasd keys and drive a tank and select the coaxial machine gun to gun down enemy troops), great units and graphics and the engine is very felxible.
even though theres a lot of micro stuff, it's really cool because it gives you choices to fight laterally.
Only bad thing is the interface is awkward and theres no proper tutorial.

In multiplayer you scavange for ammuntion for your troops as they will run out quick. Tanks getting blown up left and right. Panacking when you come under fire from an unknown possition. The singleplayer is still boring but the multiplayer makes it worth it's asking price. If you get it for the multiplayer, you get a good game. Get it for the ""story"", and good luck finding any story in there.

As much as I want to say that this game is good, I can't. I can't as it feels more like a DLC or an Add-on rather then a new game.

First off the missions are boring and repetitive, they are the same rinse and repeat capture the flag and hold it to get more units. The maps are so small they allow for no tactics (apart from a few defending missions). The best way to win is to get about 4 squads and do a suicide charge. However, The one thing the game gets right is the graphics. I actually enjoyed the game at the start but you will find that that shine quickly wears off.

There is also no story what so ever, unlike in the original Men of War (The best one I think so far, not including Vietnam as I have yet to buy it) you are known as ""major"". After the first mission you are made a colonel.... It is pointless.

To summerise if you love men of war like I do, I think you would like it but there is no replay value at all.

Unlike many other rts games this one does require thinking of the player, also planning since infantry and vehicles dont have unlimited ammo like u see in most of those type of games. Besides that the resource system forces the player to be careful with the units available to him, there is no unlimited mining. Downside is that the single player campaign, now named skirmish is repetetive for every faction, different surroundings yet same principle. Multiplayer only I would say, then again the workshop luckily has lot of custom mission maps that can compensate for the lack of variety. As far as units go, plenty of variety there, lot of infantry, support and tanks and air support. Not for everyone, if ur used to playing COH (company of heroes) and dont like strategic thinking, then dont bother with this one.

16,15142156,english,"TL;DR at the end.

Is this game good? Yeah. If you like your RTS games to be fast paced, combat centered and tactical, you'll probably like this game. A lot. Is it a great game? No. Let me explain.

What I do like about this game is that although it's very complicated, with fuel and ammo counters, stamina, different stances and cover types, camouflage, ... it feels very ergonomic. It let's you zoom out the camera to a reasonable level, there are buttons for highlighting your own troops, enemy troops, corpses and equipment, ... There are systems in place to facilitate rearming and refueling, ... You have a lot of work to do, much more than in the biggest competitor atm, COH2, but you're given the tools to do it. Very nice.

And whilest where talking about differences to COH2, let's mention the fact that there is more unit variety. A lot more. Not only are there more units available, there's also more different factions to chose from, and they're more balanced. Sure, Germany has excellent tanks, but if the enemy fields a IS2, ISU 152, M36 jackson or something other with a big gun, your powerful tiger will be a smouldering wreck in seconds.

Which brings me to my second point that I like. This game is unforgiving. You can't just rush in an infantry squad and hope for the best. If the enemy has his forces positioned well, you'll lose your squad in seconds. This makes scouting and stealth more important. Furthermore, you have to really think where you'll position your armour and support weapons because if you expose a tank for a bit too long or a bit too much one shot can knock it out.
This may seem very daunting and all, but remember that it works both ways. If the enemy drives it's tank right through a field where you have positioned an at-gun you're going to kill that tank. This hardcore style of doing things forces but also empowers you to think about positioning, movement and assaulting. Do it right and you'll be rewarded. Do it wrong and you'll suffer.

A last thing to note about the game is the resources system. There's no base building, nor is there resource gaining through capping or builings. You all start with a certain amount of manpower, which ads up over time. If you buy an infantry squad and waste it, you've not only wasted the mp, you've also delayed your next purchase. This doesn't matter that much if you're buying only cheap infantry, but even with them you have to be resourceful and efficient.

Also: modding scene!

All in all, my description may make it seem like this is an absolutely terrific game. There are however some things that hamper it's greatness.

First of all and probably the least important: the graphics and particularly the effects are a bit lackluster. The maps are certainly nice enough but some thanks look a bit 'stale' by lack of a better term. Also, explosions are a lot less impressive than in COH for example. Granted, this gives it an edge on performance, certainly on my machine, but the game would be a bit more immersing.

Second, the infantry control is not always all that great. Somethimes soldiers will not stick to the wall you've orderd them to take cover behind, or they will run out of cover when you gave them another command. They also tend to react rather slowly, although this could be due to my middle-low end machine.

Let me reinstate that these are all minor gripes about the game. The following however, are not.

The most annoying thing about this game in itself is that a good deal of units are initially locked behind a level system. You want elite infantry in a halftrack to quickly plug a gap in your line? Too bad, you're not level 15 yet so you can't have them? Want a kingtiger? Nope, not before you get to level x.
Sure, custom games have a setting to make all faction units available to you regardless of level, but custom games don't grant you any xp, so you won't level up to unlock all your desired units 'for real'. Xp is gained via playing AI scenario's or ranked games. 

These skirmishes vs the AI however, consist of a range of quite similar missions per faction, like hold point A or take point B. The most irritating part about this, however, is the fact that the mission structure is the same for all factions. Just defended German positions against a Soviet onslaught? Great for you, you're going to have to do it again only with another faction. Even the side objectives are the same. In this defence mission with the Germans you have the option to repair a damaged Jagdpanther far in no mans land. Play this mission with the Americans and the Panther becomes a Pershing. It appears from the same side of the map and even the text cue you get for the event is the same.
This problem is however less apparent in the assault missions as the maps do change.

What enfiuriates me the most is that they kept basic functionality out of the game and are now selling it as dlc. Do you wan't to save your replays? You'll need to buy Iron fist DLC at € 9,99. The most striking however is that there's no real skirmish against AI. You can't play the multiplayer gamemode against bots. They'll be adding this in a future update but you guessed it: not after you lay down another 10 euros or your regional equivalent.

The developpers have been accused of publishing this game as a means to finance their next project but stated explicetly that this is not the case. However the fact that they're adding in basic functionality as paid features combined with the fact that assault squad 2 doesn't differ that wildly from the first one (gameplay and unit wise, graphically and ergonomically it's an imrovement) speaks against them. 
Luckily for us there's a mod that adds bots but still.

TL;DR = To wrap up: this is a game that fills a very specific niche in the (dying) RTS genre but does so very well. Gameplay is fluent, tactical and engaging. The stakes are high and so are the rewards.
The fact they've decided to lock units after a wonky level system combined with the basic functions being pay walled holds it back from greatness however. Connectivity and responsiveness can suffer a bit but are on the good side.

If you already bought the first iteration, you might want to wait until this goes on sale (and it regularly does). If you're looking to get into the franchise, this might be the place to start if you can put up with the aforementioned things.

54,15118469,english,"Let's put something strait. This is without question and doubt the single best ww2/war/strategy/action game i have ever played. I came to it without having played the previous games, not really knowing what to expect. I came to it having played all of the Company Of Heroes games and all sorts of ww2 games since the 90's. This game is something else. 
At first glance it might seem impenetrably complex and intimidating. But it is surprisingly easy to get started and get right into the action. And before you know it, you have played half a dozen missions without a break and are wondering where on earth the past 8 hours went. There is a difficulty setting for just about everyone. From the cassual player to hardcore fanatics who want a punnishing experience. The missions are long and multi layered. The maps are vast. The action is intense. There is a great deal of scope in the game. From commanding entire divisions at once, right down to making each individual soldier count in behind enemy lines missions. This is NOT another Starcraft clone. The game presents you with a challenge. A problem to solve. And it's up to you to solve it. Thinking your way around objectives. 
Taking your time. It never once puts up an arbitrary timer that forces you to waste wave after wave of precious men and material. It doesn't just spawn you and the AI and then whoever spams the most units wins. If you're looking for that kind of game, move along, nothing for you here. If you're after one of, if not the greatest WW2 experience to date, this is the game for you. The graphics still hold up. The game runs fine on lower end computers and looks great on gaming rigs. 
It's largely bug free. There is the odd AI path finding issue, but nothing that can't be overlooked. It is still recieving patches and with an active modding community, there is literally no end to replayability.

For starters my type of strat game is a Total War game.
This game is decent in its self, but the campagin is the exact same has the first game. That being said you're mainly going to be playing mutliplayer, but thats my main problem. The multiplayer in this game has huge balancing issues, and the fact that there is a gigantic lag issue when playing with people. The lag causes your game to drop to around 15 fps and all your troops animations look super choppy as a result. Not to mention this makes direct controll a pain. Also, there are large amounts of exploits in this game making balance even worse. I.e. enemy tank is out of your range so you direct controll your tank and shoot a tree that is infront of your tank and the enemy.  ( dont believe there is a drop off for shell pen btw.) Single player was pretty fun, but I hate this games multiplayer, its espescially hard for new people because no one will put up with or teach them. Normaly your team either leaves you because of it, or starts greifing, etc.

The pros:
good armor pen machanics
Movements orders are ok, pretty glitchy a lot of times though.
Good modding community(thats going to mean a lot, the base game is super bland)
Editor is pretty fun(400 flame throwers vs 20 mg42 machine gunners? Why not!)
Again the tanks are really fun to mess with people
Direct controll is amazingly stupid and funny.(Smg preferably ppsh +at nades= Super Salty enemy)
Fairly competetive mp scene(I dont really like that but some do so im listing it)
MODS(Yea I know i listed it before)
Game is pretty fun to play mp or coop with friends(The only friend I played this game with is a fag who hordes all the points to buy troops with btw then complains he has nothing while I cap points with a single guy kek)

For me this game isnt really worth anywhere near $30, and the fact that this company puts stupid DLC out that doesnt even work. I'd price the game at around $15 being generous.

For those new to the Genre Men Of War is basically an amazing WW2 RTS which has the capabilities to allow one to alter their unit's inventory, as well as take direct control of that always satisfying Katyusha. Whilst Assault squad 2 bears many similarities to assault squad one, there are a few mission differences (although all different maps are still 'unique' in their own special way) meaning one can never truly be bored playing this game.

Though the major benefits of owning AS2 rather than regular AS are many:

+Decent community modding.
+Multiplayer is still up and not running on gamespy: P
+New units (I’m sure)
+A pleasant variety of maps which surpasses its predecessor

Overall a very decent game with good visuals, lovely soundtrack and an amusing amount of medics needed to keep ones army from being ripped to shred... Damn those American machine guns!

But seriously, it's a WWII realtime strategy game with more realistic mechanics than for example Company of Heroes. Each soldier is truly an individual with his own health and inventory (which you can modify). You can squad them up and move them as a squad or send each individual to a specific location.

Ammunition and fuel run out and you have to resupply your forces, you can micromanage each individual soldier or do it as a squad.

Tank mechanics are a bit different than soldier mechanics. Tanks don't have healthbars. Instead, if you for example destroy the engine or turret, it can't drive or move it's turret respectively. The penetration mechanics are also more realistic. If you play Warthunder, it's a simplified version of the one you're used to in Ground Forces. 
Tanks, as do all vehicles, must be crewed by soldiers. The crew can be knocked out. If a tank doesn't have a gunner, it can't aim and fire it's gun. The crew will automatically try to fill the most vital spots, so it's possible to have a tank with one crewmember that switches between seats as needed, although this is of course far less efficient than a fully crewed tank. 

But one of the most interesting features is the ability to 'ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL'of a soldier or vehicle. Making it a sort of top-down 3D shooter..thingamajigger.

When I'm playing a singleplayer game I often get the feeling I'm a small part of a large scale battle. You usually get control over a squad or two and sometimes some vehicles. And when you force a breakthrough, your allies will pour through it and take advantage of it.

And there is also a powerful map editor that is easy to understand, so there are a lot of maps made available by skilled editors.

TL;DR Buy this game or bad things will happen to your pet ostrich named George V.

32,14804825,english,"Looking for a good review to help you decide whether this game is worth it? Well, Good Sir, You Have Come To Just The Right Place!

Im going to make this simple, quick, and easy to read.

The sheer variety of WWII weaponry makes this game very fun.

Armor Phyics? They got 'em! If you tank gets hit in a certain spot, it will either go through or bounce. For being an RTS its pretty amazing. If you see it, you will know what I mean.

 ( Extra Info: This game has armor phyiscs, as well as that tank thing where if the shell goes through, it damages what it hits inside the tank, along with shrapnel and such, just like it War Thunder.)

The graphics are very detailed and accurate.

This WWII RTS tops all the others with every single one of it's features. Dev's, you got it right!

When I say immersion, I MEAN immersion. You can personally take control of units and shoot with accuracy indications, range, and more! What could possible be better than controlling some of the most powerful weapons of WWII?

If this review, that trailer they have, and some other showcases don't convince you that this game is THE game of WWII RTS's, go watch some gameplay on YouTube. If you still do not want it after that, shame on you. This game is WORTH IT.

Here comes the hardest part of the review...

What is wrong with the game?

I own both Men of War: Assault Squad 2 and Men of War: Assault Sqaud (1).

There is not very much of a difference between the to except pricing. (As Of This Review, The Price Of Men Of War: Assault Squad is $29.99 USD) To be honest, If I were you, I would get the first game before this one, since it is cheaper, and will give you a better idea of this one so you can think about getting this one. I am not saying this one is identical to the first, because its not. It has a few more tanks, and of different types, as well as some cool planes, and truly fantastic skirmish battles and maps.

Now I leave the decision up to you. This game is worth it, it really is. But I do not reccommend buying it before you buy the first one. 

All that insanity behind, the verdict is: This Game Series Is AMAZING.

However. this game was focused on and sold as a Multiplay game with Match Making w ranks and ladders etc.
Sadly, despite all the efforts so far by the Devs, the game is a miserable problem/headache for the MP and MM communities.  not being one of them i can not go into details on just what all is wrong.  But i know many who do and they are .... frustrated and ... unhappy in increasing numbers.
Do I reccomend this game?  as I said, I am getting  hundreds of hours of gaming fun and cannot really dis the game or the Devs, I have no prob dealing with the coop rules.
So, if you like solo mod missions, Workshop is loaded with awesome ones I reccomend buying it.

- improved graphics ( maybe a little on some machine)
- steam multiplayer (broken)
- matchmaking (broken)

I bought the game twice (for me and for a friend) and my mind just can't understand how an engine from 2006 could run so bad. The game is barely playable in Multiplayer.

It lags for 80% of people in multiplayer no matter what your PC configuration is. May be if I take some of NASA's supercomputers I will be able to play a normal game.

1) All the MOW games are pretty similar, and all good.  There are many complaints about how MOWAS2 is the same game as MOWAS, and this is largely true, but not a reason to rate the game down.

2) If you've played Company of Heroes, then MOWAS is similar but much more realistic - more like a WW2 simulation.  This makes it a harder game harder to learn, and harder to master but ultimately makes it feel more like you are playing WW2, rather than playing a video game (as with CoH)

3) Unfortunately DMS (the devs) are a little sketchy.  For us, the gamers, this means a) the multiplayer is sometimes unreliable and dropped games, lag and connection faliures are too frequent.  It also means you get shady things like MOWAS2 being bacisly the same as MOWAS (see above), and DLC's that are rather obviously designed just to make money and have minimal content.

- Detailed vehicle system: Vehicles need fuel. They also have detailed parts that can be damaged, like the tracks, the turret, and the engine. They can also be repaired to get a vehicle back in action.

- Supplies: Troops need ammo. Take ammo from dead soldiers or call in a supply truck to resupply your troops.

---

Assault Squad is back! and it is still one of the most challenging and rewarding RTS experience as its predecessor (please refer to my review of the original Assault Squad). 

What is new:

- Nicer graphics, not jaw dropping, but cleaner, better lighting, nicer explosions, nicer vehicles models and more varied camoflage skins etc.
- Nicer UI, easier to manage squad, easier to see which dude is running out of ammo, easier to select units etc.
- Gameplay tweaks: shorter weapon range, more useful infantry, faster pace overall and make actions more close up and exciting. However, unless you have sunk tons of hours into the original, you probably won't notice the differences.
- A few new skirmish maps with more variety of objective. Tank battles are EPIC!
- Steam integration, Workshop makes downloading and sharing maps easier, and SUPPOSEDLY better match making. However, I seems to have a few problem finding games, not sure if it is problem on my end or maybe I choose bad time to play where no one else is playing?

Overall, I really love this game as I loved the original.

79,14239234,english,"*Updated 2/17/2015 with the release of the latest large scale patch*

Hated by casuals, loved by the hardcore enthusiasts, MoW continues it's time-tested formula of unrelenting combat in a realistic light. If this is your first foray, be forewarned: This ain't your Daddy's Company of Heroes. The learning curve is steep, but the basics are easy to learn. If 'micro' is a term that makes you shudder, look elsewhere. If base building is a deal breaker, look elsewhere. If you want to rush techs and move large blobs at your enemy, look elsewhere.

This is a 'thinking man's' RTT. Units have their own stamina, inventory, and complex hitboxes. Though infantry are summoned on-map in squads, they can and often are broken up into small groups or as individuals. Cover AND concealment are fully functional in game, and the environment is fully destructable. Enemies held up in a fortified house? Why not bring the roof down on them with an AT grenade? Or light the building next to it on fire and let it spread to them? Heck, you can even get ridiculous and drive a tank through it and crush them alive, which brings up the major feature of this game: Direct control.

Units can be taken control of on a deeper level, played much like a third person shooter, where you can crawl about as infantry, cook grenades, handle a sniper rifle, hold the line with a machine gun, or clear out a trench with a flamethrower. Or perhaps you prefer to man the controls of a tank, and enjoy the best penetration and hitbox system for tanks in the RTS genre, where it's important to choose proper ammo types and hit specific parts of a vehicle to damage systems, kill crew, or even get lucky and send a turret flying off.

The weak will be punished, but those that stick with it(Or better yet, find friends to enjoy the game with in either Co-op or PvP) while find one of the most satisfying and truly dynamic games in the RTS genre.

Pros:
-unrivaled dynamic play. there is no real 'meta' or build orders to adhere to, playstyles adjust to tactical situations, not the other way around. No two games play the same!
-Satisfying realism, if it would work in real life, it would probably work in-game.
-US, UK, Germany, Soviet Union, and Japan all come with their own campaigns, and robust armories.
-Beautiful levels of detail, especially in vehicles.
-Unique gameplay
-Great modding community, and steam workshop support.
-Dedicated developers, always getting new patches and features. Just recieved a major update patch that adds new gameplay features and refines older ones.
-Unique style of play that forgoes base construction and economy farming in favor of persistent combat and steady income for unit call ins.Teching is based on time, rather than construction and research.

Cons:
-Steep learning curve. Recently, the latest patch included tutorials, however, and this issue is largely resolved if you invest the time to learn.
-inconsistant AI behaviour. Sometimes it's really brilliant, sometimes it's supremely dumb.
-inventory management can be cumbersome at times.
-If you played the first game, the sequel is barely a sequel at all. It's almost 99% identical, but on steamworks instead of gamespy. The latest patch has added some new features, however, that have some bigger changes in gameplay. Namely, the new supply system, and unit veterancy.
-Though it's optional in lobby matches, matchmaking forces a 'unit locking' system where you must grind through unlock progression to unlock basic tools on the battlefield, leading to terrible balance situations.

Despite it's 'rough around the edges' package, this is a solid game in a genre that is rife with imitation of games from 15 years ago. Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a breath of fresh air in a realm of 'C&C' and 'Starcraft' copy-cats and games that try to do what Men of War does, but with terrible controls like Theatre of War and Graviteam tactics and a turtles pace. MoW is a fast-paced, tactical, unforgiving conquest with good controls and a good presentation, with ever evolving features and support that steadily address it's shortcomings.


2/16/2015: Patch added unit veterancy, automatic resupply for infantry and vehicles near supply trucks/crates, reworked stamina system, graphical improvements, and greater server stability. Balance changes were also included.

Pros 
- Decent multiplayer community

- Decent workshop community pumping out plenty of mods

Cons
- Developers seemingly did not and do not listen to customers when we told them what we wanted in this sequel.
- A glorified engine upgrade to Assualt Squad 1 that still runs worse and is still not optimized.
- Most units and maps are copy/paste from AS1 (Devs even stated not every unit will be remade)
- Multiplayer is buggy, laggy, and the MM does not like you.
- Missing basic features of nearly every other modern RTS (Non mission skirmish mode for starters)
- DLC created to sell you the previously mentioned basic features at insane prices (10$ for Replay ability and 5 small missions!)
- DLC apparently prioritized over optimization


All in all, is it a good game? Yes in its core. But I believe the devs are doing very shoddy work behind it and its a victim of their ineptitude. I may change this review later, based on what the game becomes, but for now I say vote with your wallet, and vote no.

Infantry has health bars, while artillery and tanks have a damage system based on the parts

also it has a nice field of view system, hide in bushes or throw smoke grenades to be able to sneak upon your enemy, or build sandbags while the smoke covers you.

5 nations of WWII, Germany, Russia, Japan, Britain and USA, all have their own units and tanks, which more or less balance in the normal gamemode!

18,14209112,english,"Compared to the first assault squad this one plays a lot better in many different ways.

Though the fact that the first men of war has more content makes it a bit sad that these don't really have any kind of new units or soldiers beside the elite troops for some factions.

Because this one came out last year it works a lot more stable on newer computers. The graphics have also improved a great deal thanks to normal maps and better models.

The AI is special as ever and can't always be trusted with your units. When in combat they are still good enough to slowly advance if given enough units and support. Though you'll still stick to mostly controlling your units by yourself it sometimes still works to just let the AI handle that part while you focus on getting reinforcements ready.

The interface has been simplified in some areas and makes it a lot easier to micro manage your soldiers on the front. With the new interface also come a few new additions such as the ability to see which units are out of ammo and need to be rearmed. This can now also be done in squads since the ammo is given to the specific unit that uses that type of ammo ( a riflemen will still get rifle ammo even when holding a smg). This also goes for ammo sharing when units are together in a squad.

AS2 also has a leveling system that helps new players learn from the start up. More seasoned player can always bypas this system in MP matches if the host is willing to. It has it advantages and disadvantages though. My friend and I did a match with the level mode enabled and was able to use tigers which I could barely defeat with my matildas and crusaders. Then again, you can always turn it off when you are the host.

Though I heard close to nothing about it, but it seems a DLC is coming soon. These will most likely be MP maps and some skirmishes. Don't buy these unless you really want to support the devs.

This game probably has one of the most supportive and easiest ways of modding your game. This also comes with a great modding community that varies from maps, SP missions/skirmishes and mods that completely change the game!
Some of these mods also add in a lot of units which mostly make up for the lack of content.
Thanks to the steam workshop, mods sometimes only require you to subscribe and you're good to go!

They also recently introduced a patch where they gave units a veterancy system. Though in SP this doesn't go from game to game (as in CoH where you could call in your veterans from the last mission). It basicly makes them more effective in combat.

TL;DR

It's better than the previous MOW AS, and I recommend it if you are a heavy RTS player.",1422455702,1422455702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198032587678,443,7,24416,0,6855,1593374984,,

You have access to five factions, I mostly use the Japanese, though I have tried all five and they are all unique and fight in their own way. The AI is fantastic, nothing better than seeing the AI take over one of your primary weapons systems, or seeing a sniper, take over a machine gun nest on his own to slow down a large scale advance of enemy forces, awesome to see. The Infantry are the best I've used ever in a game, they move so realistically and behave as you would expect from a group of real soldiers, they are very tactical, their movement is something to see. 

There are hundreds of units overall in this game, each nation has a bevy of options, nothing cooler than calling in a Japanese Banzai attack - it's where you use a card to enable the AI to send 3-4 light tanks and about 20 infantry units immediately upon an area of your choosing. Each nation has unique features such as this, for example the British can call in a SAS-SOF group to augment their efforts. Graphics are amazing, the new patch today, added some awesome shaders and improved the overall implentation of advanced graphics capabilites.

76,13814173,english,"From reading other reviews it seems that this game is not much different from the first, however, if you are like me and have not played the first, this is a pretty good WW2 game. In my opinion I enjoy this game a great deal more than I did Company of Heroes. In CoH, you spend much of your time micro managing buildings and capturing points. That is great if your are a traditional RTS fan of Star Craft. MoW does away with the buildings and I feel that less is more. It makes up for the lack of buildings by allowing a greater micro of the units. So you are more focused on managing units in combat rather than worrying about building queues. In that regard, it reminds me of the the venerable game, Close Combat 3. That said, this game isn't as perfect as CC3, but it comes close. One touch that I really love is that you can press 'E' while a tank is selected to control it manually with the mouse and WASD. You can switch between HE, AP, and machine gun in this mode so you can often take fortified infantry with a well placed HE shell that the AI cannot come up with.

Personally, the single player part of this game is all right, but where it shines is multiplayer. I have installed a great mod available on the workshop called ""GSM Fields of Honor XI (Multiplayer Mod)"" and it is a blast. The games are very rock paper scissor in infinite multitudes. Let us say the opponent has set up sand bags with machine gun nests. I can take it out with a tank. If the opponent is smart he has set up a machine gun nest with AT guns, tank support, and a machine gun. Well, it is time to get artillery and bombard the bejesus out of him. I have had a few games with a great fun of arty duels between german rocks and russion 150mm. One time I got fed up and just got a PzIII to bumb rush the artilary and run over the gun to destroy in manual mode. It is much more fun than CoH ever was. Worth the $8 I picked this game up on a sale. I think its worth at least $25.

Now to give a fair review, the MP has issues. Eight player games are sometimes laggy and people drop out all the time due to connection issues. Six or four player games are more reliable. There is also NAT issues, but it uses the Steam networking so you do not have to sign up for a 3rd party account (just uses your Steam identity), but you can fix that by adding Steam ports to your port forwarding.",1420314072,1420314072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197989177711,146,14,3320,0,1841,1548470805,,

     Alot of people say this is the exact same game as as1, and really, it is pretty much the same, but many game mechanics were changed, which is good.  They took some really important features out of this game, but they added good mod support, to correct these problems.  I like this game, but it is really similar to as1 with not enough differences, which I dont like, I really only recommend this game if you havent played as1, or are new to the series. 

      And with the maps, there are VERY good new maps which I absolutely adore, but in some of them, I realized there is no versatility, no game-changing things, and it gets almost robotic, for example, im USA facing Japan, the enemy player sends a kamikazi, sneaks through all of my lines, and then takes out my sherman jumbo.  Im spooked, and then reinforce my lines and everything, but within that few seconds of attempting to strengthen my lines, the enemy player attacks with elite infantry and light tanks, which I cant counter because of my jumbo gone, and I lose the game because of one kamikazi.  I just dont see that anymore in as2, atleast, not often enough, and that a major flaw in this game for me, making me at times really frustrated.",1420210299,1420210299,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198040438744,122,7,60921,0,9886,1600634113,,

30,13628116,english,"Here's the deal:

This game is identical in almost every aspect to the first MoW: AS. The maps are identical, the controls are identical, the UI is (mostly) identical, etc. However, the first AS is very old. If you're like me you put hundreds of hours into it by now and have probably even stopped playing it because you've done everything there was to do. I was at that point with the first one and hadn't opened it up in over three months because I was tired of it, until I saw this go on sale for 60% off. 

I figured ""Hey, what the hell, I get the full deluxe edition for $15 and I will be able to play Assault Squad again even if it's the same damn game."" As long as you know going into it that this is just an updated version of the first one, you will be fine and enjoy it. Do not expect anything new from the single player aspect other than a couple UI changes and (somewhat) better voice acting. The voice acting in the first one was so terrible though it wasn't hard to improve on. The only real changes are the focus on Steam and multiplayer. Steam Workshop means this game will stay fresh for a very long time with new content from users and it has all the bells and whistles of modern Steam games like cards to collect, XP to earn, in-game achievements to show off, etc. 

The other noticeable change is the difficulty level. Remember how ridiculously hard the first AS was on Hard mode? I literally rage quit dozens of times because the difficulty level was ABSURD. This game.. not so much. The Hard mode feels like Normal mode from AS. Heroic here is basically Hard mode there. This is a good thing in my opinion because it now allows hardcore fans like me to earn Heroic achievements because they were unattainable in the first. I wouldn't even try Heroic mode in the original one because I figured the AI had pocket nuclear missiles and a time machine to warp stealth fighters and gauss cannons back to beat my ass with. If you ever completed the single-player campaign from AS on Heroic mode, you should write a book about your endeavor and send me a copy. 

TL;DR

Updated version of the first game. Difficulty turned down a few notches. Get this on sale and don't expect a whole new game.

The day it was to be released they changed it to an early acces game, no chance for players to get money refunded, they did that on purporse. The game lost almost all veteran players and thus completely changed the way the game was played, the new playerbase comes from COH and these players try to play the game like it was COH. 40 patches on and the game is still buggy, imagine you buy a pair of jeans and they have to be patched more than 40 times and they are still full of holes. The engine for MOWAS1 worked alot better, MOWAS2 is actually a downgrade of the first game, in this version you cant even play big maps, biggest map is 4vs4 pl and the new maps are unbalanced, one side can reach zones before the other, so in MOWAS2 you play on the same old small maps as you did in MOWAS1. The developers do not listen to any critisism at all, you get sencored or banned, Digitalmindsoft resembles a company out of north Korea or the old DDR. This game has been on sale many many times because Digitalmindsoft do not have the funds to fix/finish the game, they want us the players to fund it as they develop it and the constant sales ruins the game. because everytime there is a sale, new players come and have to learn the game and they do not listen, they just do as they please and the learningcurve is steep, very very hard to get a good game with all the veterans gone and only new players that do not know how to play the game.

42,13553683,english,"Bought this game expecting much the same as COH.  Have to say the detail is much greater than I had expected.  (picking up and using dropped weapons, vehicle damage is down to the panel hit, soldiers helments flying off when shot).  I do think some of the historical accuraces in terms of when certain weapons and tanks become available leave a lot to be desired in the scenarios.

Whilst this is squad oriented you can move individual soldiers, this can be a help and a hinderance.. it does become a bit to much like micro management.. i.e having to heal troops when a medic is right next to them, or having to individually supply troops with new ammo when they are all standing around the supply truck... this does leave it a little frenetic in the heat of battle.

I started the game on normal difficulty which seems REALLY difficult.. so switched to easy which seems far to easy so struggling with getting the right tempo.. artillery strikes are rediculously accurate in the scenarios.. to the point a nebellwerfer was more pinpoint accurate than an 88.....and loaded and fired more quickly it seemed.

Apart from those little gripes the scale of the maps, certain micro management (in house out specific window) and the overall game play gave it a slightly more 'real war' feel vs COH (certainly COHII) COH is still one of the best , WWII squad games available but this is up there.

70,13233098,english,"Because of the time and energy I have put into this game (400+ hours), I feel I am now ready to make an informed review.This game is greatest game in history of all PC games.  Period.  It also has so much more potential.  You can replay missions and scenarios over and over and the fact that the open and interactive  environment and ballistics and physics engine make for unlimited possibilites.  I love how every nuance is important in this game.  I am a defensive player and this game is perfect for those individuals.  Individuals that are germanic and order orientated and not just run and gun cowboys.  If you struggle with ADD or have a short attention span, don't bother with this game---even on easy mode.  This game is made for highly intelligent strategic thinkers who are also very talented tacticians. This is the closest digital experience I have found so far that allows me to immerse myself in and experience world war II realistically and without an Allies bias.  The fact that is is underfunded, made by a small game studio and is still full of bugs and crashes way too often, has not stopped me from clocking in over 400 hours now.  I am world war II and RTS fanatic.  The only game I have played more than this would be Company of Heroes 2 at 950hours on record.  I have subsequently stopped playing company of heroes often when I came across this game.  I hope that more money gets invested in this game and a greater financial incentive is placed on the developers to make this game more stable, less buggy, and support SLI and crossfire support and run natively at 64bit.  I have had memory related errors on this game litterally thousands of times and it is very frustrating to crash out while in the middle of battle.  I have 64GB of RAM, 4x water cooled AMD 290x and a water cooled intel 4960X.... my system is NOT anemic but I do concede that I play the game at 4k resolution.  The user interface and text is horrrifically small when playing at 4k and changes from the developers to support 4k users should be a top priority.  We are the users who would have paid $1000 for this title.  Considering how much money I invest in hardware and digital technology, how valuable my time is worth in the market, and how much I have invested in free to play WWII titles like war thunder and World of Tanks, $1000 for a more refined version of this game would unquestionably be a bargain for people like myself.  If your smart and intelligent, love world war II with an unrelenting passsion, and enjoy realistic hardcore RTS titles (not just dumbed down starcraft) this is without a doubt the greatest investment you will make thus far in your life.  I cannot stress this point enough and I am bias only because I want more money to be put into this game to make it better.  It's incredible but has so much further to go and holds so much promise.  If you have any questions about the game, I am always open to talking to people about it.  You can email me at bekraus@gmail.com or add me on facebook at www.facebook.com/bekraus

that's the key: it gives players options. you want to use 8 dudes and be super micro and control everything? go ahead. you want to play more a standard general that let's his troops perform? that's ok too. granted the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, but its not as micro intensive as I thought it would be.

last thing, this game is HARD! i mean i thought i was pretty good at strategy and tactics but the ai on normal ran over me like i was playing france instead of usa. takes some getting used to, but still really fun if you like a challenge (easy requires you not to be stupid, but you don't have to worry about your inf dying in seconds to anything/everything)

biggest beef: apparently the latest patch made it where you cannot disable shadows. ouch on my fps. also my gtx 570 and i5 cpu hate physics, which the game doesn't allow to be disabled.

16,12947623,english,"Finally a game about ww2 without one-sided balance. 
You can die for the Motherland, Fatherland, Churchill, Freedumbs or Emperor without yelling that everything enemy has is OP (japanese tanks will make you raise your eyebrows tho). Everything feels good: how tanks react, how infantry throw grenades or change weapons depending on target on their own, tanks and artillery operate at beliveable range, armor thickness and angle seems to work in realistic fashion too. However some weapons that should penetrate 160mm of armor can't kill pz4 which may be just bad luck, but is irritating for sure. Also it's always a big fanservice to me when each faction speaks on it's own language, instead of ""Kill that faschistsky cyka for stalin comerade boris tovarichs brat comerade"" nonsense.


But, and it's a big BUT (Y(__|, there's some things that really SUCK:
1) it's basically same as previous game with like 5 new maps, fancier graphics and shittier netcode, yet costs full price and it seems that AS1 servers are closed.

2)If someone in same match as you have PC FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, you will have tremendous lags too.

3)Units' pathfinding is probably most infuriating thing i encountered in my life, and believe me, living in Russia you will get thing or two to be pissed at in your lyf. Units will try to go through impassable terrain and get stuck if you wont control them like babies, infantryman, after an order to throw grenade can start doing modern dance moves and catch a bullet instead, SU-122 will agro at infantry and will get shot by Jagtiger in the ass when you're not looking, etc.

4)INTERFACE. Your first couple of hours will be literally unplayable since you will have to call all the scientists in the world specializing in awful GUI to help you figure out what the hell is going on with this squad control. Also half of your keyboard is some random hotkeys that control everything from towing artillery pieces to manually jacking off your soldiers.

5)Units' field of view: you will see for yourself should you decide to play this.

6)ELO in a game where 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 modes exist. People just never learn that it only works in 1v1. 

Now after my ass finally chilled, let's get back to good shieeet again. 

  Unit variety: even tho as a result of applying semi-realistic characteristics to tanks and stuff some units are just too useless to call-in, amount of options is really big for each faction. Even tho, as example, for soviets you will usually get something like some infantry, dshk, zis and then if everything is good you will wait for t34/57 or get that funny howitzer-tin coffin-tank thing that's at lvl 10 or something, or t60, things that you can do with spetznaz with stolen bazooka and flamethrower guy are lewder than most kinky porn. Also when was the last time you saw flamethrowers actually burning everyhing inside of a tank? Games like Company of Jobbers 2 will always shield themselves with some non-existant ""MUH BALANCE"" holy cow, but in reality Relic just dont know how things work and can't code if their life depended on it.

Manual aim: this is plain fun, even though it seems tanks ironically actually lose in accuracy if you manually aim them. If you remember Crimsonland - when you control soldier with PTRs and noscope360 enemies through covers it feels just like this. However, while you having fun you will probably lose rest of the army because i didn't find anything resembling CONTROL GROUPS IN THIS GAME AND WORKING WITH THIS MINIMAP REQUIRES 900+ APM.

  Little things: A lot of things here are just priceless: manually refilling artillery ammunition with infantry squad by moving shells from a truck through inventory (if you played a lot of Zuma at MLG tournaments you will be good at this), shooting cow and then search it's corpse, kill a guy, stuff his corpse's inventory with artillery shells and then move it near your artillery like some sort of death metal treasure chest, throw grenade into trench and then order machinegun to fire at position so enemy won't ever escape, run your flamethrower tank through building filled with enemies, ram enemy fortifications and then detonate it with grenade to see most useless fireworks ever, roll out IS-3 and lose it to one-shot from enemy AT, etc.

I give this game 100 executed war prisoners out of 100. Even though interface and matchmaking are modern means of mental torture, game itself is pure fun. As for singleplayer missions - they don't seem to be as much fun as they were in very first Men of War so i never tried them.

This is war, and you are not coming out the same boy you went in as. Conscripted for 2 years military service, your fresh carcass will be tested on the line of battle.

NEITHER. You're not even on the radar because you're that puny. Are you to assume command as a NCO, assure victory for your comrades who are pinned behind sandbags in a ditch effort to hold 10m radius of land. Who will listen? Your forces are already pinned, they aren't leaving them bags private.

Some as young as twelve. They're ready to lay lives for their country, theirs and those who oppose democratic ways of settling disputes. Please note how I hadn't mentioned boys, I consider the youth men. I see tigers ready to reak havoc behind enemy lines, I see pumas ready to pounce at those who supress idealistic gentlemen with the end of a rifle.

Is a bit of a strange release, because the content is almost 100% the same as Men of War - Assault Squad 1. The gameplay is the same and the only thing that changed are some weapon configurations and range settings. Everything else's basically the same.

As a plus though, Men of War - Assault Squad 2 has Steam integration, something Men of War - Assault Squad 1 lacks and thus is unplayable in normal multiplayer matches due to the fact that Game Spy shut down. (You can still play multiplayer by using a program like: Hamachi, Tunggle or Game Ranger)

The most important changes, however, are not with actual gameplay, but with the engine that's being used and it's probably their engine of choice for the next game: ""Call to Arms"".

It's hard to tell if you should buy Men of War - Assault Squad 2 or the prequel Men of War - Assault Squad 1.

80,12499681,english,"Men of war Assault squad 2 is the sequel to the well received Assault Squad. Even with this being a sequel there are still major and blatant problems with this game. 
 
1st. Lack of new content. 
 The 1st problem with this game is that there isn't very much new content. For being a sequel you would think there would be. It's more of an over all update to the 1st game. The only thing that the 2nd game added is an updated a game with better optimization, better UI, graphics, sound, and Steam features. There is 15 ""New"" single player ""skirmishes"", plus 25 reworked old ones from the original Assault Squad. Making 40 single player missions. Which isn't very much, especially being 25 old one. Which let me remind you that is ""3"", ""3"" new Missions for each Nations.  
 
Most of the new content that is been added as been added in patches. That were a lot of its coming from. Like health bar, skins, models, sounds, Units and new voices. 
 
2nd. AI 
 One of the thing you will ran across it the Stupid AI both on the enemies side and your Units. You will be doing a lot of micromanagement, do to the stupidity of your units. A good example would be your medics not picking up your dead men unless told to do so! It's not uncommon to get focus on one part of the battlefield only to come back and see 4-5 men on the ground and your medic sitting there. Making you to manually to him to get each one.  
 
Amour showing their ass and side to the enemy or just refusing to turn their front to the enemy. If you know anything about tanks or amour, you would know that the thickest amour is in the front. Well someone didn't tell your troops. Because 1 too many time have I had to take over control of a tank or Amour car and position it the right way. 
 
Sniper will sit there a lot even though they have clear shot on enemy troops. So many times I've had to click on enemy troops to get my snipers to pick off targets. 
AT (Anti Tank) troops will ran across an open battlefield to shot a tank point blank range. When  I've be able to take control and do from half of the Range. I've literally watch Panzerschreck troops ran straight to a tank and get killed, and if that is no enough a lot of the times, they will just stare at it from a far while it kills all his comrades! Even better is when they're right next to it, get killed, and didn't even fire a shot.  
 
With this Friendly and enemy troops won't even fire at one another even when theres a tank troop right on the other side of the dead tank. They will both sit there.  
 
Enemy troops will hide and sit there when to many casualties are taken, instead of running, and regrouping. You are now force to ran to the 1 or 2 enemy solders and completely annihilate them with a full squad. If not? You can ignore them and continue your advance to the next objective! 
 
So let me set this up for you. 
The enemy is pushing on one side of the map hard, with Infantry, Tanks, and an armored car. You get caught up in this side of the map tiring to stop this advance. You are slugging it out knocking out tanks and shooting down Infantry, making sure your troops are fighting right, and micromanagement them so do not lose this side of the battlefield. Making sure your Panzerschreck troops are firing (Or even just taking control your self...) medics are get the dying up, and that your troops are picking the right targets.  
 
Only to win that fight, go to look at the other side of the battlefield and see that your man have been annihilate because your medic didn't pick up the dead, your AT troops sat there, etc...
 
This is a very small list of some the stupid this that the AI does. I could go on picking out all the stupid drown right unbelievable things the AI will do. You literally need to micromanagement most if not all your troops. 
 
3rd. A lack of total content. 
 Lest be honest here. It is not skirmish, these are single player Missions/campaigns. If you played a RTS before you most likely played one with a skirmish mode which is AI vs you and Ally AI on a map with some object or just to kill the other side.
 
This is a major problem do to the fact that those 40 missions get old fast. Since 1st 25 of then are old one from AS1, 2nd after you complete them there isn't any thing to do after but to replay them over and over again. And most of the missions are just a Assault on key objective over and over again just on a different map. Some of the New missions are defensive mission or Sniper missions.  
 
If you wanted new content you're fucked. There is 2 way to go. Go to the work shop and download user made missions or learn to use the Editor. Which is ridiculous! 
 
1st The editor isn't easy enough for the average player to make new content for themselves. It isn't easy enough to even to make simple battles, let a lone missions. There isn't any Tutorials to help you except for one guy on YouTube, but he doesn't tell enough for how to make a mission or even a good battle. All these Epic battles on YouTube are just some guy placing random Units on each side, and having then ball up in  an orgy in middle of the map and just kill. As if they weren't even train as soldiers. Taking no cover, nothing just kill, kill, kill. 
I hear from the New patch that just came out, that DLC is on the way which in true is another sad joke, because now they're going to sell you new content that should of been in the game in the 1st place. IMHO they need to make a FREE DLC, that adds 10 new missions for each faction, then I can walk a way content. Because even with that, that still wouldn't be enough for a game that $35. Do to the fact that it has very low replay value. In my honest opinion they really should of been 25- 30 new mission and the 25 old ones as Thank you to the fans. Then I could of walk away happy, but still disappointed in no Real skirmish mode. 
 
When it comes to the DLC, most likely it will be a couple of new missions, and a Couple of new multiplayer maps. Which should of been in the in the 1st place. 5 missions for $5 which is a such a bad joke it's unbelievable. What they need to do is Add new Nations, with Missions and New units equipment, etc. Like Italy, which was talked about on the Steam Community Hub forums, and is a great Idea. Why not do a Axis minors pack with Hungary and Romania , or even a Allies Minor pack? Poland would be a Great one too, or even France. With this then you can do Missions pack with 20-30 or so missions. Or even just expansion to the already existing nations, with New units, equipment, missions, etc. 
 
With all of this, It seems like this game was made for multiplayer, yet the multiplayer is dead. Yet It was the same way with AS1. The most I've seen is about 8-10 lobbies at prime times. Even if you were to play multiplayer, you would most likely get your ass kick by a veteran of the games Anyway.  
 
4th. The verdict 
 The problem is that they made this really great RTS, (one of the best I've played) but doesn't have any content in it. Out of all the RTS games I've played, this one has the lest amount of content. And I've played them all, I've played Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, Empire Earth, Total War, Star Wars Empire At War, Dawn of War, World In Conflict, StarCraft, and many more I can't think of right now.
 
The Biggest problem is that I feel that they just made the tools for you make your own content. As if they made AI, the Units, UI, etc, and just sold you the tools to make your own game, and made a some missions as examples. 

Would I recommend this game? I would say No. Because even though it's a great game, with the lack of content and the Good but over just an update to the 1st AS there isn't much here. It being 6 month since release, they could still save this game, with a FREE DLC Mission pack, ( With more then just 1 missions for each Nations!!!!) and some new Nations DLCs. But the big problem will still be the replay value, do to no real skirmish mode.

10,9993249,english,"When I bought the deluxe edition for AS-2, I was paying more not only because I loved the previous games in the franchise, but because I loved what potential AS-1 had presented us with, especially considering the many great mods avalible for the original.  But more than that, I was buying the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.

Needless to say, I haven't been impressed.  In fact, my experience with AS2 has been beyond disappointment.  Given the time from the early beta stage to now, and including the push-back of the release date multiple times, I've found that this game has not only been a waste in terms of what potential it had, but you are literally paying for a $34.00 overhaul patch by buying this game.

The biggest improvements since AS-1 have been:

1.  Multiplayer, which lags often, and depends on who is better at storming a place with infantry and light vehicles.  Tanks are, very rarely fielded.  The gameplay is repetitive, and balance issues come and go.

2.  The Super-Pershing and a few tank models.  Yeah, they look a little more ""smooth,"" but then you can take a peek at everything else.  Everything else is literally recycled from the previous game.

3.  Multi-core support.  I haven't noticed a difference.


The things I'd thought I was going to see:

1.  A little bit of variety in the infantry.  Yeah, they don't even have new models or textures.  It's the exact same thing from the previous title, rehashed a bit for a few more ""Breeds,"" which you can make by simply opening the editor and reassigning a few traits, weapons, and items.  There are a few more voices thrown in for the American and English soldiers, but there is still plentiful cut-and-paste from the previous game.  Oh, and the voice acting is horrific for the most-part.

2.  Better textures.  The dirt looks beautiful.  A few tanks look better.  But, for everything else, it all is recycled from the last game.  The buildings aren't different.  The uniforms aren't different.  The mass majority of vehicles aren't different.

3.  Better gameplay.  Yeah, no.  In fact, [b]they took away the feature where you could unload your guns.[/b]  The AI is a little more ""Cover-seeking,"" so they are no longer inherently stupid.  However, you still have to pack up millions of bullets so they can fend for themselves without running dry.

4.  Differences between faction weapons.  I'll admit, I was expecting more realistic performance out of the guns for each faction.  But, all rifles are pretty much the same, the Thompson isn't much different from an MP-40, the Grease-Gun is treated like a 9-mm, and overall, you're just going to go for an MG-42 if you want rate of fire; the browning if you want less reloading; or the BAR/FG-42 if you want less unloading.  There isn't much of an accuracy or damage difference.  Line up soldiers with every faction's rifle; they fire and reload at the exact, same times, with the exception of the enfield rifleman.  There should be a difference.  The action on a Mosin is completely different from a 98' or a Springfield.

5.  Models and textures.  Yeah, about 10 vehicles look better.  But the mass majority of the others still look copy/paste.  If I wanted to copy/paste vehicles, I'd make a mod for that.

Can I say I recommend this game?  No.  For $34.00, hell no.  It's nowhere near being worth that kind of money, and I'm losing to faith to tell myself that ""yeah, it'll improve as they get closer to the full release.""  It's been in Early Access for quite some time now.  Before that, there was beta.  They have had the time to improve the game.  Yet, I have only seen them trying to get it into a playable state every few weeks, while leaving us high and dry in every other aspect.  Maybe if it were $10.00 DLC for AS1, it'd be worth it.  But as a standalone game, let alone a Sequel, it's not just a cheap re-release with nothing new to offer, but it's a complete waste of money.

I've already learned from one other game that pulled the same ""Beta limited-content"" trick.  ArmA 3.  Overall, that game was a complete disappointment.  There was very little content added into the beta, there was very little content added into the main game, and countless patches treated the post-final release like it was (and still is) in the early-access stage.  AS2 is mirroring this tactic, and foreshadows disappointment.

I have a feeling they're going to just decide to ""leave it to the modders,"" as ArmA 3 did, and while mods are often well done, they are not only far from uniform in quality and not designed by a common party, but that's a cheap way of copping-out of extensive work.  Work that this game seriously needs if it is to hold the number ""2"" after Assault Squad.

A better name for this would be ""Assault Squad: MEGAPATCH.""  If you feel like disagreeing, then pull up the AS1 editor and the AS2 editor.  Put down one of every model.  Test the game, see what happens; you'll learn that I'm right, because this is exactly how I tested it.  I'm not making these claims without evidence.  There is no difference between these games except for the mulitplayer.

I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE FINAL RELEASE PROVES MY FEARS TO BE WRONG, AND RENDERS THIS REVIEW TO BE OUTDATED.  SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE, I WILL GLADLY CHANGE MY REVIEW AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GAME.  SHOULD MY FEAR THAT THIS GAME OFFERS NO ""CHANGE"" WORTHY OF A SEQUEL BE CONFIRMED AT FINAL RELEASE, I WILL NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH DIGITAL-MIND-SOFT.

[July 19, 2014] UPDATE!

Ok; so since the game's release, there has been little to nothing improved upon since I had written this review.  The ""priority"" for the team has only been multiplayer.  There has been no increase in content.  There has been no more bang for the buck.  Digital-Mind-Soft has charged their community for a mere patch, and has done nothing to back the quality of the game except tamper with multiplayer mechanics, and not even to the extent that significantly alters gameplay in any way.

Do you have money to waste, and want to support a dishonest development project?  Then don't spend money.  Please.

Stop giving companies the motivation to screw over their customers and to default on their promises.  It's been months, and there aren't even any new ""Humanskins"" in the game.  Let me say right now:  It takes 10 MINUTES OR LESS TO CREATE A NEW ""SKIN"" USING PAINT.NET.

With the time they've taken to add ""boards"" to Multiplayer, I could have created the entire Italian Army with a modeling program; sadly, that's 3DS-MAX, a program that the 2014 edition of, costs upwards of $3,400 to own.




[August 26 2014] UPDATE!

Playing through the editor a bit, one of the first things I checked were the models.  What can I say about them?  Three new models; all Crusader Tanks.  The model has been significantly improved, with the Crusader looking more streamlined and smooth than before.  It looks good.  Not only that, but there are 2 more Crusaders; a 40mm Anti-Air crusader, and a 20mm Anti-Air crusader.  These, too, look good.  But nonetheless, Japanese vehicles still look as though they are made out of cardboard, and there haven't been any other model updates added.

Most importantly, the soldiers still have the same skins as in the previous title; the lack of effort in this category is appaling.  Do bare in mind; Assault Squad was a 2009 game.  [b]This means that the soldier's skins are [i]5[/i] Years old.[/b]  You can learn to create professional 3D models in half that time.

It's made me curse with rage when someone manages to explode the ammo cache of my best tank, squeal with evil laughter in my crude tactics such as getting an entire squad of infantry to charge enemies with live grenades and it never fails to play out differently.

The game offers so many options for strategy, for example, fully destructable maps where anything can be destroyed and even turned into cover for your units. 

Infantry holed up in a house? Drive a tank through it!

One of my favourite things is that no unit is tied to a squad, so you can get a squad of infantry but split them up and outfit them in any way you desire, even mix and match different units!

The micromanaging can be a little daunting at first but once you get to know it, it is the ultimate tool. You can set up your units any way you want, they have their own individual inventories and ammo counts, you can loot corpses, vehicles, run out of ammo and more. Don't forget to keep your anti-tank guns supplied!

I give this game at least a 9/10, the depth and fun within this game, especially if you play with friends is excellent.

I should also add, the reason for most of the negative reviews are because people are butthurt about the similarities between the first game and this game. They knew exactly what they were buying, the developers themselves even said its just an upgraded version. Get rekt.

52,11892060,english,"Yes, this game is very much like AS1, but with graphical improvements and even better, UI improvements. Add in workshop support for some cool missions and mods and a promised future of performance improvements and additional features. I suppose those aren't guranteed but at $14 I would buy it just for the improvements and content, and the future modding potential.

But make no mistake, this game is serious. It's not for casual gamers, because you have to devote some time to even understand it. It's complex but generally fair and well executed, although the UI could be better. It's nothing like COH or COH2. Being in the open will get you killed. Not being prone will get you killed. Being a tank will get you killed. Missions can take up to and over an hour, as can PVP games. The micromanagement is intense and for people like me, impossible to master. Thus, I like playing skirmish (vs AI) missions with multiple people, so I can roleplay my own squad in a large unit.

The MP community is kind of sparse but appears to be growing and improving. It's usually easy enough to find a PVP game but not as easy to PvE. PvP is DIFFICULT and the players are often very experienced, but a good fight can be quite a rush. There's a lot of movie-like moments (suicide bombing a tank with TNT, or one-shotting a tiger from across the map) and incredible feats of microing (usually using Direct Control, a fun feature that lets you can control and use any unit you own) that are just plain fun to watch. In some sense the game can feel like a FPS in the sense that you're covering, using tactics, and even firing a weapon yourself from time to time. The ballistics are VERY realistic and so is cover, with accurate hitboxes that make a soldier's death fair and believable. And your soldiers will die, often.

The models are great and historically accurate, so if you're into that you'll love this. The soldiers are believable and the inventory system is fun (for instance, you can kill a nazi officer and put on his hat mockingly, then loot his luger. Then blow his body up with TNT. Then take the MG from his car and put rounds downrange). 

Overall I love this game and, although never being too great at PvP, enjoy the base and workshop missions and scenarios. If you're on the fence, at full price perhaps you should wait for more progress (which is never a guarantee).

62,11885604,english,"scroll down if you want the basic review in Laymans terms.

First of all I've played the Men of War Series since the ""Men of War"". So i've dealt with the disapointment from Men of war:AS and now here comes AS 2. Assault Squad 2 feels exactly like the first one with only a new leveling system which I both love and hate. For those who've played previous titles it works like this:

You pick a nation and each nation you have a level in, based on how much you play them. (you can level up in single player which is nice). Most units you'll have right off the bat, even a Tiger I for the Germans which is nice having the heavy support. However everything else you have to unlock as you level up through games. This can be annoying as I play as Germans and I need a higher level to use any kind of Artillery. But I see the advantages as it does make you look into using units that weren't heavily used in the last games. But it does limit your tactical options in some cases.

There is a new User interface and the infantry shows you their path finding when you tell them to go to a location. They're also not mentally retarded like in the last games. Which is good smarter AI makes me happy. There is even a timer for thrown grenades and explosives which is awesome to me.

However despite these two great new features it does have a lot of draw backs. The models are mostly recycled and very little in the way of new stuff is on display. I don't see why this warranted a brand new game as there is not much of a new game on display here.

The factions so far are mostly balanced which is something the original Men of War suffered, it was rare to see a game that wasn't Soviet Union v.s. Germany, however my friend did (narrowly) beat me as the Commonwealth.

The maps are mostly nice I suppose. 

The single player suffers from the same problems as the last AS. It's boring. It follows the same pattern of attack this stongpoint, now attack this one, go attack that one. Finished? Great now defend your stuff for 10 minutes. It's rather boring ""Men of War"" had more narrated missions with some more interesting aspects such as stealth which were quite frankly some of the hardest yet most exciting missions ever.

So lets cut this review down:


Pros:
Intersting new UI
Leveling system
AI pathfinding is much improved

cons:
Lack of new units
Lack of innovation
could've done more with its leveling system
boring single player.

65,11881607,english,"As I see all the 'not recommended' reviews, I can't really say that they don't have a reason to be disappointed. We all were expecting a new engine, or at least a heavily polished version of their old one. When you first boot this game up, it looks pretty much the exact same as the first Assault Squad game. Even more disappointing is the fact that it doesn't seem to run very well (I have an ATI 6990, an i7 processor, and 16gb of ram -> the game still sporadically lags and tanks FPS regardless of how high the settings are turned up).

HOWEVER, even though this is overpriced at $35, and it didn't improve as much from its predecessor as I would have hoped, it is still the best WW2 RTS currently available. I can't comment on the balancing for competitive multiplayer because I've never been a huge fan of competitive RTS play. However, if you, like me, love comp-stomping cooperatively with your friends, then I would definitely recommend AS2. There's a nice variety of mission types: Some missions start you off with just a few units and they encourage a slower, more stealthy/tactical approach. Others give you fairly substantial armies but then force you to clear and capture more heavily fortified flags. The most fun missions in my opinion start with your team preparing for a massive enemy offensive and you are provided with lots of fun equipment like artillery to help with fending them off. 

The building destruction is still the best of any RTS. The weapons all feel meaty and seem to pack a good, bassy punch. While still not completely realistic, the damage system is far more line-of-sight oriented and consequently feels much better than the combat in other games (I'm looking at you, Company of Heroes). The ability to manually control units is still revolutionary (even though it was in the first AS game) because no other RTS has followed their lead yet. 

Summary: There's still way too much fun to be had with this game to say it's 'not recommended'. While it failed to improve itself significantly from AS1, it is still better than every other WW2 RTS on the market, and is right behind the Dawn of War franchise as my favorite comp-stomp/coop RTS of all time.",1409118831,1409118831,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968653271,322,7,490,0,490,1399712340,,

Unfortunately everytime I play it doesn't take long until I get annoyed and frustrated with it. If the developers can fix some of these issues with the game it will severely improve the experience. Here are my reasons I dislike this game:

1. The vehicle pathfinding is really frustrating. The vehicles will often drive into trees and get stuck, or take the most illogical routes through a village possible.
2. Tanks are pratically useless. Forget the terrifying panzers feared by allied infantry during ww2, because in this game almost all infantry can just spam attack them with AT grenades and destroy them instantly.
3. There is no notification that your units are under attack. This always happens to my defended positions. The game doesn't tell you anything, I will often look away for 10 seconds and look back and all my squads are dead.
4. Smoke grenades are useless. I don't know what their current in game function is but the certainly dont provide cover from enemy machinegunners.
5. The infantry ai are really dumb. I don't feel like I'm commanding real soldiers, but instead stiff robotic drones that require me to tell them to duck when under fire or move away when a grenade is right at their feet. Apparently none of these soldiers have instincts or basic training. They often will run straight into enemy fire for no reason and get killed when trying to throw a grenade rather than crawl, and take forever to fire a rocket launcher at a tank, usually just standing there frozen.
6. Some of the specialty units suck. When I saw you could get paratroppers I assumed you could drop them in behind enemy lines, but instead the just spawn exactly where everything else does.

97,11472344,english,"I have really enjoyed this game so far, and certainly recommend it. There are a few problems with multiplayer still that can severely limit when I want to play with or against other people. I will focus on two points:

- I have yet to find more than two dozen games of any type to join, no matter the time of week or day. I like skirmishes/co-op because it matters much less when people rage quit, but there seems to be far less of these games played. I want to get  a quick game in now and of the 18 lobbies, 3 are open (pre-game) and 1 is locked. One of the skirmish lobbies was opened by a control freak that I played with twice soooo..... time to write a review instead.

- I can run with maximum settings in single-palyer with little issue, by the way. In multiplayer there seems to be severe performance issues, 150-200ms ping is the max direct control range for vehicles or artillary and 250ms ping is the max to play, for me. +250ms ping seems to me to be worse than watching bad claymation. However, while in a few lobbies I have seen my ping go from 200ms to 900ms, then back down to 600ms. About 10% of the time I have played with other people, I have had a ping of less than 150ms.

These issues usually leave me with starting my own lobby, and often just playing offline or online by myself. Some lobbies seem more stable than others. The most recent version of the game seems to help, but not help bring people to or back to multiplayer. 

Still recommend it. The 2.5 hours spent playing Seelow Heights on Heroic with the 3 of 5 remaining players was some of the most intense and fun I have ever had in a game. I knocked out over 80 tanks and 200+ infantry with a flak gun I had to supply multiple times and repaired as tanks constantly crawled to our final point in just over just 45 min... so freakin' epic! =)",1406689847,1406689847,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198122645613,57,9,59055,0,4525,1600726901,,

99,11345456,english,"Bought MoW:AS2 recently! Enjoy it alot! There's a lot of things in the game i find 
enjoyable, ofcause there's always some disappointment here and there.

GENERAL

Perhaps let's talk about why It's a disappointment first, With a title like AS2 i figure
it'll be more new maps more new units and more levels, but it didn't happen. Yes, you 
may say that: ""Its stated on the game info that Dev will reuse and add new maps""
sure! but with the time Dev have between MoW:CH and the development of
AS2 you couldn't add more maps?

TRAP BUGS?

There issue with the AI troop OR Truck/Tank stuck on grass, slope, trench so on and so 
forth, very picky in the direction they travel, But when you take direct control, everything 
is smooth 99% of the time (because i defy mother nature's logic) or you'll meet that 1% 
of invisible stumps in the middle of no where and that you need to take an alternate route. 

DETAILS

There's definitely improvement on the overall visual, and i love to zoom all the way down 
to see the troops OMG! it still need improvement, even MoW:Vietnam has decent troop
detail. Uniform Color scheme, Special/Infantry Uniform could use some improvements.
Half-track driver compartment lacks in detail. One factions Half-track has more detail
than others, not going to say which ones, Empty the Veh and check it out yourself.

V.ACTING

The voice acting for Germany and Japan is still pretty BAD, and I felt like a baby 
being spoon fed with information, the way they brief  you at the start of each mission.
it will make you feel like you're not there by will but by persuasion. Every little detail
contributes to the final Masterpiece, do you believe it? 

SUGGESTION

BUT still! I really like the game, one way to further improve ""Assault Squad"" series is to
fuse MoW1 Wide map / story play style, when you play MoW1 theres cut scenes to further
enhance the storytelling (besides the unconvincing voice acting). Audience aren't bored by
the continuation of battle, there will be a feel of progression in the game combining what's 
good from the MoW1 with the Objective taking of ""AS"" series and it will be more interesting 
to play. Current AS series is too linear and the long rectangular map gets kind of boring 
after awhile. the AI in the game lacks ""Unpredictablility"".

WE....LL

to conclude! This is a Awesome game to play, Skip MoW: Assault Squad and buy AS2.
9/10 can't wait to hear if there will be a AS3 or not :D sharing this feedback on what i find
good and can be improved so that Next Men of War Assault Squad series could be even more
amazing, And players could enjoy it even more. Cheers! have a great day folks!",1405941896,1406511529,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041234826,79,8,59710,0,8428,1482463173,,

If you have played Men of war:Assult Squad 1 you will find this a disappointment as its not Assult Squad 2. It should have been called Men of war Assult Squad 1 Remastered. It Reuses many of the same maps as the orignal and has minimal changes. 

Fortunately some of the changes such as Defense missions, Steam integration makes Mutliplayer easier and mods awsome.
These changes add alot to the game.

33,10905639,english,"Figure since the game is on flash sale today, I'd write a short review to hopefully bring a little more attention to the game. This is my first game into the Men of War series, so I'm not gonna have any opinion on whether it's too similar to it's predecessor or whether it's just a cash in for the devs or not, like most of the negative reviews seem to have a problem with.

Anyway, I picked it up on preorder/early access after seeing some gameplay online and thinking it looked really cool. Before this, the only other WWII RTS game I played were the Company of Heroes games. To put it simply, this game is like a more realism-centered RTS compared to CoH, which feels more arcadey. The reason for that is that in Men of War, you have much more to deal with such as individual unit inventory management or vehicle ammo and fuel. On top of that, the combat is very indepth, more than just accuracy and health bars. With infantry, they have health bars but there seems to be a pretty distinguishable difference between say, shooting a soldier in the foot or in the head, with the latter usually killing them instantly. With vehicle combat, you can tell your armored vehicles to target specific sections of the enemy's vehicles, e.g. turret ring or cannon barrel, or if you feel you're not quite equipped to cause any big damage or pierce their armor, you can choose to attack their tank tracks and leave them immobile. Overall, much more strategy and control over units and combat is put into this game than I've seen with other RTS games.

Another feature is being able to directly control a select unit. While this seems like an outright benefit and might even seem like it could be OP if used well, let me tell you right now; it's not. I used it a ton when I first started playing as it was a really cool little feature to me, but as I played more and more, I slowly stopped using it so much and now I basically only rely on it to either force move my troops or vehicle in a way clicking couldn't, or to shoot and collapse walls/cover. The reason for this is that not only do you lose the ability to command the rest of your units, but aiming and firing is pretty damn hard, and any slight movement can send your aiming reticule swinging as your soldier waves his gun from side to side to run, or your tank bounces along, accelerating and breaking. So because of that, I find it's ultimately better to leave shooting to the AI, unless you just wanna have fun manning the hull gunner of your tank and gunning down some helpless enemy riflemen for a bit.

Overall, I think it's a really fun game, and if you like RTS and would like something that's a bit more indepth and possibly a bit more complex, then give this a try. $25 is a pretty great price for a game like this, and with Workshop support for map/scenario making it has infinite replayability. I definitely have plans to dump a lot more time into this game. However, if more micro management and extra little authentic details for added realism isn't really your thing, Company of Heroes might be your cup of tea instead.",1403961745,1403961863,True,1,0,0.499219954013824463,0,True,False,False,76561198039283793,417,21,10117,0,520,1586750948,,

E is ramming through an adobe building while simultaneously exploding from a 17 lb AP shell gouging through its magazine. Realism is a plus, though many complain of balance issues, which there are. 

Every soldier can be micro-managed, if that's your thing. A tank crew bails because their Sherman took a shell to both tracks and the engine? Scrounge around for a weapon by holding down C, now they're an assault squad with SMG's and ammo to spare, or load them up with machine-guns and have them take cover behind their former vehicle. Medics play a huge role of bringing back soldiers from the brink of death, and snipers can actually snipe important targets.

Direct control was a new feature for me in a RTS, but not unwanted, nor unwarranted. With it, you can move a unit exactly as you want, and fire where and when you want. Did a T-34-85mm hide behind that farm manor? Can you still see its position with a scouting squad of infantry? Well take direct control of your 88mm Flak and load it up with AP. The cursor will show you an obstructed target, green on the face of the building and red on the T-34. Fire anyway. That 88mm round will barely flinch at wood and plaster, flying through the manor to skewer those Russians in their fresh coffin. I've even used this trick in Multiplayer, to set up ambushes where the enemy can only guess at where I am, firing through wood sheds and empty barns.

Steal tanks by crippling them, killing the fleeing crew, then repairing an manning them with your own troops. Aim for the track to immobilize TDs and SPAs, or aim for the main gun if your feeling lucky.

Ambushes work, the enemy AI isn't omnisciently aware of your position. Lay mines and barbed wire, if you have the time. Steal guns your jealous of. Storm trenches. Weep as a Panzerwerfer wastes your entire left flank in a hail of HE rockets, then struggle to maintain cohesion after the onslaught.

This game is the best WW2 RTS in my opinion. It appeals the intellect as well as the senses.

None of the gaming companies talk about it but they know that the only thing that is going to stop such cheaters is something just short o finvading their homes with SWAT teams and sueing them in court; lobbying is far too expensive for them to take it to Washington, DC.   So the end result is that they just let the cheaters keep on cheating and those that they catch get banned.",1400427315,1400621549,True,2,0,0.478589415550231934,0,True,False,False,76561198061000429,129,40,1666,0,1594,1401132082,,

The good:
- superb realism and great combat mechanics
- superb physics and terrain destruction
- many units for each faction and many maps
- multiplayer and matchmaking (it was difficult to play good multiplayer in the previous games of the series and this one finally fixed that)
- difficult (in a good way - make sure you learn all the game's systems before playing competitive multi)

The bad:
- very similar to Assault Squad 1, even some single player maps are recycled (may be a + for some players)
- single player campaing may be seen as too disconnected, too little story (but may be treated as a good training for multi)
- difficult (casual players may feel frustrated if they are not willing to learn the game)

I have every Men of War game, including the lame Red Tide and limited Vietnam. What about MoWAS2?
It is actually a very POOR revamp of the original game, you may ask why?
I have started the USA campaign, only to find its actually the first game only worse.
You can't move the map, the game stutters like its having a fit.
The stupid vehicle run into everything going and flip over rendering them useless.
The other games had a unload option, this doesn't, the map options appear to be limited.
This is not a singeplayer aimed game its actuallly more geared to get everyone online to battle it out.
I have nothing against online battles, but they could have actually come up with something new, they haven't.
Very disappointed...almost wish I hadn't bought this now, ok there may the odd different mission further in the campaigns, but this isn't enough. Whats happened to the originallity of the other games?
Whats with the stupid icons over the top of the units? They only get in the way, so when you click on a unit you end up with a unit you never collected......please !!!
So to recap...nothing but a revamp with awful attempts to add things that become unwanted,....
I'm going back to the original MoW and MoWAS at least the developers tried to do something...unless things change, its been a waste of money and the game will probably just sit in my library unplayed.

28,10152120,english,"Forword: 
Im a bit disappointed. I recently started to play the Men of War Franchise so im not to familiar with the Series but AS2 is basically AS with a bit better graphics, worse performance, some good changes like Squad Resupply (or atleast i think this is new). For the Skirmishes most of them are just the Skirmishes from AS2. Now I know that this Game should be played in MP but Im not to fond of RTS MP Games I rather play SP so I was really disappointed and feel a bit scammed. 

All my Experience is from the SP. I havent touched the MP yet.

The Good:
- Graphics and Effects are nice
- AI is great and challenging
- New Units
- Squad Resupply
- better Pathfinding
- dotted walk/run Line for your Movement
- Cover Ghosts are more Accurate. Atleast it feels like it.
- some good new Skirmishes
- Matchmaking System
- Steam Workshop


- The Bad:
- Lots of reused Skirmishes of the previous AS Game
- The Performance got worse
- Vehicle behaviour when your not controlling them i.e. shooting HE Rounds and Infantry while beeing bombarded by an enemy Tank and so on
-- My Rig:

- i7 2600
- GTX 670
- Game runs on SSD

- Everything Maxed and 4x AA

- too similar to AS to justify the purchase

- The Ugly:
- Matchmaking seems to be broken or no one uses it.
- MP seems dead. When i looked there were 3 games with 10ppl playing.


So for me I would rather say buy AS1, its a better bang for your buck at the moment.

I'm a veteran. When I play with my civilian friends and I use simple tactical stuff you pick up in basic, such as bounding overwatch, THIS GAME REWARDS IT. I'll end up finishing a coop match with most of my infantry because I focus so much on micromanaging squads and teams in a manner of which I was taught and it works out well. Need to advance with four men? Two stay to cover, two run, then those two cover and the other two run.

Men of War used to be a great strategy game, it points a new way of how to make a realistic WWII strategy game playable and fun. Yes it does lack of great voice acting in singleplayer campaign, but at least present us a actual story line but not this kind of ""general thank goood you have arrrrived"" thing. It's just lame.
I suggest anyone who is new to this franchise stick with original Men of war; MoW: Red Tidd; MoW: vietnam. Even Condemned Heroes were better than this.

so once you realised that you throw them to the opponent and reorder some new when they died.Other bad thing are the maps.. they always look similar. Your ways to attack the opponent is quite set cause of the tight maps, you haven't much abilitys like to attack the opponents back. Sound is also from very older days, it's hard to seperate gun shots from tank shots. My opinion: the game ain't worth any money.

The game is not much diffrent from AS1 , its looking like the same engine also the editor is the same , i think they  just altered the  AS1 Engine  a bit .
Gameplay ist the same but  slower  and clumpsier .
At least the  Game  can  be played in  ""VAC secured mode"" , if you Host a game you can   select  if you want to  have the  game being VAC secured or not, wich  looks  very fishy to me,  imo  the game should  force people to  play with VAC security.I personaly think that VAC is turned off  completely in the background and its just a fake option :(

The  hardest part is, that the Community Manager  of Digitalmindsoft is a VAC banned cheater on Steam(!?!?!?!?!?) , this makes  the  build in VAC  very questionable to me and  extensive  game-hacking can be expected because of the fact that VAC is only an option and the DEV obviously  dont  cares about VAC bans at all whilst they even employee someone VAC banned.  proof -> http://steamcommunity.com/id/deltadude

38,10138133,english,"My review is based upon singleplayer only, i havent touched the multiplayer and perhaps that is where the real focus of this game lays, but for anyone out there that is also interested in the singleplayer aspect, this is for you.

First off, the game uses the standard men of war style play, in that respect you cant go wrong with the gameplay, its fun to direct control units and blow things up, nothing much has changed here since ""Soldiers:heroes of ww2"", you still cant properly direct control into buildings as infantry. 

Here is where my real issue with this game comes, the singleplayer maps. Theres no real story like previous men of war games (unlike the first assault squad which also had no story). Their is 6 or 7 missions for each faction, brits, germans, russians etc. Nearly every single map is the same, a long corridor which you must advance up and take control of the flags. There is no room for flanking, no room for any tactical depth, its basically direct control one unit and slowly advance him up taking out everything. Occasionally something different will happen, like you need to defend the flag for X amount of time. Its hardly stimulating tactically for example the start of the first mission it gives you 1 squad of infantry to defend against an attack, you literally do not have to issue a single order, your men will sit in the trench and return fire for 3 minutes until it progress' onto the corridor style level layout. Its pointless, you may aswell just speed up time to get it out of the way.

Some of the missions are even dlc missions that were released for the first men of war. So ive paid for the exact same maps twice now.

Here is the real stinker though. Youve completed all the missions for the nation that you chose to play as first, time to try out some of the other nations! Wait ... this map looks awfully familiar ....oh thats right, it is! The other nations are all carbon copies of the same maps just reskinned to look different with the units of that nation put in instead. Dont get me wrong they look quite nice the maps but there is only so many times you can advance up the same corridor of a map with the tiniest of differences between them. 

In essence the only saving grace is the community workshop, which is sad that your relying on user generated content to enjoy a game you paid for. It is truely a sad state of affairs that the game which started this series off ""Soldiers heroes of ww2"" released over 10 years ago had more complex missions, a better story and more varied missions than this. I do not think this title warrants calling itself a sequel to assault squad 1, its pretty much the same game but better graphics.

Perhaps the multiplayer is the saving grace of this series, i dont know. But like me if your interested in singleplayer missions, avoid this unless some really good steam workshop stuff comes out. Play the original men of war, faces of war or even soldiers heroes of ww2 instead they are all vastly superior singleplayer experiences.

40,9606548,english,"I've played MOWAS2 Both ways, with friends, versus, and singleplayer. 

Therefor, I can tell you the best of both-sides.


Singleplayer gameplay: The missions in the second MOWAS are an intresting idea, rather then the classic ""Move up and capture"" system, you are given challenges/difficult side-objectives. Such as, defend the three trench points untill reinforcements, or stealth tasks, or even running out of reinforcements! 
It's a cool idea, but, it gets old. There are times when you just want to play a classic ""Assault and Secure"" objective mission, and don't feel like the new stuff. 


Multiplayer Gameplay: I feel the game is centered on multiplayer. It is a blast to mow down your enemies together, and move up in the bloody battlefields together. But, there are SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLAYER. Example, if a player tabs out of the game, everyones framed will drop about 40-50 frames, it's not just me, it's everyone I've played with. And, if you're un-lucky, they won't restore to your normal frame-rate. Plus, if you have a bad ping, it will also reduce frames for everyone else. It's really annoying, and they really need to fix it.



Preformance: Men of War: Assualt Squad 2 is so horribly optimized. No-matter what GPU You have, or how many gigs of RAM you have, no matter what you do, you cannot escape the horrible FPS Drops. Singleplayer AND Multiplayer. The explosions of ANYTHING, molotovs, vehicles, or even buildings can freeze/crash your game, or make your frames drop severly. I know it's only a beta, and that's why I'm trying to keep my paitence. But, it sometimes get's unplayable. Something they need to fix PRONTO.


Overall outcome: I think MOWAS2 has awesome potential, the awesome new graphics, and relieving bug fixes from the first, really make you get excited for new updates. But, the game is not worth the price it has. For a un-optimized, partially buggy, FPS Dropping beta, $30, $20, or even $15 is WAY Too much. I'd say maybe $10 for the BETA. And I will do a review on the offical release of the full game.


Minor/annoying bugs: The bugs in MOWAS2 Are small, but really annoying. Example, your tanks won't always shoot at the targets that are most vital, example, I was playing as the Soviet Union, and a Panther was grinding my Infantry, and my T-34, rather focus on the Panther, focused on infantry. Luckily, you can press ""E"", and take manual control of your units, (Also needs work), you can take out yourself, annoying, but playable. That's really it for the bugs.


Final Verdict: I'll give MOWAS2 a 6/10, Great potential, but needs tons of work.



Since that was Early Access, it's time for the whole game.


MOWAS2 In my opinion is a train-wreck of, BS Tank penetration, re*tarded path finding, awful voice acting, and most of all, LAG LAG LAG AND MORE LAG.


Gameplay: MOWAS2's Gameplay is alright. Rather then the traditional ""Unit"" engine, the game runs off of indiviual men in a squad. For example, unlike in other strategy games, you can split off other single men to preform tasks, like, if there is a Tiger coming down the road, you can sneak a guy in the building to the side, and AT 'Nade it, or, if there is a squad, killing yours, sneak an SMG over and wreck the entire squad from one guy behind. This may sound awesome, but it has ALOT of flaws. Example, the faction balance is horrible. Germany and U.K are just stupidly overpowered. While the United Kingdom had shit takes in WW2, they beat fucking EVERYTHING. It's un-realistic. And downright annoying. They have huge armor, and for some reason, the guns devistate anybody. Tiger, to an M20. They will get 1-hitted.

Gameplay: Tanks: The tanks in the game can be really fun, or really annoying. Even though you have the ablility to press ""E"" And take control of any man/unit in the game, it still feels very unfinished. The aiming, ecspeically in tanks is really really REALLY hard. The gun never fires at the right thing, but over/under it. And meh, just dosent' feel very nice. The tanks for America are SO underpowered. I know that they had horrible armor, But even the pershing seems UP. Like, a f*ucking 2Pndr AT Gun can 1-Hit a Sherman. A 2 POUNDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. I get kinda pissed at this game cause it has such great potential, but just dosen't go reach it's hight of glory. German tanks are okay. They could be better. But, meh. They're playable. The Soviet Union's tanks are pretty BS OP as-well. A T-34 57 can One-hit anything. A tiger, to a jeep. It's screwed. Japan's tanks are shit. But, it's how it was.


Gameplay: Infantry: Infantry isn't really a problem in MOWAS2, They're pretty balanced. Actually, very balanced. Vehicles seem to ruin the fun play of infantry. Having a fierce fire-fight? It'd be a shame if a tank just ran everyone over. I don't really have much to say about this. 


Gameplay:Multiplayer: This is what ruins MOWAS2. Though, there are single-player missions in the game, the missions are crap though, as said in my Pt. 1 in my review, but, the multiplayer in MOWAS2 can be really fun, if you don't have the FRAME DROPS AND THE LAG SPIKES ALL THE TIME! I swear, if you dare, DARE tab out, or anybody tabs out, it's a shitstorm of FPS drops, timeouts, and frustration. And, the game seems to drop FPS randomly. Not a massive problem. The game is very well optimised. And it's nice to play even on low.



I really can't be bothered to make a huge Pt.2, due to the fact that I could go on for days.

43,9979270,english,"((EDIT: Now reviewing the RELEASED game:))


The MoW games have been some of my favourite RTS ever made - I've been playing them since the original, Soldiers: Heroes of World War II. They have some qualities that I think set them apart from other competing WW2 games. This is to CoH2, for example, what ARMA III is to Metal Slug - except it's fun! The realism does not ruin it.

The reason I am NOT recommending it is very simple - nothing has changed! Really, nothing has changed at all! The menu is identical, the sound is identical, almost everything is identical. I actually feel very, very cheated by this - it's actually quite insulting.

1) The voice acting is identical, and seeing as it has been used since Faces of War, I'm starting to get a little tired of it. This feels very very lazy.

3) The graphics engine does not look anything like the screenshots - in fact, it looks virtually identical to the graphics engine from Men of War AS I. I honestly cannot tell the difference, and I have a computer that can run it on full, easily.

4) In order to use units in MP, you have to level up (by playing multiplayer games over a period of time) - meaning, of course, that the best get better and the worst get trashed. You can disable this option, but you have to go into the advanced settings, meaning that many people will overlook this option

5) It is still very, very buggy. Frequent crashes to desktop.

6) 8v8 games? No. No no, there are 8v8 maps, but you can't actually PLAY with 16 players - you can only put 8 players on. Who wants to play 4v4 on an 8v8 size map?

7) The netcode is still atrocious. Good luck finding a large game that runs properly. If a single person in the game has a sluggish computer, it will slow down the entire server for the remaining players. Framerates plummet to the point of unplayability. In fact, I would say that only 25% of the games I have played even play ""playably"".

In the end, you have to kick an enormous amount of people with either terrible computers or terrible internet connections. I blame the game for part of this. 

I'm not sorry I bought this game, especially as I got it reduced, but this feels like a massive cash grab from a lazy company. Which is a shame, because they do know how to make an excellent RTS; or at least, they did once - they've just been re-releasing it for the previous five or so years.

Could do better!

I have recommend this game but also at the same time would like to warn you at the current stage its in it is no more than a rework of the first men of war assualt squad and if you want major changes look else where. However if you enjoyed the first but would like a better service , graphics and control mechanics and a better all round polish then you will enjoy the game. 

okay for the pro's - the new online maps are great my most liked map has to be oasis which looks great and works well. 

- they now have a online faction level up system of which offers some indivdaulism but is cut sort becuase of host options and the fact it can be turned off rendering it useless and kind of a waste of time  

- some new units are offered for each faction which is good but nothing to jump and scream about 

- great  new graphics and textures not as good as some rts games but certainly an improvment 

okay now for some con's ( bare in mind these could change) 

- bland , pointless campaign with no real personnality , also all the levels are the same just with different factions.

- noobs be warned there's no tutorial buit i guess you could count part's of the campaign

-same old multiplayer modes 

all in all if the games is cheap get it , and if you enjoyed the first game and still play the first get it , if your looking for major changes and a whole new gamein more ways than one  you will be disappointed. i will also edit this review as of full release to ensure a more accurate review thanks . but for now it simply feels like a funder for their future plans - call to arms

The compaign can get quite tedius and repetitious (since several maps are repeated with different plants and weather conditions) or it's the same couple of mission sets.  While the game itself is well rounded, the developers failed to address the issues that arose in the first AS.

Pros: Multiplayer, though to be honest it's not greatly improved from what I can tell.

Cons: Single Player.  Really.  Save your money and just buy MoW Assault Squad.  It's cheeper and has the same maps and abiities (scratch and add a few minor things.)

To give you an idea on how much they cheaped out on things, there's no real voice actors.

That being said:

Men of War: Assault Squad is one of my favorite RTS games. It is realistic, it isn't too difficult and it is FUN! Yet I feel cheated out of the $25 I spent on Assault Squad 2 being that I own the first. The game truly has not changed. There are some new levels and a few new UI tweaks but the game still has the same graphics (not amazing, lots of dated textures), same cheesy voice acting (not a big issue), non-fluid troop animations and same pathing/ terrain handling issues that have plagued the first game. This is DLC level right now, not the next itteration. 

Now, if I see an upgrade in these departments or if you don't have the first, I would say it would be worth it! There are still a few issues such as soldiers not being able to pick up items off the ground or AI pathing messing up in Skirmish missions. things but those should be fixed by release.

83,9895135,english,"I am somewhat new to the MoW franchise, but I did play the first assault squad.  I do happen to very much like the changes they made to the game, but many of them were very small and go nearly unnoticed.  Which is good because that gives old MoW players some comfort for it is all very familiar, but once you get deeper into the new features it has more changes than you thing.

So first thing I want to start with is what I didn't like,  MoW still does not have a tutorial and you rely entirely on whether or not you can learn from mistakes.  Easy mode is not as easy as would seem on easy mode I either ran out of men or the battle raged on endlessly, because every time I felt myself winning I put back where I started for they called another wave of tanks and it felt like I was inching towards them. 

What I did like was some little changes like speed control, which may have been in the first one, but I never looked into it.  Speed control is a must in single player because MoW is a micro-managment game a skilled squad may be able to take care of itself, but if you have multiple vehicles then when you aren't watching is when they will explode.  Slowing things down allow you to take in the battle so you know what is going on and can handle it.  Planes are interesting and I like them, it's cool to be able to shoot down these planes and not just have AA for anti-infantry.  Mines were an amazing addition to the game I have defended positions that I would have lost without them and minesweepers are the most unpredictable combat unit.  I was playing with someone and called a minesweeper without looking to see what it was and it ripped apart infantry with its mg  and it's armor was very durable.  The new graphics and mod support make it breath taking with its beautiful landscapes, well detailed vehicles, and creative freedom.  

If you are new to the game I suggest you manage materials carefully and do things in single player to see if it works before trying multiplayer.  Never drive a vehicle straight into to enemy lines or you will lose it.  I urge you to buy this game even old players because you may find some fun and diversity in the impressive modding community.

87,9857895,english,"I'm an open minded person, and I love games of all genres. I have a particular love for RTS games, and found the original Men of War Assault Squad to be very fun to play, if a little on the shallow side for graphics, optimization, and a terrible AI system. With AS2 promising to fix all these, it seemed like a good idea at the time.

Needless to say, I was very disappointed with it. I haven't logged too much time into this game because not only have the graphics barely improved aside from what seems to be better graphics quite literally MIXED IN with the older, crappy graphics at random (first mission of soviets, nuff said), it's now poorly optimized to the point that my hex-core 3.5 ghz computer with 64 gigs of ram and twin GTX titans will lag and, if it isn't lagging and actually running a solid 60 fps, FREEZE every few seconds for about a second. The UI is exactly the same as before, the AI is still not AI in my opinion as scripts should not count, and I was greeted with a lazy menu that used the same music and style of the previous game! The in-game music is the same too, voice acting has barely improved and only in CERTAIN areas, and on top of that the game pulled a stunt going from beta to early access without more than 1 day's notice. The only area that seems to have improved in a truly useful way is the multiplayer, which now uses steam instead of an external service, as well as steam workshop support for easy access to mods and maps, which I will give it credit for adding - these are much needed to this game and all games in general as Gamespy is going down and workshop just increases replayability of ANY title massively and will likely lead to me playing this game quite a bit more to enjoy workshop content.

I am not saying the men of war series of games are bad, because they are very fun to play. I am saying that this game should not be counted as a sequel to the first game - it is at best an expansion (with the majority of its content being from AS1), and does not live up to what I had expected in the slightest from this title as a full on sequel at the full price of a sequel.",1397801655,1397801655,False,29,0,0.557076215744018555,0,True,False,True,76561198000653214,684,48,251,0,89,1434783366,,

It has a XP System which completely ruined the games experience, the community is way to small for something like an XP System also. There aren't to many missions for all of the factions (Which is currently at 3 factions still), they may be some what long but they are all literally the same missions for each faction showing an extreme lack of effort and laziness. The path finding from the AI can be good at most times but you will constantly find times of your AI acting like idiots (causing them to get kill and completely ruin your strategy) I've never actaully wanted a refund for a game until now, which is saying a lot because I own a good amount of COD games.

93,9813161,english,"As a veteran of 450+ hours on Men of War: Assault Squad and a closed beta tester of this game, I feel inclined to give a review. 

Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a both a step forward that just has a little way to go before it is a success. It features some fantastic new features, namely the UI, steam support, and graphical enhancements. New missions give the single player more life than the challenging, yet monotonous skirmishes of its predecessor. The new vehicle textures are spectacular, including unique camoflage based on environment. Although the infantry textures are somewhat outdated, they don't detract from the game, same with the foliage and shaders. 

Once again, a relatively steep learning curve is displayed, requiring refined skills that can only be achieved through dedicated online play. You CANNOT just jump in and expect to win like other RTS games. You have to be patient and learn from your mistakes. Furthermore, you must dedicate yourself to learning the wider variety of control features the game displays, including the glorious direct control mode that allows for the most epic tank maneuvers you'll experience within the genre, the intuitive unit equiping system that allows you to loot and recover lost weapons and ammo, and finally the vehicle damage/penetration/component damage system, repairing vehicles based on where they were hit. Each of these features are what seperate the Men of War games from the rest of the genre, and mastering them is the key to success in multiplayer and getting over that curve. 

The only qualm I have so far with the game is the multiplayer connection glitches. 1 in every 2 games I have played so far have poor framerates, disconnects, or straight up crashes. This makes multiplayer somewhat unplayable for me right now, whereas Assault Squad 1 had very few online issues. I'm confident, however, that the developers will have the multiplayer optimized by the full release, and as I understand, very few other players have had these issues. 

Overall, I definatly reccommend this game to both veterans of the series and new players who want a massive tactical challenge. So long as you don't give up, this series can become one of the most rewarding and intuitive experiences you'll ever find. 

PS: To those who would compare this to Company of Heroes, they are different on fundamental levels. COH is an arcade style fast paced base builder with nowhere near as much thought to detail and realism on the level that MOW displays, but is a very fun game for what it is.

But it does it in such a way that it doesn't take away from the expierience.  It provides a first of all FAR more engaging AI within the game now.  My biggest gripe about the first game was the fact that the AI seemed scared to go on the offensive.  Now the AI is extremely aggressive and can actually be quite difficult to beat at times.  The graphical changes seem to be pretty minor compared to the first game but they do put some nice touches to the vehicles.  

What I am most excited for however is the integration of a massive amount of Skirmish coop battles.  According to the devs, there will be a total of 40 skirmish battles when the game is released.  In addition to that, the steam support for the game is an EXTREEEEMELY welcome addition compared to the last game which allows easy sharing of missions and mods in the community.  Another nice addition is the usage of your steam account for in-game leveling.

For those who are new, i'll recommend to you to check out some of the older (And cheaper) games in the MOW series. Why? Because MOW follows a semi-rigid structure in terms of gameplay, and certain elements shine through all of them. So if you get the first game, you have a better idea of what to expect from MOWAS2. As opposed to just buying this game outright, and run into a very common issue:
It's too difficult! It's fairly close to realistic in terms of ballistics and behaviour of arms, vehicles and ground physics. Anyway.
Sure, there's differences between the Men of War games and AS and Vietnam. But in essence get the first one, and you'll have a much better idea, than right now.

First the Skrimish I only have been able to play with the Germany and the United States so far since the other factions are coming later. The 5 missions that are available they all starting up to be the almost the same but with another terrain and enemy to battle against. Which make the game very interesting since you have to experience the same awesome mission more than twice and the challange of the battle reminds to always suprice me. 

The difficulty in this game matter much if you are not or are an experience player. If you most likely play on Heroic you can be stuck for hours same in Hard difficulty. Medium and Easy still takes a lot of time because the game developers designed this to be a defensive and offensive strategy maps. A lot can change on the battlefield that can change the way of victory which I like. This's really the one of the year greatest Strategy game out there so test your might in WW2 game and show what you would do to be victories in this game and war!

Multiplayer system using steam servers and that's great no more gamespy wohoo! although I experienced some heavy lags but besides that it's like normal Men of war Assault Squad Multiplayer system with more maps and with 2 new game types Day of victory and Assault Zones Extreme.

Men of war gives you the map editor which you can create your own awesome maps and you are also avalible to download mods in to this game with the use of steam workshop. Mods that you can use later to increase the amount of fun in this game and a lot of opportunites to make this game better.

1.)  It has stepped up and offers outstanding graphics compared to the original. (The dirt is so beautiful)
2.)  The AI is human-like and fluctuates on its reactions as the battelfield changes. (Hiding in impact craters, using tank husks as cover)
3.)  It offers a few new maps (as far as the Beta is concerned). It also has a few old ones.
4.)  All the sounds, music, and textures are recycled from the original.
      That's about it in regards to being different to MoW: AS

The second part of this review will be to describe the MoW experience to those that have yet to play this game.

1.)  The game is brutal, and unforgiving. (not your typical RTS) You must use your resources wisely as you only get so much and to recover mistakes mid game is almost impossible.
2.)  This game stresses on hardcore realism in regards to bullet penetration and physics. (Tank rounds will bounce off certain tanks and shred others.)
3.)  If your infantry is not in cover, they are already dead. (Tactical placement of infantry is the key to victory.)
4.)  This game is basically as real as war can get. 
5.)  If you press down your Ctrl key you are able to manually control and operate any unit. (This is a big plus to the RTS genre.)


All in all it is a decent game, however for the fans of the original, you may be disappointed with this new release as it has little to no changes gameplay-wise. However, if you are new to the series then I suggest you watch a few videos to see if this game is right for you.

52,9572458,english,"This strong ww2 based RTS comes from a company trusted for wanting historical accuracy, and establishing realisitic games to an excellent extent (IL-2: Sturmovik line). Accurate models of tanks and the capabilities of their weapons and armour sketch the outline of this game, with solid infantry combat at its core. 

One of the key features of the game series is the ability to directly control a unit. Keeping your top overview, you can thusly control an infantryman or tank using the wasd-keys and mouse to give you the edge of the standard unit ai. Whether you use it to take out a tank's track before finishing it off, or to grab a grenade and whipe out a clutch of infantry, the result is usually critical in a match. 
Another feature is that vehicles and heavy weapons (AT-guns, MGs) which are critically damaged and abandoned can be recrewed, repaired and added to your army. Maybe not unique in the RTS world, it is done excellently in this game.

Veterans of the original Assault Squad will mainly see graphical and engine improvements and a few new units and maps wrapped in a fresh package at a low price as far as new games go. Do not, however, expect a brand new game, which it has never claimed to be.

In terms of the looks the game is not really that much different. Most of the animations, units etc look like in the first one and the feel of the game is the same.

There are some major improvements in the play already though and heres some of them. (Will keep adding info as more content comes availevable)
1)
Improved pathfinding. Doesnt sound like much does it? It is actually a really big difference the units infantry and vehicles alike no longer get stuck as easy and the game shows the path they will take so if you can correct the route so no longer running through that open area infront of the machine gun or straight to the minefield.
2)
More maps. Again not something major but for me who has played all maps 50 times seeing new maps (and theyre actually new not just old copies from the original men of war) and what Ive tried so far theyre nice as well. Hoping to see more variety on the bigger 6v6 and 8v8 maps.
3)
No gamespy. Yeah no longer must we suffer from gamespy forgetting our cd keys etc.

I pre-ordered this title and got into the ""closed-beta"".  The game was rough, no campaign, just a few single player ""skirmish"" type missions.  I played the game a bit (atleast a few hours, my time played doesnt reflect the scenario skirmish i played for some reason), and I saw no REAL difference from their earlier games in the series, MoW;AS/etc (oh, besides the missing CAMPAIGN!!!!) and put it down to wait for the full release on the 19th. Today, release date rolls around and ............

EARLY ACCESS status ???? What ?!!!!!!!!!

This is an outright swindle, I pre-purchased with the impression that the title was to be FULLY RELEASED on the release date, and not into an EARLY ACCESS title.... Why 'pre-purchase' an early access title? There was no warning of this, it was not displayed on the store page, and the cost of the title warranted a COMPLETE/FULL (near AAA) release on release date, not a messed up early access, unfinished pile of trash.  The negative reviews are not represented underneath the title properly when they have many helpful 'clicks' from users.

Oh yeah, not to mention the title isnt even ready on the 19th, wow. Early Access on the 20th?

This purchase is seriously making me re-think ever buying another game on steam, the early access overkill is bad enough, now they have to do NINJA EARLY ACCESSS for $30!!!!. I am definitely never buying nothing from this developer again and probably never buying another non-AAA (and vouched for, released, and reviewed by proper journos) title off steam again.

There are three tanks in the level, but the game won't let you take them.

Totaler krieg will fix everything!

TL;DR 

All the ranges have been shortened, tanks shoot like pistols ranges now. the HUD has been made into a confusing cluster fug. The levels are still the SAME (with a few imported from previous games which weren't in AS1... I don't think there are many TOTALLY new maps), there aren't many new units, at all. (a few tanks, yay) The AI is still CRAP. The pathfinding is still basicly the same, horrible mess that it was.

The only thing they seem to have spent their time alot on is the new lobby system which is fine.. (Oh and camouflages Hoo-fudging-ray!) I would have been happy to pay 20€ for lobby & performance fixes on AS1 but no, they had to change the game mechanics which didnt need to be changed at all

Oh and i like the addittion of steam workshop.. This would have been such a great game if they had just focused on adding new content, and fixing flaws in the old game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have played Assault squad 1 for a whopping 1300 hours, and i am (was) a real fan of the assault squad series. I do realize this game is still in beta, and it runs really really bad on most computers, but i have not taken that into account, only the flaws in the game design and gameplay. This would have been a great game if they hadn't tried to make it like CoH3 or something.

It still has the unique Men of war feel, but the ranges man, the ranges.. so godawful... in addittion to everything else they messed up. Unit icons on the left are a really hard-to-see and confusing mess, the HUD generally is very very confusing and theres alot of unneeded stuff on your screen, what limits your field of view. I honestly don't see any improvements on the AI or the pathfinding (except that neat path that shows where they will go)

The tank Ranges used to be fun and challenging, except a maybe little too short, but now your tanks have no choice but to get into the frontline with your infantry and get bazooka'd. This might rise up the importance of infantry but for all the wrong reasons. In assault squad 1 you could easily take out a tank with infantry if you had any tactics and perhaps some stealth too.

The infantry seem to be really tough now, which is unrealistic and totally lame. There used to be a time when you had to crawl your men through the battlefield to not make them die from a Buzzsaw (mg42) but now you can just throw them out to the field with only minor damage to them by bullets. And infantry behind cover... I like the suppression thing they added... but the way infantry only takes cover when they are hit is silly, As an infantryman you take cover when you are being shot at and you get supressed, The current system is like you can keep an enemy infantryman behind cover as long as you hit him once every 5 seconds or so...",1394236835,1394718713,False,15,0,0.483799576759338379,6,True,False,True,76561197987024260,268,12,5516,24,189.0,1601406496,,

Technical issues:

-Collosal load stutter ingame
-Connecting to a game lobby takes 20 or more seconds, if it actually gets through
-At least 5 different crashes both ingame and during loading related to missing models and textures
-Constant low fps (unless the game is paused)
-Complaining about these issues in the group chat got me banned from that chat.

EDIT:
-While the lesser bugs (crashes due to missing or wrong filenames) have been fixed, there is still no stable performance.

All of that on a rig that exceeds the minimum requirements by far (4x3600 CPU, GF465GTX 1GB, WIN7 64)


Even for a beta (5 weeks before release) this is a catastrophic mess. Considering the previous game in the MOW series released without any of these issues. And now the release date has been pushed back.

General Game issues:

The game is basically a graphics update with very little actual new gameplay features. 

The new interface changes are mostly superficial.
The 8v8 mode is not something new. The original Men of War (before MOWAS1) already had 16 player support and maps that supported it. Trying to sell this as a new feature is bad.


The only hard reasons to get the new MOWAS2 is the advertised multicore support, some higher texture resolutions and steam workshop support.
Now the issue is that they failed to provide the advertised multicore support during the last 6 weeks and seeing how they tripped over the 20 february release date and pushed it back I am skeptical about delivery in the next 5 weeks. 
The improved graphics (normal maps, higher texture resolutions for terrain) can not be counted as working because performance is so bad that players with high end rigs still have to turn down settings.


Digital Mindsoft also seriously lacks in profesionalism in the PR department. Players have been banned for days and weeks for pointing out flaws in new patches and negative reviews or comments are often attempted to be removed.

30,8853043,english,"If you havent played any of the Men of War games, and I would only really recommend Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad and to some extent Men of War Red Tide. Then do so now! Men of War is the successor to Soldiers Heroes of WW2 and Faces of War. In many respects the game remained unchanged for many years and then DMS took the reigns with the Assault Squad frnachise. Assault Squad largely focusses on MP and whilst there are Single Player skirmish, these again are recommended to be played in Co Op. There is no SP campaign like the MoW or Red Tide games.

So what about Assault Squad 2? Its in beta atm and so there are performance issues and bugs as to be expected. The major ground work on AS2 is the engine improvements, graphic updates, new models for many vehicles and tanks and lots of new MP maps and SP missions/skirmish.

The gameplay is largely the same as AS. The UI has more detailed information now. The UI does look a little bit cluttered for my liking but I am sure a mod will simplify this and it is still in beta so may change for release. 

AS2, no more Gamespy! yea! Easier installation and file sharing of mods. In game voice chat. Better options in MP. Having played the beta the SP Skirmish is similar to AS, but there arent waves of enemy attacks. It feels more structured and you get extra resources dependent on your actions. In all the SP side and Co OP looks promising and is a bit more creative than the skirmishes in AS. MP the new maps look and play well. Performance is impacting MP atm, but patches are being released every few days. 

Overall not a huge amount different to AS, although the improvements to the engine have upgraded to Multi Core CPU support and therefore the graphics are really looking top notch. The tank models are outstanding. New MP and SP maps should keep us MoW players happy for some time. The new UI gives more information including unit kills per unit. 

A complex game which just keeps getting better and better. If you compare AS2 to MoW MP the difference is huge. I wouldnt go back, however the SP portion of MoW is more captivating.

I'd get it only if you're a hardcore MoW fan, otherwise wait until after release. Still, Assault Squad was probably the best multiplayer experience in the series and an improved version of it is probably worth getting in my book (provided stability issues are solved)",1390278682,1390278682,True,27,0,0.550719201564788818,4,True,False,True,76561198009628396,298,15,3172,0,163,1587988546,,
32,8762857,english,"Since I have been lucky enough to acquire early acess to the Beta of it and have logged over 200 hours on the 1st Assault Squad I figure ive earned some right to comment on this upcoming release. I have to say that I am having very few graphical issues, only one instance where i can remember a serious shader error but it was easily fixed by minimizing the game and re opening it. The graphics do look very nice and there are several small details i appreciate like the ejecting shell and the smoke from the breech of the cannon and other small things that added to the whole. The gameplay is just as good as the first Assault Squad and ive played 3 matches so far and 2 of them had good frame rates and all while one was bad but hey 2:3 isnt to bad especially for pre-release. There is still the fun 3rd person mode and all the other things that make men of war the amazing RTS it is. I would certinly reccomend this game to any fan of the men of war series and really to anyone who enjoys RTS's or stratagy games in general.",1390100311,1390100311,True,442,1,0.843814671039581299,57,True,False,True,76561198027396571,286,1,4976,0,260,1584288228,,
