10,55253270,english,"NBA游戏我从NBAlive2004玩到现在，这游戏的发展每年都在进步，球员动作真实度，到战术多样性，AI的升级，画面的升级，每年都在进步。BUT但是，游戏性一直都没变，那就是进攻防守拿比分。时间久了这种玩法早就厌倦了。我觉得2K应该重新考虑游戏的评分机制，以这些年NBA2K的发展来看，优势就是动作画面拟真度。为什么不发展一套评分系统，就是玩家在选择两支球队比赛后不看球队得分定输赢，以比赛过程的精彩度，模拟真实度给的评分定输赢呢？甚至可以组织玩家在社区分享每日NBA2k十佳球。评分越高得到的奖励就越高。奖励就是虚拟金币，金币可以用来玩个人生涯模式升级。个人模式可以继续用得分机制的游戏性。NBA2K你有没有考虑过作为一款目前世界上最先进的篮球比赛模拟游戏。玩家选一只联盟很弱的球队大比方战胜了名人堂球队的时候玩家是多么失望？又没考虑过当玩家只顾着不择手段去得分的时候有没有心情和注意力去观赏游戏画面？你们把画面。操作改来改去导致游戏性的下降还不如以前的NBALIVE操作简单，得分爽快。玩起来开心。希望你们NBA2K22有进步，不是画面的进步，而是游戏性和成就系统。永远支持篮球，永远支持NBA2K，谢谢你们奉献的世界上最好的篮球游戏NBA game I played from NBA Live 2004 to now, the development of this game has been improving every year, players' action authenticity, to tactical diversity, AI upgrade, picture upgrade, every year. But, the game has not changed, that is, attack and defense to get the score. I've been tired of this game for a long time. I think 2K should reconsider the scoring mechanism of the game. Judging from the development of nba2k in recent years, the advantage is the fidelity of action pictures. Why not develop a scoring system, that is, players choose two teams after the game, do not look at the team score to determine the win or loss, and use the brilliance of the game process to simulate the authenticity of the score to determine the win or loss? You can even organize players to share the top ten balls of nba2k every day in the community. The higher the score, the higher the reward. Rewards are virtual gold coins, which can be used to upgrade personal career mode. Personal mode can continue to use the scoring mechanism for gameplay. Have you ever considered nba2k as one of the most advanced basketball game simulation games in the world. How disappointed are players when they choose a team that is weak in the league, for example, to beat a hall of fame team? Did not consider when the player is only concerned about scoring by unscrupulous means, have the mood and attention to watch the game screen? You put the picture. The change of operation leads to the decline of gameplay, which is not as simple as the previous nbalive operation and the score is crisp. Have fun. I hope you can make progress in nba2k22, not in pictures, but in gameplay and achievement system. Always support basketball, always support nba2k, thank you for the best basketball game in the world",1569285320,1601802984,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198828473082,37,3,11576,112,11501,1601810271

1) The Story in MyPlayer was good, really enjoyed the the character progression and occasional cut scenes when you start playing in the league. No issue on the FaceScan.
2) Shoes in the game really got me like changing all the players in my team so that's win.
3) The Rebounding here is very hard. AI occasionally does like 3-5 Offensive rebound consecutively when they miss and I can't get my team to have a rebounding dominant stats.
4) Shooting in HOF is very hard. Rarely goes in.
5) My team mates who I'm not controlling are dumb. When a opponent cuts through the basket my AI team sometimes take a step in the opposite direction as if they intentionally letting the AI enemy score.
6) The Difficulty level makes no sense, I'm able to outscore a opponent like 30+ points in Superstar(Which makes it boring) but when I go to HOF they outscore me like 30. I was assuming that by going to HOF opponents will be able to play smart(Make Plays more often) but they're still dumb. the only reason they are winning is they can hit the basket even while I'm defending right in front of them and my Shot aren't even though I executed a perfectly good play just to have my 3 pointer get open.

Here is a review for 2K's NBA 2K20 developed by Visual Concepts

I've been playing this game for 2 weeks. It was a good career experience, enjoyed my time but to be honest it gets boring after about 60 hours. The reason is you are always listening to the same commentary while playing games, it takes a lot of time to start every single game and you aren't able to skip some animations. Also, everything is identical, you see this after your first 20 hours. It's hard to earn VC and you really need it. VC is in-game money by the way and you need it to upgrade your player's overall rating. I've played a few different nba games than this one and 2k20 is definitely harder than others, it is really hard to green release at the beginning, don't rage when you can't hit threes just get badges and check youtube for some tips. 
There are plenty of game modes to play such as MyTEAM, MyLEAGUE, MyGM, MyCAREER.
I suggest you to play offline, there are always cheaters and legends in MyPARK. And you can't win games.
Don't give 60 dollars or 50 euros whatever your currency is just wait for sale it's not worth for that much price.
These are what you have to know before the main review, here it comes:

First of all, I want to point out the graphics. They are truly realistic. This doesn't mean good, the game just looks real at all.
I will not be talking about the other game modes but MyCAREER. You start as a college basketball player, then few things happen (i am not going to spoil) and you go to nba drafts. Everything goes step by step. You even choose the song to play when you hit a three if you come that level. A good story goes slowly, it always continues. I had my own designed shoes too. You basically will enjoy it. But the worst part is the gameplay. Don't expect to hit all of your shots or layups or free-throws. This game takes time to improve your build. You will not be able to get an A+ teammate grade every game. About bugs; there are minor bugs that won't annoy you while playing, you won't feel them. You need a pretty good pc to play without lags. 
These are all I can say, a good sports game. Wait for sale as I said before. A tip, get quick draw and range extender badges for shooting. Now I will link some screenshots and a bug from our game. Thanks for reading.

An example of bug, I had 10 points but there's 8 below

I came back to the series after more than a decade, picking it up while it was on sale. I realy wanted to like this game, but there is a huge downside to wich I will refer later. The game mechanics are fantatsic and once you get the hang of it, the game is realy fun to play. The graphics and player animations are pretty good as well. The possibility to scan your own face via your phone and seeing yourself alongside actors like Idris Alba is kinda weird and utterly mind blowing at the same time! Although the story mode was way to short and did fail on using its full potential, I would not have much to complain, if this game would not turn out to be an outrageous money milking machine. The progression system is so unbelievably slow, that you just notice how the developers have planned to get you to pump more money into the game in order to be able to upgrade your player properly so that the fun doesn't let up. These methods seem almost criminal to me and destroy the gaming experience in the long term. I am downright disgusted by the tenacity of the developers. If I had bought this game at full price, i would have been pissed to the fullest extend. 2K should be ashamed of ripping their customers off in this way!

72,76276775,english,"Disclaimer - I'm not using any of the online content.  I just want to play offline MyLeague seasons with custom drafts.

NBA 2k20 is a pretty good basketball game, but there are some SERIOUS annoyances.  I'll start with the bad.

The bad.

*  Cut scenes.  OMG 2k, who exactly do you think is watching these?  NOBODY WATCHES THEM 2K!!  Every single 2k player has to sit there mashing the exit button and muttering obscenities to themselves when these things constantly pop up.  How can you possibly not know that these are universally hated by literally everyone?  It's just non-stop.  What's worse is they are not even necessary.  At least give us a way to turn them off so we don't have to keep mashing the exit button and getting constantly irritated.  I will never buy another 2k basketball game until I hear these stupid things can be completely eliminated from the game.  I don't want to skip them, I want them GONE!!  If these were not in the game, it would be like 25% more enjoyable, at least.  It's just non-stop.  The worst is when you start a new game, there is just an endless barrage of crap to exit out of.  Halftime is equally bad, you get all the stupid ""on court acts"", plus Ernie Johnson to mash the exit key through.  I really wish the president of 2k games would watch these several times a day, then we'd probably see an end to them.  I mean, it's not even advertising!  It's just stupid animated crap of a bear on a bicycle, trampoline acts and cheerleaders.  Not only is it stupid and boring content, IT'S THE SAME EVERY TIME.  The same.  Stupid.  Cut scenes.  Over, and over, and over.  Maybe 2k needs to hire a consulting agency and root out all the brain dead elements of their organization who are pushing to get horrid stuff like this put into their games.  I swear, it's almost like 2k is TRYING to irritate 2k players.  There's really no other rational explanation for putting garbage like this in a game.

*  CPU player cheating.  I can generally beat the CPU on the middle difficulty levels, but OMG the cheating.  I totally get that teams ""go on runs"", but the CPU players get buffs that your team absolutely never gets.  Speed bursts.  Consistently hitting contested shots that would never go in for the player.  It's pretty obvious when ""cheat mode"" kicks in too.  One minute, the game is playing more or less realistically, the next it's like the CPU team went over to the bench, drank like 30 red bulls, and applied flubber to the bottom of their shoes.  The player team absolutely never gets this mode.  In cheat mode they CPU *ALWAYS* has an open man under the basket.  All you can do is build up a lead and try not to throw the controller through the screen while it's happening.  Probably the most annoying thing that happens in cheat mode is when I block like 5 shots in a row, and the CPU just keeps getting the ball back over, and over, and over.  It's pretty clear the CPU player has pre-decided it's going to score on some plays, and there's simply nothing you can do to stop it.  It will pull any and every cheap trick in the book.  It totally ruins the game, and in addition to the completely annoying CPU cheating mentioned below, is a prime reason why I'm done with 2k games forever.  I've just had enough.  To be clear, I don't mind the CPU winning, or going on a run.  That's how basketball works, but it's just nothing short of irritating when it's accomplished by abusing the game mechanics.  One thing I absolutely hate is when the camera switches over late after an annoying cut scene, making it impossible for me to switch defenders in time to react to the play. 

*Transition defense is a complete train wreck.  God forbid LeBron James is on the other team, it's just not even worth the effort to try and play on harder difficulties.  Just sit the controller down and give the CPU the inevitable wide open dunk it's going to get anyway.  It's less frustrating than trying to maneuver your defender who just lets the ball handler stroll on by.  The Player team sure never gets such nonsense.

*  Missing players.  With resources available like basketball-reference, it's hard to understand why they can't put every single team ever in the game.  If they can't put players like Barkley & Reggie Miller in, just created fakes with their stats like basketball games used to.  Add just generic player with Barkley's stats and call it ""Chris Berkley"" or something.  I would just do it myself if adding a custom player didn't take so long.

The good:

*  Once you get the hang of some basic concepts, which requires hours of practice, the game is decent, but not great.  Until then, it can be one of the most frustrating experiences you've ever had.

*  The rosters are half way decent.  As noted above, some players are missing, but overall there are enough historic players to satisfy me.  Not perfect, but it could be worse I guess.

Overall - I'm giving it a thumbs down because of the price, CPU cheating, and the extremely annoying cut scenes.  I got mine on deep discount, but there is absolutely no way I would ever pay $60 for NBA 2k20.  I'd say avoid 2k basketball games from here on out, it's obvious they are devoting the majority of their resources to fishing those dollars out of your pocket, and not enough to making good games.  It's pretty clear they aren't listening to their fans either, because I had 2k18 as well, and people had most of the same complaints, but 2k just keeps putting out the same old game and slapping a new year on it.",1600604470,1600745940,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199032080659,21,2,1381,382,472,1600744014

Another problem I had with MyPlayer mode is that you can only improve physical stats once per week, and it's not in-game weeks but REAL TIME weeks.

Some including myself have experienced the problem where the controller and keyboard and mouse stop working once you have joined an online game. This means you cannot control your players or any others. Since this has no fix and 2K doesn't care i and many others cannot play online with anyone including close friends. This is a serious cause of irritation and i'm frankly surprised with how good 2K sales are when there customer service is so terrible. They make the same game every year and everyone still buys it.

Not only that, but the transaction side of things have taken a huge forefront in the game (which i expected but still disheartening). I was never interested in online, just some quick play games or running a season, maybe MyPlayer but even the menus have become cluttered and a catalogue of messiness. The timeouts and halftime performances and halftime shows and yadayadayada all just slow down the game and you can't disable most of it. If you could skip these scenes immediately it might be forgiven but you have to watch at least a few seconds of every once of these scenes and it gets so frustrating when you just want a quick bball game without all the interruptions. Think rocket league how you can jump in play a game and get out just as fast. A NBA 2k game is so bloated with all the simulation extras that it hurts the final product and even when I feel like playing a quick game, I don't since the bloat turns me off from trying. 

I bought it because it was on sale for $5 and that's the only reason. At that price I don't feel bad picking it up just to play a quick game every once in a while, but by the end of a game, even if I had fun there is ALWAYS some things that frustrate me with how this game is currently presented.

Been playing the game for awhile and I'm not having issues with ""crashing"" and I bought my pc at Costco.
I am having issues with the ball bouncing off invisible walls when the cpu gets near the court edges, instead of being called for 'out of bounds'.
I am having issues with players passing through my player on defense as if he was some sort of ghastly apparition.
The CPU tends to ""balance"" out gameplay with these outstanding moves born of supernatural origins.
The inconsistent controls are frustrating.  Especially when you think you are about to make a sweet dunk on the fast break only to bust out with the ever-so-flaccid lay up. 
Overall, My ignorance toward the fundamentals has created a fun learning experience for me....The Post, Lanes, Point Forwards!!!  
Idris Elbow is a weird addition to the game, as I only recall him from a movie where he played a pedophile African rebel warlord.  Why not put Marv Albert in the game attacking female fans in the background?
I do enjoy their take on Hawaii Leonard's disposition and Shaq's incoherent screeds.

57,75674908,english,"I can't really in good conscience recommend this game. There are some good points, like the graphics are good, the core gameplay is still good and it has updated rosters. But there are a lot of things that really detracts from my experience.

When you're shooting free throws as the away team, the camera shakes. This is a bug that's been in every NBA 2K game I've played since 2K13. I don't why it hasn't been fixed yet.

About every 10 games in MyCareer, the game records all the VC you earn, but don't give them to you. I had  fewer than 100 VC before my most recent MyCareer game, supposedly earned about 1000 VC in MyCareer and went to the progression tab, I hadn't received any VC. I've only played about 30 games on PC, but this also happened to me on PS4.

All the Gatorade gym training mini-games are horrible. Absolutely awful and poorly implemented. I don't like the neighborhood feature in general, but the rest of it is at least tolerable. I do like the new story. I think it's good that they highlight how student athletes are exploited by colleges. I also really like the player creator now, because you can make a really specialized player with a unique set of skills.

Almost all the improvements seem geared toward MyTeam and MyCareer. I don't particularly like MyTeam because it's like a free to play Mobile game stapled onto a trading card game and the only purpose is to drain your wallet. Game modes like MyLeague sees little improvement, which is a shame because I really like MyLeague.

In addition to this, there are a lot of loading screens and a number of bugs. The game crashed on my a couple of times and during the draft combine, I was spawned into a gym with free movement and other NPCs were standing in position waiting for the cut scene(that didn't trigger) to start. This also happened during a NBA game. This is also the first time the MyCareer mode is forced online.

In the last few years NBA 2K has become gradually more focused on MyTeam and the online components of MyCareer (Pro-Am). This isn't something I necessarily have a problem with, but it comes at the detriment of the older features like MyLeague and the some components of MyCareer. I think this product has become gradually more anti-consumer and cynical. The gambling aspect of MyTeam alone is odious, it's basically just loot crates again.",1599613142,1599613142,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197975479921,567,2,2254,0,2254,1599608484

71,75654463,english,"Maybe the worst NBA2K game ever. NBA2K games getting worse since 2015. 

There are skipless animations and visuals, make you stare your screen for nearly 20-30 sec for every foul, timeout, end of period, end of quarter, opening and ending. I just want to play the game. Why do i care rebound leader when im a point guard? Why should i look at James Harden's dropping assist numbers in every Rocket's matchup? I dont care about NBA2K21's demo. Im not interested in Dorris Burke and her speech. I just want to skip them. Ah i forgot the honorable mention, referee. When you get fouled and go to freethrow line for the first time, referee just tells some shit to players for 10 seconds. In total when you play 6 minutes long quarters, you wait about 6-7 minutes to play 18 minutes of real time. 

The AI works at least ""proper enough"" on older games. But in this game, even the simplest screen call breaks the game which causes defender to leave a gap for dodgin screen. That leaves you nearly wide-open or maximum of %10 contested statwise. Instead you dodge defender by just waiting and pressing left bumper and calling screen. Then rain 3s. Even AI abuse this. I see often that Curry call screen, wait for 3 seconds without moving and just take 3s. If you call a simplest gameplan, opposing team struggle to adapt it, causes easy points. Gameplay is really horrible in MyCarrer single player mode. 

There are issues with body colliders. You can use all your stamina to bump some1s leg and cant move an inch.

Difficulty settings are not boosting opposing teams AI but boost their stats, also lower your teams IQ to 0. The most irritating part is in HOF when i miss only 1 shot, my character going cold. Cant hit shots from close range, wide open with 85 close shot rating when i get full white bars. 

Also some animations are better than others (offers better frame windows for making perfect timing for scoring) but it is hidden so you need to constantly search for dataminer pages to get good one, cuz devs constantly patch them.

There are missing shot types and animations when i compare to older versions. There is a dropstep layup and dunk in game (i guess. there is a badge about it lol.) even i tried 2 hours to get a dropstep layup. i cant seem to find. also there is no knowledge about how to dropstep in controls menu. Only you can do is floater and eurostep. Dropstep and runnershots are missing. Fadeaway shots only available in post. There are no fancy dribbling moves. A lot of dunk styles are missing.

i did not play myteam. i dont have word for that.
There is a grind part in this game but i wont b*tch about it, it seems very easy when you can abuse AI.
Multiplayer part is laggy af.
Commentary is very limited opposed to older versions.
Curry special: Can make 3s from halfcourt.

0/10 i wont play again and not recommend
Also sorry for bed Englando xD

17,75582156,english,"The last game in this series that I bought was 2K12. I put over 1,000 hours into it; it is still to this day the third most-played game all-time on my Steam account behind Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4.

I'd avoided the series since then because they ruined MyCareer with the gross nickel-and-diming microtransactions, and the mode itself, if you didn't want to pay-to-win, would take 100 hours or more just to get to ""mediocre, legit rotation bench player on a franchise-mode team"" level of player.

But 2K12 started to feel like a relic after awhile; that was Kobe Bryant's NBA and Dirk Nowitzki's NBA, not Giannis Antetokounmpo's NBA; 2K20 cover athlete Anthony Davis played his one and only college season in 2011-12 and isn't in the old game.

For five bucks, I bought 2K20...and my gods, what an absolute atrocity, a disappointment at any price, a just plain terrible game.

Leave aside the gross pay-to-win multiplayer that combines a full-price retail product (or even one you get for 92% off) with one of the most exploitative microtransaction models in all of AAA gaming. You don't need me to tell you how awful that is.

What really jumps out at me is how genuinely terrible the actual basketball is, even in single-player MyLeague mode where you're not asked to participate in the MyCareer grind or to even look at the VC store.

The AI is straight out of 2K12, but the players' skillset is built for a modern league. The ""pace and space"" offense? Get real. Players with open looks from 3 will dribble into traffic and pull up for a contested midrange jump shot. The switching on defense is so bad that the player will frequently be forced onto a terrible matchup (player-lock yourself to the point guard and see how often you're switched onto the center every time there's a high screen and then bullied at the rim by a much bigger player. Take off the player lock and you can partially fix this but the AI will then just lose track of the guard for an open shot instead.)

Move the sliders to try and force the AI to favor the 3-point shot? Sure, they won't drive into traffic anymore, but then you're exposed to a different problem, namely that nobody short of Dame Lillard can make an open 3, and you'll add in a problem where players with a defender right in their face will shoot a contested shot with no chance of going in.

I have over a thousand hours in 2K12. The AI in 2K20 hasn't changed in eight years as the league has evolved underneath it. So it's not like I don't know how to play video game basketball.

And one other thing worth mentioning? Too often, I'd be guarding the opposing point guard, me just below the arc, the opponent out 30 feet from the basket.

In today's game, if you do that, point guards can drain a 3 from out there and make a defender pay for leaving them wide-open. It's changed the entire way that NBA defense is played and opened up floor spacing in a way that's wildly entertaining.

In NBA 2K20? The point guard will dribble down to 8 seconds on the shot clock, initiate an isolation, and then make one pass or try to drive the lane so predictably that you can take away the lane and force a 16-foot floater that goes in far more often than it ever has in real life...including during the early aughts, when NBA 2K was on the PlayStation 2 and that kind of offense was still common in pro basketball.

Terrible AI, a complete failure on the developers to understand how to simulate the game in 2020, and disgusting pay-to-win multiplayer and even singleplayer modes.

All of this adds up to 98 GB of hard drive space I'm going to use for something else, because this game's getting uninstalled for good after just 17 hours, unthinkable for a sports title.

77,75508445,english,"DISCLAIMER: I've played every NBA 2K game since 2K13, so I consider my opinion valid.

Pros:
NBA 2K20 is a slight upgrade from 2K19, as the graphics, movement and animation selection all seem to be better than before. Also, the story in MyCareer is pretty engaging, but it's still quite similar to those from past games.

Cons:
As a regular 2K player, I was pretty disappointed with NBA 2K20. The improvements were rather limited in my opinion, and the game itself was a disaster after its launch. Endless bugs and glitches plagued every game mode and feature, which actually made me uninstall until the 2K team patched some things up. Even now, though, I notice plenty of issues with game play and scene transitions.

TLDR: Don't buy this game if you're expecting something new/better from 2K. Just like Madden, this is pretty much the same game as it's always been. I'd only recommend buying it if it's on sale for at least 50% off.",1599342954,1599342954,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198079179146,36,3,9777,96,9290,1602021657

82,75505061,english,"This may actually be the worst gaming franchise of all time. The single-player and multi-player team basketball game is pretty much exactly the same as it was in 2010, and the new additions have been things like MyCareer. MyCareer is a pay to win MMO basketball lifestyle RPG. The idea of building your own character and having him play for NBA teams is actually a cool idea. It's also cool to have him play online with other player's own characters in park or organized team games. But they have completely polluted it by allowing you to spend in game currency on power, and they have added more pointless shit to spend in game currency on like 300 different types of shoes, temporary consumable bonuses, and an in game casino... It is really disgraceful. If you wanted to play games and team practice to reach a competitive stat level to play against good players online, it would take hundreds of hours... Or you could simply spend $100 on in game currency and shorten that time massively. 

I can say with 100% certainty that the 2016 and 2017 version of this game was much better than all the subsequent games. I feel like the NBA is slapping basketball fans in the face by allowing this awful game studio to make games with their players and teams. Everyone complains about how awful EA is, but compared to this game, FIFA and Madden are incredible.

79,75403298,english,"This game has a game breaking bug where when you tap the shoot button no matter how quickly you tap or press it, it shoots a very late release shot. Even if you just want to pump fake. This extends to the free throws at times which is beyond annoying because you have zero influence on how likely your shot is to go in. On top of that 2k has never had anti-cheat which ruins the game in online the park is full of cheaters it's a shock every time I get a game the doesn't have a hacker. The only other game I've played where cheating is nearly as bad as on this game is gta 5 and rdr2 and both of those games share a parent company with this game in take two interactive. It's extremely buggy with the graphics settings on pc when you turn down some settings there is a bug where the entire neighborhood has the same pitch black texture except for signs and players. The game is just packed full of bugs, such as in mycareer when you are subbed out and there is supposed to be a button to sim until the next appearance which will fail to appear for extreme lengths of time if your game is not capped at 60fps and sometimes crashes due to it making you lose what you've done for that game. The game is capped at 60fps for the online modes which on top of horrendous servers makes the online gameplay run like a handicapped geriatric when compared to the single player and I haven't even mentioned how often you will be disconnected for no reason at all. Another very fun bug is how in online games you sometimes just randomly deal with framerate stutters of dropping from 60 to <10fps which will persist throughout the entire game you play. I really want to recommend this game to friends because I genuinely have a great time playing this game when everything is working. It has so much more potential on pc however, there is no support for voice chat on pc, we don't get the demo for the next game. We get the next gen releases a year late, and despite that we are subject to the same predatory pricing and monetization as the consoles which are supported so much more. The basketball gameplay usually improves year after year but I am disappointed every year due to the utter neglect and silence that 2k treats the PC platform to making version of the game with the most potential into the version of the game with the most headaches and I do not see that ever changing in the foreseeable future.",1599186521,1599186521,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198122647321,228,38,8412,628,6503,1601882954

As always pay to win quicker is a massive thing in park and pro am as always in the 2k franchise, it is easier still though to push a 95 overall. But, that also creates the issue where you have to push to a legend in the park to reach your 99 overall cap breakers.

All in all a good game and for the price i paid at £3.20, you cant complain. Although its a grind I've managed to reach a 92 overall in just 96 hours of play, which shows it is do able and i haven't invested a tonne of money on VC.

36,75250838,english,"READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!! 

I went through Hell and back, but I was finally able to get this game installed with the multiplayer features in tact. I wrote a rather nasty review, but instead of leaving it, I wanted to put this warning out there and offer a more constructive posting rather than just saying to not buy the game. Given my experience with this one, I am not planning on buying from this developer again.

NOW THE HELP PORTION:

IF you decide to buy this game and install it, when the game launches for the first time, it is going to ask for your date of birth. There is a minimum age requirement to access online game play, HOWEVER, you would think it should be easy to put in your correct birthday. IT IS NOT. The menu has Month, Day, and Year top to bottom. There are hash marks in the fields where the birthday goes and arrows on each side. You can cycle through the months and days with the arrows just fine, BUT BE CAREFUL WITH THE YEAR! If you click the right arrow, the game will stop you right there and give you a message that says you are too young to play online and the online features will be LOCKED!!! USE THE LEFT ARROW TO SELECT THE YEAR OF YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!!!

I've read the game is full of pay to win micro-transactions that give people an advantage with programming mechanics of the game I do not even know of yet, but I don't really care about any of that. Rubbish purchases are just that and are designed to accommodate plebs. People who want shortcuts in life are the problem and they are the reason game companies get by with doing what they do. If you don't enjoy playing with those types of people, I would suggest only playing with friends who you know view games the same as you. Let the rest of the riffraff battle with their wallets.

I ultimately had to make a return to steam and re-purchase the game in order to enter my correct birthday. I spent a lot of time reading forums and trying various other methods in order to remedy the problem, and I even requested help from the Dev, but in the end the return and re-buying seemed my only timely solution. I did manage to pick the game up cheap, but considering how much money I make per hour when I am working, I definitely overpaid.

Buy the game or don't. I just hope this helps at least one person to not make the same mistake. Good luck!",1598926315,1599081408,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197969497256,69,1,883,0,11,1599585382

HOWEVER, it is in no way worth the 100+ GB download space. I could download Skyrim 5 times but instead I have this shit. The game crashes at LEAST 3 times a day and sometime crashes on startup twice in a row before I can finally play.

1. MyCareer
Good god. The story itself is quite good in some spots, but it's ruined by many things, the constant cutscenes which are just needless in some spots. You go from cutscene to cutscene, play 2 mins worth of game and another cutscene. Some parts seem like they were written by a 5 year old, needless cringe jokes and bad puns between characters leave you feeling just plain awkward. When it comes to player improvement, it has never been slower. I saw some post where you have to play for about 120-130 HOURS before you MyPlayer reaches max attributes. It's just one giant push to make you spend more money. 
2. MyTeam
 Yawn, It's still just the same old gamemode that 2k has had for years. I'm not much of a PvP kind of person so I was hoping for at least a little bit of fun against the CPU. Nope, there are hundreds of single-player challenges to choose from, allow me to walk you through them. Step 1. Try and beat team. Step 2. Beat team because the game puts it on Rookie difficulty. Step 3. Repeat Step 1 except the difficulty is one level higher. Oh no, my 30 point win is now only a 25 point win. So much harder. Step 4. Log off after 2 games because you get bored of playing the CPU on Rookie difficulty. That's MyTeam in a nutshell. 
3. MyGM
Eh, It's a GM mode, I like it.

53,75097393,english,"First time playing an NBA 2K game since 2K13 on the PS3. I hear people say the modern 2K games are bad, but I always thought that was a bit of an exaggeration. After playing 2K20, I can say that I can see where they are coming from. I feel like the core gameplay is flawed on some key areas. 
I have to say graphically and presentation wise the looks fantastic. But gameplay wise I feel like the game's need to feel realistic takes away a lot of fun. Team AI is atrocious, I feel like you can't rely on your AI teammates to play good defense especially in the paint. Players are too slow to simulate ""realistic"" fatigue, it ends up feeling like your trapped into what 2K wants instead of relying on skill. It makes fast breaks and help defense feel lethargic.
Which bring me to the main point about the core gameplay. I often times felt like I was trapped in animations to ""simulate"" momentum. This makes the game feel kinda like the movement in a GTA game. So like your player is still moving a bit after you've moved the analog stick, which can make for some frustrating defensive one-on-one sequences.
I also need to mention the gambling/microtransactions in the game, which is a whole other issue. I was under the assumption that once you got an player's card for MyTeam, that he was yours to keep. But nope, you have to constantly sign them to 1 or 5 game contracts to play with them. This gets in the way of fun and just another design choice to nudge gamers towards buying the microtransaction currency. 
It's a shame because I really wanted to like this game. I feel like 2K has all the money and talent to make stellar basketball games again. For now I guess I'll stick with the flawed but more fun NBA 2K11 until NBA 2K improves their core gameplay mechanics.",1598687000,1598687000,False,1,0,0.510676145553588867,0,True,False,False,76561197964301068,450,5,459,0,459,1598685161

87,74997626,english,"I play these games for MyCareer, saw it on special, and even though the last one was disappointed decided to give it a shot. At first I was impressed. I loved the story, and the storytelling through the camera. The animations had improved drastically. The actual game looks pretty good too. 

Everything through that point feels great. The games themselves feel okay, the shooting isn't awful, and you can find yourself doing quite well in the NBA Summer League to finish things off. I think the story is short but sweet. Not worth it on its own, but a really big step up from 2K16 which was the last game I played.

Then you hit the NBA, and the game shows its true colours. It feels just as bad as it did before, except maybe worse. Shot timing in this game specifically is the worst I have experienced. In other games, being slightly late or slightly early meant that an open shot would almost always go in. In this game, anything but an excellent shot will almost always miss. I understand wanting to make controls precise, but this is awful. 

Next, dribbling feels super clumsy for My Player. He isn't decked out on the stats, but as a shooting guard who was a big star through your college years, you should at least expect him to be able to cross over without losing control of the ball, or do a spin dribble with some speed. But the problem is, everything you think you should be able to do, you can't.

I don't want to grind for 100+ hours to deck out my stats just so I can maybe have a little fun with the career games. I don't care for any other aspect of the game, so this was yet again, not worth it. There are minor improvements, and some major setbacks from the last entry I played. With this, and the fact that 2K is as greedy as they are with microtransactions, I don't recommend this game. It's utterly infuriating, and not in a good way. 

This game looks fantastic for a sports game, manages to create a good atmosphere for basketball fans, and has a wide variety of tasks and activities to do, but the core gameplay lacks a lot of the fundamentals of a good video game.

The gameplay is as fluid as my pee, and the animations seems to go well together.

positives:I +like the addition of the WNBA (my main reason for buying this game)
                   +edit and create expansion teams and uniforms,arenas
                  +I like my career mode.(but want to play in the WNBA as well) 
                   + I like my league(but WNBA needs to be fleshed out more)
                   +I like  create a player (but again they need to add WNBA players to it) 
                    + I like the music and presentaition and other audio effects.
 And the negatives -limited WNBA features.
                               -my team seems to be mainly a cash grab.
                              - you do not seem to be able to lock on players in some important modes(practice) and it is hard to learn the game when you can lock players in some modes and not others.
                              -no game manual or in game glossary to help you learn the game 
  ---------Final thoughts--------------------------------------------------------------
This game has a lot of potential and if the make NBA2k21 add full features to the WNBA that are in NBA (create a player ,my league,my carrier ,edit uniforms,hairstyles ,faces ,(voices ?)
able to make expansion teams that you can edit arenas,uniforms ect.

32,74839454,english,"OK this is my first time writing the review for NBA 2K series.  I have played NBA 2K franchise since 2K13. So  I will give you the review from me.

Pros :
1. Updated Roster : Well this is must be the advantage of buying the original version of game than the pirate. The update well i can say that the update is often when the real NBA roster make an Update. For example, when the Player in real NBA was traded, shortly after the trade, the player will be in the new team. For me this is very useful when you playing Quick Play.

2. Easier shot meter. I don't know how the people maybe against this, but for me NBA 2K20 is easier than the NBA 2K series before. Well, I'm mostly played this game for Quick Match and I can say this point is in my pros because I almost used all of the team available (include the WNBA) 

3. The Story in MyCarrer. So in MyCarrer we played as ""Che"" who was a Captain in the Bay City Team. Somehow I love the story. 

4. MyCarrer Stat : OK maybe this is kinda weird BUT you will never increase the meter in Team Takeover while you score the most point. For me, this is very good. You just cannot make point as much as you want but if you get the point from assists or from offensive rebound the takeover meter will increase. The summary is a lot of point is not to important for takeover the team. Team Takeover for me is when you useful for the team not just be the STAT PADDER

5. Updated Team Play : Well lets make a comparison between NBA 2K20 and NBA 2K18 (i dont buy NBA 2K19 because in that time my hardware was not support). I am using Dallas Mavericks NBA roster and have very significantly different in play style (or Team Play or Run Play or whatever it is called). In NBA 2K18 you will run the play mostly in first Option is the PF position. in NBA 2K20, you will run the play more equally (equally in this meaning of all player in the court will have the same proportion of play). 

Cons (Here comes)
1. MICROTRANSACTION : well this is mostly every player will know this game as the HIGH MICROTRANSACTION. You will be know when you go to Park in MyCarrer. Almost every player has 90++ overall rating and I don't know how the hell they can be fast in increasing the overall. Well I played the MyCarrer at least 50 hour and i got 83 rating for PF.

2. NETWORK CONNECTION : oh come on, 2K fix the connection in online session. I never played so smooth in every online session (MyTeam, Park, and anything who need connection with another player). Well in my case is the connection is when I make a Shot. The Shot Meter always delay and i dont know why.

SO LETS  GO TO THE CONCLUSION :
Why you must buy this :
1. Frequent Update Roster
2. Story of MyCarrer will be different every year
3. Gameplay will be different Every Year

Why you not buy this :
1. Played mostly for online play and want to increase the overall fast by MICROTRANSACTION
2. Don't have a stable connection for Online (or at least have bad connection)

Advice
*when you play the MyCarrer, just follow the team play. If you want to be star of the team just follow it at first. Don't be hurry for be a star. Increase the minute playing by obey the team play. The easier is you must turn on the run play setting (I forgot the name) and just follow that. If you follow that, it will be a good play.

33,74838662,english,"See all those negative reviews? Well, here's one more to add to that list.
Bought it at 90 something % discount. Still not recommended to purchase. The game is worse than every iteration of the game since my previous purchase (2k17) and that version has been worse that the version before it. 2k is literally the only developer who manages to release a new game every year that is WORSE than the previous year and still manage to sell. 

So what's worse?
-AI is even worse now, half the fucking time when you're driving your moronic AI teamates will.... run up into you, blocking you and bringing a double team. Doesnt matter if you have a full 5-out team, they will INSIST on running into you. Call a pick and they will HEDGE for the opposing team and prevent you from driving. 
-Reverse is true on defense. When opponents do a pick, good luck running through two picks, one of which might be an illegal screen done by your own teammate.
-Everything is worse. Everything is tuned to be more VC focused, and no way to earn VC easily. And even if you earn the VC well enough with enough gameplay, the gameplay itself is still shittier than previous iterations. Mycareer mode limitations prevent you from even creating NBA star level players even if you max everything out. Wont be able to recreate AD, KD, Lebron, or whatever guy you wanna play as in mycareer because ""competitive play"" which doesnt really exist because cheaters/hackers galore. 

TL;DR: bad game even at 9x% discount. Dont even bother spending 5 bucks to buy this game. I spent 5 bucks and 29 hours just so you dont have to and can instead spent it on ice cream, popcorn, or bacon. And you will definitely enjoy any of those stuff more.

35,74838207,english,"Haven't really played many current gen sports games, but this does not inspire confidence in the genre. About as cashgrabby as the sims, only with the sims, at least you aren't forced into a horrible online mode, and the cashgrabbing isn't as pervasive. 

Single player mode is forced online, and everything costs VC which you can buy for real money, or spend several hours of your life trying to earn in order to come close to having a competitive chance. Everything from your character's attributes to the clothes they wear costs this currency and the kicker is they've hidden a lot of the customisation behind the online gameplay, forcing you to grind not only VD but also 'rep' points to unlock things like animations and rides and customisation options for your court. 

Basically all the fun is taken out of Single player mode, and stashed behind a paywall. Want to ride a skateboard around the neighborhood? Not only do you have to unlock it by playing online games until you grind enough rep levels, but you also have to grind about sixty to seventy thousand VC points to buy one. And the VC you get for doing things is abysmal. If you skip the story part you get placed into a team of your choosing but only make 500VC per game, without factoring in any bonuses. Otherwise you might start with something like 750VC per game. Even if you get a thousand per game that's still sixty games worth of VC you're trading in for one skateboard. Clothes cost anywhere between a few hundred to several thousands of VC, and you can't find shoes for less than a few thou. It's done this way to encourage people to pay real $$ of course, but it's infuriating nevertheless. They dangle special events and lottery spinner things in front of you, to keep you thinking and hoping you could get a big pay-out, but the most I ever won was a few hundred VC.

Then there's the team mode, and if you thought the moneygrabbing bull stopped in the career mode, you thought wrong. Instead of just letting you make a team and maybe go through a season, train the players and stuff and sort of play this sports sim, it's basically a card game where you can buy cards with (you guessed it) real money (if you want of course. You can always grind for hours and hours instead). 

There's another mode where you take control of as many teams as you want, in a league, and play up to the championship. This is like the only mode that has no online and nothing you can really buy, It's also the least polished and most time-consuming. Though it's the one that gives you the most freedom, basically. You get to edit players and their attributes and stuff, and teams, from their names to their stadiums. it's really closer to team mode than team mode is. Team mode you draw cards and pick your best ones and hope you get enough contract extensions to cover another game (because each game is a whole contract year basically, and you have each player card for a limited # of games, unless you put an unlimited contract on them, which are rare and expensive af, as you can probably imagine). 

It's not all cons, there's a few pros. The voice acting is great from most of the actors (the basketball players are about as good as you can expect, I suppose). Some characters are better than others (Isa is great. The agent is barf) though. The graphics are good and the visuals are pretty nice for the most part. The story is decent but there's a lot of cringe. Music is meh. Not my type, really, but not really bad either, apart from the odd artist I dislike. 

Overall, it's not a horrible game but it's nowhere near 'good'. The single player mode being online was a huge mistake. The VC system is ridiculous too. Lag is a big issue. But the main problem with the game is that it's just not fun. So much boring, time-consuming grinding. So much is locked away to push the VC-buying through the online stuff, which is dead anyway because of just how horrible it's implemented in the first place. 

You've barely got anybody to play with in my country and those you do find, wont touch you unless you have spent dozens of hours grinding your overall first. So before you can grind online you need to grind offline in other modes unless you want to tank your player's chances in the league for good with your terrible starting stats. It's just ridiculous.

I can't rec this game to anybody. Not even masochists.",1598278991,1598278991,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198043774069,157,6,90677,16132,43390,1602052966

65,74752061,english,"So I am gonna review the park aspect of the game since that's all I played.

So if you're gonna try to play park legit you are gonna have a bad time. I would say 99% of the players on park cheat and modify their stats, badges and rep. Although people do cheat to have max attributes and badges most keep their height and wingspan legit as long as you are a PG, SG, SF and PF. Centers are always 7'3 with speed and handles and if you do not have a center you will lose 95% of the time. You will run into people who modify their wingspan beyond what is possible but it doesn't happen so often and most people get off when they see one of those cheaters.

Now like I mentioned everyone modifies their rep to Legend because it gives you VIP spot if you're not in a squad. That means if you do not modify your rep you will get kicked out of your spot A LOT so be patient in finding a game or get a squad going.

Now the player base. The player is base is freaking garbage 9/10 times the people you play against are just terrible. Squad or no squad. Makes the console noobs look like they are actually decent. Because of all the cheating these trash players think they can play Park like MyCareer and just try to go through you and dunk or just spam dribbles just to miss while you never get the ball. I know it sounds the same like consoles but just imagine it ten times worse.

If your overall is not at least 90 you will get in the way and that's the honest truth maybe if your 3 is high enough to hit consistently you'll be a spot up shooter. Anything else if you don't cheat you better just give up.

If you're gonna play Park legit do yourself a favor and buy the  console version instead if you have one, if not you're not gonna have fun. Also you're gonna hear constant helicopter if you find a game which is also not fun.

Other than that the park runs smooth at 60 FPS and is way superior to consoles obviously even the gameplay.

5/10 because most online players in 2k are so bad that even with cheating they are worse would not recommend. PEOPLE CANNOT AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE IN THIS GAME. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LEARN HOW TO PLAY DEFENSE.

Your stats are trash and you'll never be able to hit shots in any circumstance because the game is scripted to make it hard for you unless you dump money on VC to buy better stats. It's the same copy and pasted stories with a twist and your character HAS to sound black no matter what. Equality means nothing in this game because it caters to a 76% black audience so you gotta have a fucking white dude with blonde hair and blue eyes sound like fucking Kimbo Slice in his teens.

40,74766641,english,"When I saw the ""Mixed Reviews"", I decided to steer clear of this game, but then I saw the 92% off deal and changed my mind. I will say this for the game, the My Player story mode was a lot of fun. I really liked the struggle of moving up the draft order. However, all of my enjoyment of the game ended when that story mode ended. I read mentions of the AI cheating, which I normally would assume would be the response of an angry gamer who lost. I've been that guy plenty of times, but it turns out the AI actually DOES cheat in this game. Honestly, after the story mode ended, I noticed how the games fluctuated with one consistency, my teammates were terrible. You could have star players on your team, but then you sit on a bench, and any lead you might have completely falls apart. 28 point lead? How about we take that away and put you 4 points behind the opposing team? Are you playing smart and picking apart the defense and  getting yourself in position? Well, now your character will shift as slow as the tectonic plates, allowing God and everyone else hit you and deny you the point. The ""Report Card"" will even chide you with a ""Bad Shot Choice"", because how dare you not assume the game would cheat to win. It all comes across as an obvious cash grab, because it forces people who want to make their characters better to pay money for VC. The game even tries to wrangle you into this during MyPlayer. This is ridiculous. Do not buy this game if you want to actually enjoy a basketball experience. Frankly, I would avoid buying most Sports games. The developers recognize that they have a audience that they can count on to buy their games every year, and they will milk as much money out of you as humanely possible. I will make a point to never buy any 2K games again.",1598166346,1598166346,False,9,0,0.634898066520690918,0,True,False,False,76561198007566566,158,2,1549,0,1549,1598165732

50,74615308,english,"I've only played the myplayer campaign so far, and a little bit of mypark but i think its an improvement from 2k19's. I haven't played the Team mode or anything else yet, so i won't be reviewing it.

Pros
-It controls very similarly to 2k19(atleast with a controller)
-The customization has increased with the new mybuild system
-It feels like you get more VC in the story( i was on pro and was getting 600-700 vc per story mission)

Neutral
-The myplayer story is very short.(beat it in less than 9 hours)
-The achievements can only be unlocked after beating the story(which isn't so bad i guess due to it being short).

Cons
-The cutscenes so far can be very long(one of the first ones was 12 minutes).
-The potential system or whatever it's called makes it so if you didn't set your potential for certain attributes, then you can't increase them at all
-The graphics really didn't improve much
-It took a while to actually get a decent FPS, i had to switch graphics cards and change my computers mode to high performance to get 60 FPS on ultra(which i dont usually have to do).
-Hacking is very easy to do it seems. I've ran into several people that were hacking(some had stretched bodies which was funny), only experienced this in mypark though.



I'd say the game is worth it for $4.80, considering 2k19 is going to be dead soon. I'll update the review with more once i play the online and league.",1597931633,1598054427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198274939699,251,42,1607,0,260,1600791213

I've tried all of the fixes I've seen online. none of them work, in fact they just tank the game down to about 10 fps.

the devs over at 2K games are actually genius, because I have to spend about 4 hours going through pointless dramatics just to be drafted and actually start getting subbed out. so this issue is not even apparent until after you cannot refund the game. fuck this game, fuck the devs for allowing this to still go unpatched for over a year, and fuck the Lakers. this is what will cause people to start pirating your shitty games.",1598047762,1598047762,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198064645003,504,3,4162,0,549,1599186235

MyPlayer can't hit wide open slightly late/early shots with a 70 overall, but another player with a 60 overall can hit 70% contested shots. I really want to know where is the logic in this game because so far after many attempts i have failed to find it. Every team plays with the ball very selfishly not willing to pass to me while im open in paint. Every time i ask a player to pass the ball to me, i get ignored with no obvious reason behind it. As an examle, Trae Young can hold the ball for 8 seconds with nothing happening and he causes no violation, but if i hold it for 8 seconds, i get 6 different violations and my score goes from C to F+. Hitting a green shot is rarer than your parents buying you a Bugatti for your 16th birthday. Defense of the AI is non-existent. If i go for a layup i get guarded by the whole team like im a national threat with a bomb in my hand meanwhile a SF from the opposite team can score a 3 while being wide open because why not. The AI teammates block you while you are trying to get to the player you are guarding while he is moving at 300 miles per hour and then its your fault and you get a defensive breakdown. Upgrading your player does as much good as drinking acid. The movement is garbage, the animations are trash, and i could very well see why Ronny 2K would sell the game for 4 euros. I am honestly surprised at why would new players buy it. Even 4 euros is expensive for a game thats about as good as a game developed by a rookie programmer. I mean hey there must be a few positives right? Sike you thought. If this game is ""good"" then im also 8 foot 9 irl. I dont know why i thought that it would be a good idea to purchase this game.

It's 2K19 with small changes, some for the better. What I liked the most is that now we have a visual clue when the ball is less protected and we can steal it without fouling. Also, in MyCareer you can choose what badges you'd like to unlock after you've gathered enough points to earn one. 

And there's the addition of the WNBA _ but since I only play MyCareer and MyGM, I probably won't play with/against those teams, so for me it's a useless change, although a welcome one. 

The worst is the lack of good stories in the offline modes. The prelude to MyCareer is short and bland, despite a good performance by Idris Elba; in 2K19, there were more characters and way more drama _ now, we've barely any journey. Also, in 2K19 MyGM had a long and also dramatic story, and now there's none! And we could create a team from scratch (I'll miss the Bronx Hard Ones, with Pickle Rick as logo); now you have to choose from one of the real-world franchises. Boring.  

It's also weird that we get accolades notifications during the games, but they're nowhere to be seen afterwards.

Graphics - It is a one year old game which looks okay at ultra. As a PC player expect Console quality graphics.

Music - I am not a fan of these tracks but some of them are decent and none of them are too bad.

Controls - The controls may not be the worst part about this game but they are horrible. I use a wireless Xbox One controller but I've tried wired as well and it will always feel like your playing truck simulator rather than in the NBA. I could understand the tilting and skidding and floating if it was at least realistic. The AI defense simply floats around blocking your every attempt to get in. They have some kind of speed boost making your defending trash against them.

Fun - No this is a nice game that becomes tedious when you realize there is a business model to why your character is so trash.  I recognized it because I've played a lot of MMORPGs so it's familiar. Your character has semi hidden stats that level up over time. You also have the obvious stats that you can pay real money to increase. 

I spent $30 on this game total and got through the my career portion of the game despite some of the retarded work out mini-games.  When you get to the NBA those hidden stats become so damn pronounced with every even Centers running circles around you. What's more the hidden attributes of the AI forces you to miss shots even if they are 6ft away from you because they have intimidater. 

Breaking the AI ankles even with 75 handling, 50 lateral movement and 80 post movement is impossible with the hidden stats being considered. It isn't that the AI is that good, it's just that your character rolls like they had hip replacement surgery this morning.  Couple that with that everyone simply goes faster than you and you have people who are past the half court catching up to you on the paint before you can complete a half roll to lay up.

These hidden stats makes for the experience as a player totally new to NBA 2k completely unfun and more frustrating than anything else. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the obvious buy gold coins options to make your character stronger option at the upgrade screen.

Conclusion - If you are new to 2k like I am I cannot recommend this game even at the 90% off rate. This is not the sport game for you - there is no tutorial mode or any hand holding even on rookie difficulty. If that's your jam then good luck - the reward of winning a game isn't even there because I gain 5% or less xp per game as I can't make 3's, can't make inside shots, can't dribble, can't pass correctly 5v5 (Whole other issue here), can't defend, and can't have fun. 

Perspective - I am coming at this game for the experience of playing a NBA game and being a player - it's more like an RPG for me, what I got is something that takes itself FAR too seriously as a tournament game and is built assuming you mean to play it competitively.  I have no intention of playing online or going against other people. Because of that this game is not for me.",1597959417,1597959417,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False,76561198042096878,256,38,4152,9,1212,1601048423

I have yet to test the graphical limits of this game because my PC is almost a decade old and itching for an upgrade, but with the right setting tweaks, I can run this on 1080p low shader setting and no special effects at 60fps with minimal stutters due to CPU bottleneck. Also, this game is probably only worth buying if it's on sale (which I did) and you only want to play myleague or mycareer, or on a physical preorder because of the free poster you can get with the Legend edition.

PC UPGRADE UPDATE: I've finally tried the online portion of the game, and it's just terrible. I have a good fiber optic internet connection, but since the servers are not even optimized for my country, it takes probably like 250ms to move my player or do anything.

62,74246589,english,"I hate this game.

If you've never played any basketball game with a gamepad, nor are you a keen console player, like me - don't buy this game.  You will be frustrated 99% of a time. I don't know how the others play it, apparently you need to be an experienced PS/Xbox player, which I am not. I'm 22 hours in, training after every single game, watching youtube tutorials, playing on Rookie difficulty, and I still suck. It is fcking IMPOSSIBLE to score a basket. And it is impossible to play any good if you don't want to pay. Because leveling up is a long and unforgiving grind.

You start as a 60/100 stat player. So if you get in a strong team, you will be left on a bench 90% of a time. And the time you play simply isn't enough to get a good practice. If you get in a weak team instead, you will play often, but lose all the time. So the only option you have is to pay to boost yourself up to 80/100, and you would suck anyway.

2kU - training sucks. As you play as other players like Lebron or Durant, and they have DIFFERENT timings, and are 99/100 players, compared to you. So they feel differently. You time their shots well, and when you get back to playing as yourself, all confident, you can't time your shots. Stupid

Dribbling is fucking impossible. I don't understand, there are so many buttons on dualshock, why the hell the right controller does everything? You dribble with it, and you shoot with it. You wanted to do a crossover, and yet you start to shoot in the middle of a pitch. Whyyyy???? Just make an R1 button 'dribbling mode' where you won't start shooting until you release it.

And the sheer amount of tiny little stupid details just blows my mind. For example - X is a usual pass, O - is a low pass, so I'm thinking, X button is lower than O, so it is logical to bind them the opposite way - X - low pass, O - usual pass. Sounds good. Only now, Not only passes swaped, but whole game controls too! So now, O - is okay button, and X - is back button. Do you get it?

93,74146405,english,"First time playing a 2K game since the 17 release and honestly, it's pretty bad

It's sad to see that the graphics are the only improvements I see that they have made over the past years. Buying an annual sports game release and only seeing better lighting and a roster update is a slap in the face for the fans. 

Gameplay is horrendous. At moments shooting is smooth but then at other times shooting almost a perfect shot would miss no matter how close you are, whether or not you are being covered by an opponent. Passing the ball as well can be confusing at times as well. I'll try to pass to my teammates and it'll either pass to someone that i don't want to have the ball, or they just straight up don't pass. Defense although just as terrible, I don't have much of a problem with because it's at the very least somewhat consistent. 

Besides exhibition games and occasional multiplayer against friends, the only other mode I tried getting into was MyCareer. 

MyCareer in my eyes is a failed attempt at trying to be something they aren't. I get that they want to make it seem more personal, and although I haven't seen or played past MyCareer modes, they have to trash the story aspect. It's so awkward to make a player that looks like you, give them a name, then be thrown into some god awful story plot that came from High School Musical with the dude that physically looks like the player you made, but now they gave him a voice that makes me sound like I'm 20 skin tones darker (I'm a vary pale man), the announcers don't even say the name I gave my player and default to the story name, and now the personality your ""new"" player has doesn't even match what you were going for. And if they want to stay on this route, can the voice actor playing us not be awful? In fact, a lot of the voice actors are pretty bad. It would be so much tolerable to play if they had a good story and better actors and writers.

I have done my best to avoid multiplayer (MyTeam) due to all of the push back it got from fans and critics. If you want to see what multiplayer is like then just search it up.

2K use to be a well respected company and people are willing to give them a chance to regain that respect but their greed is what moves the company now. The fact that they still are selling 2K17 for $60 tells you enough about what they care for more. I only bought this game for $8 on sale and I'm still unsure of whether I made the right choice to buy this.

[i]2K[/i] has always been my go-to NBA Sim. I’ve always and only bought [i]2K[/i] for casual exhibition games and [i]MyGM[/i] playthroughs and never really dug into [i]MyCareer[/i]. I decided to go and really do it this year. I didn’t really hate the grind that much because I personally enjoy doing so and I thought it was fast enough to at least get to 85~90 without spending a single dime plus getting your badges up and running early is fairly manageable to me. But for most people who can’t spend 100+ hours in games, I can definitely see why it still feels like a legit grind. What I find ridiculous is that it has the greediest microtransaction system in any online game I’ve messed around with and it has been a horrible cycle of deliberate money-grabbing each year! I haven’t even touched [i]MyTeam[/i]. The fact that they always price 2K games at a full AAA tag like they are actual new games, which clearly are not, and still has this much ‘Casino’ inside is just straight up BS. Everything that makes any game enjoyable deserves praise, but this has been a blatant cash grab for multiple years now. I won’t talk about the good stuff and I’m giving it a negative feedback just to be on the player-base’s side who are clearly being milked for a long time already, with zero regard towards its loyalty. 

Easily one of the hungriest publishers of the last few years. This could be my last 2K game if they continue to push this predatory business model.

MC you cannot simulate to next appearance.
Turn the frame rate over 60 the game itself starts to slow down, so 1 second takes about 5 seconds.
Loading screens just frozen end game till it loads to the next area.
Lag out during practice. I'm the only human in the game world how am I timing out?
The story is over in about 3 hours only about 5 games, compared to last year 7-8 hour and whole campain with g-leage team. (the intro/outro and credits were about the same as the whole story)

10,73773993,english,"2K is known to be money grabbers, and that's no exception with NBA 2K20. MyCareer and MyTeam are littered with microtransactions that make the game pay to win, so it's no wonder people hack to make their guys have slenderman arms and 1 inch tall. Advertisements are plastered all over the game, whether it's in MyCareer or even in the loading screens. MyTeam by around January and Feburary becomes stale when they start pumping out Galaxy Opal players like it's candy. 

HOWEVER, there's something to be said about the presentation and the best game mode in the NBA 2K series, MyLeague. When 2K tries, it can produce amazing results. There are locker room cutscenes, interviews with players and coaches and our favorite broadcasters Shaq, Kenny and Ernie. MyCareer has hours of brilliantly animated cutscenes and voice acting, which is definitely an improvement from the atrocious voice lines from NBA 2K15 that sounded like they were reading a book out loud in English class. The cyberfaces, while not the best on some players like 2010's Kobe and rookie LeBron, are very accurate and detailed. There's tons of replayability in MyLeague. Take someone from the 90's and see how they would play in the modern NBA, remove everyone who makes the All-NBA each season and see how terrible the league gets, put in your 99 overall created player and watch him break all of the records, whatever. There's so many possibilities in MyLeague and tons of outcomes for you to observe. Plus the simulation speed is way faster than on console. Player and team's stats are in-depth and advanced, which is a refresher from most sports games like modern Madden games who have basic stats. You have to think about what kind of impact each move makes, from releasing a player to signing a team owner.

33,73726353,english,"Amazing animations. An enjoyable, almost thrilling MyCareer story, which feels more progressive than the earlier approaches to MyPlayer. Some games will make you actually watch the AI and skip hitting the skip button -- if you're into it.

But it feels clunky. Animations are long and will prevent you from performing your ideas on court. At the beginning of your career, your Turnover PG will be an abomination to look at and you won't understand why your character is not jumping to block the shots, properly. That's supposed to be the sense of progression. So, you're an NBA player with no know-how to block a shot or steal a ball, but your stat increases will magically grant you that intuition. Rebounds... oh, that's a long topic, but let's say if you want a challenge and you choose Hall of Fame difficulty, and you also play anything else than a 4 or a 5, you will have games with 0 rebounds with maximum effort.

You find your character committing court violation, while you were pulling the analog ""away"" from the line. You see your teammate leading the fast break, followed by your lob, only to see the ball flying through his hands, into an innocent bystanders head (which aren't very animate anyway). You see your 7'1"" #5 not being able to box out the opposing #1 or protect the rim, while if he's a star player he'll usually grab ORBDs and dunk it.

I got drafted by Bulls in my first MyCareer attempt and thought it was the team. So, I traded. Still the same issues. The problem is, as you raise the AI difficulty, that doesn't affect your teammates. And it creates some disgusting scenes. They will still fail to find the open man, or grab boards, sometimes even nail open shots.

The progression system feels like an endless grind and you do not dare start a new career, unless you're a vivid NBA 2K player. The badge system sounds amazing but you find yourself spending copper badges on half of them, because they sound like the stuff to make a solid NBA player, but it poorly reflects the game and feels very algorithmy.

I hope to see the KB24 covered NBA 2K21 to be better than this, as I've been playing this series for many years now and would be thrilled to see it flourish and improve.

Its a very fun game and I buy it almost every year. The game isn't without its faults, however innovation wise NBA2k and visual concepts used to be at the forefront of sports based games but due to the current change with in the industry regarding the growing needs to further extort the players for even more money, they have been rather lacklustre in their attempts to keep doing so . To finish this rant, if you want to pick up this game at a sale, go for it but just try and avoid picking it up at full price.

Edit: I have played over 1,000 more hours of 2k and because of this Steam wants me to revise my review. The shooting I have grown accustom to, in this 2k you will miss many more shots than the previous 20 entries, this can be extremely frustrating. MyCareer is the best it's been in this game, unfortunely, by month 3 the park was overrun by hackers, sitting at 95 overall and with slenderman arms. This is achieved using ""Cheat Engine"", a program I personally haven't used since 2010 when I was hacking Wizard101. Explain to me why this same exploit works in NBA 2K20, a less than a year old triple A title. MyTeam is by far the best gamemode this year, cards like GOAT Kobe, Steph Curry, and Larry Bird add a lot of time-killing grinding, and are likely why I have 1k hours on this game. These cards are outclassed, naturally, by the GOAT cards in packs that you can pay real money for for a chance at them. Packs this year are more expensive than they have ever been, and the odds seem worse than previous entries. MyLeague/GM is a joke, it has been the exact same game mode for 4 years in a row.

I don't know if I'm the minority here, but I don't want to grind a ridiculous amount of hours to pull my player out of the depths of mediocrity. 

I then play through the entire playoffs and carried the Blazers to a title while averaging 50+ points through the playoffs (my highest scoring game being an 88 point tripple double). Did I get any extra VC for this at any time? Lol naahhhhhh. Instead I got a sound bug that made it so I couldn't even half enjoy the awkward ass cut scenes after winning the finals. Oh that reminds me, I L O V E all of awkward silences in every cut scene, not to mention the post game show interviews are cringey as fuck. 

At the end of all this I just wanted to do what I've always done: go to the past champions page and see my team named as the champions for the 2019-2020 season and my name for the finals MVP next to it...but of course they...removed it???? Honestly it seems like the devs are so out of touch. Everything feels so half assed and they've actually removed a ton of single player features from previous games. Of course, it seems like they are more focused on the furthering the competitive multiplayer scene, which I can understand at this point. But at the same time they seem to have no problem with blatantly neglecting the players who only want a single player experience out of this game. 

This will be the last 2k I purchase. Time to go back to the good ol days of 2k10 when I could make my player a 7'10 freak of nature through hex edit and just have fun without being spammed by 2k2v and ads every other step I reluctantly take through the neighborhood that I'm forced to be in.

8,60324773,english,"The Good:

The gameplay is absolutely fantastic. The AI system is the best they ever made and the simulation is the closest to real life, if you know what you're doing. The dribbling system is the most improved aspect this year. Breaking down defenders requires skill which is satisfying especially when you make the right dribble move or play. Playing in the post is also fun although I noticed how you can easily make baskets in the paint compared to last year. MyLeague is easily is the best game mode even though it's also the most neglected feature by the developers.

The Bad:

The microtransactions makes the online aspect of this game a pay-to-win system. Grinding feels worthless due to this fact, and there are also tons of hackers in MyNeighborhood which makes things even more frustrating. Some of the most basic in-game settings are missing (saving the camera setting as an example), and instead of fixing the game, the developers kept doling out trash items and sponsored events on MyCareer to make more profit. Oh, there are also unskippable ads as a cherry on top.

The Verdict:

This is the best basketball simulation game in the market (I mean it's pretty much a monopoly right now). This game has tons of potential but the outright greediness of 2K makes the overall experience sh*tty for the fans. This game is more about doing business rather than simply making it for the love of basketball.

They have some troubles programing but you didnt notice if you dont press attention. 

Sometimes the gameplay get bored when u have to make shots alone only to make them or with distance from another player. If someone is guarding you, you have 5% to make that shot! That Cut the emotion of do shots when someone is guarding you. (Im not talking shots from the pain)

Better Than NBA 2k19 at least the career mode. 
Better Graffics too.  
Better Gameplay.

I was lucky enough to not have to pay full price for this.

Items in the store are ridiculously priced. A pair of shorts can run you as much as 15,000 VC. 15,0000!!!!!!! A skateboard or any mode of transportation to get around the neighborhood faster than the regular speed of molasses going uphill? Oh thats not too expensive, just a cool 30,000 VC or more.

43,73271370,english,"I find it pretty funny how many people wrote negative reviews saying how it was the worst game and waste of time ever.... then you look at the hours... and they keep playing it more and more... dudes be writing its ""worst game ever"" and then play 40 more hours after the review, or the complaints its not worth $15 after playing 70+ hours in less then a month.

If you do play it, check out the WNBA part, it actually is pretty cool, and check out one of their games on TV or in person its become a pretty exciting league. 

Game feels a lot like a slow progression over the last few years, I usually play these on console, but the PC ports are getting better and better (except for cheaters are more common on PC but that is every game right?). I think its the best version yet, the story not so much, its unique and interesting but eh... what do you expect right? so its ok. The game play though I think is getting better, I felt the shooting is getting better, the movements feel better then previous years(once you learn them). While trying to get better the game does make things worse; stats/badges are more important then ever, height is more important(physics of game blocking and covering %), learning plays, animations can make things impossible to counter or stop. You just have to except the limitations of the game and what they are, and that is where at times it becomes thrustrating, how many players know they can turn off the shot meter and release it based on the animation and get a increase to the shot %? Because the game is RNG and everything is % based, which means yes the perfect shot can miss, the worst can go in... playing better and having better cards just increases those %. 

The microtransactions? yeah its in your face... spending money will make it easier, but you can easily play without spending a dime again, it can all be earned slowly, but still sucks. The less offline stuff you do the less its a issue, multiplayer obviously is impacted a lot by $$$$... so it is what it is. I don't think its the worst game out there in that regard, but it is pretty bad, I think madden and some of MMO titles out there are worse. That said it doesnt bother me in this one. 

Anyway core game is a small but nice step over previous years, lot of things to do, huge game, lot of challenges, but in the end plagued with predatory microtransactions, so your mileage may vary, but you can indeed play single player without it impacting you much at all.",1595699516,1595699516,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561197971654299,301,20,16715,0,11677,1598503540

Why a business tactic that is designed to hurt the consumer works, I don't know, but what I do know is that this game, and this franchise as of late, is not good at all. Sure, it can be fun, especially when you're playing with someone else, but that's primarily because you're playing the game because you like basketball and there aren't other NBA basketball competitors out there. With that being said, that is why I continue to play - there aren't any other basketball/NBA games with a community this size, and because during a time with no basketball or other sports, it fills a void, and thus, I am addicted to even the slightest drip of NBA content. Although MyTeam is no longer fun to me, and MyCareer is exciting only half of the time, the game can keep you interested with MyLeague - the only reason I really still play. And, if you want to pay that price tag for BasketballGM with better graphics, go for it. But even MyLeague is annoying. This may be a jumbled mess of my ramblings, but overall, I would say you're better off not buying this game and supporting this company. If you do, don't buy it from an official retailer. For now, I cannot recommend this game, and hopefully, that'll change with other entries, but I don't think it will.

TL;DR: Constant crashes, horrible AI, bad animations (everything movement in the game is animation based, and of course, every animation is too long and not user friendly), bad Virtual Currency system (game is near unplayable for your MyCareer character if you don't buy VC for him), and even more.

They have to 'balance' the players you'll be matching up against in the park so you can't just play by yourself and have a guy who can hit threes and take it to the rack. Even though these players exist and have existed in the NBA since time immemorial, it's now almost an impossibility due to the allotment of attributes.

Not only will your team mates NOT pass you the ball when you call for it, the game will actually penalize you for asking for the ball....in a game where the grind to improve your character is Korean MMO levels of stupid.

Klunky, sloppy, pigs on ice handling, and riddled with horrible design choices.

You come out of college as a first round draft pick.....who's stats are all 40 points lower than anyone you'll be playing!!!!!  Thanks for putting me up against that shooting guard, with 91 speed, and then taking points AWAY from me because I couldn't cover him.  It's just beyond stupid game design, to the point of infuriating.

To add insult to injury, in no particular order:

Career mode:  Doing pretty well?  Time to end that.  There is a script in place for career mode, and you WILL follow it.  Doing too well?  Time to make you suck for a few games.  Yah, the Lakers shot 36%, and James missed 4 free throws in a row down the stretch.  Your usual 35 points a game ya...well...you got 9 this time, sorry.

Being benched when winning:  Same as above...doing too well?   You clawed your way back to a 4 point lead?....time to sit on the bench, when you come back, there will be 4 seconds left, and you're down by 20.

Predatory gaming at it's worst:  The INSANE badge and exp grind is such an obvious pay to play grab, in a full priced game, it's beyond shameful.  This pay to win is worse than most F2P games I've played.

I put some time into this game, because I missed my refund window, covid, and because there are parts of the game that are great.  The character creation and development COULD be amazing, if it wasn't tied to such a horrible and infuriating mess of a money grab, coupled with heavy handed AI and scripted outcomes.

This game would be so much fun if it encouraged rerolling and playing different characters, and if the players actions actually mattered in the outcome of anything.  As it stands, it's one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.  The idea of playing multiple builds with the level of grind it takes for a character is just.....beyond bad game design.  They have missed every single good point about this game, and actively destroyed them along the way to money grab heaven.

AI is completely braindead.
Your all star teammates cant hit a shot, I play on the warriors, like 30 games into a season, Curry is barely shooting  30% from 3, I have gold dimer, give him an open look and he FADES on wide open shots instead of setting his feet. Same goes for Klay. They instantly get the ball and toss up some bullshit that will never go in. There is this dumbass animation this year where ball goes in almost down to the net and then rims out. It happens like 10 times a game. I tried playing on HoF, Superstar, Allstar. The same shit.

Enemy CANT PROTECT THE PAINT AT ALL. I can have 100% FG. They dont protect the paint at all, but trying to get a 3 is insanely hard, they protect it like their life depends on it, speedboosting doing glitchy animations just to stick to you.

Also the game has CONSTANT Crash To Desktop for example when viewing roster in My League.

86,72898427,english,"Saw Michael Jordan's ""The Last Dance"" and instantly had a basketball itch. I was really weary about buying this because all of the negative comments in here, but, as a newcomer to the series and a BIG RPG fan, I'm quite enjoying the ""MyCareer"" mode. I actually cared about what happens with the characters and felt quite connected to the team. Still getting used to the controls (only 5 hours in at the time of this posting), but playing the Career mode is actually teaching me how to play properly and went from a D- player to a B+ by the end of the draft (remember, I'm a newcomer so go easy on me).

I was also weary on buying because many people talked about it being glitchy, but I haven't found any so far and have always had a steady frame rate.

TLDR: If you're like me and this is your first NBA2K game, go for it, (wait for a sale if you want) just remember that most of the reviews are from people that have bought past titles and are comparing them (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that it's not relevant to someone who hasn't played the other ones)",1595083265,1595083265,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False,76561198092679464,176,7,505,0,333,1596252901

98,72776208,english,"The lack of competition with other basketball games made 2K too comfortable and rest on their past successes.

- MyCareer mode is still ok, but the story is not interesting nor decent, like every single edition.
- Parks and other Online game modes have lag, delay, server connection problems, overall the online experience is bad, the community is toxic, so those game modes have no purpose if you don't have a squad.
- Ultimate Team is solid, challenges are good, not too deversified but I guess 2K couldn't think out of the box for this one.

The main problems with this game in my opinion are the AI and the animations. Team mates don't execute plays, centers with no 3pt shot stay in corners, others are missing a lot of WIDE open shots. Screens don't trigger / animate like they should, opponents go through the screen as soon as it is set. And i'm not even bringing up the times the ball goes through hands, arms, heads, with no change in trajectory, the times you dive for a loose ball, grab the ball and then slide out of bounds, the reach-ins that either immediatly fouls the opponent or just does nothing to bother him. The times you have a clear path to the hoop on a fast break or penetration and your player just trigers a pullup in the paint instead of a lay up or dunk.

A lot of small glitches and bugs that could improve the game drasticly in my opinion. It's in the quality of the details that you can really see how good something is. NBA 2K20 is not one of those things, especially if you consider it's basicly the same game every years sinds new gen consoles.

Good overall game but way too overpriced for what it actually is. 2K has been recycling their game for over 3-4 years now, so there is no way this should be 60-70 bucks each year.


Ps: BTW, fuck 2K for always giving no shits about the PC community and always giving us a worse version of the game compared to consoles. Fuck them and Ronny for false advertising the park and other features of their game. I paid 13 bucks for this game and won't ever pay more than 15 bucks for a game that is filled with micro-transactions, pay-to-win mentality, bad servers, no fucks given about the feedback of 2k players / community.",1594889943,1594889943,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198047721557,33,1,18797,1933,5483,1602052782

Now lets get into the juicy stuff here:

Horrible Moderation: You have some of the most lazy Moderators in the world, working for this company, they simply will give you a macro or ignore you, basically it.

Crazy amount of hackers: Each year no matter what, theres going to be hackers, they do nothing at all about them and infact your most likely more often then not going to get warned or banned yourself for trying to report these hackers, its insane.

Censorship: Almost anything you say bad about the company or moderation staff will be censored near instantly, they don't want future new players or players coming from consoles to learn the terrible secrets that NBA 2K series is completely ruined by the amount of cheating, hacking and exploiting on PC, the moment you point something out like this anywhere else, you will be censored and most likely warned. Sad but true and the funny thing is, they protect the hackers like no tomorrow. 

Overall I would say do not invest money into NBA 2K or any of their PC games, even investing it into console enables them to keep printing the same game each year with zero anti-cheat and the worst support possible, the real only way to make a change is to do what? Protest their horrible services and treatment of customers. 

But everyone can do as they please, take this however you want but this review should be a pretty clear warning that they do not care and will not change.

I don't really enjoy The Neighborhood and MyPlayer at the moment, but it's not that bad. It's more of mediocre and I don't really care for it as much as MyTeam.

Don't buy this game. 

This game is beyond grindy and controls feel like there's a significant input lag when pressing buttons on my controller connected via usb. online requires me to unplug my mouse, keyboard, and keypad because there's no option in the game to switch inputs on the fly leading to a loss because I cannot move my MC on the court in neighborhood. Regarding the grind, it is insane how tedious it is to earn VC. It would've been fine if VC was used for cosmetics and the gambling aspects of the game, however it is also tied into character progression leaving you with a tough decision whether you want your character to ""git gud"" or not look broke as hell with the default clothes or even paying for the gambling to get better cards for myteam. The game constantly nudges you to pay for more VC which they constantly add the button to purchase VC when you're using VC to buy stuff. 

One of the most egregious moves 2K has implemented is to move MyCareer to online only, and it wasn't an accident. 2k knew the best way to entice players to pay for microtransactions is to make it online and have other players show off the cool and expensive items they've bought for their characters. You're not just worrying about how your character performs now, you're worried how your character looks to other players. For evidence, look no further than the 2k Neighborhood, where all the shops, gym, and training center are. In order to utilize those amenities, you must navigate yourself through the neighborhood, and walk by other players who look better than you in order to reach which ever facility you intend to visit. Sure you can try to avoid the neighborhood, however it is near impossible since you need to visit the shoe store for some shoe deals in mycareer, as well as the training facility where you can boost your stats by playing a couple of bad mini games.

So, let's talk about in game advertisements. Product placements are everywhere in this game, and when I say ""everywhere"" I really mean EVERYWHERE to the point where in a cutscene in mycareer you meet a representative for beats to which he asks the player to plug in beats in an interview. 2K was not subtle on the beats plug in, this game just advertised to me about certain beats headphones with active noise cancelling, to which I argue that my Sony WH-1000XM2s are just good enough for me with their amazing active noise cancelling which helps get me through this game, plus the Sony WH-1000XM2s has an ambient noise option which allows sounds from outside the headphones to pass through so you can hear and pay attention to your surroundings.(now wasn't that a good product placement? lol) This game is just a gargantuan advertisement that YOU PAY FOR.

This is my second 2k and it shows how little they care about the game. First of all this isn't nba 2k20 it's nba 2k19.2. Everything is basically  the same as 2k19. Mycarrer: The storyline is far less cringe than 2k19 and the new way to build your myplayer was a good new edit and that's pretty much the positiv. The negative on the other hand god damn.. The first seasone is just a long seasone of 2k trying to get you to buy VC. It's absolutely ridiculous how a player that's drafted into the best league on the planet and he can't shoot, dribble, shoot or even get a simple layup with just the smallest contact. The first 20-30 games is just absolute boredom of just grinding your player so he's at least decent. The nthe all star comes and it's pretty funny and the second half of the seasone is pretty fun. The playoffs is near and so is the awards. After the first seasone the mode becomes really boring. It's not even hard scoring 120 points. The AI is too bad and the pass the ball then run left and cut is absolutely game breaking. You need no iq and no skill to be good at myCareer you just need to grind for 2 weeks. The park is boring and the Rec center is pretty fun if you are 5 friends playing otherwise you'll just get a team of ball hogs. myTeam is what it is either you grind and will still be at a disadvantage after 100 of hours grinding. The mode basically begs you to pump in money into it. The cards are just too good and it takes out all the skill. They are also really unrealistic (like dribbling 3pt shooter shaq) The gameplay is nothing like basketball in myTeam. people just run around 6 feet outside the 3pt line and the shoots a deep three and ofcourse it hits because the cards are to op. I don't really play myLeague so i don't have a opinion i do play myGM tho. My experince of myGM was positiv i found it really fun but i haven't played any other myGM so i can't really compare it.

14,72543147,english,"If you bought it on sale good. BUT this game is a poster-boy/girl for in-game transactions. Almost any action or aspect of the game (mycareer) will need you to either grind for hours for just a small improvement or pay up for VC to actually play the game. As well this game may only have servers up for 2 years, so any of the effort may actually be for nothing. Also MyTeam is just about the same. Random RNG to see if you might get something useful, but in reality you just won't get jack.
MYCareer is also a heap of trash. The ""story"" is just a giant cringe. Playing is a chore. It really is just something to kill time with, with no real reward after even 10+ hours.
The AI is terrible. Even a ported Garry's Mod NPC could probably do better, EX: 90's level players brick layup after layup. A player known for inside play and grabbing boards will grab a rebound, dribble out to the three point line then hold the ball forever till lobbing it to a guard or forward to brick a 2-person covered three. It's as if 2K has never actually watched or played a game of basketball in their life. 
Also, while some people think that the shotstick is a skill-base thing, it's absolute BS. No matter how well you hold it or release it it's pretty much just RNG if you get lucky enough to get a green shot. (Also even with a ""badge"" to make the consequences of poorly timed shotstick usage minimal, you still brick shots randomly.) Seriously it's easier just to run around the AI on defense and hope you get a lucky layup to not be missed. 
Also, one final sidenote if you hate ads. you will certainly hate this game. It's one walking ad. No matter what you do all you see is ads for gatorade, shoes, or some other random thing.

TLDR: The game play is poor. Ingame currency is the pay-to-not-be-trash. Even on sale, don't waste your time.",1594532025,1594532025,False,2,0,0.529616773128509521,0,True,False,False,76561198085598776,53,5,4059,0,927,1598975822

Most of you have already heard about the input lag complaints by other players so I'm not even gonna bother. The AI and the animations are also really terrible. There was a time when I was running the fastbreak in a 2v1 situation and the AI ran straight out of bounds as I was passing the ball, costing me a turnover. Another one was when I passed the ball to the Anthony Davis inside who was wide open, but still did a pump fake which eventually lead to his actual shot attempt getting blocked. The animations and gameplay are simply very buggy. It just screws up MyCareer and gets really annoying. The game also tends to crash sometimes for reasons unknown. I'm not big on the other gamemodes but I guess they're pretty decent. It's obvious that 2K has barely changed in the past couple games, except for some obvious minor changes.

57,72503991,english,"JFC The cut-scenes.  Upon first launching the game they wouldn't let me skip them.  Then once in MyPlayer mode, there are like a hundred cut-scenes in the first moments of that play mode. I'm not joking.  Just scene after scene after scene after scene after scene after scene....I played maybe 5 minutes of actual basketball and spent another 15 skipping through scenes.  It'd take an hour to actually watch 'em.  What a joke.

There's camera wonkiness as well.  Want to play every game mode with the same general side-view camera?  Nope.  The black-top and myPlayer modes (and maybe others) force you to play from a different camera angle, never really letting you get comfortable with one view.  Then in myPlayer mode, your defender will run off the side of the screen, so you run back to try to cover him, but good luck as you're both out of view.  Then the AI will pass to your opponent and he'll score. You'll get dinged points because of a defensive breakdown, but you couldn't even see what the hell was going on.  Fantastic work, 2K.

The overall gameplay mechanics are pretty frustrating as well.  Everything is delayed, slow, restrictive.  It feels like you're moving through butter.  Everything requires a length animation, so timing things like rebounding, blocks, and steals are just plain stupid and lame.  Sometimes you get lucky, but most of the time you are just off away from the play jumping by yourself, looking and feeling like an idiot.  I read a review that this game was less about pre-recorded animations, but yeah..that guy was full of it. This game is nothing be pre-recorded animations.  It's so boring and doesn't feel at all like I'm in real control.

2K really do suck at this.  It's a shame.  They spent all this time making cut-scenes with Idris Elba, and that squirrelly dude, Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley.  If you just want a solid gameplay experience and don't want to pay to watch a crapload of cut-scenes, look elsewhere.  Such a disappointment.  I'd love to sit down with the development team and look them square in the eyes and just say a ton of hurttful things to them.  They deserve it for this shameless money-grab.

If you want a somewhat realistic CPU that matches your skill level but also keeps the game somewhat realistic, be prepared to spend countless hours adjusting sliders.

MyCareer is a ridiculous grind that is constantly trying to get you to spend more money, you cannot turn off 2KTV at all anymore (minor issue but it drives me nuts), and the feel of game 40 in the regular season against a team with a 11-29 record feels the exact same as a Game 7 in the NBA Finals all in MyCareer, MyGM, and MyLeague. They tried to switch up MyGM and I personally don't know what they were going for but it's not fun. MyLeague is fun but you have to manually change everything constantly to get it to feel real. Teams never change their lineups (even in the playoffs they'll go 10 deep in their rotations) unless there are injuries and they don't adapt well in-game. In a tie game late in the 4th quarter you can run pick-n-rolls all day and the most the AI will do is double team.

I and several others who have purchased this game have been experiencing random crashes every 10-20 minutes of playing with no error pop-up. I have contacted 2K with no response. I have gone through multiple threads of attempting to fix the issue, ranging from updating graphics drivers to verifying game file integrity. Nothing has worked. Speaking with others on threads experiencing the same issues, it seems to affect users with Nvidia graphics cards. 2K probably will never fix this issue since they will be solely focused on making 2k21.

- You like being punished.

In myleague mode I accidentally accessed some on-court tactics mode thing and it took precedence over controlling my player, it's almost as if the AI could sense this so they relentlessly dunked on my while my players were stationary, that is just straight up broken, I ended up losing off the confidence loss from that and I was very shaken, this is just broken and unacceptable.

It could use some real training, this 2KU thing isn't good enough to really get you used to the skills you need in the game, the drills all use terms that you need to be a basketball fans to know, like ""Do a post-fade jump shot"" And I'm thinking ""You might as well tell me to do a flooptydoop"" because I have no idea what ""Post fade jump shot"" means, stop punishing people for not knowing everything.

93,72184767,english,"TLDR: For the best offline experience, play MyLeague (with player lock or normal team). MyCareer, while started nicely with the story, looks like 2k17 (where your teamates are awful and opponents godlike).

PROS:
- My League is improved
- Graphics and gameplay are decent (if you control the entire team !!)
- MyCareer archetypes are better than 17 but still not as good as the old 2k (where you could build the player as you wanted) 

CONS:
- P2W (I mean look at MyTeam and MyCareer/neighborhood). Even EA doesn't make its ""MyPlayer"" so grindy
- MyCareer teamates & gameplay: they are beyond stupid. Attempt shots even myself I wouldn't dare
- MyCareer opponent AI = OP. Every game, they get around 70% shooting and me (Houston Rockets) around 35%. What am I suppose to do as a rebounding center? Chase down the wide open 3s?

70,71494624,english,"First the game doesn't recognize a PS4 controller.  I literally have free games in my library that do this.  But this has been a feature of 2k as long as I can remember.  So get Steam set up and finally get my controller working only to find that my controller buttons don't match the default Xbox buttons in game, so another feature from 2k.

Finally I get the game working and it asks me to accept the online policy which I refuse because I only play single player ""My League"" and ""My Career"".  Unfortunately this leads to another issue, because 2k has made single player offline impossible.  In order to play single player ""My Career"" you must be online 24-7.  Why?  Greed.  2K wants milk every possible dime out of their players for their $60 AAA game, and they couldn't allow someone to play single player offline, because they cant monetize it.  This is where the pirated version would actually be better than the original game.

So finally I accept the TOS for online play (at this point almost 45 minutes in and still I haven't played, because I like to read what I accept) and the game starts.  I am able to play ""My Career"".

What follows is a travesty.  240p real images and potato quality real video are interspersed between ultra high realistic 2k resolution graphics.   The result is bizarre.  But hey at least they added the ability to skip the majority of cut scenes.   So, so many cut scenes.  I start out listening to the story and realize is just the usual trope, so I begin to skip through the cut scenes.  At one point Thomas Middleditch is on the screen, so I watch that part to see if he's funny.  He says ""Man, I am sweating like a fat kid in a candy shop"".  That seems insensitive to children with obesity, but also on par with 2k.

So I start skipping again, play some college games, combine, everything is going okay.  Finally I get to the point where I am drafted to a NBA team and can actually start the ""My Career"" portion of ""My Career"".  Only I can't.  I set on the bench and it says press A to sim to next time I am put in the game.  But that doesn't work.  I press X (A) and the message goes away and I am stuck watching the team play from the sidelines for the entirety of the game.  And as an added side bonus, they are now moving at 1/8th the speed, so a 6 minute quarter lasts about 48 minutes, entire game will 192 minutes of me just waiting on the bench to be subbed in.

I read up online and find that you can alt tab to fix this problem.  So I do that and it works one time.  After that it either doesn't work at all or the game freezes up and crashes.  At one point it somehow crashed so hard it broke my multiple monitor set up.  After several hard reboots, hours of watching from the sideline, I finally just give up.  Literally the worst gaming experience for 2k to date, and the bar was already very low.

The real kicker?  Because I was in game unable to play, reading the TOS, and skipping through 100s of cutscenes just to get to the point where the game was playable:  I can no longer get a refund, so now I'm stuck with this POS that I can't even play the one mode that I bought the game for.  At $9 it's still a complete and utter rip off.  

Obviously if you don't play career mode this may not affect you, I haven't tried any other modes because I could care less about them.

EDIT: So apparently this is a known bug since the release of the game.  There is a work around that requires you to downgrade your graphic performance to 60Hz, but to date there doesn't appear to be any fix for this bug.   So if you are playing this game on PC with 144Hz, it simply won't work.

Update: Found more bugs, sometimes L Bumper brings up play calling, sometimes it brings up icons.  Sometimes you can press pass and it passes the ball, occasionally you just stand there holding the ball and nothing happens.  There is a lot of downtime in the game where you are just waiting until the game let's you skip ahead to the part where you can actually play the game.  In my career your player is super gimped.  I choose the speed over every other aspect for my physical, unfortunately after playing 15 hours and getting 10k free VC from 2k, my speed is at 76 out of a possible 87 - which means 90% of the people I pair up with just blow by me.   Even if you do great in the game, the difference between doing medicroe and excellent is just a few 100 VC, which won't buy much.  2KTV used to be an option that you could turn off, apparently not any more.  Turning off camera shake doesn't actually turn off camera shake.  

Update: Apparently you are stuck with the nickname CHE?  even after changing your nickname they still refer to you as CHE wtf is that?  Yet another bug in an endless sea of bugs for this barely worth $9 game.  After putting in 30 hours, I still am haven't come close to my maximum physical abilities, meaning that after 500-1000 hours I might actually peak and be an above average player - or you know, you could just spend a few $100 and pay to win.  In addition you are constantly bombarded with Gatorade, Beats,etc. in game advertisements.  At one point they asked me if I would allow them to email an ad in real life for a real life gatorade product.  If this is sponsored by all these corporations in game, why am I paying for the game.  Beats headphones are literally the worst headphones on the market.  I worked as a tech at a computer store and every other week some parent came in with these cheap Chinese headphones asking if we could repair them.  Nope, they are literally crap.  Beats headphones are total junk for any audiophile worth 2 cents, but here in game I have to listen to countless ads about how great the Beats headphones are.. They are junk. worthless crap.  It's insulting to have to listen to in game advertisements for something that is utterly junk, but that pretty much sums up the entire 2k basketball experience at this point...

- Outstanding simulator with seemingly limitless options.
- Many enjoyable single player experiences

Cons
- Online Play is literally nothing but hackers.  They don't even hide it because nothing is ever done.
- Animation locks make the gameplay feel clunky.

Comments
- Pulling up for a 5 foot jumper when driving to an open basket...
- Missing several uncontested short shots while the computer pulverizes you with endless contested threes...
- Practice finally feels even slightly meaningful!  If only for a short time...

I really enjoy this game for it's single player applications.  Online play is trash on PC.  Don't bother unless you can hack the game yourself.

18,71992653,english,"I just couldn't help myself, despite knowing what previous years have brought with NBA 2K games. I've already requested a refund at the time of writing this review. Even though the game is 85% off.

I'll explain why. 

For me the most fun part of the NBA games is the MyGM mode. So its what I went straight into with this game. First of all, the expansion teams were gone. So you couldn't start off as an expansion team, the first red flag. Since previous games had this. Next the MyGM mode doesn't allow you to choose between starting the season straight away or starting in the off-season. You start in the season. Second red flag. You are consistently given tasks as soon as there is a space for one. Which wouldn't be a bad thing, but the Head Coach for the most part just wanted me to trade players. So I had to choose between doing the trades for experience to unlock skill points or ignore the tasks which makes him dislike and distrust you. Another red flag. Unlocking chit chat seems to be an important part of the skill tree because with it you can build a small amount of trust and morale boosts, without it you'll might end up struggling with poor trust and morale problems. More red flags. You almost have to do an action everyday of the season or end the day, because if you decide to skip the week instead and a team wants to make a trade offer. You can't stop the skip and look at the offer if you decide to skip the week.  Plus one to the red flag pile. The final straw that breaks me. Going into the draft no one on the staff has mentioned who I should draft, so I draft whoever I want. Only for after the draft the head coach to tell me who he wants me to draft (its already too late) and the right away after that gets mad at me for not drafting the player he wanted when the draft was already over!

That's at least 6 different problems or choices that have been removed from previous iterations of NBA 2K. F*****g 6, that I noticed within 2 hours of MyGM mode! I had low expectations buying this game, but when you ruin my personal favourite aspect of the game. There is nothing left for me. I could go on about other things as well like a story mode version being gone or the fact that certain actions are now behind a skill point progression system. But I can't be bothered wasting my time anymore.

28,71984784,english,"I'll start by saying this is still a fun game that I'll probably play a fair amount. That being said I got it on sale for like 11$. DO NOT BUY for any more than that.

Pros: 
I miss basketball because of the quarantine
The my career story mode made me laugh a bunch

Cons:
Nothing is done to make my life easier as a keyboard player. All the drill instructions are only shown as if I had a controller so I constantly have to check the key bindings to know what to do.
Controls seem unresponsive sometimes, most notably movement and rebounding
Settings DON'T SAVE: every time i launch the game i need to switch it to full screen mode but much worse is that EVERY TIME i sub into the game I need to change the camera mode because the default sucks AND when ever i sim to my next appearance i have to tab out and in to the game multiple times to actually make it work.

In conclusion I really want to like this game more than I do, the last 2k game i played on PC was 2k14 and it's mindblowing that things like the lack of keyboard ""support"" and control issues are the exact same with the addition of settings not saving. Otherwise the gameplay is the exact same but with better graphics and imo a worse music selection than 2k14. Sure I should play with a controller but I don't have one and haven't really looked into getting one. But why should I spend upwards of 80$ on a controller I'd probably use for 1 game?

Now I bought 2K20 since it had this discount and ran it. And WOW I hated this game immediately straight from the menu screen. It's all uncomfortable to navigate. Didn't even bother to go into the gameplay as I only made it to the 1 minute of exhibition before figuring out the controls.

75,71296009,english,"Here is my honest assessment of the 2K series and this game. I read most of the bad reviews and I read most of the good reviews prior to buying this game. I have not owned or played NBA 2K since 2K16. So I decided to buy this game when it was on sale. I can honestly say that I will never buy another NBA 2K game ever again without some serious changes. This game at its core has not changed much since 2K16. This port for PC is really awful. If you're trying to play online then you are just wasting your time, between the input lag, the net code, and the 2K servers, the online play is dreadful. One of the biggest reason why I quit playing NBA 2K was because the servers were not good. They have not been good the past few years and this year was the worst I have experienced by far. I have watched countless hours of YouTuber's who play this game and it looks bad for them too, I will say that online play seems to run a little smoother on PS4 and Xbox but I am only saying that cause of the  YouTube videos I have seen. I don't know why the online connections on PC are so bad but it is unplayable. Outside of the 2K servers, the other reason I will never buy another NBA 2K game again unless changes are made, is because of all the microtransactions. All 2K cares about is money. Everything you do in this game involves money. I personally have only played MyTeam mode. I read to many horror stories about the other online game modes, so I stuck with MyTeam only. 

This mode could be a lot better. If you are a player that chooses not to pay money, then you are in for one long grind. The sad part about the grind is, outside of the GOAT Galaxy Opal Kobe card, the rewards you get are not really worth grinding for. As mentioned previously, I can never connect to matches and if I do, it is a lag fest the whole time. You will also notice as a non-paying player that you will be at an extreme disadvantage against paying players. No matter your skill level, if someone has a stacked team, 9 times out of 10 they will beat you, and there is not a whole lot that can be done about it, and it is all because they bought it and it is another ploy from 2K to try and get you to spend money. I will admit that I have a good paying job, so it sadly affords me the opportunity to indulge myself on needless expenses, such as buying VC for packs. Be that as it may, getting such a late start to MyTeam, kind of forces you to pay if I want to get good players in a limited time. To those that wonder if paying money for VC to buy packs is worth it, I will tell you it is not. That is another reason why I feel cheated with this NBA 2K game. Even when you decide to spend money on the game, the pack odds are terrible. The chances of pulling the same duplicate cards seems to be a lot higher than need to be and at the end of the day, if you do pull a Galaxy Opal, chances are it is going to be the worst one. The amount of money that I have spent in the little I have played this game is not worth the rewards that you get. The offline modes would be better, but as I have seen in several reviews, the input lag on PC is bad. The players go out of their way to do the weirdest moves on the simplest of commands. Unless I am wide open and not moving, almost every shot has a delay, and it is multiplied by a 1000 when playing online. 

If you read this far, then you've probable guessed that I am just writing this review because I am annoyed at spending money and not getting the best players. That may have been very annoying for me, I just wanted to tell you the truth from someone who isn't paid to write nice things about this game, my assessment is true. I am not a YouTuber, and I am not a Streamer, I am just that regular everyday person who really wanted this game to be good, and  it just isn't which is sad. I promise I don't regret spending the money on the packs, my annoyance with that is that the pack odds seems to favor 2K and again- their idea of making money off people. Plain and simple please stop buying 2K games and spending your money on this company. At the end of the day this company cares about one thing, and that is themselves. They make billions of dollars from players every year, and every year this game does not improve, mainly their servers, what could be the best aspect of this game, playing online with your buddy from across the country, turns into an unplayable lag fest. Never invest your time or money into a company that is littered with microtransactions and allows people to be pay to win. I just wish NBA Live would return and be somewhat decent, that may give 2K a reason to go back and do better and realize what use to make this game fun in the first place.

Who do you think you are? The ad said silence = murder then asked people to vote, obviously for Democrats. What is it? Do you 2K drughead marketing managers know that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer cannot even read George Floyd's name right?

Original Review:

Downtime for George Floyd ONLY, really? Why can't you keep your political message out of video games? Does Mr. Floyd have anything to do with the NBA?

How about you ALSO honor the innocent lives and properties being taken away in the riots?

How about instead of shoveling a political message down the players throat, you actually make the game better? Like a BLM dedicated event is better than this ""memoriam"".

TL:DR - I'm leaving a positive review only because it is better than 2K19 (Left a negative one on that), if you don't mind spending for 2K and wants to get the 19-20 roster, go ahead, especially during the sale. I will list down the things that are better below:
 
-The UI's layout and design in the game. You go into your MyCareer static page first before you hop into Neighborhood. You don't have to load the world to go into the animations store.
-Camera work is slightly better, no first-person view when sitting out the game, new cutscenes during pre-game.
-You can choose your specialization badge freely, which is pretty great.
-Movement is more realistic compared to the previous one, deciding to shoot will cost you a few milliseconds more.
-Waiting for your next appearance became interesting, instead of a simple fading to black transition.
-WNBA
-You can play Draft Combine and Summer League during the prologue.

Now.. for the cons:

-Graphically identical to 2K19. You wont notice a difference, at least to me it didn't.
-Timeouts are still a waste of time for them to show their sponsors.
-Story sucked compared to the last one, didn't even cared for my own character let alone the others. Short too.

They got rid of the walking out on to the court animation from a previous title (2018 or 2019? Can't remember). So its mostly just Menus, Team Practice Court, Game Court and the neighbourhood if you want.

▶️Introduction
NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K.

Release Date : 5th September 2019.
Last known update: 29th May 2020.


🎮Gameplay:

Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?

Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:
Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.

Gamemodes:
Play Now: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include Play WNBA that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, NBA Today that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,Play Now Online is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly Blacktop which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to.
My Team: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed.
My Career: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues.
My League: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. My GM Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.

🌇Graphics / Audio:
Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.

Audio / Soundtrack:
The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well.

🌀Performance:

In Game:
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S:
I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap

Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:
Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.

🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:
The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues.

💲Price:
For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.

⚖️Conclusion:
NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

📉Overall rating: 74/ 100

95,71338189,english,"The game is great offline.

I understand people are mad at the MyCareer and the multiplayer. If you just want to sit back, relax, and enjoy basketball, this is it.

If you wanted to play MyCareer but don't want to invest in a player, just play MyLeague and use ""player lock"". Create your character, customize however you like and enjoy.

Online play is non-existent. Don't even bother.

The increased difficulty in MyLeague make me want to come back to the game mode every single time I play. 2K have nerfed some parts of the stat system like a players potential. Someone who's A+ in potential may only shine if he has players who revolve around his play-style. Although, I find that you need a star in order to win a championship. Mediocre 80 overalls won't get you anywhere but the second round.

Virtual currency is very lenient this game. You can get an easy 1500 each game. They implemented a progression feature with the MyCareer character that allows you to progress through basketball. The progression blocks the player from increasing overalls. But, it allows the character to develop in a realistic fashion, although, very grindy. That's why I mentioned the MyLeague option.

If you enjoy basketball and offline play, it's something to look forward to when it's on sale. Looking for multiplayer? Stay clear from this title.

Does anyone else feel like their shot indicators are ridiculous as well?  They need to check the definition of VERY because 99% of the time VERY late or early seemed barely late or early at all.

You can have Anthony Davis who is 97 in my career mode and he goes like 1-10 in the paint against Trae young. That's not even a joke.

Ok so, MyCareer/MyPlayer and MyLeague are fun.  I haven't touched MyTeam, and don't think I will.  I'm not into collecting cards but whatever. 

But when it comes to MyCareer, it's super fun.  I don't get a feeling much when i play the league and it's a bunch of repetition.  I like the progression and it's fun.  I made it all the way through two seasons with one character and will start another one.  Awesome fun stuff. Standard game mode is an A+

When it comes to online play, this is what you can expect:
As with any PC game expect hackers.  Super long arms, OP shooters, I don't even see the best youtubers shoot this well.  They hacking, and if you like to cheat to win then go ahead and do that.  I personally, don't care, if i see it, i just don't join them or play against them.  
There's absolutely no REC games.  So don't try.  you'll be waiting for hours to find one game, which mind you by the time a game is found, the players are AFK and the game get's cancelled.  A suggestion here is to visualize how many are needed in a rec game to get it started while you're in the park and not taking a shot in the dark. Hope that gets seen
But for the most part, 90% of the people play the game straight up.  It's fun.  There's not a lot of people, but that's okay.  There's enough to have each park about 50% capacity and a little higher during peak hours.

[h1]▶️Introduction[/h1]
NBA 2K20 is the latest addition to the NBA 2K lineup which exists for almost 2 decades now. The 2K game series featuring best in class graphics & gameplay, ground breaking game modes, and unparalleled player control and customization. NBA 2K20 was developed by Visual Concepts and published by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/2K]2K.[/url]

Release Date : 5th September 2019.
Last known update: 29th May 2020.


[h1]🎮Gameplay:[/h1]

[b]Is this game really the most realistic basketball game?[/b]

[list] [*] [b]Playing basketball and the basics of 2K:[/b]
Well long story short, this is easily the best game as far as gameplay goes, when playing the game you can easily think that this is a legit real life scenario. Shooting mechanics are basically what you expect, everytime you take a jumpshot a shooting bar appears next to your player and if you manage to cover 100% of the bar you get an excellent release which means your shot will hit, unless you get blocked or 2K decides to make you suffer. Obviously you have a huge variety of dribbling moves that are basically real life moves the game even offers streetball moves, in order to successfully perform some of these moves you will need to memorize the patterns for the right analog stick, after that you can break some ankles. Defense has been decently talked about as it got nerfed badly compared to the solid defense we got in NBA2K19, defense feels basically a lot slower and not as body to body aggressive. Don’t be surprised if you see people spamming the steal button as this is probably the most logical defensive tactic in 2K at this exact moment. Lastly passing is something that hasn’t really changed since 2K16 or 2K17, long distance passing is literally a meme as you will never hit your teammate, alley oops are still OP after they got nerfed in 2k14, to use them as many times as possible especially if you got athletic players on your team. Overall the basic essence of the game is more than solid but the unfair advantage of offense is a little bit to harsh.

[*] [b]Gamemodes:[/b]
[i][b]Play Now[/b][/i]: In quick play you can match up against today NBA teams as well as some historical teams dating back in the 1960s as well as some All-time teams that feature the best players in the history of each team. Some smaller modes within that mode include [b]Play WNBA[/b] that allows you to play with the female NBA teams, [b]NBA Today[/b] that allows you to play with today's NBA teams with all the updated ratings, matchups and injuries,[b]Play Now Online[/b] is a ranking mode that matches you up against other players worldwide and after each win you collect points in order to improve your ranking lastly [b]Blacktop[/b] which was one of my favourite modes back in the day is a nice mode that can go from 1 vs 1 to 5 vs 5 in a street ball setting that allows players to do crazy moves and dunks but fouls as many times as they want to.
[i][b]My Team[/b][/i]: Is a card and rank based mode that needs a lot of grinding, the rankings of each card can go from Bronze to Pink Diamond Opal and some special edition cards are included,you can do challenges, online matches, offline matches and many more activities sadly they removed one great feature which was The Gauntlet that allowed you to take 3 players and start a Blacktop type match, still disappointed that it got removed.
[i][b]My Career[/b][/i]: Is the story based Single and Multiplayer Hybrid aspect, this year is kinda special as 2K added some well known figures to play in the story like Idris Elba as the coach and LeBron James as...well as Lebron James. You start off as a young player with major leader potential basically a guy that cares about his team and winning instead of stats and personal awards, after your good friend and teammate gets a season / Career ending injury you decide to show your frustration by not playing and having a small feud with your coach, as always everything works out and you get drafted and meet Lebron in his personal plane and decides to give a cringey dialogue that made me rip my ears off my head. Other than the ripping ears off my head I enjoyed the Single Player campaign, after that you get put into the Online mode and you’re greeted with the same things as 2k19 , Neighborhood, Parks, Sweaty MyPark guys and Connection Issues.
[i][b]My League[/b][/i]: Is basically Manager mode, where you can select a team and make them win championships, make trades, break the bank and sign a superstar and have jerseys retired and all that good stuff. [b]My GM[/b] Is an identical mode just a lot more hardcore with more things to do.

[h1]🌇Graphics / Audio:[/h1]
Honestly, NBA 2K games have probably the best face scans since NBA 2K14, you will be amazed by the visuals.

[*] [b]Audio / Soundtrack:[/b]
The soundtrack is great as always, like its really good, voice acting is spot on simply because the same commentators in real life talk in the game as well.
[/list]

[h1]🌀Performance:[/h1]
[b][/b]
[*] [b]In Game:[/b]
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 X, 16GB RAM, RTX 2070 S:
I was running the game on Ultra Settings 1080p with 60fps. Note:60fps is the cap

Intel Core i5 5200U, 8GB RAM, Intel HD 5500:
Believe it or not I was running the game on Low Settings 720p with 28 -30 fps.

[*] [b]🖥️Bugs / Glitches / Crashes:[/b]
The game was terrible at launch after 6 months it got fixed but I still get to see some minor bugs like at halftime where they display the stats you get the bug that shows that you got as many assists as points, some random crashes happen as well but nothing major. In around 200 hours of being a mediocre 2k Player I had no game breaking issues.
[/list]

[h1]💲Price:[/h1]
For 50 Euros you get a decent game but I would wait for sales.

[h1]⚖️Conclusion:[/h1]
NBA 2K20 had a terrible launch but after months it is a pleasant experience now with a ton of content and stuff to do, it is a decent sports game.

[h1]📉Overall rating: 74/ 100 [/h1]

But the multiplayer is a disaster, worst i ever see.

POSITIV:
- Fantastik story mode but no variations after playing a while.
- Good my career mode to play alone (best part of the game)
- GFX is good. HD and 4K solution settings are possible. 

NEGATIV:
- moderate basketball move animation and not very smooth animation in motion transitions.
- very CPU intensive stress to system because of bugs and a lot of game crshes.
- too much bugs, spezially keybindings, and network. Grafik-bugs, screen-bugs, lot of multiplayer lagging and skipping animation etc.
- keybinding are switching between default settings and own settings from time to time.

Mutiplayer not playable here some examples of a lot others:
- not able to chat or communicate with other players in neighborhood
- VOIP doesnt work properly and cause to game crash often 
- if VOIP works u got probölems in understanding players because of annoying ambiente sound like helicopter.
- forming groups squads cause to game crash very often.
- very often heavy network laggings.
- not able to find matchups in time
- cost to much time finding players of same level to play with.
- no balancing in finding equal players 
- no long time motivation to play.
- unablle skiping Intros/Animation/tvshows and at least after waiten 5 sec to be able to skip it. Annoying and time-consuming waiting espacially in second season after knowing all events/animation/tv-shows
- some bad and wrong implementation of BB Game rules, on fouls and time violations.
And if you know the basketball rules you will fast reconize that a lot of rules are implemented wrong. For example their is no shot clock violation if the ball leaves the shooters hand before times end and of course shot counts. But it does not in this game!!!!

After over 300 hrs playing i have to say ""what a bad game at all"". it makes me angry!
I woulnt buy this game again if i had a choice now. 
I buyed this game to play multiplayer with friends online on free court and all my friends quit playing this game. At the begin we are 11 players - now no one is playing anymore.

Rec center. Literally worst online thing with randoms in whole universe. Every single random teammate more and more retarded and worse than previous one, every single random stupid teammate dont have pass button or just shooting full contested shots day n night. Literally worst online matchmaking - rec center solo. Brainless teammates every single game. Worst online experience in the world.

If you want to achieve your dream of becoming an NBA legend or assembling a Myteam dream team, you better be prepared to waste a lot of your valuable time or spend a lot of your valuable money. 

You could play Mygm but it's just plain boring, so few features have changed or evolved for the last 5 years and the Storyline they try to wedge into it feels slow and more like a boring conversation simulator.

Sure it's the best basketball game out there right now but if they keep going in this direction i can see an exodus of users when a competitor starts noticing and makes a better game, which wouldn't be that difficult.

This franchise has stopped respecting it's users and instead are manipulating kids into forking over their parents money.

The second you play anything other than gm or quickplay or career, the servers decide that maybe they shouldn't work. All games are full of lag. Comparing the ping to other games, this is one of the worst of all time. Its such a shame that this game didn't do well. They have every component needed in a good game, just terrible online experiences mixed with lag, hackers, and exploiters that all just find every possible way to cheat instead of being good at the game. Buy it for solo play, Don't touch this with a ten foot pole for multiplayer. (After playing predominantly MyTeam as well as some GM, Quick Play Online, and Career) This game is 100% pay to win in MyTeam due to both the fact that you can buy a literal all 99 overall team combined with their awful, and I mean ET video game awful, servers. Online play feels like running with a parachute, no matter how fast or well you do something, you will never be going at full speed. My last online game, the servers actually made the game feel like they were going in slow motion. At first I thought it was frame drop, but after checking, I was at a full 165 the entire game. If you are thinking about buying this game at this point in time, save your money and just walk away.

98,70151683,english,"If you've ever played a NBA 2K game before you know exactly what your getting into. While I don't support 2k or it's Microtransaction-mania; or in-game advertisements; or incredibly obnoxious product placement; for the majority of the time this is a solid, playable game. So sit back and relax, as me and my 43 hours of in game experience take you on a journey into 2K tomfoolery.

Lets start with the actual basketball game mechanics. To sum it up, the gameplay in 2k20 is a smoother version of 2k19. Players will cut, drive and dunk much faster and have less of a chance of getting stuck to a defender who is spamming R2 (I swear every computer is doing it). 3-pointers are more important, players will attempt (and make) them at a higher rate. The AI generally has been improved too, they will make smarter plays, and play more like they're real life counterparts. They still get stuck on screens though, and occasionally get janky when it comes to contested shots off a pass, (or anything player initiated).

The music is the same-ish as the last few years; though I swear the variety in music genre is less and less as years go by. For the most part 2k20 just takes the top 50 artists and throw in they're B-list songs. Unfortunately nothings going to top Kurtis Blow or his Basketball song about Basketball.

MyCareer has gotten better; 2k seems to have reduced the grind and the importance of VC accumulation. It only took 10 hours of playtime to get my guy up to an 80 overall. Which is a significant improvement from other years where I went the entire NBA regular season only to peak at a solid 77 overall. The biggest change to MyCareer (and honestly the game as a whole) is to the player ""Archetype"" system. They give a lot more control in designing your players physical attributes. Skill-wise you get a nifty looking pie-chart that defines your overall in each main category (Finishing, Shooting, Playmaking and Defense). After that they let you edit your own skill caps for each individual skill (like 3-point shooting or Offensive Rebound), setting maxes to each skill based on the pie chart you selected at the beginning. If this sounds like a sham, that's because it kind of is; the only thing that matters is the pie chart you choose as the game will only let you max out your skills to fit that chart (give or take a few skill points). It gives you that nice veneer of player control without the actual ability to customize anything. Its not a perfect system, but it still gives you more control over your players play-style than last year, and its nice to know that 2K is willing to listen even just a little to the player base that complained about player archetypes in the past. Other than that MyCareer is essentially the same as 2k19 (with a different story of course). You take control of an up and coming NBA rookie, and navigate through at least one NBA season playing with (and against) the leagues best. All the while increasing your attributes with VC and getting cool endorsements/obvious product placement from real world companies (GATORADE WHOO).

 I don't play much in the way of My GM, but from what I've seen it hasn't changed from previous years. Online is a little sketchy, and you might have a little trouble getting into a game. But even that's playable if your willing to overlook the  occasional hour long wait time, and the occasional cheaters (one time the entire other team was on fire for the entire game). Every other game mode is pretty much the same. You still have your quick-play, your season mode, and the illustrious franchise mode. These are all effectively the same as last year, which for me  is fine because how much is a regular season mode going to change in any sports game. League expansion is still here as well, for all of you who wanted to navigate the Flint Tropics to another NBA title.

All in all the game itself isn't that bad, not much has changed from 2k19, the stuff that has changed is mostly for the better. 2K' s VC nonsense is still here but at least in MyCareer they've significantly nerfed it's importance in terms of overall player development. And yes in game ads are a thing, but they're not as bad/invasive as people make them seem. They're mostly for in game apparel, or custom animations. Things that don't really affect gameplay at all. And nothing that other games don't already do (I'm looking at you Fortnite). The worst is the 2k video series that plays every time you load a game. I'm convinced that nobody actually interacts or watches these, except for when they offer free VC for answering a poll. My biggest gripe with the in game currency is that short shorts for your My Player cost 5,000 VC. I had to grind 5 NBA regular season games out just so I could show off a little leg in the neighborhood.

If your thinking about buying the game, at this point I would wait for it to go on sale. Either that or wait for 2k21 to come out.

TL:DR 2K20 has made small, but mostly positive changes to 2K19, and has downplayed the importance of in game VC (its still there). I'm interested on whether 2k will continue to make changes based on user feedback. Maybe someday that will mean the end of VC, and in game ads? Idk as long as I get to customize my own GATORADE bottle I won't complain.

Oh and the MyCareer cut scenes are still pretty cheesy, but I mean what do you expect? Its a game about basketball, not a Disney Original Series.",1591026798,1591026798,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561198114787473,267,1,8684,0,2582,1598488483

72,69802692,english,"I should have realized what was up when I installed the game and discovered you can only play ""My Career"" online and logged in. (Ready to pay.)

The scripted of the STORY are actually pretty good.  Pretty immersive.  This would be a plus were it not for the fact that it's a set up.

I ground and I mean GROUND may way through the first 30 games of my rookie season.  If you help on defense, at all, you lose teammate grade for leaving your assignment, and it's harsh.  If you don't help on defense, the other team scores roughly 65% of the time while you are on the court.  I focused on staying on my defensive assignment, like the game seemed to want me to, and my player's +/- per 36 minutes played was -18.  The worst on the team BY FAR.  I tried to get assists, but discovered that almost every time I set up a team mate for a decent shot they either didn't shoot, made a needless move first thus negating the assist, or missed the open shot, in that order of frequency.  

I attended every single practice and did max drills every opportunity, without looking in to what this does for you too much.  You slowly unlock badges and I know those help, and you also unlock general ""attribute upgrades"" as you go.  What are the attribute upgrades?  The game randomly chooses attributes for you and increases the cap on that bar.  The higher you raise your attribute bar, the more VC it costs.  So by grinding away and earning ""My Points"" you are increasing the potential for you to spend VC to make your player actually better.  How do you earn VC?  You get a set amount for playing games, you get a smidge for stats, (you get 2VC for making a bucket and raising your attribute one bar costs over 1k when the bar is high already,) and you get a chunk for winning a game, (good luck with the hand of God scripting that goes against you and the difficulty settings that  you can't lower, only increase from default,) and you get a chunk for the grade your teammates give you, based on how team oriented your play was.  (In other words, how much you didn't try to alter their destiny and just went with the flow.)  

So after 30 games I had increased my overall to 79, and now the coach tells me I'm ready to start, benching a much better player.  I am stoked and go all in trying to play an efficient, team oriented game.  I get a tough defensive assignment but he only burns me about 3 times.  I get 7 assists by force feeding my open teammates at every opportunity.  I play crazy transition defense.  I don't iso a single time and get called out for bad shots.  I make a few last second buckets and go to the line a few times, scoring 12 on 56% FG.  I get more rebounds than normal.  I feel really good about the performance, (after all it was an A, which is rare for me,) and we win the game against a good team, at home.  

I head in to the locker room, and....

I apologize to the assistant coach, (the only staff member that actually ever talks to me,) with my head hung low, for ""letting the team down.""  I get blasted on social media for a disappointing start.  I have NO IDEA why.  I am stunned.  How could that possibly be bad?  We won, I got a team A, and I chose the team based dialogue options to max my team chemistry, and for some reason the game wants me to feel like I am inadequate.  

Wonder why that is?  

So I go to player progression to raise my stats a little, seeing as how I wasn't good enough to impress anybody after my best effort.  Turns out I had earned 1100 VC.  That was enough to raise 3 stats one bar each.  It did not increase my overall.

I don't mind the fact that it is a serious GRIND to improve.  I actually like that long term sense of progression this sets up.  But the game shames you for not being good instantly, it stacks the deck to make it tougher on you than it should be, and the only way to change your fate is to pay real cash.

So know that about My Career if you are interested in that aspect.  It's a trap.  Don't get the game just for that.  (Or actually, now that they knocked $40 off the price, right after I bought it....maybe go ahead and take a flier on it.)",1590441009,1590441009,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198020012714,247,3,4284,0,3976,1590711067

For reference, I'm new to basketball videogames (Besides the NBA Jam series some 2-3 decades ago) so those that are frustrated with a lack of improvement since NBA 2k14 may be correct in their assessment.  

I am just having a blast with my career, my team, (Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson and Thomas Middleditch?  Well, this is above and beyond what's expected from me).  The 3 on 3 games are fun.  The throwback teams are fantastic (Jordan v Lebron James?)

Just a great time so far.  2 biggest complaints though are - Face scan with the nba app was terrible.  It took 20 attempts as there were constant errors with the app, uploading it to the servers, or downloading it to your game.  Eventually I got a very bad face scan that looks nothing like me.  

I played 1 game online with 90mbps internet and got a juttery though playable experience.  It definitely stutters much more than single player, which limits my desire to play it compared to the silky experience offline.  If I had friends I would invite them over to play in real life.

I mean.  I have friends.  But it's the pandemic.  It's not a lack of friends at all.  Yes.

However, this year they have really screwed up the shot system and for some reason I cannot get the hang of the timing. I can't win any games and can't hit any jumpers even with wide open shooters. The reason for this is that the game makes it incredibly difficult to hit a shot unless you green bar the meter, even wide open. The shot percentage is like at 20% unless you get an all green bar meter which is something I can maybe do 1 out of 10 shots. 

everything else I can deal with, the clumsy ball handling, the poor AI . I can deal with that, nothing new. But when you can't make any shots wide open with perfect scoring shooters... there is a huge problem with the game. 

2k is ruined for me forever since this is the direction they've gone down. I've played every year since the first 2k and I don't think I can play basketball again. I'm going to stick to strategy games instead of sports now.

MAIN ISSUE: if your internet connection is interrupted, the game lets you play through and complete it, just to be met with a message that says something like 'NOT CONNECTED TO THE SERVER' and you lose all data/progress from the game you just played. This renders your last 30-40 minutes of gameplay NULL and is very annoying. I can't believe this hasn't been fixed. It would seem pretty simple to have data from game just played saved [briefly] onto an offline cache that transfers results of game played back on to your account once you reconnect to the serves. PLEASE FIX THIS!!! THIS IS SIMPLE AND SHOULDN'T STILL BE A PROBLEM!!! I've only had this game for a week and it's already happened to me 5 TIMES. 

Other than that, the MyCareer is a little better. I like some of the development they've done, but it also seems like you cap out on attributes quickly. It's like you start as a certain type of player and are inevitably going to be stuck in whatever build throughout (ie shooter, defensive, playmaker). Yes, you can improve your weakpoints, but not very much (from what I can see).

MyTeam is GREAT. So many different player cards and amassed game modes inside of it.

When I was in junior high, I spent my pocketmoney, and well, even some part of dinner money on purchasing basketball magazine and newspaper. The magazine launched out half monthly and the newspaper came out every Tuesday and Thursday but it's cheaper than magazine. It was from those juicy magazines that I started to obsessed with the trivia and gossip of NBA player. T-mac is my favourite, because he played with Yao Ming in Houston Rockets and he played gracefully. 

I started to play this 2k series last year (although I've acknowledged this game more than ten years ago). But I'll still need to buy a wireless controller for this game( I am using machanical keyboard currently which is good enough but...).  My team includes Dirk,Garnett,T-mac,Thompson and Barros, all are build-in player card which takes no money. This team is good enough to win a game for even ALL-STAR level, ignoring my bad keyboard operating skills.  I switch to Chinese version of  commentary(I'm Chinese) and it is sometimes very amusing, well at more time, they are very mean.

57,68680870,english,"Just dont get it. I wish I still had the $60 dollars I spent. After about a 5 or 6 game win streak in my Career, your next game will automatically be scripted for the other team to win. My player is averaging fucking 70 points a game and yet every 5 or 6 games i have to restart multiple times because the game mechanics will blatantly be boosted for the other team and nerfed for you. All of the sudden your teammates will stop playing defense, the center on the other team inherits the block rate of fucking manute bol and any third-string player can drain consecutive threes regardless of defense. 


Symptoms of a scripted game................ 

1. your player runs right past the person your defending.
 2. Unable to make shots even with minimal defense.
 3. CPU getting consistant offensive rebounds. Usually after a well defended three 
4. CPU scoring on 80% of possesions
5. your teammates unable to defend their man
6. CPU ability to score over well defended shots.
7. CPU ridiculous help defense
8. CPU ignoring player physics, going through my arm for a shot etc. 

This happens for all difficulties on MyCareer

I maintain my playstyle consistantly throughout games and usually by the end of the first im up 25, yet every couple games, whether it be the lakers or the fucking knicks, i cannot maintain a lead above 5, and the other team immediately goes on a 20-0 run as soon as im subbed out. 

If you still decide to buy this game some advice.

1. After you go on a win streak for 5 or 6 games immediately restart your next game once
2. During first round playoff games- restart twice
3. for conference finals on-wards restart 3 times
4. Dont play online, your buddies at Taketwo Interactive have offered up an extremely immersive experience this year where hackers are unregulated and players with 9 foot fucking arms run rampant in servers. If your lucky sometimes you get to catch a 100ft player.

58,68705141,english,"Look, I could come at this from several different angles, but lets start here.  Have you played and if so do you enjoy NBA 2K20, or failing that, NBA 2K19.  If the answer is no, then the choice here is fairly simple, do not buy it.  Assuming you do enjoy or have enjoyed the NBA 2K series within the last two years or so, e.g., on console, then there is a lot to like here.  Assuming you are brand new to the franchise, I would say that whether this is a good game for you or not will turn heavily upon how much you loath micro transactions (or are willing to work around them) and how much you appreciate a sim type play style versus an arcade play style.  This year in particular tends much more heavily toward the sim side of that dynamic.  Micro transactions are a problem, but especially in MyCareer they can be avoided or at least mitigated in large part.   Using myself as an example, I buy a bit of VC at start of every season to ease the first grind (much like an MMO), then no more.  This isn't strictly necessary but your life will suck much less, because, make no mistake, park in 2K is a basketballl MMO.  Anyway, I suspect the main audience here is people who either currently play 2K or have recently on console and are interested in playing it on PC.  To that person I say this: The online community is much more vibrant than years past.

You have to pay money to get to a higher level without insanely boring single player grinding.... None of the higher level players will play with anyone below level 85 or so.... I can understand not wanting to play with a level 75 or lower, but 80+? Come on man... I've played with lower level players that are clearly better than some higher level players. Some won't even play with people below lvl 90. Special players get the ability to ""boot"" you out of the queue to join a game which is absolutely nuts and totally unfair. Especially when you've been waiting a bit to get into a game and as it's about to start, some idiot boots you out and takes your spot... what kind of idiot thought this was a good idea? Oh yeah, the people who want a lot of these guys to feel special and important so they spend more money on the game... those idiots. The same ones who thought a casino was a good idea. What I hate the most is you are met with this INSANELY, obnoxiously loud helicopter sound the covers up every bit of sound in the game world and practically blows your ear drums out every time a Superstar joins. It's absolutely insane that anyone thought this was a good idea or even thought the sound of the helicopter should literally almost clip your speakers every time someone comes in. And to make matters worse, most of these people are hackers. If 2K actually put effort into making this game mode a good experience, it could actually be one of the best online sports games there is. But nah, lets just cater to pay2win players and put minimal effort into creating the game mode. Don't buy this game for My Park gameplay, and next year make sure you read up on how it works before you buy it. Always wait for the inevitable sale the game has every year as well... unless they do amazing work on a game, I always wait until the price drops to at least $20 and even that is too much.

I have to STRONGLY advise you against purchasing this copy/paste, low-effort, embarrassing, and enraging piece of addictive garbage. I would say this game has significantly worsened my mental state and contributed to the debilitating anger issues I have today. There is, as unfortunate as it is, no better basketball game, because god hates gamers who like basketball. If you invest hours upon hours like I have (been playing religiously since 2k16), you will find that the game does not reward, and rather, punishes by matching with noobs, who still have 50/50 chance of beating you due to the games inability to register skill and make it matter. The MyTeam platform is especially pathetic in that you cannot beat anyone unless you invest a minimum of $100, and even then you'll often lose to 12-year-olds who have spent thousands of their parent's money to acquire a ""god-squad"" that is virtually unbeatable. I have invested, as of now, 751 hours into this garbage. I hate myself for it and I've invested far more time into other games and didn't regret it as they were consistently enjoyable, as opposed to this RUBBISH. I genuinely wish death upon all the money-hungry head-developers, who have been using what is essentially gambling to trick children into wasting endless amounts of time and money. I could go on and on about how horrible this franchise is. I am disgusted. I am angry. Never before have I been more enraged by a piece of media than this. PLEASE DO NOT BUY! PLEASE! I beg of you!

Beyond that it's insistence upon itself while also having a higher and higher hill to climb to obtain VC for your myPlayer every year is just more and more ridiculous.

updated jan 31 2020: This game, while having some interesting things that differentiates itself from 2k19 and previous 2k entries, brings A LOT of terrible balancing issues and bugs to the forefront.

The developers are more interested in adding more items that you have to purchase in game currency for (or grind out game after game to afford them) than they are of fixing these bugs.

If you play with sim stats on, like i do, simming a partially completed game will result in ABSURD statlines for your players. For example I just simmed a game i had 3 minutes left in wherein Robert Covington hadn't scored a single basket, looking at the stats after the game he had dropped 25 points. I looked further and what would have been 6 minutes left in a game resulted in ~25 points for both teams. In a blowout game with that little time remaining that's absurd.

In myplayer when you play full length 12 minute quarters more often than not, the opposing team will not call timeouts. you'll end up getting games where you are forced to call time outs to replenish your players stamina to keep going, just the other day with 1.5 minutes left in the 3rd quarter my team, who held a 20 point lead had two timeouts remaining whilst the other team hadn't called a single timeout yet. Really? come on. How are you gonna call yourself a basketball simulator when little tiny things like this are ALWAYS popping up.

The Drills you run to gain XP points towards your badges are often riddled with bullshit. Often times you'll be doing what they ask of you only to be hit with an X and not getting points towards completing your drill.

I'd only recommend getting this on a deal, don't give 2k more money than they are owed. The only thing this game has going for it is that it is somehow still better than the NBA live games.

Update 4/22: I continue to play this due to my love of basketball. I can only suffer a game or two at a time before I get enraged and turn off. new gripe though: I have had to repair the installed files now 4 times total in the 4 months I've owned the game. Every now and then i experience a bug where it will not show me menu icons so i have no idea where the cursor is at. this will not be fixed unless i verify the games files. I have no idea why it's happening but considering this is a 60 dollar AAA title, I don't think this should occur, amongst all the other ridiculous bugs here and there.

77,63672285,english,"Man this game is so frustrating... When you play MyCareer, the only game mode everyone wants to play just to create your own player and go to the NBA or the park, etc. If you go to any team and you play the Golden State Warriors Curry and Klay will hit so many 3s that you will get angry, but when you decide to go to GSW suddenly everyone in the team becomes retarded, Steph can't hit 2 open 3s in a row, Klay can't do it either. Whatever team you go instantly everyone on it becomes a retarded player, taking stupid shots and missing wide open mid-range or 3-pointers.

The thing about archetypes is also frustrating, you can't create a player like LeBron or MJ because if you can shoot and defend then you can't finish at the rim, if you finish and shoot you can't play defense. If you create a 7.0 post scoring center with a good defense and good post game then you can't shoot a simple mid range shot or freethrow.

The most anoying thing about this is the lack of reallity in it, you post up with a 7'1 against a 6'10 with no defense whatsoever and you can't score on him, but the other way around he can posterize you every single time even with good defensive stats.

2K needs to realize that people want to play good basketball and play with good teammates instead of playing with retarded players everywhere you go. They need to create a Story where your decisions count, because here whatever you decide in the story it will always end up in the same shit...

Most of the time the game will match you up with a team that moves 50% faster than your team and sometimes the other way around. I suspect the game matches you up to players with faster servers. Open shots are so hard to hit and even if a player is open for a shot, because of the lag defenders can recover so quickly before you release the shot which is insane. I decided to buy this trash game on PC because I thought the game will improve due to better specs and LAN internet connection but still the same crap game and same problems.

Same stupid fouling and same animations from previous Nba 2k title and when you're down points the AI can't score again like previous games. When you're up points the game becomes tolerable and even enjoyable since you can score more easily and AI even behaves somewhat rationally. The Problem with AI is that it can't create consistently especially when you're down. No mid range shots are taken and it's always go to the basket and get contested or blocked or maybe it even gets one in. This is of course on your side of things. It's so tiresome how these that are supposedly based on a Team sport like basketball make the player carry the team and make the team incapable to run offence and make plays much less make plays that get you The player open. Mycareer also suffers from microtransactions where your player starts as a low level guy who somehow gets into the NBA without being able to play basketball at all. Your stats are so low that it's embarrassing and you having to carry the AI or just lose most games just forces you to buy virtual currecy to get better or grind and get infuriated. This game is stupid waste of time. 

Multiplayer is hardly any better the way it is handled. No communication methods in-game makes making a group in the park take too much time. Jordan rec center is at least a match making system but of course it's populated mainly by level 90+ players and limited number of lower level players sucking the fun out of that mode.

After deciding to play it a bit, it can be sort of fun, but there are FAR too many bugs and issues with the game.

The game force quits all the time.  It can be in the middle of games (both season and playground games...and in the playground you just get replaced by an AI even if you log right back in...in season games you have to start the game over even if you've made it to the locker room talk post game).

Sometimes you just stop getting experience.  If you do, there is no fix.  You're just stuck.  You can create a new character, but you will have lost all the VC points you spent (not to mention time).",1585616593,1586134836,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198085740075,45,3,9079,0,318,1586673411

52,66648919,english,"I'm giving up on this game because of its gameplay mechanics. For those who are not familiar with it, shots and layups are either beased on an individual percentage (each basketball player on this game has its own % chance of shot sucess) or based on a timing system (I'll explain it in a second). If you set the shot/layup setting to individual percentage, then you will face the game's RNG. If you set the shot/layup setting to timing, then you will face a tricky meter that charges accordingly to the time you keep the button pressed. Press it for a too short amount of time and it won't charge enough for the perfect spot (called a ""green release""), press it for a too long amount of time and it will exceed the perfect spot. It's tricky but at least it's fair. Well, only to a certain extent. There's one more gameplay mechanic which is much more annoying. Whenever you make a shot/layup, if there's an opponent defending it close enough, there's a HUGE chance you will miss that shot/layup. The game calls it a ""contested shot"". On the other hand if there's no opponent nearby, then it's called an ""open shot"". The problem with the contested shot mechanic is that it's not nearly fair when you play against the IA. If you are close enough to an opponent but you don't try to block the shot using the blocking action, it's almost guaranteed the opponent will hit the shot. However, if you are close enough and you do try to block the shot, then great are the chances you'll make a foul. The same goes for the stealing action. The unfair part here is that whenever the IA opponent tries to block or steal the ball from you, it rarely makes a foul. In the end, I feel that having good skills in this game are either useless by its randomness or shut off by its lack of balance.",1586066923,1586066923,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197970917361,219,2,2848,0,2848,1586062520

During drills the helpers will pass the ball 5 feet out of the spot you're supposed to shoot in... man it's so bad. You can pick your player jersey.... but you can't see what the other team is wearing so you have a potential to pick matching jerseys....

Also, note this game is super heavy on grind early on. The game wants you to do horrible. if you stick with it, you'll be able to drop 40 points a game like 25 games in, but it's still a pain, and you have to force it... I cut to the basket in the 2nd half.

If you go off and get like 40 pts, 10 assists, 3 steals, 3 blocks, 10 rebounds.... your next enemy will play like Kobe regardless of their overall. You will also be constantly guarded off the ball and won't be able to move. It's so ridiculous lol. 70 overall matchup shouldn't drain everything.

Unless you perfect time every shot, you will miss them. Badges make the difference. Make a 99 overall character and don't give him a single badge. He will miss every shot. Overall doesn't really matter for your player. 

The story is 3 hours, really annoying, and takes forever.

I mean it's obvious that the company remakes the same game every year because they have no competition, but this one blatantly says, ""I don't care about the player experience. What are you going to do about it?""",1584411895,1585974661,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198147969597,58,18,4628,0,49,1588119823

2. Screen tearing during online multiplayer 
3. You cant do ""skip to next appearance"" in my career unless you turn on vertical sync
4. Ai Team mates are deliberately forcing you to lose the game (my career)
5. During fast break when your team have the ball your ai teammate deliberately waits for the opponent to block him before attempting to dunk the ball (my career)
6. The ai opponent that guards you will be glue sticked to you during 4th quarter (my career)

20,66037976,english,"If you're a MyCareer player, like me, expect to be sorely disappointed by the quality of this game. 
The CPU players routinely make inexplicable decisions, especially on defense, and you will often find your team perfectly set defensively, only for one of your teammates to suddenly leave a 3-point shooter wide open because he wants to switch the match-up. This has been a problem since NBA 2k17, and I don't think it will change for a very long time.
While I appreciated NBA 2k19 for the quality of the collisions, NBA 2k20 has gone backwards massively, and you will often see players going through each other. For example, you will see a defender's hand go through the ball as he's trying to block a shot (without a block registering), or you might find yourself in perfect position to defend, only for the ball handler to go through you and find himself wide open in front of the basket.
The way in which the game plays is extremely unrealistic. All teams play exactly the same offensively, i.e. the ball handler gets the ball, he triggers some useless offensive motion, then sits around while the shot clock counts down and then shoots a contested jumper. Defensively there are only minor differences related to how they treat pick and rolls and mismatches.
Hall of fame difficulty, just like previous years, turns your teammates into secondary school calibre players, unable to make even the simplest plays, like pass to a wide open teammate, knock down open jumpers (which especially applies to top tier shooters), and sometimes refuse to shoot an open layup in front of the basket, instead preferring to make 2-3 useless pump fakes, during which the defender gets back into position, and then air-ball a contested layup. Conversely, the Hall of Fame CPU is moved into a Godlike tier. Do not be mistaken, this does not mean they are smarter, or more skilled. They still trigger useless offense, and run around with no purpose, however, they just make impossible plays. There is the classic example of the heavily contested three as the shot clock winds down, but even if that misses, you will find that the HOF CPU will dominate the boards, and will have a 99% chance of boxing out the defending rebounder. This applies regardless of who is fighting for the rebound, so a player like Jayson Tatum will somehow manage to push Andre Drummond out of the way and grab an improbable rebound, then dunk the ball like Shaq.
Instead of making the experience of playing on Hall of Fame fun and challenging, they just made it purely frustrating and unrealistic and I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, unless they wish to try other modes.",1585427709,1585427709,False,68,6,0.801127195358276367,2,True,False,False,76561198028257021,30,1,12583,0,4896,1600793613

I ran into a performance issue where the game was only able to maintain around 20-30 fps, and you have to do some tweaking to make it run properly.

72,65949592,english,"Presentation 7/10

Presentation gets a 7 for me. The main menu isn't anything to brag about. No hyped intro video (2012 was the best). The NBA Pregame show is kind of nice for the first 20 games you play then it just gets repetitive. Despite all of these, the game looks amazing.

Gameplay 8/10

Gameplay isn't actually too horrible. My only gripe is that when you're at least slightly contested, you brick almost any shot you take. Sure with the default sliders, its basically impossible to make a layup with Rudy Gobert within 5 feet of you but taking the time to tweak sliders makes the game better. I can't name off the top of my head anything that constantly ruins my experience. Just a couple of weird 2k bugs that show up every once and a while. 

MyCareer/Park 4/10

The myplayer builder is a great improvement in my opinion. It allows for so many different myplayer builds. The new badge system is nice because you actually get to pick your badges therfor create even more customization. The story at the beginning is alright but abruptly ends as soon as you start your rookie season. Summer League is pretty cool especially with the different commentators. After Summer League though, You're plopped into basically generic mycarrer. A couple endorsement cutscenes sprinkled in between but thats about it. The park is the same from last year. Same people heaving up bricks from half court, same people spamming steal with HOF pickpocket. Servers are laggy. In game items are way too expensive. Too reach 99 overall it's a GRIND without buying VC. I've been playing the same Mycareer for about 1 1/2 seasons and average about 10 minute quarters and i'm a 84 overall. 

Interesting side note: I play on a 144 hrtz monitor with v sync off. For what ever reason, I cannot skip bench time in mycareer unless i alt tab exactly 6 times. 

MyGM/MyLeague 4/10

These are basically the same modes in my mind. One has a little more artificial customization but overall they're both just franchise modes. Everything goes pretty smoothly until you get to the draft. You can either import a custom draft class or deal with the WORST DRAFT CLASSES I'VE EVER SEEN. These dudes come into the draft between the ages of 21 and 26. I put the draft class quality to 100 and still had this issue. To my knowledge there is no way of fixing this and my only fix is to either pick the youngest players or edit the player's age which puts my team at an advantage over the other teams. After a couple of seasons, you realize that everyone is at least a 76 overall and every team has 4-5 players over 82~ overall. Bum free agents want upwards of 20 mil a year and players' moral drops for no reason. They complain about loosing games when the team is 26-3 and they'll complain about playing time even though they are starting with good minutes. Expansion teams are decent but don't have any custom audio for cities. Your arm sleeve color is locked at bright blue unless you go to each individual player and change their colors.


MyTeam -/10

I've put about 3 hours into my team so i don't think its fair to assess it's rating. From my understanding it's about as grindy as mycareer and it's 2k's other cash cow. 

WNBA

Great improvement, I havent used it much but it's still a great feature. My only wish is to put WNBA players against NBA players

Conclusion

2k20 is one of those games you have to buy on sale to make it worth your money. Pretty fun most of the time but has some game breaking flaws in MyLeague/MyGM. Overall, 7/10, would break your ankles again.

BUT, the MyCareer mode if you play only the NBA is great, the people complaining about crashes is on there end... I have never crashed once playing 150+ hours of this, I crashed once when I tried to change some settings on my Nvidia Control panel, so one thing people can try is to go into their Nvidia settings and make sure that the NBA2k20.exe is set to restored or default settings, and see if that fixes the crash. NBA is on Pro level difficulty so the people that can only handle rookie mode, will get wrecked... my first week with the game, I was getting owned but persistence and learning the game mechanics made me avg a score of 60+ in any game on PRO difficulty that is, I am no Hall of fame level player by any means. The game is really amazing if you have the same skill level as me, because some of the matches were so heart pumping and realistic. I had a few games where I would be down 10 and the uphill battle to come out on top at the final 1 minute, was simply an AMAZING experience. I wish the PC community got more love, but the hackers make the online play impossible for me. Also, the console versions have a mode called MyPlayer Nation, I was looking forward to doing it on PC, but found out it is exclusive to the consoles version of the game only.

P.S The park mode got me fcked up in the beginning because they reset your camera, or the options for the camera is separate from your NBA game settings. To change the camera in the Park, you have to hit right on the D pad, and use LT, RT to cycle through the cameras. The park feels really weird to me compared to NBA and MyCourt.

I would only buy this game on sale... I would never pay full price... This is a cash grab company and video game... everything in the game, you will notice that they try to maximize the amount of money they can get out of you. EVERYTHING COST VC, Upgrading your character, buying animations, clothing, and emotes. I understand spending VC for cosmetics and animations, but these animations also affect the gameplay as well... there is no balance in this game, if a player does their research to create an OP build you can save a lot of time, money and frustration... anyone new that picks up this game and creates their own build is at a disadvantage... I wasted my entire 100k VC from the legend edition on my first character, just to find out I made the most retarded dude in the world LOL. But hey, the games still really fun to play, I am just bad online. Definitely worth the 33$ I paid for the Legend edition. I calculate each Dollar, by the hour that I play a game for.

I almost had it where I could thread enough needles to have fun with this game, but every time I get there, something happens to break it.  It shouldn't be this hard to enjoy a video game.


Update:  The game can work with a CPU vs. CPU my league but it has to be done differently.  You have to control every team, but change every team except the one you want to control to auto everything in the management area.  This will enable you to view games other teams play.  It's not ideal, but it is a workaround that works easily enough.

Broken for CPU vs. CPU sim players

Tried to play other games in a myleague and let the CPU vs CPU go and while the option appears to be available as you can check the games, and the option has indeed been there for at least a decade, it appears to not work this year.  While I know we are a small portion of the people who play the game, it's impressive that they actually decided either to purposely remove that feature or be so buggy a game that they accidentally removed it.  Maybe this game will be worth it after they fix, but for CPU vs CPU players in my league, this game is currently a non starter.",1569188197,1584944037,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198014640512,189,3,10204,0,25,1584944284

Olumlu Yönleri:
- Oynarken çok zevk alarak oynayabiliyorsunuz.Oyundaki animasyonlar vs. gerçekten harika.
- Arkadaşlarınızla oynadığınızda çok eğleniyorsunuz fakat mümkünse sadece arkadaşlarınızla girin.Tek başına girdiğinizde size hiç pas gelmiyor veya takım arkadaşlarınız mal çıkabiliyor.
- O kadar mükemmel archetypelar var ki hem savunmacı hem şutör hem de iyi bir oyun kurucu olabiliyorsunuz.
Olumsuz Yönleri:
- O kadar çok hile var ki yani anlatılamaz.Her sunucuda 1 legend var profillerine girdiğimde 60 OVR çıkıyorlar.2K hileler ile hiç ilgilenmiyor.
- Aşırı derecede buglar var ve sürekli oyundan atmalar yaşanıyor.
- MyCAREER oynamaya meraklıysanız hikayesi LeBron James & Springhill Entertainment'in 2K ile iş yaptığı kısa bir hikaye.Hikaye güzel gidiyor ama sonrasında bir anda kesiliyor ve hevesinizi kursağınızda bırakıyor.Sonra döngüye bağlanıyor sürekli aynı şeyler yaşanıyor.82 maçlık seride bir tane bile drama yok.Bence ağır bir eksi.

But if u are coming here for the other modes, grab your kids, pack the bags, and stay as far away from this game as possible. Also the servers are complete shit. I was originally gonna give a thumbs up for this but after writing my thoughts I realized how shit this game really is, they treat basketball fans like complete garbage but we need our fix.

Okay, after adding 10 more hours of this game, it is seriously NOTHING like real basketball. The game has like 3 animations and it is VERY unrealistic. Trying to play this against friends competitively is so bad. Ronnie 2k just picks which team will brick shots wide open right outside the block with not a soul in sight while the other team will hit fading away shots not even facing the basket from a long 2 in the corner with a guy draped all over him.

96,64435202,english,"First to put this slightly this game as a basketball sim is really good... on console. If you really want to invest time into this game get in on console but is this game worth it. To be completely honest to you. Only on sale. And it's still not worth it sometimes. And there's multiple reasons why. First there's no anti cheat.... So people are literally straight up making impossible builds but sometimes still being trash and if you want to try and cheat with them good luck finding a trainer cause the ones they're using are impossible to find and they all hide in a discord server sending each other the updated ones and if you try to buy it from them they just straight up scam you. Now aside from that the gameplay is good but not better then 2k19. And the parks at certain times can be fucking empty. Now that may seem good but from what i've experienced the park with alot of people makes the game sometimes impossible to play on and half of the 3 courts cannot be taken serious for me because on one side of the court it's literally a slideshow and impossible to play offense or defense. You expect a company with a alot of money to invest it on servers but you're as far off as saying NBA 2k18 is the best 2k game of all time. Now my main problem and ik it's part of pc but I've heard it's on console sometimes as well so i'll say it. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING OTHER THEN PARK GOOD LUCK. Rec is not even close to being alive and stage is just a cheater fest. And pro-am is not even to be heard. And also the events are mostly just total ass in this game. Main reason no one plays them. like 4v4.... it's literally dead. Now some events are worth it but you gotta wait till the weekend and again... cheater fest. Now I haven't talked about myteam a bit cause it's... alright rn. Haven't played much of it but if you're into it go for it. This review is mostly about the park. But one of the things I finally want to touch up before I finish up is MyCareer. I used to be a MyCareer guy back in 2k16 and 17 but now 2k is focusing too much on it for one reason. It's literally a way to bore you to the point of spending money. One reason it's bad is because you can basically score a triple double almost every game and the max you'll get out of it is around 1100 vc.... now it's decent but the main problem is the badge points. Badge grinding in this game is horrible. I've spent over countless of hours on my first build and i didn't get all the badges till near the playoffs. And don't get me started on the jumpshot creator.
Now if i would like to sum it up i'll say this. If you have a console and 60 dollars buy 2k19. If you want to play 2k20 on console that's fine as well. But please spare yourself from this port. 2k has already shown they don't care about the pc community at all. But if you really want to get this game badly at least get it on sale. If you don't i'll make you suck a melon. Plain and simple/",1583205153,1583205153,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198313983146,16,2,13477,0,12692,1594528680

51,64263070,english,"I don't often take time to review games on Steam, but this needs to be said. This game is a huge piece of garbage. I fully expected coming in that this would basically be a re-release of an old game with new rosters. That's just what these sports games are, yet people pluck them up for $60 every year.  I picked this up on sale for $20, so I was pretty tolerant of issues coming in. In short, this game is a [b]nearly unplayable buggy Gatorade/Beats/Express commercial[/b]. Hell, for all the in your face product placement (way more than you think) this may as well be free to play. This review sponsored by Gatorade GX, change the way you refuel. Beats.

Bugs:
Here are just a few of the bugs you can expect to see:
[list]
  [*]Seemingly random crashes to desktop at any given moment. Especially fun after you've played 30+ minutes of your MyCareer game and you lose all your progress.
  [*] If you set your refresh rate to anything higher than the 60hz default, then when you simulate to your next appearance in a MyCareer game, the game slows down to a crawl. It will not begin simulating until after about 1 minute of this and/or after you alt+tab a few times to ""kick start"" it.
  [*] Online neighborhood games are often a lagfest, and there is a constant underlying latency added to your shot timing. Essentially you need to completely re-adjust how you shoot when playing online. This isn't game breaking, but it sure as hell is annoying.
[/list]

Other comments:

In fairness to this game, when the MyCareer isn't crashing, it's actually quite fun. You can tell they expect you to grind to become a half decent player, and that feels a little more heavy handed than older versions I've played. This is likely a ploy to get you to spend your hard earned money on more VC so that you can actually compete, but to be honest it didn't take that much work for me to get to an 80 overall, and with smart play you can still be a competent player. Also, all of my experience has been in MyCareer mode. I've heard MyLeague/MyTeam are fun, and I can't personally attest to how stable those modes are. But know that if MyCareer is what you are after, you are probably going to be frustrated.

Honestly, for a game that does so little to innovate every year, you would think they would at least fix the bugs. However, they still sell every year without fixing anything so I won't hold my breath. I should note that when googling the random crash to desktop issue, I've found forum posts from NBA2K18 complaining about the same issue. Awesome.

Final Verdict:
Don't buy this POS on Steam. The PC version isn't stable enough for an early access alpha let alone a ""AAA"" release. If you must play this game, I highly recommend you get it on console.

- GLeague progression totally ludicrous causing every random scrub in the league to become an instant stud just because they played in the GLeague, which in turns causes the overall talent level to skyrocket, causing actually talented prospects to become extremely undervalued.
- Contract length and the ability to resign players is extremely wonky. Players on current rookie contracts have their lengths and ability to resign screwed up, causing you to lose out on players for nothing or not have a chance to extend them before they are a free agent.

MyLeague players - save your money. They also made MyGM mode a ""ranked"" type mode so they removed a ton of customization options, even if you want to play ""unranked"".

I am not a MyCareer or online player so I can't comment on those.

EDIT: Forgot about another huge one. If you have a NVIDIA graphics card, you have to roll back to drivers from 6 months ago to have the game not crash every 2 minutes. I don't know whether this is an NVIDIA issue or not but this is the only game I have had this problem with. My rig is excellent, it is definitely a specific issue to this game.

First you can't play offline even if you just want to play solo. That means that you must always have an internet connection. This is probably a way to deter cheaters and VC hackers in the game, as the devs can just ban you and you won't be able to play the career mode at all; this maximizes their profits from the numerous amount of microtransactions in the game. Which leads me to another point, your starting player is very bad, you can have a 85 shot rating and consistently miss wide open shots more than you will make them; even with the shooter build. I'm sorry but I don't see any real NBA shooter that misses wide open shots consistently like this game makes you miss. Your player can't defend, he can't score, he's pretty much useless until you get of a higher rating. Which would be fine, but the game gives you starter's minutes as a 60 rating going against high rated NBA superstars that will leave you with the impression that your player is moving in slow motion, it's just so unfun from an individual standpoint, yeah your team may win, but you're not having fun playing your character. Also the CPU will defend aggressively and constantly rip the ball from you if you try to do any kind of ball handling. The grind for VC is crazy, everything about this game mode is a grind.

nba 2k20 offers a lot of content , hours of random game experience ,

the game will make you laugh because of amazing and crazy actions players do
and of course you will :D cry because these guys play like ""real"" players most of the time ;D.

25,63494325,english,"NBA 2K20 is a good basketball game that I still recommend despite one rant I do have about it. Some pros first, MyCareer has another solid story-line, MyLeague is still enjoyable as you always have total customization of the team you are running, and the inclusion of the WNBA is refreshing and should be expanded upon in the future.

Now for the cons, 2K totally wrecked the MyGM mode this year. It's tedious, repetitive, and boring. The constant chit-chatting and pestering for trades is annoying and the action points and skill tree concept is very flawed and limits a lot of your actions and you have to grind even more just to get to certain points. They need to make MyGM fun again because 2K18 at least offered a story-line without it becoming too heavy-handed and you still had a lot of customizations. This MyGM is just awful and isn't fun in any way. It's just a grind of talking and chit-chatting with your staff and players and it shouldn't take a long time to simulate through the season either. They totally killed one of the best modes with this new system which shouldn't ever be done again honestly.

Other cons of course are more minor but 2K needs to allow us to permanently save our face scan to the game so it doesn't get lost easily and bring back Create-A-Legend in the form of something like MyLegend. I actually loved picking a random NBA player having a great career with them.

56,63179884,english,"I definitely think this game is worth picking up. At first glance the game looks similar to NBA 2k19, but it's the details that bring this game apart. I'm still early on in gameplay, but I've noticed some key differences: speed and defense matters.

For example, if one team has a quicker center that can hurt you a bit. I just played the Lakers and they took advantage of my slow center (Gillmore? from the All time Bulls). I ended up countering by putting Horace Grant in at center, but that only goes so far against the Lakers as they have so many weapons.

There is also a 'player DNA' and 'create a player' in league mode in the front office tab.. nice feature.

My Team is also enjoyable. The way you can upgrade key players and they have goals to unlock stars further skills (like Hakeem Olajuwon is the player I chose early on.)

""PC is the worst platform!""- The ONLY downside I can think of is less players, so less auction house listings. For me, Servers are the usual experience on all consoles, the lag is the same, I have yet to see a hacker in game, etc. Also another downside is no game chat, but if you join a 2k PC discord, this quickly becomes a non issue.

BUT-

The game has it's issues. Look at any of the other reviews and you will see angry customers ranting about Ronnie2k.

The biggest issue to me is the complete imbalance when it comes to shots. You can be wide open, but unless the shot meter lights up green (perfect release), the odds of the shot going in are little-none no matter player ratings. I get not every shot should go in, but it's at the point where it's completely ridiculous now. This happens with layups as well. And as far as CONTESTED shots go... yeah, good luck. Meanwhile the CPU seem to be able to drill shots from no matter where, even contested (to a lesser extent, like it should be with the user-controlled player). This is all especially true in MyCareer because your teammates will consistently force up bad shots or miss wide open ones and before you know it you're down 20.

Ads are still annoying too, do we really need to sit through the players making their way to the bench for a timeout and then five more seconds just so we can see Gatorade pop up, EVERY TIME? And do we really need an express introduction before the game (not every game, but still)?

The animations still seem clunky. When I try to steal my player sometimes goes halfway across the world, AI players will randomly dribble it out of bounds or back across half court for no reason, turning your player the other direction takes three years, etc. Not the biggest issue but something that could be improved (but lets face it, probably won't).

Due to the lack of competition in the industry 2K has once again ported over the old game with new rosters and some changes that were buggy and probably not play-tested before launch. The game has had multiple large patches that have completely changed the way it is played, and made certain player builds that were good at launch completely useless. Additionally the servers seem to be somehow even worse than last year despite claims that 2K20 had new servers to eliminate the issues from last year.

The game is full of ads for companies that paid to be included in the game not to mention the ads for VC (the in game virtual currency) all over. To make matters worse VC is the only way to increase the abilities of your custom player and any cosmetic item you may want to apply (ie shoes, jerseys, braces, sleeves, etc) can only be acquired by purchasing with VC. Even more offensive is the fact that the equivalent USD amount for many of these items ranges from 10-35 REAL WORLD DOLLARS.

Edit: This game can be very inconsistent to say the least.

I've played every nba 2k game since 16 and honestly game play wise their have been improvements but at the same time downgrades gui wise MyGm looks much better but overall serious downgrade from last years game this years is completely unplayable for me, I just don't like the changes they have made to the level system and how MyGm mode is now a time management/rpg simulator. MyCareer mode as a few dumb things in it but overall an improvement i liked last years choice selection circle better than this year because if you skip through the a part that has a choice it auto picks the first choice in my experience. Skill boost are used in prelude games and since you have to play games the first time you start MyCareer it is a bit unfair. Camera angles in prelude games change from game to game from the one i set. I find without a few defense badges it is next to impossible for me to stay in front of any player even if i turn on the ai assist to max. Scoring is stupid easy in this game if your a slasher and the ai seems clueless on the fast break and worse of all at random defense assignments change at random sometimes but there is a slight improvement to defense mainly you actually contest shots now even if your not assigned to the person so a huge improvement compared to the last few games. I do prefer the new sim process when your player is on the bench because before sometimes you would be up 20 you sit and within a minute of game time you were somehow down 10 so i like that you can watch it or just spend an extra second just to skip like normal but i will add sometimes it seems like the new simulator gui or the simulator itself not a ton of points ever get scored even when 15mins of game time pass a few games i've seen a total of 30 between the 2 sides  in a half  and other times its like 30 points in within 4mins so if anything it just seems really inconsistent.",1580231465,1580489796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198039532946,148,14,13490,1087,2135,1602032145

I really want to like this game but it is INSANE the lack of QA happening with this title. There are so many bugs it's hard to really detail them all but some of the biggest are 

- Every video is literally a green screen of death
- Menus are wildly choppy on a high end system running on SSD, i7, 2080, etc
- Game modes are poorly thought out and clearly designed to force you into micro transactions
- Crowds look like garbage
- Almost nothing changed from the last two years
- Instead of just fixing what was wrong in previous years they layered on more garbage overly-elaborate menus that slow everything down.
- In-game performance is HORRIBLE, choppy and just really poorly optimized for PC 

This game is not worth your money! Wait until it is almost free and maybe they will have fixed some of the major bugs (although it is doubtful).

12,62415272,english,"MyCareer Introduction | 

This game is horrid, I initially got the game for MyCareer however the game mode is terrible, once you enter MyCareer you have to either watch a 45 minute movie with loads of cut scenes or skip them all. The story isn't that great either so I wouldn't advice sitting through it all. One thing that stood out was the Combine, you are tested on your mid range, your catch and shoot, vertical height, etc. These tie together nothing and have no correlation to your player other than you possibly getting an upgrade in your draft projection. I only sit through those excruciating parts to get an extra 750 VC instead of the regular 500 if you were to skip the draft.
VC/Money Hungry Devs |

 Speaking of VC you are practically forced to spend money on the game, especially if you want to play in MyPark/MyCareer. I average 1500 VC a game on 12 minute quarters, and full incentives. To upgrade some of my stats to max (95) I would have to sit and play 24 games. That's just for one. Single. Stat...The prices on the VC are ridiculous, to get a fairly good OVR and a good character you need to spend $50.00 on VC, Unless you want to sit and grind for 30+ hours on each character you create.

MyCareer Gameplay |

The AI is terrible, you are forced to be selfish and get a low Teammate Grade, for example, I play on the Warriors. Stephen Curry one of the greatest 3 point shooters of this era will miss a wide open catch and shoot 3...consistently. If you aren't being selfish your team will chalk up misses upon misses. Each game feels repetitive the AI will run the same exact play system. When I set screens for my teammates they will not run through the screen to catch a defender and make an easy 2 pointer/ 3 pointer. Whilst the other team will go through the screens and run straight to the basket for an easy 2 pointer. When I switch defenders on screens I will still get a ""Defensive breakdown"" when I'm clearly trying to cover someone else to make up for my teammate who got caught on a screen. These are just some of my main complaints, I could go on and on about animations, waiting screens, Questions etc. etc.

MyPark |

Now this could be my PC or the game itself, but inside MyPark it feels like everything is delayed and my frames are super jittery. The whole gameplay even with a controller feels delayed and clunky. Not to mention the toxic builds and the tryhards on the court. As well as the hackers/exploiters. It's so predictable the builds on the game, Glass Cleaning Lock Down, Slashing Play maker etc...You will wait ages for games, and when you do you'll get terrible teammates. It's fustrating as a whole and the clothing in the game is overpriced as well (Not looking like a bum is also very important) 

Other Online Modes |

Other than MyPark I don't play any other online modes, especially since I don't know how to/Don't like them. But also you will rarely be able to find a game. I can't comment much on these

Other Offline Modes |

I'm sure there are ups and downs on those modes however again can't comment on them as I do not play them.

2K as a whole |

It's a very greedy and bad company that doesn't listen to it's community. It instead destroys it by taking out certain things that everyone liked, inserting things that no one wants. And fucking over the community as a whole they are greedy liars who say they will have things in upcoming games and either lie or shy away from the fact that they didn't whole heartedly mean they would add 'this' instead they added something like that but very different that no one wants. In summary this game isn't worth your money if you aren't prepared to deal with toxicity and paying loads of money to make you have a better time and allowing you to play the game in the first place without ragequitting and deleting the game.

44,61755130,english,"除了该死的服务器问题外，基本上95%左右的初期bug都已经被修复了，所以除了NBA目前在中国的形势显得有些尴尬外，中国小伙伴们可以放心游玩，欧洲，美洲，澳洲，非洲南部玩家无需挂载VPN方可直接连接，东南亚，部分亚洲，以及那位神秘的南极洲玩家，和北非玩家需要挂载VPN。关于新手不太了解第一次玩这个游戏的流程，我简单总结一下，如果您是需要挂载VPN连接服务器的地区的玩家，我建议您选择正规的付费软件，如中国的腾讯加速，网易UU加速，8LAG布卡加速。日本以及韩国选择8LAG也可以，东南亚，北非推荐使用Google官方推出的VPN插件，但是价格很贵，并且最新版本资源很难找到。另一个问题就是关于最近推出的下载更新，如果您的下载进度条一直不动或者卡在某个地方，那么可能是如下几个问题：1.您的NBA2k20与您的steam文件夹不在一个系统磁盘里 2.您没挂载VPN，加速器，或者是加速器加载错误，需要重启加速器或者电脑 3.可能是您的磁盘空间不足，需要调整一下磁盘空间.不排除可能有其他情况，请利用您当地的搜索引擎查找原因和解决办法。

В дополнение к проблеме с чертовым сервером, исправлено около 95% первоначальных ошибок, поэтому, за исключением текущей ситуации НБА в Китае, которая немного неловкая, китайские друзья могут быть уверены, что Европа, Америка, Австралия, Южная Африка Игрокам не нужно устанавливать VPN для прямого подключения. Юго-Восточная Азия, некоторые страны Азии и таинственный игрок в Антарктиде, а игроки Северной Африки должны устанавливать VPN. Что касается новичков, которые мало знают о процессе игры в эту игру в первый раз, я кратко подведу итоги. Если вы являетесь игроком в регионе, которому необходимо установить VPN-соединение с сервером, я предлагаю вам выбрать обычное платное программное обеспечение, такое как Tencent Acceleration в Китае и Netease UU Разгоняется, 8LAG Бука разгоняется. Япония и Южная Корея также могут выбрать 8LAG. Юго-Восточная Азия и Северная Африка рекомендуют использовать официальный плагин VPN, запущенный Google, но цена очень дорогая, а последнюю версию ресурса найти сложно. Другая проблема связана с недавно выпущенными обновлениями загрузки. Если индикатор выполнения загрузки застрял или где-то застрял, это может быть связано со следующими проблемами: 1. Ваш NBA2k20 и папка steam находятся не на одном системном диске. 2. Вы не установили VPN, акселератор или неправильно загружен акселератор, вам необходимо перезапустить акселератор или компьютер. 3. Возможно, вам недостаточно места на диске, вам необходимо отрегулировать дисковое пространство. Существуют другие ситуации, которые не могут быть исключены, пожалуйста, используйте ваш локальный Поисковые системы находят причины и решения.

En plus du fichu problème de serveur, environ 95% des bugs initiaux ont été corrigés, donc à l'exception de la situation actuelle de la NBA en Chine, qui est un peu gênante, les amis chinois peuvent être assurés que l'Europe, l'Amérique, l'Australie, l'Afrique australe Les joueurs n'ont pas besoin de monter un VPN pour se connecter directement. L'Asie du Sud-Est, une partie de l'Asie et le mystérieux joueur de l'Antarctique et les joueurs d'Afrique du Nord doivent monter un VPN. En ce qui concerne les novices qui ne savent pas grand-chose sur le processus de jeu pour la première fois, je résumerai brièvement. Si vous êtes un joueur dans une région qui a besoin de monter une connexion VPN au serveur, je vous suggère de choisir des logiciels payants réguliers, tels que Tencent Acceleration en Chine et Netease UU. Accélérez, 8LAG Buka accélère. Le Japon et la Corée du Sud peuvent également choisir 8LAG.L'Asie du Sud-Est et l'Afrique du Nord recommandent d'utiliser le plug-in VPN officiel lancé par Google, mais le prix est très cher et la dernière version de la ressource est difficile à trouver. Un autre problème concerne les mises à jour de téléchargement récemment publiées. Si votre barre de progression de téléchargement a été bloquée ou bloquée quelque part, il peut s'agir des problèmes suivants: 1. Votre NBA2k20 et votre dossier Steam ne se trouvent pas sur le même disque système 2. Vous n'avez pas monté de VPN, d'accélérateur ou l'accélérateur n'a pas été chargé correctement, vous devez redémarrer l'accélérateur ou l'ordinateur 3. Il se peut que votre espace disque soit insuffisant, vous devez ajuster l'espace disque. Il existe d'autres situations qui peuvent ne pas être exclues, veuillez utiliser votre ordinateur local Les moteurs de recherche trouvent des causes et des solutions.

Zusätzlich zu dem verdammten Server-Problem wurden ungefähr 95% der anfänglichen Fehler behoben. Abgesehen von der aktuellen Situation der NBA in China, die etwas umständlich ist, können chinesische Freunde sicher sein, dass Europa, Amerika, Australien und das südliche Afrika Spieler müssen kein VPN bereitstellen, um eine direkte Verbindung herzustellen. Südostasien, einige Asien und der mysteriöse Antarktis-Spieler sowie nordafrikanische Spieler müssen ein VPN bereitstellen. Wenn Sie sich in einer Region befinden, in der eine VPN-Verbindung zum Server hergestellt werden muss, sollten Sie sich für kostenpflichtige Software wie Tencent Acceleration in China und Netease UU entscheiden Beschleunigen, 8LAG Buka beschleunigt. Japan und Südkorea können sich auch für 8LAG entscheiden. Südostasien und Nordafrika empfehlen die Verwendung des offiziellen VPN-Plug-Ins von Google. Der Preis ist jedoch sehr hoch und die neueste Version der Ressource ist schwer zu finden. Ein weiteres Problem betrifft die kürzlich veröffentlichten Download-Updates: Wenn Ihre Download-Fortschrittsanzeige hängen geblieben ist oder irgendwo hängen geblieben ist, können die folgenden Probleme auftreten: 1. Ihr NBA2k20 und Ihr Steam-Ordner befinden sich nicht auf derselben Systemfestplatte 2. Sie haben VPN, Accelerator nicht gemountet oder der Accelerator wurde falsch geladen. Sie müssen den Accelerator oder den Computer neu starten. 3. Möglicherweise ist Ihr Speicherplatz nicht ausreichend. Sie müssen den Speicherplatz anpassen Suchmaschinen finden Ursachen und Lösungen.

In addition to the damn server problem, about 95% of the initial bugs have been fixed, so except for the NBA's current situation in China, which is a bit awkward, Chinese friends can rest assured that Europe, America, Australia, southern Africa Players do not need to mount a VPN to connect directly. Southeast Asia, some Asia, and the mysterious Antarctica player, and North African players need to mount a VPN. Regarding novices who don't know much about the process of playing this game for the first time, I will briefly summarize. If you are a player in a region that needs to mount a VPN connection to the server, I suggest that you choose regular paid software, such as Tencent Acceleration in China and Netease UU Accelerate, 8LAG Buka accelerates. Japan and South Korea can also choose 8LAG. Southeast Asia and North Africa recommend using the official VPN plug-in launched by Google, but the price is very expensive, and the latest version of the resource is difficult to find. Another issue is about the recently released download updates. If your download progress bar has been stuck or stuck somewhere, it may be the following problems: 1. Your NBA2k20 and your steam folder are not on the same system disk 2. You did not mount VPN, accelerator, or the accelerator was loaded incorrectly, you need to restart the accelerator or computer 3. It may be that your disk space is insufficient, you need to adjust the disk space.

It's not their fault, it's our fault.

Let me get to the gameplay, I LOVE IT! Besides AI being stupid, such as randon switches or switches on pick n rolls or standing in the paint when there is a guy open it the corner on fastbreak or AI unable to turn around while opponent is sprinting on fastbreak, gameplay is pretty damn good. I only played MyCarrer, finally after all the years you can use menu to navigate the game not the pointless and time wasting walking in the neighborhood. Feel like game is pretty smooth very enjoyable for me, love the new creation of the player, people say it is the same as archtypes but its not, you can leave out pointless abilities you dont need(e.g. my PF doesnt need ballhandling or steals) and you can max out other atributes, you still cannot create a Lebron, Giannis or Luka but you can get closer to your dream build this year.

I don't expect anything from the servers as PC has the lowest playerbase compared to consoles(atleast I think, some1 fact check that) so makes sense they dont't give much attention to the PC servers. I played one park game and it seemed alright much better than 2K19 experience but hard to judge from one game.

All in all I feel I haven't enjoyed a 2K game this much since 2K17, hope it stays this way. IF YOU LIKE GAME OF BASKETBALL - MUST HAVE TITLE.

NEVER. STOP. BALLIN.

EDIT: after few more hours and leveling up myplayer I must say the game is good. Not perfect but good enough for me, after last few years of playing this game on PC and servers crashing all the time and park games disconecting, its much better. There is still input lag so if you expect perfect game its not for you.

I bought a pre-built computer with an I7-9700k and a 2070 Super as well as a 165 hz monitor so this game looks too sexy. The problem is that there isn't enough other players so when I tried going back to NBA 2k19 on my PS4/TV at 60 hz and low response/quality it felt unplayable.

I still enjoy MyCareer and just building my MyPlayer even with less park games.

34,61396302,english,"Such a love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand, the game-play is the best its ever been. However, just about everything else about this game is cancerous. And unfortunately, there are simply no other basketball games out there that can compete. 

As many reviews mention, the game is designed to encourage you to buy in-game currency. I knew that going in and was willing to look past it for the sake of the game-play. However, this year's 2K CRASHES ALL THE TIME. I have a top of the line rig. I know it is not my computer. A few crashes here and there would not bother me, but this has been consistently crashing for months. 

What's so brutal about the constant crashing in both MyCareer and MyTeam is that you lose your valuable in-game upgrades like skill boosts and gatoraide boosts for your MyCareer player. (which are expensive AF in game) And in MyTeam you lose your entire line-ups contracts. The contracts in MyTeam are bad enough and I hate them so much. But losing these valuable commodities due to crashing is simply the worst. There are days I can't even enter MyTeam or MyCareer modes because it insta-crashes. They push so many damn updates to the game and provide little to no feedback as to what changed or why. 

They have no problem pushing out new packs to purchase every week in MyTeam. But game stability??? FUCK THAT.  Last year the servers were a nightmare and everytime a lockercode came out the servers would crash and you would lose your lockercode or those in-game purchases I was talking about. This year, servers are better but game just crashes.....so we're right back where we started.

Playing in my neighborhood was just me getting disconnected my first 3 games before I was finally able to play with the 8 people running around and then disconnecting again.

Impossible without buying a ton of VC or grinding an entire season and even then you won't have enough VC to spend all your points. Want clothes so you don't look like a newbie scrub in the park?

Locked into Pro difficulty or higher
When you get subbed the computer goes on 10 point or more runs.
One little skill move by you or when bodied by defenders, that stamina bar melts quickly.
Meanwhile the opponent AI, runs thru and around screens full speed with no fatigue hit or slow down.
When you get screened whether a big or small guy, you're character flies feet away or gets stuck.
When you screen you barely bother the NPC, and it's teammate covers instantly.
The computer does not miss free throws 9 out of 10 times even if that player sucks in real life.
If there is a big even 5 feet from paint you are getting contested on drives.
I could go on and on about how the AI is superman and you are high school scrub.

I don't play online so can't comment on that. I only got this for a xmas present cause it was on sale. But I think this was the last straw. Sale or not, I will not be getting future NBA2ks until I see raving positive reviews across the board and all this MT and overtune crap is gone. Hopefully EA makes a better live and on PC next year. They are probably no better than 2k if they had no competition. But competition will keep both in check somewhat.

I only played my team, and it's been much much better than 2k18's. There are so many challenges and different game modes that make the play time of this mode way longer and more fun. It doesn't force you to spend either, because there are some players that are sapphire, amethyst, or even diamond that go for 2k or less my team points in the auction. Really no complaints there. 

Gameplay is much slower than in 2k18, but it makes it a bit more realistic that way. Jump shots are slower but i noticed that it isnt affected by weak defense, unlike in 2k18 where the weakest of D would throw your jumpshot off. 

Anyways, im recommending this because of the My Team, which i think i'll be playing more often than any other mode.

These are just some I can come up of the top of my head:
- Whenever you set the refresh rate above 60Hz (for example 144Hz, or in my case, 240Hz), it causes a game-breaking bug where, in MyCareer, you cannot skip part of the gameplay (simulate the game until next appearance) when you get subbed out. You have to basically have to sit and watch your A.I teammates play for 5-6 minutes every game. There are some workarounds, set the refresh rate back to 60Hz (which kinda suck cause I bought this game to pay in high refresh rate) or ALT-TAB several times until you can sub in.

- This game constantly crashes on my PC. I tried everything, re-installing the GPU driver, re-installing game, checked for missing game files, change in-game setting, updating windows, nothing works. My PC Spec is far above the recommended requirements (3900x + 2080ti).

- The game is basically the same as 2k19, same engine, same graphics, just a little upgrade on the User Interfaces.

- You can basically pay-to-win on this game. It is filled to the brim with micro-transactions.

- You cannot access MyPlayerNation, 2KLeague and Ruffles rewards on PC Versions (Unlike the ones on consoles)

In conclusion,
NBA2K19 V2 is not worth 80 CAD. Don't buy it (unless it's at least 95% off). You can get a lot of burritos for $80",1577162186,1577162186,False,133,33,0.871073603630065918,10,True,False,False,76561198214988656,519,5,26857,27,11177,1601886331

81,60095795,english,"Very good game from the offline POV, MyCareer is cool and fun to do and the builder is nicely done, MyTeam you can do Domination (3 separate levels from Current NBA to Historic Teams and later to All-time teams, along the way you keep receiving rewards and stuff you can either purchase on the auction house or just open packs with MTPoints or VC), triple threat is also cool, you have rewards for up to 1000 wins (Galaxy Opal Dominique Wilkins). The MyGM is also cool to play and very rewarding if you do it correctly and actually know what you're doing.

From the Online POV the game for me is pretty much a 2/10 and I don't give it a 0 because sometimes you find a good enough server to play on and it's pretty cool to play online. Most of the times you get matched up against 10+ levels of overall rankings with a laggy server against a dude that literally has almost a team full of galaxy opals (TOP Level players basically, above 99). 

I'm from Portugal, I played CSGO, Squad, R6S and any other MP games and never had a laggy server to play on and on NBA 2K20 looks like only 1 out of 7-8 games you play with a decent server ping wise and against an equal or almost equal team on the other side. I mean if you're into spending money on the microeconomy stuff and GAMBLE if you can win or not because of the garbage servers, be my guest but as for me I won't play more MP since it's just pointless.

Online gameplay --> 2/10

35,59775425,english,"Been a life long player of the 2k nba franchise. I have been writing negative comments since the introduction of the micro transaction system. It's obvious that it doesn't go away, so this time I write about the game itself.
I use to play My GM a lot. I have finished a 5 year My GM play through with a top 20 global score. With the VC earned I would then play a My Player career. This would give me some VC to start of with a player that could actually score, defend and rebound a bit, which was a way around the transaction system I guess. Even though this means hours and hours of playing. 
This year, the My GM version has been completely changed. There's no more VC to be earned ( or maybe very little when simulating the game ) , so the whole idea of playing My GM is just about the leaderboard. Now I play only single player games, I really don't care much about what the rest of the world is doing, the final result is that I get a global score apparently and this is supposed to make me feel satisfied with the hefty A+ rating game fee. 
In My GM mode, I have clicked the A button probably more then 1000 times. The gameplay is all about ""chit chats"" with players and staff. I wouldn't use Action points in the first days of the week (or limited at least) and then would chit chat with a player sometimes 3 times in a row to get the trust up. That is just weird, I love basketball, but I'm pretty sure that any player wouldn't enjoy going to a restaurant with me 3 times in a day. 
So I would say the My GM has been a major disappointment this year.
The My Player however, I am pretty satisfied with. It's an improvement in gameplay compared to previous years. I have only played C position so far, and I can hit A+ rather quickly in the mycareer and the VC earning goes much quicker as well. I got this game on the black Friday sale after skipping the release because of the once again negative comments. I feel that it's worth the purchase now, if not only the My GM is a complete waste of time, energy , and general happiness of the right thumb.",1576254558,1576254558,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198826412953,43,3,14640,0,4037,1583599334

38,59752673,english,"In simple word: THIS IS THE BEST NBA GAMES EVER.

I know many people won't agree. But, here's my point:
1. I'm NOT PLAYING ONLINE. I enjoy every mechanism of the game. It's so much realistic in offense and defense compared to 2K19. Love the flexibility on new dribble mechanism even though it's much harder for me...
2. The AI much more natural when reacted to our move, more human like. Even 1 on 1 battle feels so much fun in 2K20.

Note: I'm not trying online not because there's so much cheater, or there's so much grinding. But, it's pointless for me. If I want to play my own player, I will just create a player, then play with it. AND the TOP reason that I'm not playing online is: I'm from Indonesia. I use very fast internet connection, and good ping. But still, the server of NBA lagging for my country ( I think ).

SO, IS THE GAME WORTH THE PRICE?
Sorry for most of people that disappointed in this game, but I think it is really worth the price. Just think about the gameplay alone, it's worth it. :)

It's not that I'm not agreeing with all of you that's not satisfied with 2K response to the community, but at least I know the price is right, even though they still need to improve their response and service.

Also, to some extent, you have to make the game realistic and take the player out of the game, but if I'm testing my build, I should stay in the entire game. Testing the build is just about trying things, and it doesn't help to be simulating half the game and not playing in it. I also think the practice drills could seriously be improved on.

2. while the online has hiccups most of the bad reviews are salty Btches who jack up shots online with KOBEEEEE and can't win a game because they don't know the fundamentals of team basketball. 

3. this game has the most fluid and best basketball game play around but it my be too real for those little kids ( the ones putting the bad reviews )  since it's not NBA JAM or some un realistic game like that.

66,55005791,english,"Thankfully, I've not had some of the problems that others are having with actually running the game. Playing mostly on My Career and other than some very bad choppy frame-rate on some of the cut-scenes (and during some of the half-time/ full-time shows) the game has mostly run fine. Don't get me wrong, there a ton of bugs, but I've been lucky enough not to run into any game-breaking ones yet. 

That said, I put in 760+ hours on 2k19, and after only about 20 hours of 2k20, i'm wondering if it's worth putting any more time in. 

The MyCareer story is kind of lame. Apparently, you become the Colin Kaepernick of college hoops. Lame as it is, it was also a little too short and a total waste of Idriss Alba's talents. 

There are also a ton of changes to systems and my neighborhood. A short tutorial or a write up would have been useful. For eg. how do you gain reputation, changes to the physical stats, etc. 

The tweak to player builds is interesting. I would say the jury is out on whether this is a good or bad thing. Same with the badges (swapping out badges at will seems like a cool thing, since there are badges that may be more useful for single player and others which may be more useful if you're playing multi). Except earning them now seems a lot tougher. Also happy not needing to go into the gym after every game to get turbo, that at least is a welcome change. 

But the new stat progression system kind of stinks in how you cannot put points into physicals (Speed, Acceleration, Vertical, Stamina). Apparently, these physical stats and kind of tied into the other stats and they increase bit by bit as you increase the other stats. In theory that sounds ok, but this does not translate well into gameplay once your player hits the NBA. In previous games, the first thing I did was to pump all points into the physical stats. If nothing else, it allows your player to be competitive and keep up with the PC players. This time round this is not possible. The system means you generally won't hit your maximum physical stats until you're close to maxing out ALL your other stats (i.e. end-game). It means you'll be slower, weaker and jump lower than most other PC players unless you are close to max stats. That combined with the change to turbo (using it really terribly drains your stamina) means that 1/2 the time PC players are blowing by you. That's crappy when you're a wing and guarding top-stars, who waltz into the paint at will. But the time i wanted to put my fist through the monitor was when i realised that as a SG, i could not outrun a Centre on a fast break. Things like that really affect enjoyment of the game and I cannot help but cynically feel that all these changes are intended to force players to spend $ on VC to max up faster. 

There is a new simulation system when you are subbed out. Previously, you just press A till you are subbed in or the game ends. Now, there is a choice to watch the game play on before subbing in - but apparently, quite a few players have complained that this feature is bugged and causes the game to go into slow-mo. I've not encountered this thankfully. But the developer who decided that it should be a good idea (when simulating to sub in) to be forced to watch the last few seconds of every half if you're not subbed in should be shot. After a while, it gets tiresome.

Been reading some other reviews on the changes to MyGM. They sound horrendous. After MyCareer, My GM is usually my next favourite mode. Apparently, MyGM has now become something like a mobile app game ...

as for the others gamemodes I didn't really check them out so can't comment on them

overall same mechanics as NBA 2K19

dunking on or posterising opponents is still quite tricky to constantly do so most of my matches consisted of either teammates shooting 3s or me going in for a contested layup

ps. the interview animations and dialogues look and sound really awkward so maybe for 2K21 they could make them sound more realistic and less robotic

- Commentators in the game frequently repeat themselves, post-game interviews also a lot of repeating lines/dialogue.

91,57615735,english,"I never really post reviews, but wow I have to give major props to the people who handled the presentation in game time. Overall NBA 2k20 is kinda sleazy with the micro-transactions. But, when it comes to overall presentation and simulation... WOW this game is tops. 

Say I try to make a tight pass to a guy cutting to the basket... If my player realistically could pull that off the play looks gorgeous! Far better than previous years... the play looks like two players in sync executing the way professionals do. When I make bonehead plays and turn the ball over... it looks like a player had a lapse in judgement... maybe even tries to take it back but cannot... IT IS GORGEOUS!!!

The Story in the My Player mode is actually pretty good as well. I used to be solely a Franchise Mode guy, but this year's story mode is fairly good. I doubt I'll continue it long, but the initial story is good. The micro-transactions really nerf how good your player can be unfortunately. You can have a solid experience, but there is a limit to how good you can get compared to the other pros without investing $$$. 

Franchise mode is so amazingly good this year. I watch teams make intelligent trade proposals! At least mostly... better than previous years. The coaching options like Defensive Match-ups and Strategy screens are simultaneously deeper and easier to understand at the same time! How is that even possible!

The play by play is also outstanding. I get near, actual interviews that are somehow contextual to the actions in the game (again for the most part). I hear J.R. Smith get interviewed and talk about how we were driving the ball to the hole so well... and that's actually true... it's an actual interview that is contextually relevant to the goings on of my particular execution of a simulation... that's just uncanny awesome.

I know at this point I sound like a fanboy... Well I am. This is a great game. The people in charge of the presentation deserve major praise for this achievement.

BUT

This game is probably one of the most inconsistent game I've ever played..   The shot meter for starters... you can have a wide open player shot a three, with 95 on their 3's and have the bar 95% full and the ball will miss..   

Meanwhile someone with 65 on 3s can shoot with someone on them and drill it..  

The shot meter is kind of useless, anything less then full green is like throwing a dice or flipping a coin.. no matter how open or how covered your guy is.. Especially when it comes to the AI..

Anything above Pro and the CPU will be like Jordan in his prime against a middle school team..   

I won't even get started on myteam.. which is again a massive crap shoot..  It's not really needed to spend money, but you better be ready to grind out players for years.. The auction house is laggy, buggy, and generally unfun to use..   Select a bunch of options then sort through 15 pages of ended auctions..   Finally find the cards which you can bid on...  25 seconds left...  I'll bid... you're bid is not highest... ok... big 20 more times and the auction expires and now all your MT coins are gone.

The contracts are always lame,, I get they want to make money on this full priced game, but jeez,, can't toss people a bone and make those infinite contracts a bit less rare..  I mean we paid 60 dollars for this game and now your taking all our coins on contracts..

Did I mention how buggy and wonky the shot meter ... it's even worse in my team.. as the AI just flat out cheats..   Triple Threat, you're playing against Wilt Chamberlin as a 5 ft' dude who never balled before...  The AI will never miss, your team will play Defense like they have on wet sneakers..   Try to switch around to cover the ballhandler yourself and he'll blaze by you with his super speed.. while your guy has tar on his sneakers no matter how fast he normally he..

For fully upgrade your player you will need around 20k VC, not including all the animations, clothes shoes, or stuff like that.At your first season, you would probably get 750VC as your salary plus your performance, so you will get around 800-900 VC every game. Even you can get extra VC from other contracts and team practice, I would say you will need at least 2 seasons for fully upgrade your player.

I really want to like this game, but it has been soooooooo buggy and crashes. Random and excessive load times between games, progression, etc... I even bought a brand new RTX card last week to really enjoy this game. And because this is so similar to last years neighborhood, crib, stores, gym, and everything else... I'm just so confused what the f'ing problem is here?! 

Great story though, awesome character creation options, love the badge upgrade system. A lot of good things in this game, sadly over shadowed by the bugs.

 I can't recommend this game in its current state.

2K, please fix the game we all love!!

UPDATE: 11/11/19

The game still crashes at the end of games played while doing the points load out. They don't care, they aren't going to fix it, and I think it might be time for a class action lawsuit since taking away those assholes money is the only thing that will get their attention.

I am so sick of having to replay games I have won and did amazing in, only for the game to crash, and replay the game with different and sometimes worse result from my crashed game... assuming that game doesn't crash too, which it has!!!

I don't play online and I always hear a lot of backlash for their servers. I don't play MyTeam unlimited or triple threat online (only have played a half dozen games of Triple Threat Online) but I would recommend sourcing more reviews for information on their online play.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a player who have played through 2k11 to 2k20. Some are on PC and some are on console.
I focused on MC mode only.
Conclusion: The MC mode these years made me cancer.

Reason:
1. Years and years, MC mode story kept telling you about a young man chasing dream. But ironically the game mechanism tells you a different story. 
                                  YOU CANT BECOME AS GREAT AS THOSE LEGENDS DOES
You wanna be a great 3pts shooter like curry does?  OK.
You wanna be a great ball handler like curry at the same time?  Maybe.
You wanna be a great slasher like curry at the same time?  Nope, only average level, cause your life is limited.
What about defense? Nope, you are gonna be shitty on defense that everyone can one step dribble through you easily.
                                       YOU JUST CANT BE AS GREAT AS THOSE LEGENDS DOES
Really frustrating.

2. Stupid teammate AI and God like opponents AI
Old problems on MC are still there, and never seems to be fixed, or it's their purpose to do so.
How stupid the teammate AI is? Try call a pick, slash in, drag the defense under basket, and pass to the open C or PF teammate. Guess what? they will either hold the ball rather than shoot it immediately and wait for the defense covers him again and than shoot, or skip the offense chance and run a random play on the playbook.
WHY? HOW? Mystery.

3. The unreal RPG experiment 
RPG is a good mechanism, but not with a bad implementation.
In the story you'll be a 1st round about top ten picks player if you try hard.
But a weird thing happened. An overall rating 65 player in a lottery pick?
Dude, this guy can't even sink an open mid range!
Even my grandma can do it.
The only thing this guy can do as well as my grandma is the moving speed.
This dude, this lottery pick dude moves like he's carrying a 100KG bag on his back.
When ever he needs to do a sharp turn, it takes him 1.5 second.
He's in the fxcking NBA. And he needs 1.5 second to do a sharp turn. OMFG
When it comes to the situation that you've been double team, its ugly.
This dude cant even pass a ball anymore. 
This pathetic dude has played through the NCAA for four years, and when it comes to deal with the double team, he cant even pass the ball properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not finished, but I'm tired and got to sleep.
Hope I wont be dreaming bout these crap.

This, in my opinion, is a good game core ruined by excessive microtransactions. Yet, at it's core, 2k20 is not a bad game. Unlike 18, which had no defense at all and blowby's were incredibly easy, or 19 where a guy like JJ Reddick could play lockdown D on LeBron, 2k20 actually has  a good balance of defense and offence. The new badge system is great; it allows for more customization and an overall more unique gamestyle to each player. Post play has been nerfed. Centers being able to be rim protectors and outside shooters is rare. There are still issues with myTeam and myCareer, though. The myCarer story is not good. Somehow even worse than 19, imo. Both are stil microtransaction hell, and it is the samer prk as last year. But, by itself, the core gameplay is good.

I primarily play myLeague, which hasn't really changed. MyGM, on the other hand, is completely different. There is no more just cringe inducing dialogue; you have to deal with sponsorships, meet with players, hold a weekly press conference, and manage all aspects of team business and running operations. That being said, the new action points system kinda sucks. You shouldn't need them to play a game. Plus, quarter length is locked at 6 minutes and I believe difficulty is locked at pro.

14,56046853,english,"The engine has improved from last year. For those who enjoy realism modeled on the court, this is the best 2k yet. VC rewards for playing MyCareer (actual NBA games - not park) has improved but the VC facet of the game in general is still trash.

The game is overall better and MyLeague has increased the available tweaks and controls over the league. Park play is better (less laggy so far), but it's not my preferred method as significant input lag is unplayable to me. It's not a light year leap, but for a less than 1 year dev effort and version update, it's as good as any other years' progress. Also, WNBA ftw!

My biggest gripe (paid VC aside) is that what my player can be (skill-wise) e.g. a one of a kind player such as Lebron, Steph, MJ, Giannis is limited because the same character that you use solo is forced to be your multiplayer character. Let park attributes and career attributes be managed separately for balance even through the same character. In real life, there are players who are sharpshooters and elite finishers at the rim. I don't want to be blocked from that in my solo career progression because of park (where the caps actually make sense).

Overall, the core game play is better than ever and the solo MyCareer experience (and fortunately more generic story) is better than any previous year. VC is still VC and park servers are still laggy, granted slightly less.

21,55593511,english,"Come on people..., the gameplay is the best it's ever been and the graphics are pretty good as well. The only limitation is that it has to play well and look good on this current generation of consoles as most of its sales are on generated from console sales. Seems to me like everyone negatively reviewing this game is just hating on the VC , the over the top online park, and the microtransactions, but just for actually simulating playing the actual game of basketball, it is topnotch! Just look at most if not all of the negative reviews and most all of them speak negatively about the aspects of the game that don’t even pertain to actual basketball gameplay! As a NBA 2K console player for many years now, I am enjoying playing NBA 2K basketball (now with the WNBA) on my laptop and while it can always be improved upon, it is by no means a bad or terrible game. It actually plays quite well considering the recent patches. Seems to me like a lot of people are just jumping on the negative bandwagon because it cost real money to make a fictional player in their likeness play well in the create a player online portion of the game. Personally, I believe not every  personalized created player online should be ranked a 95 or higher overall player right out the gate anyways... (That would be some really unrealistic and crazy gameplay). Anyways, if you play this game to simulate the actual game of basketball and the NBA League it does that job quite well! 

Note: if you play this game on a NVIDIA equipped laptop be sure to dedicate your graphics card to your laptop as the game for some reason will try and use the internal integrated graphics card as a primary graphics card? To do this, right click on the desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel. Once in the control panel select manage 3D settings and under Global Settings select High Performance NVIDIA Processor, apply and then you will be good to go. Learned this the hard way at first as the game played really slowly on my laptop until I figured this out. Now it plays smoother and better than my console.

The comments about this being a copy/paste of 2K19 are accurate, this game feels identical to the previous installment, save for some minor interface updates. Even with the new Rookies, they haven't included actual photos of them, they're just computer generated faces, so if you're buying this game to get the most recent up to date teams, you may as well just stick with 2K19 and download a rookie/roster update pack, because that is all this game really is, a $60 roster update. It comes across as very lazy.

For that, I've given this game a negative rating. I'm also pretty turned off by the whole casino/gambling thing, but as mentioned, I only play MyLeague, so I thankfully don't have to experience those things.

Hope EA works out those kinks that keep crashing peoples computers before releasing NBA2K21. Please get more testing and validation staff to test PC and console varieties and work those problems out from the get go........

63,55403576,english,"This is actually the best 2K I've played. I've played 31 hours and i'm already 82 overall without any microtransactions and loving every minute of it. 

I've got 2K15 through 2K19 on steam and those were ok for the most part, however I have always played on Hall of Fame 12 minute quarters. In those games it felt like my team was absolutely useless, I couldn't hit shots and just became a volume shooter and the movement slow and clunky. Also when they had changed the free throw to a badge and just how you got badges in the previous games was an absolute grind to Hall of Fame badges (or just badges in general were a grind).

However with 2K20 the new skill system is amazing, not hard to ""grind"" them at all because you get a lot of points to unlocking a level in the skills from just playing, in combination with the extra practice sessions its no issue and a huge plus. The movement and speeds of all the characters feels a million times better, you can do stop and go moves, use your quick speeds and you don't have C's catching you down the floor on the break anymore. Loving the story as well, really interesting take on your way to the NBA, with a bonus of great actors to be apart of it. As for the difficulty level, as I said I play Hall of Fame 12 minute quarters and this is the only 2K (2K15, 2K16, 2K17, 2K18, 2K19) that I can actually play Hall of Fame properly without getting utterly frustrated from it seeming like nothing can go right. 

I feel like its got horrible reviews because people look to purchasing microtransactions to be amazing straight out of college, which isn't realistic, and then complain about how aggressive the microtransactions can be. And yes, obviously its pretty microtransaction themed in a way, but at no point have I thought about buying microtransactions in this 2K. In previous I had because I got so frustrated that I couldn't do anything right ingame, so to solve that I had bought them. In this 2K, you can actually play just fine with the VC you make naturally throughout the game.

The single-player gameplay is fantastic, though. Easily the best basketball simulation so far, one of the best sports simulations as well. The game feels less hyper and unrealistically quick as previous games, all in the name of realism. Graphics seem slightly better than 2K19, and the animations are much better. You can customize all of the animations from previous 2ks, as well as new things, such as dribble/running style. A lot of subtle jumpshot and dribble animations were added, making the game feel much more realistic. I enjoy the new MyCareer system, except for the awfully long grind. In-game, it's pretty enjoyable as a campaign experience. As a person who likes the single-player, simulation aspect of 2K, and occasionally creating custom characters to insert into the NBA, this is easily the best 2k yet.

The online is less than worthless.

On the other hand, the npc team you are playing against, they freaking make  contested shots  with defenders all over them.

Examples:
For some reason now there is a better chance of shooting an early shot and it going in, then shooting a slightly early just off the green window. 
No matter what 2K promises the servers will never be good. Because if 2K can manage to save any money for in game performance, you'll be safe to bet a million dollars that they will surrender customer experience for MONEY.
Shot contest is a joke. You can contest a shot / layup and be given 'good shot contest' only for the shot to go in. 

Don't buy the game now. Wait until next year. The game will be much more polished ( hopefully ) and you will have a much better experience compared to buying it right now. 

In totality 2K is so out of touch with their community and game. Simple bugs and glitches aren't even noticed by the dev team, but are noticed within the first 20 minutes of launch by the community. They released an un-finished product per usual.

You're supposed to create more than one player, I guess (thus more opportunity for microtransactions).

52,55159009,english,"Wasted opportunity.

I didn't want to write a review, but I feel like between the trolls and the good reviews there's a lack of details about why this game is as bad as it is. I'm not at all surprised about the micro-transactions, lets be real, this is 2k they're not going to slow down on that. I do understand that it's tough to make an annual sports title that actually has new content and I'm happy to say that 2k, for the most part, has actually done some great work with some of the new features. However, MOST of these are implemented in the wrong way, and/or broken. 

The progression system is really good, it allows you to actually choose which attributes you want to upgrade. That was one of my biggest issues with 2k19 and before. Instead of hoping to get your next ball handling/3 pt attribute upgrade, you're allowed to upgrade any of them to your cap right off the bat, that's really great. Here come the issues...

The shooting, it is soooo inconsistent. I have made shooting builds and miss open 3s and 2s CONSISTENTLY. So basically the only way to make shots is to get a green release, which for most of the people playing this game casually, myself included, its not fun to shoot because you have to concentrate so hard to make your shots. And this is offline too... Not even in the park. This means that it doesn't really matter how you build your character unless you know your jumpshot or have badges, which kind of removes the point of attributes in the first place. 

Next is badges. You basically are a 10 OVR if you have no badges. If you have an 80 3pt and no badges, you shouldn't even attempt a 3 because you're most likely gonna miss. ON PRO!!! On top of that it takes for ever to get a badge upgrade point. I'm a 90 OVR with 5 playmaking badges and it takes me 6-8 games on 12 minute quarters to get 1 badge, which is basically upgrading 1 badge to bronze, unless you have more, then you can respec, make some HOF, gold, silver, etc. It really sucks this way because, why should I even upgrade my 3pt in the first place if I can't shoot without HOF range extender, deadeye, steady shooter, difficult shots, quickdraw. I just don't know what they were thinking.

This game ultimately isn't rewarding, getting yourself open for looks only to miss on a full white isn't my idea of fun, it's more frustrating than I ever thought it would be. 

In the end, I cannot recommend the 2k series from this point on unless they address these issues. Hopefully micro-transactions go away in a couple more 2k's and maybe soon we'll actually be able to make an NBA superstar, but until then, save your money, it's really not worth 80$.",1568747187,1568747319,False,7,0,0.545078575611114502,0,True,False,False,76561198167857140,83,4,9190,0,3083,1586823202

2,55041396,english,"So first off, I'm a fool for buying the game this year. No way around it. 

Now lets get to the game itself. 
From my 7-8 hours of gameplay, i still see the same issues that the last few editions had. Let's name a few. 

Disliked the archetype system? Well this year that's changed, into the exact same thing without the names. There's literally no difference, except instead of sharpshooter/slasher/defender/etc, you now have pie charts that does the exact same thing.
Want a Melo clone? Well fuck you, have a watered down version that either doesn't know how to finish at the rim, shoot 3's, post up or have a ball handling stat that will enable you to go by terrible defenders. Chose 2, and forget all about defence. 
Wanna make a fucking Terrence Ross? Well pick between Dunks, 3pt and finishing at the rim. You can't have all 3. 

Wanna double team? You'll get minus point for leaving your assignment. Doesn't matter if you get a steal and win the game because of it. You left a person open, so the game will fault you for it. 

Got less than 70 in block rating? Your character will jump AWAY from the ball. I've played and trained basketball for tiny people. Even the 8 year olds know to jump TOWARDS the ball. 

Dislike cutscenes? Well bohoo. This game will force you to watch them. 

Liked last years choices when it came to MyGM? well fuck you, this year you only get the storied version that nobody liked in 2k19.

I could go on and on and on and on and .... But seriously, we all knew this was gonna be the game. 1 step forward 1 step back. Of course if you expect any focus on online play and hackers, well you're as big an idiot as i was. 

I realise my next words are gonna sound cliché, but I won't be buying 2k games for a few years.

I shouldn't have bought it this year, but i somehow fell for their marketing tricks and decided to give them 1 last chance. And holy fuck do i regret doing so. 

This is a trash game made by a trash developer, produced by a trash production team. 

It's trash.

1st Edit: So i've played a bit more, and i've encountered so many other issues, that i think i need to keep going with this. Bear in mind that these are all bugs that were in previous years editions too.

If you pass and the ball even scratches a player on the opposite team, it's about 50-50 if it'll count as a turnover or not. Doesn't matter if they actually had control over the ball or not. 

I'm currently an 80 overall, despite not having a single attribute above 70, and alot of my attributes being below 50. So this year we're able to play as the most overrated NBA star to ever grace the earth. Thanks 2K, you sure know how to give people what they want. 

Demarcus Cousins. So his injury apparently affected his shooting mostly, since he's now in the mid 60's on open 3 pointers, and high 50's on open midrange shots. Of course we all know lower body injuries fuck with your hands. 
But in that case they must have changed his tendencies too right? Nope. Every time i pass to him, he takes the jumper and of course misses. He might honestly be the worst player in the game right now, considering his stats vs tendencies. 

Teammates don't run their lanes or roll towards the basket. The amount of times a teammate will move to my exact position instead of rolling to an open basket is like 99% of the time. 

I'm using a Dualshock 4 Controller, and despite it being fully supported on the PS4, it's still not fully supported on PC.

EXPERIÊNCIA TERRÍVEL!

O modo Mycareer é o único modo que jogo, e o menos caça níquel também.
Entretanto, se você optar por evoluir o seu personagem com as partidas será uma decepção.

Os personagens ou são rápidos ou são grandes, eu simplesmente não consigo jogar de SF, PF ou C pela velocidade deprimente deles.

Seu jogador respira e a stamina despenca, existem algumas badges que diminuem isto então eu preciso deixar de colocar em uma badge interessante da minha gameplay para investir numa badge pra não dropar stamina, um absurdo total! O jogo ainda te pune por não acompanhar as jogadas que claramente são impossíveis de fazer antes do 99.

A atualização nerfou tanto meu playmaker que eu precisei evoluir mais 10 pontos pra ficar parecido como estava antes, que decepção. Se você quiser jogar como slasher, vai se estressar, as infiltrações estão ridiculamente difíceis, te obrigando a jogar como shooter.

Infelizmente eu gosto muito de basquete, senão passava fora dessa bomba, quem gosta pouco é melhor nem comprar. Com a 2k sem concorrência essa bomba vai continuar a se perpetuar por todos os anos.

Eu nunca fiz uma análise negativa de algum jogo antes, mas esse eu me senti na obrigação de vir aqui e fazer isso.


TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE

Mycareer mode is the only mode I play, and the least pay to play as well.
However, if you choose to evolve your character with matches it will be a disappointment.

The characters are either fast or big, I just can't play SF, PF or C for their depressing speed.

Your player breathes and stamina drops, there are some badges that slow this down so I need to stop putting in an interesting badge of my gameplay to invest in a badge to not drop stamina, total nonsense! The game still punishes you for not following moves that are clearly impossible to do before 99.

The patch nerfed my playmaker so much that I needed to evolve 10 more points to look like it was before, what a disappointment. If you want to play as a slasher, you'll get stressed, the infiltrations are ridiculously difficult, forcing you to play as a shooter.

Unfortunately I like basketball very much, otherwise it was out of this bomb, who likes little is better not even buy. With 2k without competition this bomb will continue to perpetuate for years to come.

I have never done a negative review of any game before, but this one I felt compelled to come here and do it.",1568320240,1568338290,False,3,0,0.511533260345458984,0,True,False,False,76561198207098247,51,1,16034,112,2146,1602038920

Quick Play Online: pretty much broke
- most of the games encounter a problem that doesn't allow it to finish (and not counted on your record). I have a very good Internet connection and network seems fine, but netcode or whatever on NBA2k side seems terrible. After all these years, errors like these still have not been fixed. It's not a new error on PC and game play issues surrounding online vs. have been there for years. 
- still after all these years, no microphone supported game chat against opponents on PC
- why am i still buying this game? because i love basketball and this game, but... it's getting a bit silly.
- i remember when 2k was light years ahead of nba live. Nowadays, I wish nba live would come back to PC, so 2k would actually have to fix their broken game. Or anything? Maybe CD Project Red can make a basketball game.
- i'm happy to review other aspects of the game, but by far quick play online is my favorite (and almost unplayable).",1568335773,1568335773,True,0,1,0.368271946907043457,0,True,False,False,76561198078730521,131,3,8371,0,923,1596935630

DO NOT BUY unless you're fine with just kind of accepting that it's a good game buried under several bad ones, and if you don't mind having to do repeat standout performances in games you've already played (for instance, break the NBA 3-pt record, play for 40 minutes, barely win game on buzzer beater, then crash and lose every ounce of it).

You cannot even compete with computer if you dont pay in MC or MT mode. Try yourself as a 65 overall in MC NBA game and you will be like a fool. Try  yourself with sapphire or lower card to play against diamond or higher card team and you will see god. Difficulty is a joke, if you have galaxy opal cards, hall of fame is easy. Secondly, make the offline content worse and force you to play online mode so go back to rule No.1. Thirdly, trash-like servers all around the world. No matter you are in US/EU/Asia, you will face network error anytime and loss your game progress no matter what you did. Not to mention there is a super lag in the server response which make the online play unplayable. (So you have to pay the money but we dont make sure there is a good server, hahhh) Fourth, so many bugs in the game. Players like air can run into each other's body/face/ball in the game if you look replay which is ridiculous. Auction house in MT mode cannot work correctly. Eg, if you search for silver cards, you will find bronzes. Auction house even broke down in the final month of 2k19 which means they dont fix it for the whole year when you play! 3 vs 3 offline in MT mode is unavailable. (Did 2k really serious to launch an unfinished game?) The program icon for 2k20 is still 2k19! So 2k is telling you directly that we are selling 2k19 again and you need to know all the customers you guys are fool! Last but not least, in the online game mode, so many cheaters, they use super power they force you to lose connection and lose the game but 2k did nothing. They only care about how to push you to spend more money but not the game experience!
Overall, 2k basketball series is DEAD already and I really hope a new series to be available on PC, eg LIVE from EA, welcome back. I would try any other basketball games if they are close.

- Shoe transactions are duplicated (paid twice with VC)

overall this game feels very cheap with zero effort made compared to other NBA 2k series.
Stay with 2k19, no point buying the same game twice. MyCareer mode did not live up to any hype,
story line is really disappointing with nothing notable. The actual games feel a lot slower defensively, and on offense, it
feels way too easy to cross anyone. (Shooting feels slow, but i think there are badges for it later on) The new character build 
makes defense look useless. anyways, hate this game, really want to return it at the same time i wish 2k would send out an update to fix it. in the meantime, stay away.

I'm a MY GM player and have always liked the option to build a team through trades/the draft and then play around with that team whenever I wanted to in the past games. However, with this game's god awful AP system, I cannot do that. 

Instead of being able to build your team and staff and play at your leisure, you're now given a quota of points and games are auto-simulated behind the scenes. You can either take control of your team and play the basketball games, OR do the team building stuff... not both like you could in past games. Why restrict a game mode this way?

First: I'm not sure if everyone has this problem, but when I start in offseason in myleague and select to use the real 2019 draft class none of the rookies of the 2019 draft (ie zion, rj, morant) have scanned faces. They all have these generic faces which look roughly similar. All the attributes on them are the same, and their scanned faces do show up if I start at beginning of season, so I have no idea why this is happening.

Second: I keep getting an error code: 95b37d16, which doesn't even register on the 2kstatus webpage youre supposed to check when receiving error codes.

73,55023359,english,"I bought this game just for the annual check-up on if the alleged developers have fixed the very basic features, which would serve as the basis for this game to start distantly resemble a team sport. I try to enjoy this game as a realistic basketball simulation, playing mostly 5v5 vs AI. I find it hard to enjoy this game.

No. The automatic playcalling option still doesn't not work. The on-going bug since atleast NBA 2k16, has not been fixed. 

No. As a ballhandler, you still cannot protect the ball, if you want to call a play from the playbook. Or call any offensive tactic, whatsoever.

These two flaws alone should help you decide in favor of not purchasing this game. I don't realistically see anyone with any bit of basketball history, to be able to enjoy this game, due to these two afore mentioned flaws in the game alone.

The ballhandler being restricted from simultaneously protecting the ball and calling a play, is claimed to be an intended functionality by the ""product support"". That feature interplays together with the automatic playcalling bug. Often times a play is automatically called, that directs AI players to bring their defenders close to the ballhandler, who is desperately trying to go through the clunky playbook UI. While restricted to be able to protect the ball. In this year's ""rendition"" of the ""game"" there is an extra layer of UI to choose and pass as you try to call a play from the playbook as a ball handler. This makes it even slower to call a play. The NBA 2k19 displayed the most lopsided AI perimeter defense. Allen Iverson was unable to dribble to the basket through the perimeter defense of the likes of Shaq. That aspect of the game has been balanced. But with this new UI rework, we stand at the same woeful situation as with NBA 2k18.

I'm forced to use quotations around the words developers, game, edition, version, rendition, bug and fix. The product support claim, that known bugs will be fixed in future game versions. If it's called a _game version_, why do we have to pay full price for it, just like we would for a brand new game? On the other hand, if it's a brand new game, then why is it's functionality the exact carbon copy of its predecessor? Launched with a couple of broken features, which are then restored. Why would you call developers with the term developers, if they don't develop anything? They merely break aspects of the game, and then restore them back.

26,55009324,english,"MyGM used to be the mode that I played all the time starting with 2K16. Look at my time in 2K19 on Steam; that's all MyGM.  It was what I moved to when they implimented the stories into MyPlayer. I could create said player and draft him and play through his whole career. I liked that you could customize it and that content creators could upload their rosters and/or draft classes for you to use so that you could sort of have updated rosters through a couple years (barring all the bizarre trades and the Spurs getting horrible no matter what). Along with that came customizable difficulty and sliders for contracts, trades, progression, and injuries that gave MyGM ""realism.""
At his point, all the customization I loved is gone and now it forces us to compete against each other in a ranking system in a single player mode that was just there for us to mess around in. They've stripped basically all the customization out of it save for the difficulty setting. You can't even play the full 12 minute quarters. I'm sure it's still in Season Mode, but I want that little difference between that and the old MyGM mode. It was just enough immersion for me to keep coming back to the game.
Another thing that kills it for me is MyPlayer. They told us that we could customize our player's progression and overall max stats individually, but that's only half true if I'm being generous. We still have to use the broken arc type system that can be abused in the Park and handicaps you in two skill areas. The only difference is that now we're even more restricted on how good our players can get because we have to allot our attributes within that arc type, and you don't enough ""upgrades"" to max out that arc type.
I'm also tired of these preludes and how heavy the mode focuses on story. I like seeing all these cameos, sure, but I remember back in 2K14 when the story was minimal and didn't impede on the fun of having your character actually somewhat be you. They were a blank slate and the arc type system still allowed your character to excel at all areas. 
They weren't forced into a set story-line that lasts hours longer than the actual gameplay it's supposed to build around. I don't care about the story. It's not engaging; it's disruptive. Sure, you can skip through it and ignore the whole story, but I couldn't even make it that far. And I don't want to play a ton of games that aren't even in the NBA before I can get drafted.
It wouldn't be such a problem to have them give us these narratives in MyPlayer or give us the new competitive MyGM mode if they would let us opt out of them for the classic versions. I can't imagine that it would even be that much work to do, they did it last year.

- When I think 0 progress is bad enough, team practices now actually give me negative points and badge progress is reset to 0. Am I a joke to you? What am I Markelle Fultz?

Do me a favor and do yourself a favor and dont buy this crap nba2k20 game.

Input lag online is horrible, offline it is also felt. The game plays like the shitty nba2k19 with a slightly adjusted defensive AI awareness so that the AI defense sticks to you like shit but not as much as 2k19. the playcalling and online team selection the shit is similar to 2k19, which means the playcalling is not back to the 2k18 easy to handle menu and easy to call a play, and you cant play with 1 team online you need to play with different tiers to advance which means you cant have a favourite team. which means if your favourite real life team is a tier 3 team you get to play them only once every 5 games. anyway this is not the issue, the issue is input lag that is horrible enough to make you want to crash your computer. 
gameplay feels like the game is playing by itself without you contributing to anything.

67,54998483,english,"Wow. 

So, let me just start off by saying, I really don't care at all for the MyCareer/MyTeam aspects of this (anymore) thanks to 2K monetizing it and making it grindy (not to mention the cringe-worthy storylines and dialog). My bread and butter is really MyGM mode. MyLeague would be my preferred option, except every 2K for the last several years has bare-boned MyLeague in favor of MyGM, leaving out crucial features like morale changes (I benched Russ the entire first half of this season to test for instance, and his morale didn't drop one bit in MyLeague), not to mention other features such as badges on staff and other aspects. So really, there is no ""perfect"" mode for me, thanks to how 2K has broken these modes apart.


Anyway, so the last several years I've been playing MyGM, because with all its flaws, it's still at the best experience available (unfortunately). 2K19's MyGM was actually fairly decent, it gave us most of the options available in MyLeague, while still retaining its own feel. It was fine. Apparently that wasn't going to fly with 2K.

So fast-forward to 2K20. MyGM has been bastardized and is TOTAL GARBAGE. Gone is the ability to edit your players -- AT ALL. Want to change Ben Simmons from a PG to a SF? Can't do it. Want to make AD a PF instead of Center since LA already has Boogie and Dwight at Center? Nope, not anymore.

The entire ""edit player"" option is gone in MyGM. You can no longer edit a player's number (so now if a goofy new player comes to OKC and takes #0, well, even though it's unrealistic, you're stuck with it). You can no longer designate a player as a playmaker in the edit settings. You can no longer edit their accessories. You can no longer do ANYTHING we could previously do in those settings in other iterations -- it's totally gone. I get removing the ability to edit other teams players, admittedly there were ways to really cheese the system last year, such as changing other teams' players that you wanted to crazy positions (like Andre Drummond as a PG) in order to make them tradeable, so if they had removed the ability to edit other teams' players, I would be ok with that. But you are telling me as a GM, I can't change the positions of my own players to evolve with my team? What?!


On top of that, you can no longer use a custom roster anymore. Honestly, I wouldn't care much about this personally, the only reason I use it is because 2K still lists KD as 6'9, despite the fact he is clearly not and has admitted so himself, so it looks goofy seeing him next to Giannis who is 2"" taller than him in the game, even though they are the same height in real life. 


Also, another HUGE missing feature, is that I can no longer set the quarter length, or sim the games I play to have realistic minutes and stats, so now everything is off if I decide to play my own games (which if you don't, what is even the point of playing?). Why was this removed? It makes no damn sense. We can no longer make any other difficulty edits, other than a generic (and totally vague and unhelpful) option to select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty at the beginning, and that's it. 


And don't even get me started on the new ""action point"" system. I still don't understand it, and it still makes no sense, but I can already tell it's awful. Apparently, you have to do something every single day if you want to be able to even play a game -- I can't even just fucking select a game to play on the calendar anymore, it won't let me. I have to do BS tasks and other things each day just to advance. The NBA season is long! I don't want to literally do hundreds of things that are mostly meaningless every season just to be able to play games I want to play. 


There's a lot of other things I am forgetting in the heat of the moment, and I may come back and edit this as I remember/discover more. 

But the main takeaway is that this game has been severely stripped down from the MyGM aspect, to the point that it is pretty much unplayable. Again, none of this would be an issue if MyLeague were given the same basic features and systems that MyGM has, such as working player morale, coaching badges, a feeling that players actually care what you do, etc, but that has been neglected for years by 2K. I suspect it's because they want people playing only modes which include options to spend VC, and if you can customize the game mode to make the league how you want it, how are they going to get money out of you? 

This game is really gross. I'm going to give MyGM a while longer, but I may legit ask for a refund. I keep asking myself ""why"" throughout my experience with this game. MyGM was fixed and fine last year, WHY did they strip it down and make it so restrictive? Restrictive and prohibitive is the best way to describe it. 

I won't be buying 2K next year. I'll wait until a decent version is cracked, and then just grab it that way. I don't care for any of the online BS because it's already been turned into a grindfest in order to milk money out of people for a game they already paid for, so in my eyes 2K did this to themselves. What a gross and disgusting company. 

Stay away from this game.

I don't see the difference at all. It feels a bit clunky running around and the stores really are not that great. I played the Myplayer story and i liked it. Some parts were confusing and didn't really seem like a real players experience to me. Over all good acting and game play. On the court it sometimes feel clunky just like 2k19 but feels faster and more like a basketball simulation. So from playing Madden football and playing this,  NBA2K is by far the better game. Football i love more than anything but this game is a better all around package. If you played madden you know what I'm saying. If you like solo play and just want to work on Myplayer or play franchise mode this game is for you. I also think this game gets a bad rep because there is always so many problems when released.

The game makers should be embarrassed. 
Steam should be embarrassed they sold this crap. 
Right now, in its current state, the game is not at all playable. 

The first thing you notice is it takes forever just to connect after you download. 

When you get into the game, even on my 4K computer, it runs with latency. 
At 4k resolution, the game will not let you run faster than 30 mhz refresh rate. 
At 60 mhz and at about half resolution, the frame rate is terrible even on low settings. 
The game videos do not play but instead give you a choppy green screen. 
If you get passed all that and can get to MyPlayer and make a character, you'll find more issues. 
The menus do not always work. Especially when simply trying to exit. Hit A. Nothing happens. You have to minimize and then close the application and restart. 
So you're building a player. Sometimes it will let you choose what he looks like and sometimes it'll just send you straight to ability making. 
After you choose your position, your ratings for various stats, etc, and you save your player, when you go to load it, you will something else. Like I made a Shooting Guard that can Slash to the basket. I ended up with a Small Forward with a different ability. I made a center playmaker and ended up with a Center paint defender.  
With my center, I was shooting deep 3's and did not miss a single shot. On either player I created, I did not miss a shot. I did not play very many minutes, but still did not miss a shot in maybe a dozen or more attempts. 

After all of this, I decided to ask for a refund, so unaware of what other problems there lies in other modes of the game or further along in a game or in MyStory mode beyond a few minutes. I am sure there are other issues.

Every time I uploaded my face scan, it would say error and then make me do another face scan. I got sick of it not working, so I created a player based off a face in the game. During the customization, it skips a bunch of things I would want to change, and locks in a semi-customized player. I played career mode for 20 minutes and cringed and found myself skipping the cutscenes since they were so cheesy and obvious. 

I thought I would delete my career and try again today for making a player. I deleted my career, and when I went to start a new career, it had that same semi-customized player locked in without any way for me to make a new player or change the appearance.
