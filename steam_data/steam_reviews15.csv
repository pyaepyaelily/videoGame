Now that the company is attacking a large portion of users who play with mods and working to restrict the use of mods it seems pointless to have the game.

2015-04-17,0,0,275,False,Recommended,Amazing game rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didn't that was achieved anyway but i'm sure they were. Amazing graphics better than any console graphics 60fps makes it so much better and feel like you're actually there at times when you're in the amazing... 1st person mode! Which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the PC. Director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is ALOT of fun when bored in the game. Definitely recommended (If you have a graphics card of atleast Radeon HD 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one but yeah definitely recommended!,Grand Theft Auto V

If Take 2 had a brain they would clap down on 8 and 9 year olds playing a game they have no business playing not a modding community that has made them millions in sales because the mods are better than the orgional game content. As im concerned they can take their ridicilous over priced shark cards and all future titles and shove them up thier bank accounts. There work any more is repeditive and there other games that you can mod where the owners arent money crazed nut jobs. I feel like ive wasted three years and alot of time for nothing.

2017-06-16,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,I stopped playing this game a long time ago but recent events with the cease and desist towards the developers of OpenIV compelled me to write this review. I'm hoping that no one else will buy into the awful practices that Take Two are conducting here. I never got the chance to play GTA V's campaign when it was released the first time around so that part was fun at least. However once I started getting into GTA Online with friends it became apparent very quickly that Rockstar does very little to combat the blatant hackers which ruin the experience for legitimate players. In addition there have been multiple occasions that Take Two have shown fervent hostility towards the modding community that help keep their game alive. I could go on but it's nothing you won't see in the rest of the negative reviews here. Please don't support this developer as it's clear they don't care about their playerbase and this most likely won't change any time soon.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-25,0,0,230,False,Recommended,"This is hands down the best single player experience I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I own this game for Xbox 360 Playstation 4 and PC and have played through the story 4 times in total. Every single playthrough has been just as fun as the first time even though I know what's coming. The game is not running very well on the Xbox 360. It struggles to upkeep the 30 fps that it is locked to.When I got it for PS4 I was stunned by the graphical upgrade and 60 fps. I had so much more fun than I had on the Xbox but it wasn't until I got it on PC I got to know this game's full potential. Not to mention all the mods that exist which further increases single player experience. The story is well written and the concept of three main characters was new to me at the time. It's like a perfect combination between a movie and a game. Sure many missions involves driving from A to B but somehow it doesn't get boring and repetitive. I think a strong factor is that there's usually very well written and clever conversations between the characters in the car while doing so especially between Franklin and Lamar. They'll undoubtedly make you laugh. You don't really get to know much about the past of the characters but it doesn't really matter that much as you get launched in to a every entertaining series of events that creates a complete view of each of these character's personality. Like I mentioned before what really makes this game shine is the very well written conversations along with great acting. You just never want this game to end. As for the online part of this game it's basically revolves around who can afford the most shark cards and brag the most. It doesn't take you long to realise that everything is made so that you pretty much need to buy a shark card if you want to be able to afford it in this century. On top of that it's a giant meat grinder with high level players giving a hard time for low level ones. And as if that's not enough pretty much every session has a ""modder"" (or as I would call it cheater). The positive thing is that there's weekly updates and they're always free.If you're buying this for its single player experience then hell yes BUY IT but if you're buying it to play multi player I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere.",Grand Theft Auto V

The day had come and instantly bought and started to enjoy GTA V like we've never expierenced it before.

2016-12-30,0,0,226,False,Not Recommended,Edit/Update I had to update my initial review due to new experiences circulating and my want to support the community.Where is the single player DLC that has been rumored and teased over the years? Banning modding that was a heavy part of the community and drive to keep players in the game by playing the way they wanted?Mods got banned for stupid reasons if you don't support the community they won't support you. My way of supporting the community is re reviewing into an unrecommendation.Original Review Great installment to the GTA Franchise more engaging and entertaining than the previous ones usually I get into the game and get sick quickly of all the driving time and repetitive missions. This one was refreshingly entertaining with their usual quips on the radio but had a lot of extra. Coming from multiple main protagonists to being able to boost their individual stats doing different side quests and training. Each character had a unique way to engage the world too which was really fun to witness. Their attention to detail was amazing too grass moves around as it would when you walk on it in real ilfe sweat appears on your characters while you sprint etc.As soon as I got online I started losing frames every couple seconds. It got to the point of unplayability and it bled over into single player. My screen would freeze every about 5 seconds with no fix in sight. I searched online for hours and troubleshooted for a few days to no avail. Ended up not being able to play single player or multiplayer after that point. What I did witness online was a good introducing of the online character from Lamar and a crazy amount of hackers before I did get banned though.Single Player Campaign 9/10Online Multiplayer 1/10Would recommend this game if it was on a deal and you didn't want to play online.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar must be well aware about the fact that you cannot access GTA Online while you have installed any OpenIV modThe statement ""Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody"" is just wrong and they know it. OpenIV does not allows or supports any kind of GTA Online mods. We always supported Rockstar in their right to protect GTA Online from hacks and cheats.

2017-06-16,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,"One of the top five most sold games in the world and they only wanted more. They couldn't handle not selling enough shark cards but its not like they didn't sell they did and they sold so much they completely gave up on any future single player content. They focused on multiplayer only content with extremely high priced objects in game which to afford you need to buy shark cards. They didn't even bother to add some of the multiplayer content into the single player. So to keep singleplayer fun and intersting if you're not a multiplayer kind of person you'd need to mod the game using OpenIV they saw this as ""taking away from the multiplayer experience"" and they thought that they were not monetizing their games enough. They ordered a cease and desist against the OpenIV team. If they think this game is worth more than $60 they are wrong. Don't let them step on us anymore than they already have. They are saying ""You can't modify your game that you bought we need more money from you so you are going to buy our shark cards"". If Take Two doesnt stop being greedy and manipulting I will never purchase any more of their products and will openly and activly oppose them. I used to love this game.

2017-06-18,0,0,177,False,Not Recommended,Let's start with the fact that instead of shutting down the TRUE HACKING TOOLS they (Take2 Interactive) did shutdown OpenIV which is a programm that was in development for almost 10 years to only later on shut those down so they're image doesn't suffer that much after this fiasco. OpenIV made it a lot easier for people to install a diversity of mods. And at the moment OpenIV is the only tool available out there that is able to open the encrypted .rpf files without it Modding is reduced to a fantasy since the files can't be accessed and is illegal. For me as machinima producer it closed a lot of doors and possibilities. A lot of the people who bought GTA V on PC did it for the mods and not for GTA Online. Maybe if it wasn't for GTA Online we wouldn't be here in this situation. I blame the Shark Cards. GTA O has become a grind you will see your self repeating the same Heists over and over again to just get a little $$$ that's a thought out thing by Take2 so you buy their Shark Cards intead. At the beginning you got a lot more $$$ out of doing missions but now its a ridiclous grind. It's a shame to see how grindy companies like Take2 and R* which I respected but not anymore. They took down the last thing that made me enjoy GTA. Damn I miss the days of modding GTA San Andreas and IV it was so much fun trying out things like the Big Foot mod Iron Man Mod Map conversions ..etc. Microtransaction are ruining the gaming industry developers are getting greedier by the day. That's why I only respect CD Projekt Red they're one of the last enthusiast studios out there who are down to earth. It's Doomsday for the GTA Modding communityThank You very much Take2 Interactive and Rockstar Games for buring your TRUE CORE fans.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,746,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is certainly a very enjoyable game however it has a few flaws that may make or break it for people. With most of the post launch issues ironed out there are still a few anomolies such as high CPU usage causing world streaming problems. Anisotropic filtering also appears to be a bit off as surfaces at oblique angles can appear very blurry at times despite having it at 16 samples.The game also has extremely poor mod support which is unfortunate considering the creative inventions people devised in the previous iteration. As I abstained from it till I heard feedback many players are getting banned for simple (albeit necessary) mods like an extended FOV option. This sort of response to mods is considerably counter productive towards the community as it was a driving force of the last game.Whether they approach these issues is still up in there air but till a satisfactory response is made the verdict stays. June 2017 editHow is it that more than 2 years have passed since I wrote this review and the game still has broken anisotropic filtering and poor mod support? The former can be fixed with tweaks but unfortunately the latter can only be solved by firing Take Two interactive executives. I have spent many fun hours playing this game but I cannot forgive a game for a spiteful approach to mod content creators.,Grand Theft Auto V

Visually this game is stunning just watching the city react and move about with random events or player initiated events that tell another story in itself. Gameplay is straight forward as with other GTA games but the car handling seems a bit tighter and more responsive than previous titles. The vehicles are beautifully detailed the custom works could be a little better but that's more an opinion than anything else. All in all this game is just awesome once you get the graphics to ""ultra"" it will blow you away at how realistic they are. Online mode is another beast in itself letting you create your own ""thug"" and go about crime sprees at your own pace with plenty to do.",Grand Theft Auto V

After I restarted my computer it gave a blue screen report that says VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (nvlddmkm.sys) and when I opened up Geforce Experience again it couldnt not find any hardware. I tried to install the driver again but the installation program couldnt find the hardware either. I believe the problem is the new release of GTA 5. Also my Gpu Tweak program says the laptop is currently using Intel Graphics.After all these happened I contacted you and you told me that you should contact with the manufacturer. And I did that too and got my Geforce Experience fixed. This time when I open up the game my laptop shutted itself down 3 times. Then I optimized the game from geforce experience.

2017-06-18,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,Okay for starters this review is not because of the bandwagon about the modding situation with this game (However I do not condone the actions the company has taken in the context of mods). No the reason I'm giving this game a negative is the missed opportunity Rockstar made it other this game. The singleplayer was one of my most captivating and thrilling gaming experiences ever. The multiplayer was a great environment to explore with mate's thanks wide variety of different game modes baked into GTA online such as Heists Missions &amp Racing. However it became clear that Rockstar's long term strategy with this game would be to focus primarily on income from microtransactions and constantly update the racing aspect of the game with silly loops and numerous additions to the car list within the game. In other words non of the DLC or updates catered to the strengths of the game instead they focused on pushing players to spend money on in game currency and purchasable items. It's such a shame I bought this game three times (Xbox 360 Xbox One &amp PC) and every time I try to climb back in I leave the game feeling disappointed. I wish Rockstar had a larger emphasis on the single player post launch with expansions and continued to enlarge on Missions and Heists. It's not the same game it once was during those first few months which is a great shame.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,196,False,Not Recommended,So here is the thing.GTA 4 was a fantastic game. A modding community spread out of it and was fantastic. So much fun was to be had out of that game the most fun you could have anywhere. So people made a common place to run these mods Open IV. These people are dedicated to the game they love and they want everyone to be able to do anything they want in the game. There was not many problems back then other than hackers in multiplayer but that was a minor minor issue. Now GTA 5 exists and the hope was that we could do whatever modding we wanted to do just as long as we didnt touch the multiplayer side of the game. It was a great time it was for a year give or take. But now as i heard from a video from Nerd Cubed Rockstar has decided to jump ship because they dont profit enough from the players in single player so they want to get rid of Open IV. This is just horrible use of a companies power to basically shut down an entire expieriance in this game. What is so bad about people wanting to fly around their SINGLEPLAYER as Iron Man? This has gone to far. I believe in this community to stand up and fight for the game they paid for twice or even three times.

Yes they still charged full price in the sales. Surprisingly THAT'S NOT THE GAME.Game itself is the best game I've ever played. Gorgeous graphics very well optimized and a great port for pc. Storyline is hilarious and the characters are a joy to play as. Gameplay wise with driving and shooting is spectacular.

2015-06-29,0,0,296,False,Not Recommended,"Edit Do not buy this game for the multiplayer. 12/12/15It's garbage. EVERY lobby has a hacker in it usually blowing everyone up instantly wiping out all your guns freezing you crashing your game etc. Rockstar gives no . It's been like this for months and only gotten more frequent. Awesome game. Runs very well (Some stuttering issues I have to restart the game every two hours or so unfortunately) getting 50 60 with some dips into the 40s on heavily populated servers and a mix of high/max settings. GTX 870m.Campaign is around 40 50 hours long not much to do afterwards besides replay missions or go rampage about. Still almost every moment in the single player is fantastic lots of great humor some crude. Fun driving pretty good shooting massive open map. The online can be incredibly fun or it can absolutely suck. If you want to play online get a team of 3 other people and try to play together. Randoms are horrible at the game and expect to be overpaid. This coming from someone who loves playing Payday 2 with newbie/randoms randoms in this game are pure hell. Lots of grinding online as well. And it's missing a ton of both small and big touches single player has. The online alone is hard to give a straight reccomendation for still if you're mostly interested in single player there's massive fun to be had. Personally this is my favorite GTA game. As someone who rates the series 4&lt 3&lt SA&lt VC&lt 5 this combines the best parts of 4 (mostly the visuals/driving/physics/activties) with the open world of San Andreas with tons of freedom. The story is probably the best out of all the games pretty easily and was honestly probably one of my favorite video game stories ever. I will note however one issue with the story is Franklin. He's incredibly bland with zero personality. He's involved with funny moments but the other characters carry the scene. He has no motivation besides ""I want money"". Michael is relatable and easier to sympathize with. Trevor is flat out psychoticly hilarious not particularly likable on a personal level but he's insane and extreme comments can get a few laughs.Probably one of the best looking games out right now on PC. Solid gameplay. Tons of playtime to be had. And it holds up very well compared to the rest of the series. Buy it for the single player unless you really want to try GTA Online in which case lower your expectations.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,I own this game on 4 consoles (PC PS4 PS3 Xbox One) and have never used a mod in my life. The actual concept of banning Open VI and other mods is baffling. The success of the franchise is built on the freedom it affords and the great content it brings. This is why Rockstar has created the most loyal gamers in the world today and has done so for close to 20 years. Take Two's incredibly stupid and misguided decisions based on stakeholders who in all likelihood have no idea about how to make a game great has turned me off for life.. I have always purchased shark cards as a testament to how good the game continues to be but will avoid it outright from now on. Horrible and irrational decision.Look at Watch Dogs 2 Battlefield 1 Titanfall 2 COD Dishonored 2 for how gamers feel when there is a cash grab scenario involved.

It is a fun game if you want to do some random things with your friends. when you're alone though.... not so much fun. While GTA O is a great addition to GTA series the character creation is.. not that good. Heritage system is pretty IMO and the female hairstyle... really rockstar ? I always thought rockstar implemented heritage system so our character is not over standarized (is that even a word ?) but with those hairstyles... I didn't even know that's a thing. I'm not going to say anything to the clothings though. Something ticks me off about clothing compatibility but it's not that bad.Still they actually updates the game with new contents very often (although recently those updates are overpriced cars IMO) so... yeah one can hope. TL DR It's a fun time waster stress reliever kind of game. More fun with friends (especially those who can create random moments naturally).P.S.

2017-06-15,0,0,224,False,Not Recommended,Well the mod thing has now returned to normal so I guess time for a real review.The game itself is..well decent the story is decent the graphic is nice the gameplay is mediocre. But singleplayer mode lack content and becomes boring onci it is completed 100%. Which is why we have GTAO. But GTAO doesn't really something you should be hyped for for now anyway. For me there are lots of preoblem with GTAO from hackers toxic players ultimate grindfest and last but not least microtransaction...on a $60 game...that could cost more than the game itself...which is a shame. You could play in private wether alone or with friend or with crew but it's useless if you want to do the businesses thing. The Microtransaction is the cause of the ultimate grindfest hackers and toxic players. Although it would be the same without it but I guarantee it could at least reduce the amount of toxic players and hackers by a lot. But T2 don't really care with their consumers they don't they think of us as a cash cow. They only care about money flowing into their pocket all the updates that has been made is to encourage players to buy the sharkcards (all of the updates so far are for GTAO I don't think singleplayer update will come (if they do it will probably going to be in a form of overly priced DLC or something like that)). I could not really recommend the game if you play alone or solely for the singleplayer (because they don't want to put more singleplayer stuff in) if you want to play GTAO best play it with friend or trusted crew members if not then...well just hope you stumble dinto a peaceful session (Which has a very little chance),Grand Theft Auto V

Week by week month by month and a whole year of playtime i can tell you from experience that rockstar has not shown a single lick of support to their people If you have an issue that needs fixing they will shoot you down give you an automated message about some kind of BullS*** and never get back to you and just forgets that you exist. And dont get me started on the giant heap of security measures rockstar has applied to this game Yes i understand there are hackers and rockstar is trying to take care of them but the way they are handeling the situation is not a good way and it is completely sh***** on our opinion as gamers and our feedback dosent mean crap to them. Now dont get me wrong i really want to love this game and i did love it for the time being but rockstar has just turned this game into a giant mess.

The game is... honestly sort of mediocre by my tastes it hasn't really grabbed me and sucked me in the way San Andreas or even IV has (and I really didn't like IV either) but at least there was the potential of mods before that potential no longer legally exists.

I feel this is also on Rockstar too as they once mentioned before bringing a storymode DLC but they have become money hungry and only release DLC for Online and want you to buy sharkcards. They stopped releasing the new cars for singleplayer in hopes they buy sharkcards online. Shame on both Take Two and Rockstar,Grand Theft Auto V

Not only did they killed off single player modding GTA Online is a hot mess as well with people getting banned without reason. They promised a single player DLC ages ago.

2017-06-15,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,I've owned this game on its release Xbox 360 PS4 and recently bought it on PC for modding my single player game. I'm sorry but GTA Online is a joke and has been after the second or third update. We were promised single player DLC... Never happened. They couldn't even give us the respect of releasing the content from the multi player updates into the single player experience! After R* or Take Two realized what a cash cow they had with Online they all but abandoned the campaign and further character expansion.To add insult to injury Take Two has now released a statement stating OpenIV an almost essential modding tool to enhance and actually make GTA V experience enjoyable again ILLEGAL. You've got to be out of your mind! I'm sorry and I'm sure I speak for most of the rest of the GTA V PC community when I say WRONG MOVE. Overnight you've turned a majority of your fan base against you. I hope you gain some sense retract your statement and can only hope to repair any damages you've wrought.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,128,False,Not Recommended,GTA V singleplayer mods were the only thing keeping this once great game afloat after Take2 destroyed the online community by milking it with Shark Cards all while ignoring the blatant problem with hackers who ruin nearly every multiplayer lobby in the game. Take2's decision to shut down singleplayer mods has officially killed the only remaining light left in this game and will severely impact the entire series' future which is a shame to see. Take2 I'll never be buying one of your games again. I hope you go out of business and I'll wish you good riddance.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,226,False,Not Recommended,After the fantastic adventures I had years back with Grand Theft Auto III I purchased Grand Theft Auto IV and found myself in a highly realistic world that had massive potential for letting me simulate whatever chaos my imagination could bring about. With the discovery of modding I was able to customize my single player experience to a level I couldn't have dreamed of playing as all sorts of various monsters beasts and men flying shooting driving being a villain being a vigilante being a superhero the experience of a game that let me do realistic things that I wanted in a sandbox that had potential to being able to do ANYTHING I wanted to do in a sandbox that had realized its potential was absolutely fantastic. There are many memories I will not forget from that game.With Grand Theft Auto V I was quite content to enjoy the game as is when it was finally released on PC. The expansiveness of the world the slight reduction of realism in favor of fun and relaxed gameplay that still had its challenge and intense moments I found to be wonderfully balanced. I didn't touch much of GTA Online preferring to stick to Single Player. After time went by and more and more mods were developed for Grand Theft Auto V I immediately set about creating a personalized customized world that spoke to me my interests and what I wanted out of the game. The time I spent on it was always positive always fun and always enjoyable.Now after a decade of being able to enjoy that personalized content the developers have decided to lash out through legal means against all that a gaming community stands for. Mods are something that is part of a community venture without community there wouldn't be mods and without mods the community that does exist will never reach its full potential. Because of that Grand Theft Auto V a game which for me has had immense value no longer has any standing in comparison with other titles that allow for such freedom customization and personalized experiences.I cannot recommend Grand Theft Auto V until the lawsuit is reversed in favor of rendering mods legal once more. Buying this game at this point is nothing more than donating money to a cause which seeks to tear apart communities strip players of their freedom and take away the singular experiences that you can create for yourself through the free open modding tools that have been out for years.,Grand Theft Auto V

This is a big downfall for Rockstar they are pushing people to buy sharkcards or to grind missions/heists and this has caused people to cheat for money. That back fired didn't it Rockstar.

2015-12-22,0,0,563,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open world games aspire and it s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do explore and play with both in single player and multiplayer plus great creative tools it s truly amazing on multiple levels.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-28,0,0,695,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 can be described as one of two things either really good or exceptionally bad forcing you to drive your fist through your moniter when a 12 year old goes trigger happy with some missiles (the best fix for this is to just quit and pretend that you did not just die 10 times in 1 minute). It all comes down to how you choose to play who you play with and what you spend your time ingame doing.If you enjoy the story mode great! No issues there. If you want to play online with your friends then you need to make sure that you do not grind ceo or biker warehouse missions with unpleasant players that want to make waste of your 8 hour long session. Simply avoid all of the toxic and salty players (which is over 90% of all gta online) then you will be fine. Also watch out for the hackers.

2016-12-23,0,0,367,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE 3 Take 2 have decided that openIV is ""illegal"" and therefore is essntially trying to stop SP modding which Rockstar supported. This move is disgusting and just adds to a list of how low Rockstar and Take 2 are and are by far the most greedy devs out there right now. Disgusting dont buy. Dont support.Alright so the singleplayer is brilliant cant argue with it but this review is for those that want to play online.From day dot online has been a mess. Whether it was horrible payouts or connection issues or hackers not much as actually changed.I still encounter hackers the community has a few toxic individuals that will grief you and force you to find another server. Sometimes you can be loading the game for ages before actually getting in. SOmetimes you will be doing a mission with your friends and you all suddenly get put in your own lobbies.The worst part is that nothing has been done to stop any of this instead they keep spewing out ""FREE"" DLC. Now lets talk about this DLC you need money. Now if you can be bothered to grind BORING missions OVER AND OVER this may not be a problem for you. But chances are you just want to get into a make believe game and own heaps of cool stuff and make easy money because this game isnt real life. You would be wrong in thinking that. We all thought heists would payout but they only do if you grind. This game is just a boring grind fest. Or you can spend a stupidly large amount of money for what can sometimes buy only a few expensive things in game. The hydra jet will set you back about $30USD. Sorry but that is NOT OK.But lets say you want to do the CEO or bikie gang missions well you better pray you have a good team or a peaceful server because people can grief you and make it hard for you to make money because you cant do it in a private lobby. But again at some point you will all be kicked and have to rejoin each other.Online is a broken mess and it is very clear Rockstar are trying very hard to make people spend real world money to buy in game vehicles. Shame on you R*. Not to mention their support is trash or filled with fanboys who think the game in its current state is fine.Cant wait to see how much they expect us to fork out for a horse in red dead redemption 2 oh wait that isnt even announced to be coming out on PC. Nevermind.update on top of everything else the game is now experiencing a memory leak or some other issue. The game will have FPS stuttering or incredible FPS drops. Nothing has been done to fix this or even ben done to show they are aware. This doesnt happe to everyone but for some the game is running horribly. And of course Rockstar support are no help.Update 2 the game is still having stuttering issues for many even though the game once ran fine for them. Issues from years ago still pop up and the only way to fix these issues is from finding a fix yourself as support offers basic and useless advice that never solves any issues. Modders are still ruining the game and the game i still a boring grind fest that will chip away at your life just to buy some super car. Still cant and wont recommend this game at least not when the game is somehow still $75USDTLDR Grindy and rather boring open to griefing hackers toxic players non existent support loading times can be horrible FPS can randomly drop and lock at 30FPS ""free DLC"" It is made by Rockstar who are now more money hungry then any other company. Even EA has lifted their game.Oh yeah and not single bit of DLC for singleplayer. game is",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-29,1,1,347,False,Recommended,I played the singleplayer and was after finishing the missions interested in the online mode.I joined to a server after i clean my desk changed my underwear and ordered christmas gifts.In the moment i left my apartment i was killed by an amored car. I counted around 700 shots which piered my body.While the next loading screen i feeded my dog and my cat and discussed with my girlfriend which shoes are nicer.This time i looked through the window for suspicious cars but i hadn't seen anything.So i leave the apartment and walked to my car. In this moment my character thought about a bullet which ends in a death screen. After 3 weeks i guess that must be a sniper.Since that was not satisfying i changed the server while i pet my dolphin i just bought and build a tree house for the neighbor kid.This time i was able to enter my car and drive around the city. But the civilians was scared about something and runned away.I stopped in front of a traffic light as a police car bumped me from behind. I immediately got 2 stars which i extend to 4 stars while trying to escape from them.That was like you maybe guess not successful.I tried hundred times to achieve anything useful there but end up in killing new joined playerSo far the game is fun but it got a very deadful multiplayer.I can recommed this game.

2017-03-11,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,I originally bought this game for the classic GTA single player mode which this game does very well. I have played through the story on PS3 when the game came out and then on PC a couple years later. The improvements to the gameplay content and visuals on PC was worth the money and in some ways it felt like a completely different and newer game. Loved it!I was reluctant to try the online mode (I prefer single player stories) but eventually I got into it and started doing missions with a friend on PS3. Great fun! I bought a garage and an apartment and it was fun until I gave up my PS3 and couldn't play anymore.Fast forward about two years and I'm trying the PC online. How has GTA Online fared in two years? It's become an absolute how of grinding and outrageous in game pricing for expansion content combining with the Shark Card system to produce an overwhelming pay to play experience. As a grown adult I simply don't have time to grind for enough hours to buy even a single car from the new expansions. It would take me weeks to get one. The payoff isn't there anymore. I play games to relax and fantasize about what could be but instead this game is exactly like real life in that you work your off and still never quite achieve what you want. Ain't nobody got time for that so I stopped playing. Occasionally I jump on story mode to relive it but Online is a complete waste of time.And then you get banned. I haven't for the record but apparently it's becoming such a common problem that putting work into your online character is a real gamble. Again I don't have time for that petty This isn't a competition it's supposed to be a fun casual video game.TL DR If you like single player story mode this game has a wonderful one. But if you want to enjoy an online game that is enormous active and constantly evolving with new and exciting content this isn't it. Because you can't work hard enough to earn enough in game money to buy any of that content. And when you do you'll get banned and it'll all get taken away from you.Rockstar what happened? I've been a customer for over 25 years and this whole online thing has gone to your head.EDIT 6/15/17 My review isn't changing in light of the new Take Two news but it did remind me that GTA5 is taking up 70 gigs on my drive that could be used for other games so I think I'm going to uninstall it and move on. And hope RDR2 isn't a money grabbing multiplayer disaster like GTA5 turned into.,Grand Theft Auto V

The graphics are *woosh* the driving is *woosh* the shooting is like *wack. wack wack wack wack wack wack wack wack wack wack*. The Franklin is like the Steve Urkel of Grand Theft Auto. The Trevor is like the Jack Nicholson of Grand Theft Urkel. The game takes place in America's worst city Los Angeles. The main character is played by Michael (his wife is a big but don't tell Charline I said that.) The game's career mode rips off of Payday The Heist. You play as 3 musketeers and rob 5 banks so that you can buy 10 cars on your phone instead of just hitting the Y button like everybody else. Grand Theft Auto Vice City is a remake of Wave Race 64. Turns out the FBI's witness protection program is actually a diabolical Pyramid Scheme to sucker criminals into doing infinity suicide missions for some cowa bunga dumbass. The whole game Michael goes ""Okay I'll do this one last mission for you guys but then I'm out of the game for good."" ""Michael I'm pulling you out of retirement for one last job."" ""Okay I'll do this one last mission but then I'm but then I'm okay I'll do this one more this one last mission okay and this one this one last mission but then I'm done I'm out of the game for good. Okay I'll do this one more mission for you guys but after this okay this really really on this one this has got to be the last one but then I'm out of the game for good."" Grand Theft Auto 5 is real life. Whenever you steal a black guys car he's listening to rap. Whenever you steal a Mexican guys he's listening to ing ""Hasta Mañana tortilla chalupa la da da da."" Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars is a remake of Pilotwings 64. The point of the game is to teach impressionable children how to gun down throbes of innocent civilians. Whenever you play as Franklin you always have 5 stars for doing nothing. They only have songs about California in this game unless you go on the classic rock all you hear on there is Radio Gaga Radio Wee Wee Radio Poo Poo all we hear is Radio Doo Doo Radio Wee Wee. And then it goes ""HEY BADA BADA BADDA BA BADDA BA IM TALKING MODEL LEPRECHAUN. YABA DABA DABA DABA DOO PIKACHU ACHOO CHOO.

In fact using OpenIV mods will disable online play unless you turn them off. The online cheats have nothing to do with OpenIV and Take Two/Rockstar know this. Even IF OpenIV was the source for some cheats if they really cared about cheating they would make a decent anti cheat (something they never did) they just want to stop modding so that players will be forced to use all the ridiculously expensive new content in GTAO.Scummy move scummy company.

That is so long as Take Two and 2K realise that the modding community hugely benefits their sales and wants to be left alone to do their own thing in the offline game modes. If they continue to hold up their end of the deal this will be a positive review. If they do not well... Grand Theft Auto V without mods is not a Grand Theft Auto V that I consider worth buying. Not even Gunrunners and Heists in Online make up for it and I played on console mostly to avoid the hackers and account modders from ruining everything.Do not buy this game during sales. Do not buy the Shark cards. Don't do anything to even tacitly support 2K Games/Take Two Interactive's decision to shut out the modding community because they can't secure their online multiplayer properly. Not playing it either is also an option.I repeat do not do it. Wait until 2K/T2 renege on their tremendously short sighted decision. This is not OK and this is not what the community wanted.

2017-06-23,0,0,779,False,Not Recommended,Hello I am very BIG fan of GTAV. I have over 750+ hours of this game. I know this game in and out. Rockstar has done some shaddy things in their life of this game. The modding incedient is its hit new low. I (being a fellow modder on both singleplayer and online) and very dissapointed in Rockstar and Take 2. Being a modder online is frowned upon. But personally I had a great run. Most people think that Rockstar hasn't done anything to fix their online modding situation and has instead focused more on the singleplayer modding community. I am here to say that is not only true but it's wrong. My mods for online were expensive and quite functional. But they actually took the steps to figure out the injection method of this modification. They did infact successfully figure it out and I was banned PERMANATLY. But they havn't spoken about that much because they dont want modders to know about their plans. Though they have worked on the singleplayer issue more that the online one it's still being done. This game is extremely fun both online and singleplayer. Though its not the most communal game. Its still great.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,238,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.For 10 years now over half of all mods for the gta franchise have required the use of a tool called OpenIV. This tool was damn near essential to molding your game and definitely essential for getting any mods that change the game in a meaningful way. Nearly all of the largest mods in the history of this franchise have used this tool (lspdfr for one) and without it I sure as hell wouldn't be playing single player (especially after being banned permentantly for lagging in game for a minute...seriously). I would argue that the reason anybody plays this game on pc now is because of mods as we have all played the regular gane to death and back again. Well now take two interactive in their ultimate wisdom have decided that OpenIV and subsequently all mods that require it are illegal. Seriously. Take Two have now sent a cease and desist order to the creators of OpenIV which they have no choice but to follow. That means you cannot legally get OpenIV anymore and as a result mods mods are now illegal. This is t. Why have they done this? One reason. Microtransactions. I hope anybody reading this can agree that Microtransactions are absolute garbage. All they do is ruin a game and suck money out of the gullible but they work. So take two noticed this and declared recently that they were UNDER CHARGING us! They plan to put far more Microtransactions into their game. So why get rid of mods? Well they want to funnel people into the garbage that it gta online.Gta online started with a great idea. The madness and insanity of gta very with your friends. Crazy fun? Sure. However they realised that if they released things that got gradually more and more expensive players would be less likely to want to play missions over and over and more likely just to buy a shark card. The last I heard they had made 2 billion dollars from shark cards alone. That put them on their track. As soon as they noticed that we started seeing more and more expensive items. Cars jets helicopters even clothes got more expensive. Hell the cheapest yacht is 6 million as standard and if you complete the best paying heist perfectly you don't get a fraction of that. Yet still more and more expensive items appear. So people stopped playing. Online numbers have been declining but play time is the same that means people have switched back to single player to play mods. Best way to get then back? Make new better cheaper content? Naaah let's make mods illegal!This is utter t and cannot be allowed to happen. If they had a real problem with this they would have stopped it at the beginning but no they stopped it now so they can make more money. Please do not buy this game. You will waste your time with a trashy online filled with overpriced items an overwhelming amount of trolls low paying jobs and everything tailored to getting you to pay more. What's hurts more is we were promised single player dlc which seems to have been abandoned to make more money. Save your time. Buy something else.Forgive me for any errors I am on mobile and it's 5 30 in the morning,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-14,0,0,609,False,Not Recommended,"After quite some time playing this game all I can say is that it's pretty flipping boring at the top. Once you've managed to get all the cute little toys that they plop down onto the online servers every few months there's always that moment a few hours after messing with it and asking one's self ""Now what?""So then you go to Online and oh boy there's more issues like why should I bother to grind more money if there is certainly nothing worth the time of it all. Once you find your favorite car it's Occam's razor and you're done. Same with weapons and the like. Sure there might be some newfangled thing but it's unforgivingly priced in such a stupid way and you kick yourself to get it and when you finally do (after grinding or microtransactions (in a fully priced game)) you realize it really wasn't worth all the extra effort and there is no furthering enjoyment value other that it seemed like a good idea at the time.It's a constant flux of ""Oh this is kinda fun "" and then interest is lost once the novelty breaks away to showcase the repetition. And this is all if you've managed to eke out some decent isolation from the... let's just call them bastards. Some bastards go out of their way to grief you some bastards prefer destroying everything you love and some bastards hack the game. There's no anti cheat. It's a joke to them that R* thinks they can stop this behavior. And this is all nigh unavoidable thanks to their recent additions to the multiplayer.Basically you can do these free roam jobs that allow you to build up (ingame) cash flow in a multitude of ways before you feel repetition fatigue set in and why are we doing this games are supposed to be fun. Also you can't do this sort of thing in a private (solo friends or crew only) server for who knows why and so after slogging through who knows how much work for a ""big"" payoff some bastard can swoop in with arms full of C4 and underwear full of mess and ruin your hours and hours and hours worth of work. God forbid a hacker decide your struggles are in vain. Remember there's no real anti hack measures? R* doesn't care if things blow up in your face. So all this ""fun new stuff"" comes to naught. A game that should have been about a long lasting sort of enjoyment has become a quarter year check in to remember to oneself ""Right this still sucks.""The single player is enjoyable to a point and that's the end credits. Afterwards it's just some kind of mill around toybox and hey maybe I could replay some part of it but then you remember how much friggin' time this thing eats up. Recent actions on Take Two's behalf have soured my feelings on this game to finally write this review That being that they believe they deserve more of the player's money that we're being under monatized (because a fully priced game isn't enough even with rediculous microtransactions) and that they have declared all forms of modding in their games to be illegal. Which was one of the many selling points for the game and interesting things for the single player's life span.(modding was kept out of Online to prevent further cheaty dickbaggery) But now all that extra fun is done it's either play the game our way or don't. By the way we think you're a hacker so you're banned.They don't want you to have fun.They want you to give them your money and then off.",Grand Theft Auto V

This is an amazing addition to the GTA scene but this has been brought to a standstill by many many hackers that have in the past dropped 100's of millions on countless amounts of players causing there to be a lot of people with everything maximised without any effort.

If you want it for singleplayer fine. DO NOT PURCHASE FOR ONLINE GAMING you will get banned for NO REASON and you will NOT be given any recourse to refute the ban NOR will you be given an explanation as to why you get banned. I wrote this on the rockstar forums ""I have repeatedly attempted to consult with support into investigating the ban I have received to my account and have been stonewalled all 4 times. I'llhave to state here that I am not attempting to appeal a ban. What I am doing is I am stating the ban was an error and should have never happened in the first place. This falls under ""Game Unplayable"" section of support. I'll repeat that The online game system is in error and is preventing my gameplay. On top of that no one at rockstar gives a damn to look into the issue and so I have come to the conclusion the game is simply broken since I didn't do anything wrong. I have NOT been informed of what caused the game system to make this error in my specific situation. Because of this I am effectively permanently suspended on the first ""system error"" because whatever caused it in the first place will probably happen again once the 30 day suspension is lifted. Obviously the probability of that happening after the suspension is over is 100% at some point again because I don't know what caused it and so it'll happen again inevitably.This is why I need this issue to be properly investigated. I need to know why the system decided (for itself) to ban my account. I also need input on what could have caused this because there had been nothing I had done intentionally or out of my own knowledge that violated any part of the EULA / TOS.Clean install of windows 7 2 months ago.Msinfo32 and DxDiag show no problems and pass all tests which I did send in with my support ticket.Steam verify files of GTA V passed successfully screenshot sent in as well with support ticket.Applications that run at the same time as GTA Online Ventrilo / Teamspeak uTorrent Steam overlayNo mods installed (ever.)I did not exploit anything in the game.I did not harrass anyone in the game.I did not use any third party applications that interfere with the game.I use a legitimately purchased and downloaded version of GTA V from steam.""",Grand Theft Auto V

Worth buying for those who only wants to play offline. It takes 24 hours to end the game and you can get more by doing the sub missions. Great Graphics for PC 4K support etc etc. DUH!Cons In GTA Online we can't create party with our friends in public session though there's a mode that allows us to be playing with friends only. There's a limitation in each game session it's annoying enough if we wanted to join our friends but the session was already full. You can still queue though. But by the time it's available our friend will be moving to another session. SERIOUSLY ANNOYING! In the HEIST MODE of GTA Online if one of the players has disconnected the game session will end. It's extremely frustrating if you've almost had the game completed and one of the heist crews is disconnected and then you get nothing!Overall despite of my cons tho i would still recommend this. 8 out of 10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-03,0,0,338,False,Recommended,GTAV is an amazing game yes its abit pricey but its worth it after all just make sure if u wnt to go online u have a good internet connectionand your wifi is upand running otherwise its pontless. in my oppinion its amazing i can play GTA hours on end which suggests it a good game sometimes if your lucky you might even be in a session with a youtuber like i have been a couple of times. i would reccomend this game the only 2 faults is when u install it it takes forever to download possibly a day and if u got no internet you can only go on strotymode well i guess at least u still get to play it. buy it its worth every penny!!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-04,0,0,123,False,Recommended,The story mode is very repetative but has an amazingly interesting storyline that had me watching all of the cutscenes as it is in most GTA games It is mostly just driving around and shooting some people however there are some fun and interseting levels. The games engine feels nice and looks good in both first and third person POV's. The PC port was very successful and it runs quite well. (Random frame rate drops and crashing occur when running the game with DX 11 with a GTX 970 so I reccommend using DX 10.1 with this card).Customisation in the story is excellent in both the character and vehicles. In multiplayer (GTA online) the vehicle and player cusomisation is a bit restricted by your level and achievements. Online missions are VERY REPETETIVE and provide little motive as the rewards are small (frankly there is no point in doing them) but the heists are great fun and are challenging and reward players that choose to play as a team handsomly with big cash payouts and experience (RP). When freeroming in GTA online there is not much to do. After I had invested in a luxury appartment and car completed all heists gotten bored of the repetitive missions and killed some innocent AI and players alike I found myself at a loose end.This is why I will probably no longer play Grand Theft Auto V unless ther is some good DLC or updates and I think that the money I paid for this game was only just worth it but only because of the interesting srotyline and few hours of heists.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-19,0,0,1277,False,Recommended,WAIT FOR GTA VI. This game is such a wreck.Well not really a wreck. Waiting won't solve any of the issues. ESPECIALLY the community. You might want to consider having a friend or two in order to enjoy this game since IT WILL REALLY take awhile to find decent players.UPDATE The more you play online. The worst it gets... seriously. Not for your ordinary casual gamer. I've been playing single player lately to compensate the bad experiences online. But even in single player the game randomly crashes.. I cannot stress how bad this game is. I'm wondering why it has a lot of positive reviews. In my opinion if you want real reviews. Read the negatives.UPDATE AFTER FINISHING THE STORY Story was great. Just like any other Rockstar games in the past. That being said I still wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who's gonna play online unless you have some good friends willing to play with you. And by good I meant players who have patienceUPDATE after not playing for two and a half months (GTA Online) I've decided to give this game a positive review after all of my experiences playing. I've learned a lot when I started playing again.. One of them is know what to expect. Here are some of the things to keep in mind if you're ever going to play this game 1. Listen to the negative reviews. This game will ABSOLUTELY hit you hard if you ever don't know what you're expecting.2. When you're planning to play online. I strongly suggest going to online forums and ask for assistance since chances are everyone will you off in every session..3. Build a good circle.. 'Good' being a subjective term. Adding legit players who are keen and patient will flip your entire experiences. SERIOUSLY this is an understatement.4. STAYING ALIVE IS THE GOLDEN RULE IN PLAYING ONLINE5. For beginners For god sakes. If you're not gonna communicate with your team. Atleast try and figure out WTF you're doing.I've added a hundred more hours when I started playing again and I don't have any plans on stopping.The biggest reason why I'm giving it a postive review after all of the heavy ruckus i've experienced is because I've developed a solid and reliable circle to play with. Although there were a lot of little details that makes this game irresistable great worth playing and just a plain classic. The devs are still deserving of a good review for all of their solid work.Still the anti cheat system is flawed in every way. But with all of this being said.. A good circle is your ONLY bet in making your experiences enjoyable Like anything in life.. Surround your self with these people.It's an open world and a game. BUT it's also another lifeP.S. Configure port forwarding if you're having a hard time hanging out online.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-25,0,0,623,False,Not Recommended,"Rockstar is stupid they really think banning people is gonna stop modding when people who mod are usually nice. Everytime they waste their time making anti cheat stuff when everyone finds a way around it. And Rockstar just makes things too expensive and expect people to buy their Sharkcards which is the main reason why there are so many modders. Yes the heists are fun but it's the only ""fun"" way of getting money and it seems like they don't even listen to their fans. And yes they did a good job on the game itself but it's like they don't even care about their fans and see why people are modding for the most obvious reason. Modding is the only other way to make GTA fun since there are only so many things you can do but all the stuff you can do only gives out about 150 hrs which makes the game more dissappointing. They need to change their sense of mind and understand that people mod so they can have anyone else have fun since this game is mostly money farming simulator 2015.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-17,0,0,223,False,Recommended,REVIEW FOR SINGLE PLAYER ONLY So many great things about this game I do not know where to start.. Well the 3 characters system debuted in this game and I think it's a very very nice new feature in the GTA series all characters got great personalities which fit very well into the environment of the modern world unlike GTA IV which felt very dry (it had a great story but the characters were meh.). Another new feature is the first person mode which is nice but I personally do not like it much (driving can get very confusing). The missions and the story are really fun sometimes a little generic but I think you cannot expect more from a GTA game. The one thing I really hate about this game are the radio stations not very much enjoyable music for long rides.This game is unlike it's predecessor very well optimised so people with weaker systems like me can play on pretty nice details and decent framerate without serious lag issues or something like that. You can see the developers learned a lot from the miserable PC port GTA IV was. Actually GTA V is running much better than GTA IV on my system.Conclusion Awesome game most Immersive GTA game since San Andreas GTA fan or not it's a must buy!.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is a good game if you ignore the mad GPS and can stand being online with the Hackers and Sctipters who will try to ruin your session but at worst case the Rockstar Mission Created Jobs still work and you could always play the Story Mode offline.

This shows the fact they did not review OpenIV at all and have pure disrespect for the modding community. OpenIV isn't capable of allowing people into online with malicious content. In fact the program called ""Rage Plugin"". which is most commonly used with OpenIV won't allow you to even enter online. Rockstar is constantly trying to get money out of its players and doing what they want instead of listening to the community.

2016-11-23,0,0,580,False,Recommended,Grand theft auto franchise has always been my favorite game of all time and this game is no exception. Grand theft auto 5 has the most stunning graphics for a sandbox game to date in my personal opinion. Not to mention there are tons of mods that could enhance the graphics to look even more realistic. Apart from that the single player story line is absolutely great and this is not the first time rockstar has created good story lines to name a few gta san andreas red dead redemption gta 4 and gta 3. The voice acting and story writing are splendid and it ables to attract the player's attention. Gta is fun to play over and over again on single player but with online multiplayer and the free updates add more to the game's value and I have been playing this game since it first came out on the last gen consoles before the game was out on PC which is on PS3 and I still continue to play it until today and the fun factors are still present especially when you play with your friends or relatives. Although the multiplayer section is not that great in terms of anti cheats and user friendly interface. It is still the best sandbox game to date. CONS The thing I hate about multiplayer is that you are unable to be at the same party with your friends. For an example when entering into public games you have to always invite your friends and if the game session is full or the game session has already launch when you entered your friends cannot join the game which is kinda a let down. I want some system that enables you and your friends to be in the same party so that whenever you search a public game it will always transfer you and your friends to the game session at the same time without having to invite your friends over and over again. The second thing is that you are unable to create private lobby if you choose to directly go into gta online. You have to be in single player first before choosing to create private lobby from the pause menu I find this very annoying. The third problem is that when you have created a private lobby every time if you want to go into the same lobby again after a game you and your friends will have to select the freemode on the selection screen if one of your friend is AFK he will be transferred into a public lobby. The solution to this problem is that the developers need to develop some party system that identifies you and your friends that you are playing together. If the game's loading time is short I don't find these problems as nuisance but the loading time is long and you have to always invite your friends if you guys are not in the same lobby is a nuisance to me and it is not enjoyable because half of the time you can spent playing together were spent on loading screens to get into your friend's private lobby. Although these problems are such a big nuisance to me I still recommend buying this game and play with your friends because when you able to get over these problems by always selecting freemode together trust me it is a great experience that you would not want to miss.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,260,False,Not Recommended,"While GTA V's singleplayer experience is rich with detail and well crafted the vain approach RockStar and Take Two took with GTA Online has been an irritating thorn in my side for more than two years. The implementation of Shark Cards (GTA O's micro transaction system) has effectively ruined the online portion turning the acculation of in game currrency to access content into an unreasonable grind fest for those who refuse to pay for said ""micro"" transactions. (Side note How exactly are RockStar and Take Two getting away with charging $100 nearly twice as much as the main game for only 8 million in GTA cash that is clearly a f*cking ripoff seeing as to how much the ""free"" update content goes for in game.) I had lost any interest in the online mode after the current gen releases.Then came the PC version. The only justifications I had for purchasing was the increase performance and the massive modding community GTA had garnered over the years. A community that was driven almost solely by passion had provided some amazing content. Thanks to Take Two that might now be over. Years of work and dedication thrown away for reasons that are currently up for speculation. According to Take Two the modding of their games is now considered illegal. The future of the modding community is now pretty murky what a damn shame. So in the kindest words I can think of F*ck you Take Two you greedy f*cking c*cksuckers!",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-31,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Just from a sheer technological standpoint I found this game quite impressive. To have an open world as large as GTA V did and with the amount of detail in the environments that this game had is pretty mind blowing. You can wander out in the middle of nowhere and look around and the environments will appear just as detailed and vibrant as they do in the heavy traffic city areas. Add on top of that the complex physics simulations and game systems realistic character animations and large open world and this is probably the most technically impressive video game I've ever played. Especially when you consider that the game is running on 8 year old hardware.Gameplay wise it s pretty much your standard GTA game. Drive around blow stuff and cause chaos. What s different about GTA V is that you can switch between one of three characters at nearly any time. The characters all have different personalities and missions as well as stats and abilities. One of the characters can do bullet time driving while one of the other characters can do bullet time bullets.The characters in GTA V all have distinct personalities and are incredibly well defined and well written. Especially when compared to other GTA games where I found all of the characters to be more or less forgettable. While I found the characters to be well written I found a lot of the parts of the overall story to be hit and miss. Mostly miss. There were a lot of the parts of the story where the characters had no conceivable motivation to be doing what they were doing. Because the characters were so well written and defined they sometimes felt out of place in story situations that were over the top. There s a part in the story where one of the characters meets a total random stranger flies up in a plane with him rides an ATV out of the back of the plane and opens the parachute at the last possible second just for fun. Okay but why? Why would my character decide to do this? Maybe I m not supposed to take the story as seriously as I did but the game seems to want me to. At least sometimes. GTA V seems to randomly decide to take the story quite seriously whenever it wants to and the tone oscillates between serious and ridiculous which is kind of jarring. The game will have you jumping ATVs out of planes one second but then want you to care about these characters and their well being the next. Which didn't quite work for me.But the fun of a GTA game is driving around and causing chaos which this game does as well or better than any other GTA title. The missions were fun no driving people around and having to call and chat with them constantly like GTA IV. There were only a small handful of missions in GTA V that I found to be boring or tedious. And there s a frequent checkpointing system in the game so you ll rarely need to replay a certain section of the mission over and over again if you fail. I've pretty much ignored the online portion of this game. I don t know why it just doesn't appeal to me.Summary Overall I found GTA V to be a pretty solid game it s my favorite in the series and I doubt fans of other GTA games will be dissapointed.For more game reviews check out http //whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,256,False,Not Recommended,This is a good game in single player mode. It's fantastic even. Maybe even a crowning achievement for its time. But that's only in single player and the online mode (which is all anyone seems to care about these days ) is GYABAGE.GTA Online is the perfect example of the free to play business model being detrimental to the game except it's not a free to play game. By all means I'd recommend the single player portion of this game but with the online mode not only being GYABAGE but also hoarding new content that the offline portion of the game doesn't get I can't recommend this game.Note I originally made this review as part of a review bomb after Take Two did something monumentally stupid. My review would have been negative even if that fiasco never happened I just never bothered to write it. I've left the original review bomb below for posterity. Take Two has essentially decided that modifying a game is illegal because they just can't get enough of your money what with the shark cards. Well gee if only IF ONLY the game was being sold at full price and sold over 80 million copies! That sure would be nice wouldn't it?I don't think they even realize that they just killed a ten year old project for NO REASON WHATSOEVER since OpenIV isn't even the thing that people use to hack online. It's not even exclusive to this game OpenIV was for multiple Rockstar games but nope can't mod those either anymore it's illegal now because of reasons.I don't intend to support Take Two any longer for any reason. I don't care if they publish a 10/10 game I will not stand for this.Get stuffed Take Two.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-31,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I've been following this game since it's announcement but I never played it up until a few days ago. I'm reviewing this solely as a single player experience since I don't play multiplayer games. The game is definitely Grand Theft Auto through and through. It improves on everything Grand Theft Auto IV did and recreates San Andreas perfectly. For the first time in video game history a developer has successfully created a realistic city and that's really impressive in itself. The story is amazing unexpectedly it's around 25 hours long according to most people and I'm almost done it and I've done nothing but the main story. The gameplay in itself still isn't fun to me. What makes this game amazing is what Rockstar did to make a realistic cast of characters and a living world. A huge improvement over the boring everything of GTA IV and all the GTA games in my opinion. Despite all the rightfully deserved ing about the multiplayer I don't play the Grand Theft Auto games for the multiplayer and the purchase is worth $60 just for the single player only. Even if you don't plan on doing a single activity outside of the main quest it's worth a play.The story is why you should buy this game ultimately. I just finished it I've never been so excited to see a game's conclusion before it was amazing. No spoilers. But you're given a choice in it and the choice changes everything.,Grand Theft Auto V

Everything is amazing.Now looking at my hours. I have never cheated on this game because i wouldnt have been here still. Now im banned. they took all of my stuff. i have NOTHING left. 3000 hours down the drain. I have a question for Rockstar. ARE YOU KIDDING?This is some t right here. They claim to have fixed the problem with hackers but no. Hackers are walking around like nothing and im here putting my god damn life into this game. Ive spent a LOT of money during this time. mind you im 15 at the time. I m not a youtuber that can get shark card for free. I damn sure dont have a job. I could put 3000 hours more into it. 3 years. Who knows? I dont know what do anymore. FML i guess. All those all nighters for nothing. I did have a good time before tho and to praise Rockstar they have made a gaming masterpiece. Period.Money well spent.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-09,0,0,108,False,Recommended,Experience Finished story mode and a bit of online time.Story mode Great story that allows you to switch to different characters and dive in with multiple perspectives. Also gives you free time to roam around and learn how to operate the game learn the ins and outs and enjoy it. In the end you get 3 choices and the story will be impacted differently on which option you choose.Online Don't have too much playtime with this one but its basically your own custome character and you can do missions buy cars garages to store those cars and pretty much build yourself an empire and do whatever you want(just no modding i heard people get banned for that). Playing with friends is recommended. There is also tons of missions and activities like participating in races going to the shooting range hunting or engage on a crusade of extreme violence(you sick bastard).now im off to go invest thousands of hours in GTA online lel. And yea i've seen the negative reviews about rockstar being s and online being totally corrupted with modders cheaters and bans for no apparent reasons but i guess i will have to play at my own risk.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-02,0,0,231,False,Recommended,I've sunk plenty of time into GTA V starting on the PS3 and PS4 and finally the PC. Playing this on PC is by far the best looking best performing and best overall experience. Optimisation is top notch. Loads of options to tweak should you have any issues. Unlike a lot of games SLI actually works well in this game.Plenty of replayability Hundreds of hours to spend in singleplayer and even more online. The campaign/story is brilliant. Everything you would expect from a GTA title. Awesome radio stations comical advertising a plethora of crazy and interesting characters. The humor is spot on everything and everyone is stereotyped. No political correctness. It's perfect. The gameplay has been improved much since GTA IV. Cars handle better. Shooting and combat is more fluid. The world is far more dynamic and feels alive more than ever before. I have a few gripes with multiplayer. Heists are ruined by early quitters. Once someone quits your back into the lobby. Back to waiting many minutes to recruit new player(s). I would have loved a mechanic that pauses the mission if someone quits and recruits a new player. Give that player an incentive to help such as a cash or XP bonus. Also cash and XP feels like a HUGH grind decent vehicles and apartments are unreasonablly priced. Probably one of the best games on Steam. Highly recommended!PS. Here's hoping to RDR2 has a PC release.,Grand Theft Auto V

Do you want to drive fast cars while simultaneously having some random side of the road babe giving you head?

Or maybe you just want chill in your high rise apartment drinking gallons of wine and doing the bong 'til well picture your brain as a rubix cube everything is in order all the colors are together. Each block is an item or idea. Once you smoke the blocks start to move and new ideas come together that you had never thought of before. It makes you think in different ways. None of the blocks leave the cubes they just get mixed up with the others. When the high comes back down the blocks go back but you always remember the possiblities that you created. Anyway back on point If you like those things I mentioned above this game is definitely for you. Endless Possibilities. Mindless Chaos. All. Day. Every. Day.,Grand Theft Auto V

Even though I've won the story mode I still play around with all the cars customizations posibilities exploring the map and simply just driving or creating chaos is a very entertaining way to spend your time. I do however feel it could've been a bit more engaging if the game included features that GTA IV used to have like dating and actually creating a relationship with your buddies. Apart from that I think bigger boats planes cars and garages and the ability to purchase properties in the Dynasty 8 Website on your phone should be included like in the online version. Apart from this its the best open world 3rd person shooting game ever created. Rockstar Games thank you for never dissapointing me! 8.9/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

Console or PC gamers have been given equal attention to detail by developers to provide a gaming experiance rivaled by none in the genre of open world game play. As a PC gamer I was highly sceptical of how Rockstar would redeem themselves after countless releases of failed PC ports of my favorite franchises. What was once thought of only a ploy to pad accounting numbers for Quarter 2 of 2015 I now know that the wait was worth it and Rockstar gained a lot of trust in their brand to deliver a high quality product that was playable from Day 1. Heists are one of the greatest innovations in gaming and provided content that is enjoyable for months on end not having to worry about content becoming stale within weeks brings upon a sense of relief and amazement.,Grand Theft Auto V

A wonderfully detailed world awesome single player great story and top notch gameplay. Everything just comes together near perfectly in the singleplayer. The multiplayer is when you run into problems if you try to play the multiplayer withou either friends or spending money you're gonna have a bad time. Frustrating online community annoying missions cars upgrades and weapons that are overpriced and some overpowered (the Kuruma good god). However playing with frineds is still a ball and you can still have a good time but I feel like its a real slog most of the time. However the game is worth it for the single player.

2015-05-01,0,0,93,False,Recommended,Alright time for me to review. It is said that rockstar had the pc version in the making way before even last gen console. Thye said so them self after lying about it. Look that bit up so with that said.. It is HIGHLY optimized! Runs flawlessly on my simple fx 8300 3.8 and gtx 660 oc. Got it on 1920x1080 High/VeryHigh. Now with that said. So far i've yet to see any problems with the game it's well polished. I've had it since day 1 release. Online is great too! Now for people complaining about online it's 9/10 your setup why you can't play and join friends!GTA Online is strict when it comes to NAT settings. But it does that for a reason. Eliminates any real problems in the network/hosted game. Forward ports or get a new router/modem if that doesn't work! I know some companies block opening ports on their leased modems unless you buy your own and all that I found that out the hard way!Anyway The game is smooth story is great graphics look phenominal and it's well worth it! Only thing i can complain about is online's whole passive mode thing needs re made. Players with a bounty love doing passive mode after quickly killing somebody! ITS ANNOYING AS HELL! Passive mode is abused way too much and ruins online (atleast when in game with people like that). Now loading time and such all depends on your hard ware i'm mentioning this due to the fact people complain about that too. So it's your end pal. I can say i'm not even on an SSD jsut a plain ol' HDD. And it loads up under 20 30 seconds if that. Online too. Don't complain as i said... 9 times out of 10 it is the players hard ware limiting them and screwing around! Rockstar did damn good on this release! My wife even runs it high with a measly gtx 650 1gb and athlon x4 860k and it also loads about as fast so c'mon people! Look into your set up.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is a sad day for us all. I love(d) this game but given R* and T2's disgusting stance on the modding community I have to give this a big thumbs down. For a company that once welcomed modders with open arms and who also previously stated that single player mods were fine this is shocking.This was probably done to prohibit MP mods and scripting but more importantly to prohibit the use of MP only content in SP in order to fuel R* shark card money making machine.If you want a fantastic vanilla single player experience then go buy it it'll probably be worth the money. The lack of SP endgame content was one of the main reasons for the extremely active modding community. However I'm not giving the game a thumbs down because of the game itself I'm doing it for the sake of moral principles.,Grand Theft Auto V

One of the worst thing about this game is the online. So you may think that this uses dedicated servers like SAMP but no it uses peer to peer. Whats terrible about this is that there are hackers everywhere online and there are no multiplayer mods available like there were in SAMP.

You will and cry all day and demand your money back but you WONT....it will get patched....and you will end up pre ordering GTA 6 or any other game that offers you a pre order with a **special bundle** you all fuel this kind of shoddy work and guess what?! as long as these companies still get pre order money they are obliged to launch a game on the date they stated instead of doing what they did back in the day and delay the launch/release. I will say from looking at all the reviews negitive and positive this game might not be for everyone just until you can play the game without sorting through files and going through the steps that game devs get paid for. Also for anyone who wants to know I did NOT pre order. To clarify I recommend this game but from 14k of total users who wrote comments it looks as though 20ish% cant play this game without a hassle.

The multiplayer is awesome however i have ranked it down a little due to the following reasons * There are a few bugs mainly on leaving heists. White screens of death and stuck loading screens.* Only 5 heists (This will be addressed in the future for sure) Especially with player made content.* The maximum cost appartment is only about 500k you can get this within a day if you run heists.* As mentioned in other posts load times are sometimes a bit testing.* As with GTA 4 online de sync can be a pain in the I should probably mention a few good bits too * The keyboard/mouse controls are flawless.* You can switch between keyboard and a controller within a split second.* Cash is easy to get.* The heists are brilliant even better if you have friends to play with.Would i recommend you buy this game? Hell yes even with the few things i mentioned above this is a damn good port and one hell of a game. I had a few issues with running this game I advise you download and update direct X seperately.

It's a disgrace to let something so simple to let others learn and encourage others to have fun be ruined by Companies such as Take Two Interactive &amp Activision right alongside them to ruin a fun experience to expand on a title so overly exaggerated only to the point where it makes others want to play these 'offline modifications' in order to expand on the already non contented SinglePlayer which I'll admit no content in such a time as everything is ""online"" really is a pain for all of us and you people only care about yourselves while you watch all the rest of us actually taking online seriously fall right along with the people who're desperate to give your game a bad name to make us &amp yourselves work even harder to prohibit the use of modding ONLINE which 'ScripthookV' 'OpenIV' and Alex's 'ScriptHookVNet' all have in common.

2015-04-19,0,0,251,False,Not Recommended,"One of the big draws of the GTA series on PC has always been modding as well as the community behind them.The sheer amount of love and passion people put into these games through modding is immense and has definetly become one of the many reasons I and many people have bought these games.The recent shutdown of OpenIV by Take Two has affected that community and has just left us in a state of dissapointment.Rockstar in the past have always shown their gratitude towards the modding community for its content they make and/or enjoy yet its apparent that Take Two doesnt care for the modding community in fact they probably dont even care for the non modding community either. Especially with the recent statements the CEO of the company has made about undermonitizing users and not making enough money when its clear they making buckets loads from GTA O microtransactions.But back to the modding/OpenIV situation it is just uncalled for.OpenIV has been around for nearly 10 years now and has never once had anything kind of C&amp D letters sent to its creators so why now out of the blue?The claim that OpenIV used for making cheats is just dumb and goes against what the tool is meant for.Both OpenIV and even GTAV itself actively prevents you from even going online anyways so its obvious these ""malicious mods"" are coming from somewhere else and not from OpenIV created mods.I suspect that these ""mods"" probably came from something like Cheat Engine or a hacked version of scripthook(which normally with blocked online play much like OpenIV unless its tampered with by cheaters.)Either way I will not be supporting Take Two products possibly ever again.

Removing Open IV mod support is the final straw.

Yes the OpenIV decision was stupid and yes they deserve your distrust and disrespect. But this doesn't discredit the already existing game. This is the major problem with steam reviews about GTA they don't review the actual game. While the singleplayer modding situation was an extremely dumb move on Rockstar's part it doesn't mean that the other parts of the game are void. The singleplayer is a fun experience and you can around in it without mods (although definitely not as fun) for a long time if you choose to. The online mode has many modders but is still extremely fun to play. TL DR The game is good itself the modding situation was t but it's fixed and the negative 'reviews' aren't reviews as much as they're whining.,Grand Theft Auto V

No then stop reading this and don't buy it. Yes you played enjoyed it and now you want it in all the eye candy glorry! ... Yes assuming you have a good system. As for myself even at the $60 price point I've clocked over 60 hours of play so A.) I have too my time on my hands (I don't but this game is addicting) and B.) It's a $1/hr just on the single player mode Making this a good buy on entertainment per dollar hour ratio factor.Don't have a great system but want the PC glory? Wait for sale you've enjoyed the meat of the content already and you might be disapointed watching all the flaws of your system nock the game down notch by notch. Don't have a top of the line system but never played the game? Conservate side in me says wait for a steam sale and have a blast with it being discounted in price. However as mentioned before I broke the dollar/hr barrier with just single player mode.Very pretty game in 4K resolution &amp high textures driving around at night durring a thunder storm was pretty.All in all I love the questionable life lessons/dialog from fictional psycotics while indulging in so much eye candy it gives my optic nerve fibers diabetes.If this game ever gets on Linux platform I would consider this a MUST BUY AAA title.

2015-05-02,1,1,136,False,Recommended,I've not played much of the singleplayer but what I have played has been good.Online has been lots of fun although stressful. The load times are crazy and there's still a lot of bugs (Such as getting stuck in a 'Mission Failed' screen). Playing heists is always fun though. Hopping in TeamSpeak or Skype with a few mates and finishing a heist from the start can take upwards of 4 or 5 hours (although it can be divided up into separate play times). My biggest complaint with the gameplay is that sometimes the heists seem too easy and don't have much variation (If you play a heist one time you've pretty much mastered the technique for finishing it). My biggest complaint with the game as a whole is the performance drops after 20 minutes of playing it seems to get frame drops from turning just about every corner.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-22,0,0,1855,False,Not Recommended,Well. It's a sad day well not really but anyways.33 million dollars was just removed from my account when the new DLC was released and i didn't know why at first i still don't but at least now i have visited some forums and read from other players with the same problem. And the amount of money i have had removed was indeed basically everything i had they left 400k. So now i have some ideas on what can have caused it.It seems that people who sold their stuff as CEO and MC in solo public sessions might have been hit hard. And this is also exactly what i did to earn my money. I didn't want any hacker to just run up to me and blow up my stuff so i decided to sell my stuff safely well i guess i got punished for that now.In Christmas 24th and 25th December 2016 there was a 50% raise in CEO sales those two days me and some friends worked our asses off i made 20 million in just those two days selling CEO crates and also so some import export and MC work. All this hard work is now just wiped.Well anyways i actually never thought i would downvote this game i consider it to be one of the best games i have ever played and i have almost 2000 hours in it. So much work i have put into this game i own everything worth owning have all the best cars all businesses even bought a couple of megalodon shark cards just a week after the game released because i loved the game so much.Well the single player is damn good can't deny that it is indeed one of the best games i have ever played to this date but the way Rockstar is treating their players is really not good and i never thought I'd say that myself. I have always defended Rockstar and i always wanted a clean and fair online experience. But the hackers have been there all the time and they can do so much damage in so little time. At some point i just decided to go passive when i played just so i could roam freely and be left alone.But not even this helped at some point as script kiddies can teleport you out of your car blow the car up and the lock you at a position remove all your weapons and force you to change sessions. And i am suppose to sell my stuff in lobbies like this? Or even risk it? Seriously. NO! I work very hard to collect the stuff i don't want it taken away by cheaters!And if it had i would never have gotten it back rockstar wouldn't have cared one bit.So anyways this was a sad day. Now i'm done with the game. Rockstar is treating their players like they really are and it is a shame really. It is a masterpiece of a game that was made the wrong way the online and the single player should never have been built on the same code this was a gigantic mistake and rockstar is now desperate.To bad legit players like me are punished and hackers are roaming freely. Just to bad.,Grand Theft Auto V

Basically the first thing i noticed in GTA 5 is the gameplay is rather similar to Skyrim but it is set in a modern era.

Some of the new cars are upwards of 7 000 000 and that is more than the Tank used to be on release. You used to be able to buy a car for 4 000 or a realistic 10 000 but now it's crazy like 800 000 for a bike.the game is overrun by teens who spend all their poket money on shark cards now they have the equipment and money but no skill. It's getting way too ""swag"" these days. they added motorbikes and scooters which appeals to me but they cost a fortune and you have to be a super high level to do anything with them.You can tell they won't be making any large DLC for the game anytime soon because they are collecting too much from kids who have nothing better to do than spend their money on clothes cars and swag. don't get me started on the Boats and apartments. Also sometimes you will be playing and some swaggot will try to lord over you with some high priced high firepower jet/heli or car and you can more or less beat them easily if you have a homing launcher (which makes buying or flying a plane pointless because someone WILL shoot it down within 30 seconds of take off). You can't destroy anyones personal vehicle unless your loaded because it costs 4 000 if you destroy someones car and you can end up in debt if they keep coming for you and all you can do is kill them or go in passive but passive is a joke because you can still be killed if they are smart enough to push something into you. the whole mechanic of losing your car or having it impounded is so annoyingIt was great but now its just over run with kids and swagsdon't bother with it. let them realise its time for GTA 6 or some decent DLC.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-29,0,0,876,False,Not Recommended,Smugglers Run.Total disappointment and the single greatest waste of in game money I have ever spent. Seriously 3 million gone for what?I bought a hanger and added the aircraft workshop flew in my Cargobob Jetsam as I had been looking forward to customising it for ages. You can only change the primary and secondary colours I was a little disappointed with the lack of options but at least I could still recolour it. I painted it silver with a bit of blue.I then went to do the first supply mission. This is when I realised this is not a money making DLC far from it in fact I think it has the worst money/time ratio per activity in GTA online. Once you factor in all the resupply missions (15 to 20 minutes each) and the time it takes you for a successful delivery mission the cash at the end is laughable. Once I was back at the hanger the Cargobob had bugged into a standard military one albeit silver. I called Pegasus for my Jetsam variant again and flew it in to the hanger. At this point I then had two Cargobobs. The silver military one I never bought and the stock Jetsam one. I repainted the Jetsam back to the first silver and blue. I then went back to my office to steal a car and called for my new silver and blue Cargobob at the elevator the stock one arrived. It turns out you do not change the Peggasus version you simply create a duplicate you can only call for if you request a personal vehicle. Despite standing by my office with a helipad the personal Cargobob was delivered miles away and with it being a personal vehicle now my car disappeared... it was going to be a long walk if you don t steal a lift from an NPC.I toyed with the idea that from now on instead of calling for the stock Cargobob from the comfort of my own office I take a trip to some part of the city to collect my custom version. Massively inconvenient each time I want to sell or steal a car but I gave it a go anyway. Aside from being long winded when I finally delivered the top range car the cut scene of the Cargobob dropping off the vehicle was back to being the stock version a second later when I was back in the game the custom version.I now have a Hanger that is costing me $700 per day that there is no point using for earning cash limited point in using for customising aircraft and no way of selling.Total waste of game money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-26,0,0,646,False,Recommended,"What really needs to be said? It's a Grand Theft Auto game. If you've read any media about videogames at all in in the past 10 years then you've heard about how amazing these games are.I pre ordered GTA V just to get it on the day of release for Ps3 and then switched to PC after the long awaited release and believe me it was well worth the wait! The switch from last gen to current gen consoles met the release for PC and SO MUCH content was added both in GTA Online and the story! The story alone was amazing and I've played it through probably 5 times. I played the story a few times for fun and to re capture the bad feeling the crazy story gives you and I've played it a few times just to meet the 100% completetion. Even leaving the story mode out of it you still have countless hours to spend on GTA Online and if you get bored of that you can install some mods for Singleplayer (or the new ""GTA Network"" mod) and it'll make for enough fun and playtime that it's like it's own game and you'll never get bored.So if you don't own this game the question you might be asking is ""Well Should I get it?"" and to that I have to say this If your PC can run it and you have the money.. You should get this game. I've never met someone who doesn't enjoy a Grand Theft Auto game and I don't think you'll dislike it either and if you buy it and it after an hour or so of tweaking it it doesn't run on your computer or you hate amazing fast paced Prolouge No Worries!

2015-05-09,0,0,24,False,Recommended,"FiveM Reccomended Grand Theft Auto Online Neautral/Not Reccomended I originally marked this game as a ""Not Reccomended"" not because of the game itself but because GTA Online soon became a Pay2Win free for all deathmatch. However now that I have discovered FiveM my opinion has changed drastically. Before reading this review bare in mind my ""Hours Played"" is not accuracte seeing as FiveM is a third party launcher which doesn't specify itself under ""Grand Theft Auto V"" so calculate my hours played on ""Source SDK Base 2007"" and my ""Grand Theft Auto V"" hrs to give you an idea. Weird I know but it is what it is. For those that don't know what FiveM is it's a roleplay platform (amongst other modes such as battle royale) which uses your Rockstar login and launches GTA V through an alternate launcher. If you haven't already I would reccomend looking into is or the Launcher ""Grand Theft Auto Online"". What differentiates these third party launchers from the base game is that it is purely economy based. You don't have to spend 20 everytime you want the latest car you merely put the hours in trafficking Cannabis Cocaine amongst other jobs. Primarily the launcher is designed around RP. What that means is that every cop in the game is a real person. Every paramedic is real etc. This creates a massive opening for the Role play community. So yes that means that GTA Online now consists of more than just a massive Free For All/Troll battle. Which GTA deserves the amount of potential that the game has which simply isn't shown on the base game is unreal. There are downsides however such as the fact that servers currently only hold a maximum of 34 players (however this is being worked on and to be honest 34 people per server feels like more than enough) as well as this if there are hackers they can be banned by the server admin but they can merely Steam Share and play on the server again. With this in mind I haven't personally come across any hackers but the rule breakers especially from RP communities do abuse this method. Eventually however the trolls get bored and move on. If you choose a good server the admins are usually sh*t hot on trolls and rule breakers. Pros of FiveM Massive platform for Roleplay and easily beats it's major competitor Arma 3 (Iv'e played 1000 hrs on Arma so this is not a Bias opinion No more Pay2Win features that the Shark Cards hold on this note I know GTA servers are expensive to run for Rockstar but paying 40 for the game and then at least an additional 40 to pay for good features is ludacris. More Job oppourtunities such as drug trafficking and features such as Robbing people banks stores etc. Large communities (more people on this than the base GTA Online Modded cars and additionall features become more widely accesibleCons of FiveM The launcher does have a tendancy of crashing quite frequently (again being worked on) Slots currently capped at 34 (however other RP launches hold more but this is being worked on) Obviously any updates Rockstar make on their base game don't cross play. (with this said the amount of mods available on FiveM more than make up for this) Hackers and rule breakers get it easier. So pick a good server!Verdict I would not reccomend buying GTA if you only have the sole intention in playing GTA Online or what I like to call it ""GTA Free For All"". However with this said it is down to personal preferance. This conclusion is made on the simple fact that it is Pay2Win and full of trolls and hackers. I would on the other hand reccomend the game for FiveM online and the campaign as both are brilliant.

Came back to it in the last few weeks with VIP and CEO upgrades it makes the game alot more interesting makes online play more fun and allows alot more progression opportunities.You start off as a noob struggle without weapons do some missions and heist setups eventually some heists finales which pay big. You can also become associates or ""underlings"" of CEOs to help run their illegal trade runs in online play which brings alot of fun moments and purpose to online which was lacking before and through associate vehicle request allows you to play with high level vehicles which the CEO owns in online which you would otherwise nto be able to do.Eventually you earn enough money through all of the above to finally buy your own office and warehouse to become a CEO and start earning cash with newer players as associates. You can see progression in your office buy vehicles for your associates to use for free and earn lots of cash for the gucci gear. Sure there may be other faster ways to earn cash than CEO but it still very good and is most importantly more fun compared to other methods.Despite the complaing about cash cards you do not need to buy them at all. The game is the msot gun when you earn everything. I myself worked my way up from noob to CEO with office in not much time. Luxury fast cars which cost millions don't mean alot in online play.

2017-03-30,0,0,198,False,Not Recommended,Not trying to write a long review many of those can be read. So straight to the point as a SP game I find it fun for awhile but sooner or later you will be tempted to play online.......thats where the problem lies. The online feature is fun but the risk factor of modders/hackers/cheats is too high. Time invested and money too (if you buy shark cards) can be ruined just by falling in the wrong lobby. If someone other than a DEV can kick/crash your game the potential risk of harm to your PC is high ( talkiing from experiance). I can't recommend this game if the Developers care nothing for the rampant hacking/cheating that is taking place in thier play yard. You can't say you can't be blamed for bullys in the yard if you charge other kids to play there including when you have made enough and then some to put a private army of security to combat the bully( overkill!?). If you want to buy this game go right ahead SP and online in private sessions is good enough just know that you will be taking a risk everytime you go into a public session which the bigger moneymaking features of online lie in.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can play the game in single player storymode or if you prefer you can play online with other players roaming around the city or countyside in freemode or choose from a ton of different challenging missions/races.

Previously I purchased GTA 5 on Xbox 360 and Xbox One. I was so excited to transfer my character over until I discovered that they discontinued that feature. WHY? Why would you continue selling this as a $60 game while removing features? How many servers could that have taken? How much money could that have saved you? You know what? It comes at a cost. I am done buying games from Rockstar and will be requesting a refund. There is no logic behind removing such a useful feature.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-29,0,0,266,False,Recommended,"As amazing as this game is it's gone down hill far when it hit the PC. Not because of the game itself (... For the most part.) but because of the community.Now the campaign is fantastic no doubt about it. But after awhile you'll want to go play some old fashioned online. Once you make that character and find yourself among the masses you'll be hit by hackers... Non stop. Whether it's getting banned from money being dropped on you or getting stuck to another player or getting tanks dropped on you or even playing online matches and getting killed constantly there is a huge hacking problem. Rockstar if you can see this you need to implement some sort of anti hacker feature.The issue with hacking makes playing with anyone but your friends basically undoable. And the people who aren't hackers will kill you any chance they get for fun. ( Not me... I can usually fight them back but it's a legitimate complaint. )And the loading screens... My god the loading screens. And the disconnections! Any time I try to play with my friends someone gets disconnected from one of the missions as we start and they can't come back until it's over. Any time you play online with random people you're likely to get force disconnected by a hacker any time you try to accomplish anything. Trying to join any online game in the first place 80% of the time you're going to get ""Unable to connect returning to GTA V""Again the campaign is great...

(expand below)Loading times between activities are rediculous..... Servers shutting down... connection problems... online save fails general glitchiness.SOCIAL CLUB!!!! very annoying and can be buggy. not remembering password and not logging in._________The match making sys. To Rockstar Guys why did you make it so that people have to *accept* any other players job? (!)Would you not agree that if a player ""opted in"" for any job and his status is ""on call"" he is automatically agreeing to the fact that he will start a job as soon as the server finds him a suitable lobby? After which that player will be put into that lobby by the system with skill matched players.This unfortuntely is not the case. Instead you have to wait untill someone accepts your job and this could take from 1 2 mins (which rarely ever happens) to around 20 30 mins (much more likely).If RS made it so that any player who wants to go on a job will ""opt in"" through their phone like usual this would dramatically decrease waiting time and there would always be matches with players of a similar skill level as you.The whole thing just feels like it has been badly ported from other platforms (consoles).The first GTA was released in October 1997 for DOS and Microsoft Windows and on 14 December 1997 for the PlayStation.I think RS made the mistake of building for console first and porting to PC rather than the other way around. Which IMHO would have made the game more stable for all platforms.Not going to give RS a ""thumbs up"" for this. Rockstar GET BACK TO YOUR ROOTS.",Grand Theft Auto V

I personally find it very hard to stop playing after I've been playing for a few hours. The Story Mode is extremely entertaining and the plot is good. Overall I'd say the controls are much better when using an Xbox controller but there is very little to complain about when using the keyboard. The map in is game is massive and the sights are breathtaking. Depending on your PC the graphics are great and it runs very smoothly. GTA Online has you buying houses yachts cars and other things and it makes you keep coming back to drive around and have fun with other players. Overall I would rate this game 9.4/10.

Shutting down the mod tools for Open games is welcomed but forcing that same ban on single player and friends only games is mean and unnecessary.I have a friend who uses a mod which allows him to 1. adjust his FOV so he doesn't get motion sickness on his wide format monitor and 2. use his driving wheel and pedals for driving cars. He only plays in Friends Only mode and never in Open. And now he's screwed. Thanks Rockstar!So I'm going to give it a thumbs down until Rockstar starts making better choices.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA 5 is an absolute MUST HAVE.Sure it's not perfect there are still a fair amount of hackers and the matchmaking system is far from ideal but the content makes up for it tenfold. The graphics are amazing and there is so much to do endless character and car customizations racing freemode events heists missions and just ing around in general.As far as getting banned for getting hacker money it doesn't happen if you are not exploiting the system. These babies on here complaining that they got banned were probably bugging the hackers for money in the in game chat and racked up 10's of millions. I've encountered hackers and have always been able to leave before getting any substantial amount of money (they spawn $50k bags so getting to a few million would take a while even if they are shooting it at your face).,Grand Theft Auto V

Depends. People who try to harm you as of adding money or taking away money exploding you are s. Hackers who add fun things like adding Alien ships and such are fine. The community is full of kids who need anger management but If you stay away or go in a private session you'll be fine. If you're willing to pay for a game that is basically 2 in 1 and get free DLC's then go for it. Got a stressful life and want to blow people up go for it. You're a teacher and your students are annoying as hell? Tell them to join your session... Not the best Idea if they're level 200 but still! Buy it if you got lots of friends who also have it.

2017-01-10,2,1,33,False,Not Recommended,This review will be talking about my experience with the single player campaign. This game did not live up to my expectations at all. I don t know why it is so consistently on top of the Steam sales. I think this game works a lot better at telling a story than being a game. Most of the game is a driving simulator. Drive out to the country drive back to the city fly out to the country fly out to the city. In fact most of the dialogue happens while you re driving back and forth which kind of begs the question is there a better way of delivering dialogue than just having me hold down the W key and tap the A and D keys every now and then? The heist missions were certainly the most enjoyable in the game but there aren t that many of them and most of the preparation for them involves boring busywork like collect this really slow vehicle and drive it 5km around the city and if you so much as happen to look at a cop the wrong way good luck outrunning them in a garbage truck. For a game that focuses so much on the driving it could at least make the experience enjoyable however alas that was not either. The flying mechanics are really irritating if I wanted an accurate flight simulator I would be playing Microsoft Flight Simulator X or something. Games in this genre are supposed to be over the top ridiculous fun and most of the heist missions are exactly that which is why having realistic finicky flight controls makes no sense at all. You basically have to hold down W + 5 constantly to go anywhere in the helicopter and trying to get the thing to slow down or hover over a specific location is such a pain in the The worst example was during the Merryweather nuke mission where I chose to use the submarine/offshore route you have to hover this gigantic chopper over this small submersible and hook it on and you have to fly low enough so that the hook can attach. I lost count of the number of times I dropped into the sea trying to do this as every time you circle the chopper you lose more altitude and then if you gain more altitude you speed up and start moving away from where you re trying to go. Speaking of which on the same mission the submersible controls happened to be even more annoying. I constantly had to press the shift key to keep the submersible on the surface and then after I got tired of doing that since the thing moved about as fast as an overweight person on a mobility scooter I used the direct mouse control instead which resulted in the thing flying all over the place. I have no idea why Rockstar decided these controls needed to be somewhat realistic I m trying to have fun here. I feel the main issue with the game is Rockstar focused way too hard on all the side activities you can do rather than on the main missions. If you really want to play golf or tennis there are other games that do that far better than this one does. I didn t buy GTA V to play as a middle aged man doing stuff a middle aged man does I bought the game to do things that a middle aged man who is a skilled bank robbing badass does. For whatever reason Rockstar decided that the game world should be really accurate like driving someone home when they re drunk only nets you $50 but again that s not particularly enjoyable. There s really no motivation to do it and it s just a ton more driving to do. There are a lot of different examples like this most of the side missions are just blatant busywork and mostly involve driving or flying long distances and then rinsing and repeating.Then there s the gunplay. You die in about 10 hits which again is more realistic but again for a game that s supposed to be over the top explosions and action and has a psycho maniac killing hundreds of people it again sucks the fun out of it. Every police chase is over in less than a minute as you slowly enter your helicopter or vehicle of choice meanwhile 100 bullets have flown through your windshield. You could argue that you aren t supposed to aggravate the cops and that is your punishment but again it limits the ability to make your own fun in the game. Driving down the highway and you throw some C4 out the window and blow up a bus? Cops are after you even though there were none in sight and nobody would have noticed you throwing it out the window. I wouldn t so much call that realistic as just unnecessarily annoying. Rockstar really seem to be trying to have their cake and eat it too by saying Look at all these cool crazy things you can do but at the same time if you step out of line at any point it s like they re punishing you for it. Even if you re speeding down the highway and some vehicle randomly runs into you you go swerving off the highway run into a pole and instantly die (I failed a mission more than once because of this). Then you get to have fun driving all the way back there for the next few minutes. Doesn t make a lot of sense to me.I haven t even tried the online mode and based on the plentiful other reviews here covering that topic I have no intention of doing so. Overall I think you d get 95% of the experience of playing this game from watching a playthrough on YouTube. The gunplay really is nothing special nor is the driving in fact you d be saving yourself the strain of pushing W on the keyboard. Saints Row 3 &amp 4 both are far more enjoyable games to play even if this game has a better story. They are far cheaper they have co op too and the flying controls are some of the best I ve seen in any game.,Grand Theft Auto V

The online game is just a grind fest. not recommended if you want to play online solo.and now they wanna take away the only thing that keeping the game alive by shutting down the openIV?. seriously R* and take2?.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-17,0,0,414,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is great the customer service is not. I would recommend that if you buy the game DO NOT invest any money in shark cards as you can receive a ban with no explanation or reimbursement for Rockstars numerous banning mistakes... When this happens your character is reset and you lose everything you've PAID for. I love gta mostly for the car customization features but I won't be buying the next one until Rockstar addresses it's terrible handling of customers. Clearly they don't value your business and they don't deserve your support either. There isn't any point in investing money into a company that can simply take it's product back from you for absolutely no reason and with no accountability for their actions.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-21,0,0,1989,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V as a singleplayer experience is an amazing game that is worth the price. If all you want to hear about is singleplayer go off and get it (preferably on sale) it is worth it. GTA Online the 'free' (microtransaction ridden) extension (where most of my game time comes from) is yet another example of a company starting off with a strong base and then whittling it down to a grindfest through microtransactions.Don't believe me? Every DLC thus far has been getting more and more expensive. The Beach Bum pack their first DLC offered completely free (FREE!) vehicles for anyone to access (...which when PS4/Xbox One came out they put prices on...). Fast forward a few updates and you have 6 million (cheapest no additional features) to 10 million (most expensive all additional features) yachts which are just mobile apartments (that you cannot drive) of which the vehicles that they come with are bad (the helicopters take you out of passive mode so hope you like getting blown up by a level 5 with a homing launcher).Skipping ahead you get to the Bikers DLC where previously the fastest bikes in the game cost between 15 and 80 ish grand. With the DLC the second best bike in the game costs around 1 million while the best bike costs 2.2 million. That is the same price as the top supercars for a bloody bike!Remember when the Osiris came out at the price of 1 950 000 and people cried out it was too expensive (previous top tier cars being 1 million)? Well now there are several cars priced higher than that.""Oh but the new Tempesta is extremely fast and only 1.3 million! The DLC is starting to get less expensive now!"". First off the Tempesta is a great car for performance I will admit. Second one DLC is not an indicator of a trend. Third no it is not! Have you seen the price of the Ruiner 2000 introduced in that same DLC? 5.7 million for a bad muscle car (in terms of driving performance) whose redeeming features are a jump ability (that came in GTA Vice City when you completed enough taxi fares) a infinite parachute (admittedly pretty cool) machine guns that can only fire directly forward and do terrible damage and homing missiles (but you can only carry 8). Or for 3 million get a fighter jet with infinite missiles faster speed greater maneuverability and explosive machine guns. I'll leave that choice up to you.So yeah I have skipped a lot here but is GTAO addictive and fun? Yes it can be otherwise I wouldn't have spent so long on it. But is it grindy? Oh hell yes if you don't have 100s of hours to grind for stuff the in game way you better have a decent paying job to buy overpriced (for what they deliver) Shart Cards. Or go into a public lobby and just beg for a script kiddie to drop you cash like every other er seems to do. Oh and the 'anti cheat' is a total joke. And not the funny kind.",Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-22,0,0,505,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Great single player and mod community also riddled with hackers making online unplayable.I have spent hundreds of hours on this game. Some of it grinding missions to get money to buy the new stuff they release (anything but cars is seldom worth it). Now the new stuff is so hideously expensive as they try to push the micro transactions on its game playing public it is no longer worth trying. Add to that the the best way of making money is to go onto you tube download some hackls and yes thats right! you NEED to hack to play this game online. If only to save you from being inst killed by another hacker or teleported or turned into a tree or well anything. This coud actually all be solved by private games (this sometimes happens when im on an empty instance witrh friends and for a time it's good). The Heists are fun but there is no way enough of them the single player experience is one of the best out there and it has an amazing mod community. If you dont have it get it on sale if 15 20 or less and play single player.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,The only reason I have played the GTA series was due to the extensive modding capability.

2017-06-16,0,0,191,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar removed modding due to Take Two's cease and desist towards the creators of Open IV which allows you to mod within the game. This is not okay with me. Take Two's stocks fell significantly because of it! If Rockstar is closing down modding then I am closing my wallet with them. They cannot beat the hackers who will continue to find ways around the secure wall just so you can make more money while upsetting the community. Blizzard Entertainment dealt with this kind of issue with Diablo 3's Real Money Auction House that produced a profit for Blizzard Entertainment. They tried to find ways to beat the hackers and cheaters. But what did they do when they knew they couldn't beat them? They removed the feature of the Real Money Auction House that provided Blizzard Entertainment a soaring profit! They weren't being greedy at all! Rockstar in this situation is just trying to gain more money by cutting a feature that is likely used throughout the entire community. This is not okay with me. And obviously not with the community.I urge them into reversing the cease and desist and lookout for the communities cries rather than your own finances in mind.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,459,False,Not Recommended,Everything about the core gameplay in GTA V is amazing and warrents the highest of praise.

2016-12-07,0,0,279,False,Recommended,"I would just like to point out before I go in to detail about my review that I have played GTA V on PS4 then I switched to PC a few months ago so I have racked up a lot of experience when playing the game. I enjoy playing GTA V Online when I go on it's a different experience every time but there's a few things that are starting to get on my nerves and putting me off from going Online a) Modders/Hackers My most recent experience when coming up against a modder/hacker happened as soon as I joined a server after completing a heist with about 28 people roaming about killing each other within about 2 mintues of joining I randomly teleported to the airport where I saw every other player in close proximity not being able to draw weapons and not being able to control their characters. At this point everyone was confused and typing in chat that hackers were to blame and I have never seen anything like this before especially when playing games on my computer. There were little brown briefcases dropping from the sky and it turned out to be money (I would just like to point out also that I read some where that if you pick these up you could be banned so be careful if you choose to pick them up!) after about 5 minutes things got even weirder! Everyone that was teleported to the airport turned in to little bunnies (I you not!) and we could control our character and now able to climb and jump over things this baffled the out of me. Noone could go in to passive mode or even leave the lobby the only other option was to close down GTA and load it up again and at the time I didn't want to do it as I would be waiting a trillion hours for it to load up. I stayed in the lobby for a good 45+ minutes taking in what was happening about 30 minutes in I get a black screen with bold red writing that said ""Everytime you login to GTA this is what will happen from now on! HAHAHA!!"". At this point I was getting worried thinking I wouldn't be able to play GTA again after this and it turned out the guy that was hacking/modding was in fact a Russian youtuber (I dont know the name of his channel but I will try to find it and update everyone his name on GTA began with 240ghfrdset...). This is the sort of thing I'm looking out for now and staying well away from them! I just hope to GOD that I dont get banned for doing nothing wrong and being dragged in to something that was completely out of my control! Just be very careful when you go online and look out for anyone who is in your server that might be hacking or modding!! b) Trollers and Just starters I don't even know where to start with this part to be honest it just seems like the vast majority of heist/setup missions I join there's either someone who just wants to it all up right from the word go or someone who talks utter These people/little kids need to be banned or at least silenced for a specific amount of time because its childish boring and it completely ruins the experience of playing the game. Then there is the other half of the spectrum these ""Just starters"" Jesus in' Christ!! I dont understand how some people can be so ing terrible playing this game constant restarting then dying then restarting then dying. Your just left hoping for once in their lives they would take it more seriously and THINK before they do anything. Not every player is like this but my recent playing time of GTA V this happens more often than anything. c) Most of us by now would of had dealings with the Support teams of Rockstar and I can tell you that they are a 100% useless bunches of cracks!! Their reply time is absolutely terrible as is their phone manner as well as on the phone waiting times what a complete waste of time! If you need an answer to something search the web you wont die of old age doing it that way.d) Another issue with the game is the torturious online loading times... On PS4 it's not excellent but it seems to load a lot quicker than on PC you should be on in less than 20 30 seconds. A few people might say that my computer could be to blame but my answer to that is I keep my computer running at optimal efficiency/performance meaning regular disk optimization closing down unnessacary applications in the background that sort of thing. I would also recommend downloading ""Razor Cortex"" to help speed your games up if you are having performance issues with your games.If you can deal with these sort of things then you obviously have more patience than I have I'm not saying all of my experiences are like this but these things ruin the game for me but I would still recommend to anyone wishing to buy.

2017-06-14,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,I haven't written too many reviews before but recent events make me leave one here. This was the second copy of GTA V that I have purchased. I've completed it multiple times and I wanted the PC version for the full effect That full effect being high graphic fidelity a great online experience and modding support. Well I have yet to experience any of these. So I can run Battlefield 1 at full graphics settings but I cant even get consistant fps at all online. Not to mention the horrible online service. Constantly being dropped out of sessions or ending up alone massive wait times for lobbies and in general very little to do outside of special missions/maps (many of which are USER CREATED). And now today I find out that a Cease and Desist letter has been sent to modders telling them TO STOP WHAT THEY ARE DOING BY THREAT OF LEGAL ACTION. Not only are they destroying any kind of good faith they might possibly create with the modding community they are spitting in the faces of their fans that have been with them throughout this entire series having fun creating crazy awesome stuff. The entire game was made to make money. They create new content and release it but only for the multiplayer and then they make it prohibitively expensive rewarding the pay to win attitude. Things need to change and the fans need to speak out and say we won't tolerate this. I realize these money grabbing tactics aren't new but when they step on the modding community and determine the things that we AS FANS create to have a better experience they need to realize it's not always about making money 5 years after the game came out and focus on making the game a better experience so that new people buy it and the userbase stays strong.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-31,0,0,226,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is personally an amazing game. However you need top notch graphics in order to get the game even somewhat running.It is highly recommended that you get a graphics card such as a Nvidia GTX 750 and higher WITH 1.5 or 2 gigs of ram (on your graphics card)You will also require 8 ram or more and a QUAD (4 core or higher processor)However if you DO get the game to run.. Expect BEAUTIFUL ( and I mean life like stunning graphics some of the best I've ever seen) a FUN multiplayer mode where you can join all of your friends and do various missions such as robbing banks ganking noobs or just dicking around.Highly recommended game Vexenn,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-31,1,1,515,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto Five is an amazing game. I absolutely love it and I'm even upgrading my computer to run it just a bit better. I don't really care for mods so I'm not going to talk about those much. The game itself is wonderful and if you want modded hell just buy Garry's Mod for $9 99. I would give GTA V on PC a strong 98/100 just because I don't like keyboard and mouse controls (don't worry it is controller compatible). Other than that it's wonderfully perfect. P.S.

2017-05-06,0,0,107,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is the best open world game on the market. This game has killed every other open world game and set the standards so high that not a lot of games can surpass.The story was an amazing experience the plot twists the surprises the explosions. It was really fun and I would go through it all again. Even if you completed the story you still have the option to use mods to enhance your gameplay and make this game even more fun (note that mods can/will trigger a ban in multiplayer).The online is also a great experience it's lots of fun with friends and the grinding is fun as well. In my case I have only experienced 1 modder in a lobby but I just left the lobby and joined a new one. I do not know if there is just no anti cheat or it's just really not that good. The modders are a small problem if you encounter then just leave the lobby.Overall an amazing game I really suggest you buy it you won't regret it. 10/10 Would buy again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-09,2,1,101,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is probably one of the best games I have ever played. It is marvelous but yet it does have many flaws. Let us start off with the pros this game looks beautiful on PC especially in 4k. GTAV also has a lot of replay ability the campaign is fun (played the story mode on console) and has a lot of freedom so that itself is amazing. But the best part of GTAV in my opinion is the online. Playing with heists with friends making money with friends and just playing missions has never been this fun. I could easily sink 100+ hours into GTA online. There are endless amounts of things to do on GTA online. But now to the Cons the cons are some of the non custom missions (Rockstar made) in GTA online are very repetitive and boring at times. The stupid socail club thing is tedious and the plethura of Hackers in GTA online just tarnish the experience. And the game is STILL 60$ eventhough it came out in 2013! But overall the pros out weigh the cons and this game is just amazing. I would highly recommend this game and it is worth the 60$ price tag. I rate GTAV a 9 out of 10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-10,0,0,1325,False,Recommended,Just updated because there is new content added.Single player is good very very large and many acheivements to unlocl.I spend most of my time in multiplayer because I enjoy company of friends. You'll find there is some random hackers and some people that just grief you but they can't really do any long term damage you can flip the session and lose them easily.There is a lot of 'grind' for online (if you don't want to pay sharkcards I would never use them).The best thing is to find a crew and have 4 of you play the heists. This will get you a decent start in the game (and they are fun).There is many cars to unlock and some have many many customizatiion (like graphics and spoiler wheels etc).There is many mini games there's a tennis sim a golf sim. There's (I can't count but I'd say near to 100) forms of deathmatch and capture the zone shooting games. There's race tracks (and race tracks that you can also shoot eachother). There's stunt maps (with full editor modes to make your own race or death matches). There's even a TRON game in 3d something I have dreamt about before I even played GTA. The point is find a good crew and you'll never run out of fun. Don't focus only on making money take time to enjoy the other modes because they are fun with a good crew. The graphics on this game are indredible considering it's age. The amount of detail in the set design is second to none. You can be anywhere in game and just look arounnd and be amazed by what you see the unique grafiti in places etc. Single player there is a lot more mini side quests too which are immersive.Bad points Okay so I have to say you get used to these. There is some huge connection issues that you sometimes experience some are more affected than others (I would suggest checking router settings properly or just unlocking the NAT on your router or a good reboot). Sometimes players will drop out from a session or a heist sometimes you can lose a mission objective depending on what point you disconnect. There is also the hacker/cheaters (although in GTA they are known as modders). They drop free money (which may get you banned) and can use god mode etc but you can just change session and I've never known anyone personally get banned for being griefed by them but you'll hear stories like that.....The other game modes for deathmatch and races never have anyone playing. This is why it's important to make friends. Go on reddit join REBL or a forum crew and you can arrange meets otherwise you'll sit in a deathmatch lobby for hours with no one joining.The grind to get to the top of the game is hard. Best chance you have is find experienced players and unlock Criminal Mastermind (google it). That's $10mil unlock. Otherwise to get the warehoues the super cars and all the helicopters etc you will play many hours doing repetitive tasks (like any game right?).My final words are get the armoured kuruma work towards getting a CEO office and Import Export garage and buzzard helicopter get the cheapest of each because the only difference is location. Don't get the yacht unless you want to show off (its pretty worthless) and don't feel like you need a supercar to have fun (unless you want to race professionally and beat times etc). Many people have the best $2.8m car but crash into traffic all the time. You can get to most places in the same time in a kuruma )I will recommend this game there is content being added this year (2017) though perhaps no more after but you will definitely get your moneys worth if you pay full price even. The game is essentially peer to peer so it doesn't rely on any servers being hosted by R* so I assume it will live for a long time past GTA6 even.Check www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline for latest help+advice (REBL details are on there if you want friends). Feel free to add me I can help you with heists or jobs etc.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-15,0,0,276,False,Recommended,This is a monumental achievement in gaming. Not only does it look like a brand new game but it launched without a hitch. The industry needs to study under Rockstar's coders because this game is so well optimized that it makes recent AAA releases look damn embarassing. This is without a doubt one of the greatest games ever created.______Gameplay+ Almost 100% a completely succesful port.+ The mouse control for Airplanes and Helicopters is surprisingly succesful once you get used to it.+ The First Person view is also splendidly well integrated and fun to switch in and out of. I still found myself wanting to play this with a gamepad because it does have it's spikes of difficulty where auto aim toggling/target toggling+ Modible cars and bikes. Although I wish the default cars for each character were able to be changed. Some aspects of the modibiltiy leave a little be desired and seem to be more cosmetic than functional.+ Character stats that improve with usage. Always a + to have a little RPG element to an action game. This causes me to drive Motorcycles at top speeds againsts 3 lanes of highway traffic to level up Driving. Like Trinity.Graphics+ Amazingly gorgeous improvement from the PS3/XBOX version. HD textures FTW.+ Features like NVIDIA TXAA PCSS Ambient Occlusion Depth of Field are well implemented.+ Incredibly well coded and optimized to run well on high settings with an average machine. No PhysX (. Then again if taking apart a house bullet by bullet shingle by shingle and plank by plank were possible in this game like the excellent Mafia II I would probably never be able to tear myself from it.Story+ I never really thought much of GTA's previous storys but Rockstar knocks it out of the park. With a capability to be both silly and crass and still have you feel a connection to each of the 3 main guys. Particularly with Michael.+ Long game. Love long storys. Lots of character development over a long period of time. + Heists!Sound/Voice Acting+ Incredible level of detail in the writing of dialogue. It is equally performed as such by the actors.Extra Stuff+ There is an essentially endless amount of extras and exploration and easter eggs to deal with if your into that.+ Can't wait for the mod community to do what they do. Some more HUD/UI customizability for startersThe State of My Well Being+ This game is the purest crack rock one could ever light up.

2015-11-20,1,1,1032,False,Recommended,After a nearly 2 year wait (dont forget the 6 we had to wait from gta iv relase to gta v announce) I can confidently say that Grand Theft Auto V was worth the wait. This game ups the ante in every way possible and has the unbelievable polish that you would expect from a Rockstar game. I would say that GTA V is easily the best in the series and does everything better than the previous iterations with the exception of music and setting with Vice City and san andreas.The gunplay in GTA has never been very mechanically sound before but V provides enough control options to make it very competent in this department. The driving is also easily the best the series. In previous games it always felt like you were driving on ice but this game gets driving right and makes it not just palatable but fun as well. The story is also a standout to me. I really enjoyed the mission variety and feel like the developers spiced it up more than in previous games. The three character switch mechanic is very well implemented letting you choose who you want to be on the fly. I felt that narratively this was the most cohesive entry in the series as well.As far as optimization goes I found it to be pretty good but not amazing. I played the game at 1440p with a 970 on mostly high and some ultra settings. I did find shadows to be very subpar as well as a fair amount on aliasing. That said it's amazing that they made an open world game this detailed and vibrant.we cant even forget the massive map with all envirmants to enjoy town desert forest mountins rivers lakes and huge ocean.then there is GTA ONLINE after houers of playing this i can say its one of the best multiplayers ever created its have incredable amount of missons 5 long heistes that can give no little paper races lts tdm apartments and lot of stuff to enjoy with friends.and the best FREE UPDATES! there been so much great updates like lowriders heistes busniss 2 and alot morenow the pros and cons PROS a great graphics and optimizationvery detailed long enjoing story a MASSIVELY HUGE mapsoundtrack and mechanic is awsomefree updatesgta online for enjoy with friendsCONS requires expinsive macine to play on good graphicsthere a little amount of hackers in online (but almost all pc games have)a little expensive and not allow refoundi whink you should buy this game if you want a good game with great story and online,Grand Theft Auto V

This can be as simple as Graphical settings to full blown jockey cars.Some of the greatest games in history were born from modding Counter Strike Team Fortress to name a couple and without them we wouldn't have some of the core multiplayer shooter prospects that we have today.On behalf of everyone who has used mods in a PC game it's better than what you want and you don't know what your users want if you think modding in singleplayer experiences is bad.To put it simply and in short.Modding takes your dull and singleplayer experience and shines some sprinkles on it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,46,False,Not Recommended,"Alright. Let's get super real for a second. I'm not gonna claim to love the GTA series. I actually haven't even played this game in a while but what I do love is freedom in videogames. Freedom to do what I want or what to do with video games in general. Freedom to do what I want to a product that I have personally bought that is a luxury item that I can do whatever I want with as long as it is not hurting anyone. I'm talking specifically about modding in video games. Open IV is a program that was used to make more than half of all the available mods for GTA IV and V that is now cease and desisted by Take Two who is the parent company of Rockstar and 2K games. The modding scene was only truly for the Single Player experience of this game not its' Multi player (which means this was not meant to cheat exploit etc in any way shape or form for personal gain or hurting of any real profit that they would get from a sale and in fact would probably improve sales as it got me to get the PC version of this game ).This is honestly unexceptable. The modding scene is what makes Single Player games stay alive for longer than they probably deserve and what helps drives sales because of it. People might ask why is this getting a cease and desist? As of this review being made ask Take Two themselves because the reason they gave in a letter they have given to the developers of Open IV is ""illiterate"" (To quote the forum post http //gtaforums.com/topic/889348 openiv/ ) and I would definately agree. (I would highly recommend to you all that you look at this post as well. It mainly gives clarification on Open IV's side of the argument.)Sorry Take Two but you've now killed any sort of desire for me to play any new Rockstar or 2K game in the future and you've probably destroyed the desire in many others as well and it's a shame considering Red Dead Redemption 2 is on its' way. TL DR GTA IV and V are pretty much dead to me now along with any desire to play another Rockstar or 2K game because of Take Two's desire to kill what was once a truly great experience that led to buy the game due to GTA IV's modding scene before. Take Two will not be getting any money from me in the future until they deicde that what they did was too much.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-26,0,0,444,False,Recommended,This is undeniably the best pc port from the grand theft auto franchise. It has lots of graphics and other options to suit your pc. I originally bought this game two or three days after its release and im gonna be honest it had performance issues and minor bugs but after a lot of updates the developers at rockstar managed to make it perfect. The game itself has a lot of content in singleplayer and a lot more in online. After you think you have seen and done everything that it has to offer(which is a lot) you will be delighted to know that it keeps updating with new and exciting dlc completely free of charge which is a really nice bonus considering the price tag. During sales its a no brainer to go and buy this superb open world game. The only negative about this game is its online matchmaking which sometimes connects you to full lobbys or randomly disconnects you from online altogether and forces you to go back to singleplayer to join back but that is a really rare occasion. All in all i think that the developers at rockstar outdone themselves and brought us the best open world game you can find. I recommend this game to everyone!! 10/10 (p.s it has heists!!!!),Grand Theft Auto V

I had to reinstall this game (which by the way takes HOURS) only to find out it was the simpliest solution that no one mentioned on help forums. Finally got it working but out of no where began getting random crashes. Just lost almost $5000 from losing a hairstyle 3 times. This is unfair. I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone at this point just because of how finnicky it is. Also my boyfriend who has half the amount of video card gigs never crashes so it definitely isn't that...TL DR There seems to be a 50/50 chance your game will just be f***ed and you can do NOTHING about it.

2017-06-15,0,0,2097,False,Not Recommended,"GTA 5 makes several improvements on its predecessor in the graphics and gameplay department while the writing has actually gotten worse. Having three protagonists sounds good at first until you realize it comes at the expense of having any well developed protagonist. The driving controls just might be the best of any open world game while the on foot controls are still some of the worst. How does a game with this much shooting not allow the player to crouch? There's still a lot of fun to be had here in story mode but the online mode is another matter. If you enjoy cooperative gameplay and steer clear of PvP this is NOT the game for you. With every update it seems like the developers try to push away fans of PvE in favor of attracting more fans of PvP. ""Oh you want to stay in a private lobby alone or with only your friends? Fine but we won't let you run your businesses there."" ""Oh you figured out how to lag yourself into a public lobby by yourself?

2015-04-14,0,0,188,False,Recommended,4/14/15If you ever so much as touched the GTA IV port on the PC and then came over to this you'll understand why this game is such a fantastic MAJOR improvment.I can run this game on Ultra at about 80+FPS on 1080p with my 970 and that says a lot by itself considering how fantastic of a job R* did with this port. The game flat out just looks beautiful to say the least. It's a night and day difference in my opinon between this and the console versions with this obviously looking and feeling the best. There was a couple hiccups I had on the night relase and my game crashed twice. But I'm assuming Rockstar has heard of this issue and will be fixing it promptly (hopefully). I have friends who do not have anywhere close to the rec. specs and they are able to play this big of a game at pretty decent settings with some good frames.

Clearly Take Two have underestimated how much an effect modding has on GTA going after the online hackers was a sensible move but going after single player modders was probably the stupidest thing you have ever done.P.S Suck a wet fart out my Also for those of you saying that Rockstar had nothing to do with this. I'm afraid that they did because they released a statement to PCGamer condoning the actions of Take Two and basically agreeing with them.

2017-06-15,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,Really disappointed in Take Two for banning mods of this game. Mods are at the core of so many PC games and often turn ok or good games into great ones. They say that Open IV can be used to break the game's piracy protection. Well if you know what you're doing and find a generic de compiler and get at the game files then there's no reason why Microsoft Notepad couldn't be used to pirate the game.Mods or modders do not intrinsically cause your game to get pirated. People who pirate games cause your game to get pirated. All this will do is attack people who have bought your AAA title priced game (often more than once many PC players bought the PC version purely to mod it) for trying to enjoy the game in more ways that the devs intended.Many of the best PC games throughout history (including Kerbal Space Program which they just bought...) thrive from having rich modding communities. Much of KSP's development has even been influenced by what modders have done that has and hasn't worked. I am unable to support any of Take Two's games anymore and encourage others to do the same because their stance on modding and attitude towards their customers stinks.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-14,1,1,143,False,Recommended,"GTA V is an awesome game that I would recommend to anyone because of the beautiful graphics and stunning gameplay. When everyone complains about the ""hackers"" they are obviously noobs and have never played this game before. Just because someone goes around in a tank mass murdering people does not mean that they are hacking you can purcahse a tank in game for around $1.7 million. Simple solution for these so called ""hackers"" stay in your appartment and just quick join jobs until you have enough money to reign havoc by yourself. I am not going to lie there are hackers. But there are hackers in every game deal with it. However my only encounter with a hacker did not perpetually kill me rather game me money. Who would have thought. Personally I love the PC version more than Xbox 360 because of the newely added features. One con for me is that it takes a long time to find lobbies/missions to join because the skill match option is messed up. Other than bad experiences every once in awhile I recommend this game to you and your friends because this game needs a hell of a lot more players on PC. Ejman65",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-02,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar is still against modding ever since the hot coffee incident. Rockstar needs to stop with this stupid mindset as modding is what makes GTA great not the broken online mode they have converted to some sort of pay to win mode filled with cheaters. Rockstar should do the following with the next GTA.1. Provide dedicated servers that are fully customizable that allows both client and server side scripting. Of course they can still also run official servers but there needs to be community servers. Also the servers needs to be able to handle 60+ players.2. Make the single player storyline a lot longer. The GTA 5 storyline is WAY to short next GTA needs at least as long storyline as GTA San Andreas.3. No shark cards or other pay to win functions that destroys the gameplay.4. A modern GTA map really needs to include more than one big city. The next GTA needs at least 2 big cities.5. Make it easier to mod the game by useing scriptfiles and by documenting internal functions and file formats. Also provide an modding API.6. When playing online the simulation should be handled by the dedicated server to prevent cheating.Until GTA includes the 6 above changes I will not support this game series.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar has made many attempts to what i'd quote ""cash grab"" and basically force players to pay money for newer and expensive guns/vehicles/etc or grind for hours upon hours for cash by removing the easiest ways to make money that weren't exploits which in turn by cause and effect has caused an uprising of modders in the multiplayer community giving large amounts of cash to players or modders that just grief in general and make the game unfun.I'd have to say this game is just a huge cash grind or a wallet drainer whichever route you take either way and rockstar isn't doing anything to help except lower mission payouts and even with heists it's just mainly unfun that being said if you're with friends and you play with them it'll be fun for a few hours give or take but eventually you'll get sucked into the grind to afford guns ammo vehicles etc.Tl Dr Game is just a huge grind that can be fun when playing with friends which is the only thing that makes it even remotely worth the buy.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,For a while I did enjoy the game it had a lot of fun moments especially when with friends. The story is interesting I didn't really enjoy the 3 man dynamic but at same time I tought it was really different and cool. However the biggest part of the game and the one R* is focusing on multiplayer is pretty bland when analysed. There isn't really anything you can do other then races PvP and Co Op missions.They added a lot of new vehicles and other kind of missions but in the end they still follow the same categories and it the fact that everything they is 10000x more expensive that all the money you could ever make just so you'll buy their shark cards. Mods like OPEN IV we're trying to allow a better experience in multiplayer. Where roleplay actually played a role and the world itself had a lot more to offer. This wasn't the first that R* went after but it seems to be the one that people have rallied up the most about. So that's why I'm writing this. So that I can let people be aware that R* is killing their game and will continue to do so with their other franchises.Now I know it may seem counter intuitive seeing that I did buy it but if you still haven't bought GTA V I recommend you dig in to everything the games has to offer before making your choice so you'll know how little you are actually getting and maybe reconsider.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA 5 has a fairly long story with many unique characters and a fun online mode were you could meet many interesting people that you could do activities with such as heists races and deathmatches. The things I personally like best of Grand Theft Auto 5 is the combat and driving in the game (which there is a lot of) Which is very realistic and immersive and great for roleplaying.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-29,0,0,158,False,Recommended,Let me just say this before I get started if you're looking for a good game then you've found it go buy it now. If you need more information then let me tell you. I personally across all platforms (PlayStation Xbox and PC) have about 13 000 hours. It is a beautiful game with a huge community and regular free dlc updates which keeps this game alive.Lets talk about the graphics this game no matter where you are in game will keep a solid 60 frames at high settings at 1080p on most modern cards thats without mods but little to say this game is very optimized and runs great. That should be expected of a 4 year old game but still for how large the game is and how many tiny details there are its pretty impressive to say the least.The story is really great its fun and the characters have some depth. Its a pretty basic easy to follow story with some pretty good characters such as Trevor. The story is pretty easy (except for the mother ing yoga mission) and very enjoyable once you have finnished the story there is tons of content to explore not to mention the massive library of mods to further the time put into this game.One of this games strengths is its weaknesses. That is that this game is now on PC. If you don't understand what I'm getting at its that while on the right hand you have impressive graphics and high frame rate on the other you have modders in the online scene. This can be a make it or break it situation since this game amassed a huge following through its online servers. For the most part the anti cheat is ok but if you run into modders most of the time its gonna mean no fun.Get the game its worth it put the modders aside and you have an amazingly fine tuned beautiful game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-13,0,0,350,False,Recommended,Moving on from the console versions of GTA V even after months of delaying and waiting this game proves to still amaze all gamers. Obviously the graphics is the biggest upgrade but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the PC port. It's amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. Feels like there's no difference except (better) performance graphics and details in the game (like its music). I already owned a 360 PS4 and Xbox One version of GTA V but it was well worth $60 to buy the PC version. You get what you paid for and even more. This PC port is what every game developer should aim for. How optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. It's safe to say that all GTA players will be missing out on a new experience if they don't purchase this game. 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

They still dont care and just banned.EditSo after returning from the temp ban I got reimbursed for the shark cards. i played online for a bit then jumped onto singleplayer. I know its not the hardest singleplayer to get money in for obvious reasons but I was cheating a bunch to fast forward a bit and to better buy weapons and property. I tried playing online a few days later to be told that i have been permanently banned without any reason as to why being stated on screen. I submitted two tickets both stating the ban cannot be appealed. I gave their customer support a call. I got help pretty quickly. The guy on the other end was nice and seemed like he cared. I told him about the situation i was in and he sounded genuinely sorry. But even from his end there is no way to remove bans. He also stated that there is no way for them to tell why i was banned either (I beleive people have stated that rockstars banning methods are automated. Not 100% on that though). He said what most likely happend was that the cheats/mods that i was using for singleplayer were detected as having changed the game files and had triggered the ban from the multiplayer.Long story short Be careful modding or cheating in single player. You may receive an irreverseable ban.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-07-03,1,1,461,False,Recommended,"Well this game has come a long way since the initial PC release. Though most games have there problems on release this one seemed to have gotten worse with progress as far as issues to a point where I had to put it down for a while.After recently picking it up again I must say I had quite the pleasant experience with online mode now that seems performance issues have been resolved and the servers are much more ""quiet"" now. Here's a run down of my experience of GTA V Story Mode An extensive story where it was fun accomplishing the missions / heists due to how much action there is. A great selection of voice actors though that probably is a given considering the main character models were derived from the actors themselves. A lot of side missions to help you get familiar with Los Santos and things to do around town. Many vehicles and if you're at the right place at the right time you can grab a decked out Super Car to travel around in. There are 3 main characters all with there own story that later connects up with each other so you can relate to the minds of every perspective which ultimately leads to your choice of how you want the game to end.Online Mode The same vast open world that is in single player but now instead of side missions is filled with activities to help you master different aspects of the game (parachuting racing PvP etc.). There's not so much a main story here (outside of the intro stuff with Lamar) but the heists make up for that. Character Customization. When getting down to the advanced tools when creating a character you can make him/her look however you choose. And then you can later change some minor details by visiting a Barber Shop Car Insurance. Afraid to lose your car because it's awesome and expensive? There's insurance in Online Mode so you could easily call and get it back. Freemode Events. Freemode (initially) didn't have much purpose to it other than upsetting other players. Freemode events now give Freemode more of a purpose than just an interactive lobby. VIP / CEO This made online fun for me again. Being able to bring in your friends and start a company with them and customize your office (for the right price of course) and doing more advanced Freemode missions to make the big bucks back that you invested into it.Other Things Director Mode. I enjoyed being able to make movies using the Rockstar Editor and Director Mode. Think of this as ""View your Last Match video On Crack"". Benchmark Testing. Trying to optimize what my computer can and cannot do in this game was easy thanks to this testing tool supplied right inside the game. Having stuttering / fps issues? Make changes and benchmark test it again.All in all I can say this game has come a long way since it's initial release and I'd recommend it to anyone who asks me.",Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar has also improved its security based on its servers so that players that hack actually get banned and not ruin the gameplay Experience for others. Earning cash in the online game is quite adequate but difficult in some ways such as bodies being fragile due to the ragdoll physics but other than that its all good besides the players that randomly kill you for no reason. Finally the single player storyline player is very interesting and with all the new stuff its really a must play game for all those GTA players out there.

2017-06-18,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,A week or so after I purchased this game for PC (after waiting what 2 years for the PC port then another few months for my birthday) Rockstar dropped a patch that made the game unplayable for more than 5 10 minutes at a time.Patch 1.28 support.rockstargames.com A month later they released a patch claiming to fix this problem to no effect. I reinstalled the game steam and even Windows with no luck so I uninstalled and tried to forget about the $60 lemon in my library. A year later some unrelated patch caught the problem and I was finally able to play through the game three years after it was first released and a year after I bought it.A few days ago Rockstar began removing mods from the game and I've uninstalled it for what I figure to be the last time. The game is still $60 dollars on Steam somehow but I'm not sure I would recommend this game for $10. I will likely never purchase another GTA game after this protracted negative experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

There's something unique about GTA which transcends the limits of a simply great game. Tapping into the core of modern humanity the ability to speed steal and slaughter with reckless abandon is the purest incarnation of our inner desire. As expected Rockstar delivers the next level of the series with the high quality we've come to expect all the while keeping true to their style overlaid mockery of our societal values leaving no aspect of our culture untouchable including themselves.

2015-11-05,1,1,62,False,Recommended,Reviewing Grand Theft Auto is somewhat pointless. Nearly everyone already has an opinion on it nearly everyone has seen the gameplay and most people already own it. But do I recommend it? Only if you like open World Games that make you feel like a participant in Pulp Fiction.ProsUpgraded graphics from console versions.Open world gameplay that lets you do almost whatever you want.Upgradeable owned vehicles.Excellent acting writing and performance. Very good gameplay both for shooting and for driving. Previous GTA games struggled with the driving but this game gets it just right. For those who strictly use Mouse and KB the helicopter controls aren't great but doable.No frame caps or locks. Many graphic options.ConsNo mod support.The game should look better and run better. Yes it looks good but it s very taxing on higher settings and doesn t look as good as it should. As of this review I am running an i5 + GTX 980.Each character has at least one vehicle bonded to them. You can upgrade and customize it while being sure it will always respawn. Unfortunately this does not apply to vehicles you steal or purchase. You can store them in a garage but if you total it or leave it outside for too long it will be gone forever. This is a failed opportunity.Considering how old the game is since the first console release Rockstar s pricing has been very aggressive. Remember the winter sale Shark Pack special that was 10% off but actually cost the full retail price?Global leader boards for race times and other competitive events are dominated by obvious hackers.The online community is pretty small.

Rockstar never let their fans down and the products they release always manage to make its way up. GTA V is no different and is probably the masterpiece of the masterpiece.Using the same technology from LA Noir and an improved engine from GTA IV GTA V is an amazing game making you have nerd s every time the loading screen finishes and you start playing.Different from other game developing companies Rockstar knows it takes years and effort to deliver quality. That is what they have been working on this game for so long making the time waiting finally pay off. GTA is a game made by highly talented professionals to game lovers. Very optimized and fantastic in every single small detail. From the random events that occur when you are driving by the city to the movie like missions you will come cross.Rockstar has my respect in all senses. You fell involved with all the environment the cities have to offer making you want to play it more and more and more.Although they use their own software to store saving progress and friends it is still well designed and friendly and this surprised me because we had bad experiences with GTA IV in this sense. Well the fact is that it can not be compared to the trash Ubish*t and EA call GAME and 'gaming platform'.All I have to say is well done Rockstar! You do respect your fans and are great professionals. I would pay double if I had to if I could have products like this in my computer.PROS AMAZING storyline OUTSTANDING gameplay ASTONISHING graphics AWESOME in every single small detail Well designed missions Very optimized Pretty well designed controls A TRULY GAMING MASTER PIECECONS Small bugs Multiplayer takes time to load Nothing ELSE!Ubisofty Activision and EA. Please learn with these gentleman how to treat your costumer AND develop softwares.Thanks.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-04,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"Here's my philosophy on the games as it relates to this OpenIV debacle buying a game grants the producer of said game money and the purchaser limited rights to the game's usage. If a producer (Rockstar) openly supports a new usage of their game (modding the source code of the game that OpenIV enables) then this extends the rights of the end user to include this new usage. In this entire event one must understand the role of Whales (See the Extra Credits video on Whales in F2P games for a better explaination of the term) in freemium multiplayer games as well as hackers. While a gaming company is fine in supporting whales with a business model they should never support hackers. Whales and hackers both ruin the online experience in GTAV. Whales have paid hundreds if not thousands of dollars to get ahead in the multiplayer aspect of the game without needing to grind or extend hard effort for leveling while the hackers do so illegitimatly through exploits that the game's developers have ignored in patching. This creates a smalll amount of ""top tier"" players who are the most powerful in the game.This disproportion of high to low level players in the Online aspect of GTAV is what makes for such a frustrating experience for the average gamer. Hackers and whales alike have little or no repercussions for attacking the average Online user. This makes and even more grueling experience as a gamer that does not want to hack or pay to win is faced with countless setbacks in trying to make progress in the online aspect of GTAV. Many users who wished to avoid the litany of wanton unfairness in Online and still wanted to experience Online's content turned to mods. Modding GTAV requires specific software. One of the more popular softwares for handing installing and managing mods in GTAIV as well as GTAV is called OpenIV. It was created by a group of Russian developers for the sake of modding. One of the figureheads of this development group GooD NTS has posted a notice on the OpenIV website as well as the GTA forums detailing their side of the issue. So go look for their statement if you want more clarification as I will not be detailing GooD's post here. Essentially what has ended up happening days after Take Two the parent company Rockstar has stated they are ""undermonetizing users in GTA Online"" is that the two companies (Take 2 and Rock*) issued a cease and desist letter to the OpenIV development team. This guts the modding scene for GTAV as more than half of the mods for the game rely on OpenIV.Connect the dots and you can easily deduce that Rock* and Take 2 are trying to push people back to Online to buy needed Shark Cards the game's microtransactions to survive in a broken online environment that they refuse to fix. Both companies ruined their reputation with this bureaucratic idiocy and I refuse to support them until OpenIV comes back from the grave.(If you are looking for my performance review I was having constant frame rate drops from 30 45 fps no it never reached 60 fps on a variety of settings. This made the game nauseating and unplayable for me.)",Grand Theft Auto V

GTA 5 can be depraved amoral sickeningly violent and childishly desperate to shock yet it s also one of the richest and deepest games ever made with an ambitious three stranded storyline that holds so many disparate parts together.

2016-03-31,1,1,853,False,Recommended,This game is awesome. My computer runs it like but I dont care. I have 300+ hours on PC but I played it for 800+ hours on PS3.This game offers a lot of content in two different ways Singleplayer and Online.Singleplayer is playable for 50 hours but with mods you can spend another 50 hours. The story and cool but lets face it dickin' around is MUCH more fun. Cheat codes trainer mods and all is the best part of singleplayer.Now for the online you start by creating your character by selecting your parents. A very cool method. You get a car and you do the introduction and all of this and that. Freemode is a 30 players lobby and is awesome for all of you thrill seekers or chill dudes. You can buy a whole arsanal of weapons hundreds of vehicles (including a TANK Attack choppers boats armored cars etc.) and modify most of them in the local Los Santos Customs. You have a large selection of vehicles mod but if you wanna go hardcore go to Benny's Originals where you can blow your IRL college funds on GTA$ to pimp out a lowrider. Btw If we are talking about blowing your college funds you can also buy a YACHT and customize its livery lights flag and all. mine costs 10 000 000 $.The Online offers a lot of missions and Heists. Those will fill up your pockets with greens if you dont want to pay real life money (I grind missions every time I play and do 200K 400K in 4 6 hours of gameplay). The missions are 10 20 minutes of action that includes a LOT of bullets flying your way crazy getaways and in the end some money in your pockets. Some missions require one player at least and some require 4 players. I'd recommend playing with one or two friends at least. The Heists require 4 players. The Heists are done by doing the setups (usually 5) and in the end the heist itself.Lets talk more about freemode. Did I mention there is a mast shop on the beach with over 100 masks? No I havn't. Also there are couple of hundreds of cloths waiting for you in the clothing shops. any player can choose up to 5 properties from a large selection and these include Garages Houses and Apartments. some of the apartments can be customized. Ok so if you like action all the time the freemode offers the Freemode Events which are missions without loading time with high payouts.I can talk about this game for another 20 minutes but I gotta go so Im gonna stop after this last paragraph.This game is AMAZING. If you got the time for it just buy it and enjoy. Don't let anything stop you.carlitos AWAY!!!!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-13,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,This game is obviously a great concept it's graphics are incredible and it's got one of the best singleplayer campaigns i've ever experienced. But don't expect to get any enjoyment out of anything beyond campaign the online is almost completely unplayable. You're gonna get randomly dropped from heists right before you finish you're gonna freeze and crash anywhere from 1 3 times an hour and you're going to spend an agonizing amount of time in loading screens after every job. It's literally a worse experiance than it was on Ps3 or 360 seriously...it's the same matchmaking and the same waiting around for lobbies that will never launch. Don't waste your money on this game if you had it on another console. It's worth it for first time players for the campaign alone but if you thought GTA V online would be super awesome on PC with 24 people andtons of players for deathmatches and capture missions.... well you're out of luck. It's ironic that Rockstar made a game about bank heists when the biggest heist involved in the whole game... was the ing game itself.... and the got a lot of people twice...Update game is still a giant turd GTAO is unplayable.

Online side has good deal of hackers stealing your cash and weapons. Online car selling is really bad with highest you can get is 9.5k cash from every 40 mintues so another way making tiny cash.Online Biker or CEO side is bad with mission to sell items with plane where high level players with fighter jets try to kill you all the time or cars where players can wait next to your lock up and kill you after the 3 second count down and everyone can kill because you become a hugh marker on the map. so if want to make anything being a biker or CEO. just focus the game to make go in solo sessions to get little money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-20,0,0,284,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a huge and well optimized game. The map is big smaller than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas's map but still a big map. You have the abillity to make your own radio just like in Grand Theft Auto IV and that is very nice.The Singleplayer you have the abillity to play as three different characters which in my opinion is something amazing. The storyline is awesome even though one of my favorite Grand Theft Auto characters Johnny Klebitz gets killed by and when Trevor is being introduced but the storyline is just awesome.And here we are with Grand Theft Auto Online which makes the half of the game. You pretty much play the usual GTA stuff but you have the abillity to create your own character &amp play on sessions with up to 32 (30 playing and two spectating) players. GTA Online is totally better when playing with friends and doing different activites. You have a lot of missions such as VIP work (you need an office) Import &amp Export missions (you need a vehicle warehouse) Cargo Crates (you need a warehouse) biker's work (you need a motorcycle club) biker's business (document forgery weed counterfeit cash meth and coke businesses) and a lot of other missions. There are a few problems with the sessions and of course the players hydra griefers people ruining your missions. Even worse GTA's developers thought about giving the griefers more cars and planes to grief.But overall GTA online is an amazing game.9/10 totally worth buying.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-20,0,0,820,False,Recommended,After multiple delays Grand Theft Auto V has finally been released on PC and it was well worth the wait. Rockstar s open world crime epic was released for last gen consoles in 2013 and a remastered HD version was released on PS4 and Xbox One in 2014 making this essentially the third version of the game. Taking advantage of modern PC hardware it brings yet more visual improvements as well as a suite of new features exclusive to the PC version including the remarkable Rockstar Editor. It s a tale of three criminals Michael Franklin and Trevor. Michael is a retired bank robber living a life of luxury with his family in witness protection but who misses the excitement of his old life. Franklin is a streetwise repo man who wants a better life for himself. Trevor is an unhinged meth dealer with a seriously broken moral compass. They re three very different characters brought together by a shared desire to break as many laws and make as much money as possible.Michael is the most interesting of the three. Grand Theft Auto games typically chart the rise of a criminal but in Michael we see the bleak hangover of that success. He has a palatial mansion a luxury car and all the comforts that wealth brings but he s also deeply unhappy spending his days reclining by the pool drinking whisky and listening to Phil Collins. But a chance encounter with Franklin whose career has only just begun triggers an extreme midlife crisis that sees him returning to a life of crime. The characters are colourfully written and acted but they re frequently overshadowed by their surroundings. The game s setting is the fictional state of San Andreas an analogue of southern California that s several times bigger than GTA IV s Liberty City. To the south lies the city of Los Santos a satirical reimagining of Los Angeles and to the north you ll find Blaine County a rural expanse of desert mountain and forest. You can traverse this vast space in a broad selection of vehicles from muscle cars motorcycles and eighteen wheelers to jet skis fighter jets and speedboats. It s a wonderfully varied and stunningly beautiful landscape and the attention to detail is dizzying. Rockstar s world building is among the best in the business and this is their greatest work. In the poor rundown areas of Los Santos gangs loiter on corners and the searchlights of roving police helicopters hunt suspects through alleyways. In Vinewood Rockstar s version of Hollywood expensive sports cars glint in the sun tourists pose for pictures and aspiring actors yap into their phones about auditions. In the countryside you ll be passed by hikers cyclists and dog walkers. Extras in costumes wander around movie studio lots and biker gangs roam the desert highways. The sense of place these details evoke is lightyears ahead of other open world games. This is a product of both Rockstar s keen eye for detail and their limitless budget. And the fact you can share it with other players makes it all the more exciting. GTA Online is a game in itself mixing GTA s sandbox chaos with elements of massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs). You can take part in elaborate multi mission bank heists with friends or just crash around the open world causing trouble. It s a thrilling online playground with a compelling level progression system and hundreds of missions including bicycle races death matches destruction derbies and skydiving competitions. There are some problems with lag but no high profile PC game is immune from this on launch week.Ten places every Grand Theft Auto V player should visit View galleryA wealth of PC graphics options brings San Andreas to life in the most vivid detail yet. There s adjustable tessellation motion blur high resolution shadows and pretty much every setting you would expect from a modern PC game. It has native support for 4K resolutions although you ll need a powerful GPU to take advantage of this. But it scales impressively running at 60fps on high end and medium spec rigs. After the disappointing PC version of GTA IV this is a welcome relief. You ll have to sacrifice some of the finer details like the gorgeous depth of field effects and ultra high res textures but it s entirely possible to play and enjoy GTA V without a super powerful PC. If you have the muscle to run it at max settings the visual fidelity is astonishing. Driving through the city at night in a storm neon signs reflecting in the puddles and on the rain slicked hood of your car it almost looks photorealistic. But the real star of the PC version is the Rockstar Editor an amazingly powerful tool that lets you record in game footage edit it and upload it to YouTube. At any time during play you can start recording. But instead of recording video it records an in engine snapshot of your actions letting you go in later and move the camera add filters and implement dozens of other tweaks and effects. Then using an editing tool that s like a stripped back version of software like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut you can string the footage together add music and text and then put it online. Accompanying the editor is Director Mode which lets you change the weather and time of day in a scene to create a specific mood as well as selecting virtual actors from a massive list of non player characters. This gives you total control over your scenes and combined with the editor allows you to make virtually any kind of film you can think of. You could create a gritty gangster drama a horror a nature documentary or a David Lynch esque arthouse film. It transforms the game world into a giant film set and creative players will be tinkering with it long after they ve completed the game. It s been a long time coming but Grand Theft Auto V s PC debut is a triumph. It maintains a slick 60fps on even mid range PCs with only a few visual compromises. It offers a large number of adjustable options to tailor the game to the strengths or weaknesses of your setup. The Rockstar Editor is endlessly entertaining. The online heists are with friends some of the most fun you can have in a multiplayer game. The single player story is an exhilarating series of increasingly absurd missions. And it all takes place in one of the richest densest most atmospheric game worlds ever built.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-23,0,0,941,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V what more can I say. This game has been out for a couple years now and having played it on the Xbox 360 the Xbox One and PC putting over 50 days in the online component alone this is the best game I've ever played. I feel confident saying so as this game is the best $60 dollars I've ever spent. Or I suppose $120(ish) (I own it from a license transfer on the Xbox One). Open world games are my favorite types of games and this game is a masterpiece on so many levels for the genre. The world of Los Santos is an incredible representation of the United States' west coast so much in fact it is scary. That alone is a story for another day but its sprawling metropolis and scorching deserts are so lifelike it's incredible. Rpckstar put so much effort into detail I find myself disccovering more throughout my playtime each day I play. Rockstar continues to update Grand Theft Auto V Online almost every single month. Adding in new game modes vehicles weapons clothing and features. Some complain as the content is ""miniscule"" complaining we need to see more hiests. When sure I'm not arguing against bigger and better conent but you cannot complain for how much has been given already. Seriously almost every feature I've dreamed of coming to Grand Theft Auto V Online nearly literally has. Between chilling on a yacht cliffdiving going to car shows getting in police chases drift competitions drag racing demo derbies flying diving etc. This game never gets boring. At least not if you make it fun. There is so much to do in GTA V if you lose interest it is your own doing for not being creative enough to try something new. Because in GTA V there always will be. If you haven't bought it yet get it now. seriously. This game as of 3/23/2016 is a 10/10 masterpiece of writing design and most importantly gameplay. I could go on for hours telling you why between all the memories I've created in this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,378,False,Recommended,11/10. I'm sure that's enough to say about this game.Edit (01.21.2018) This game is still a masterpiece and will remain that but there are problems with it...The first and the biggest one is that we won't get a DLC for single player. It's story was good addictive detailed.. It was like a movie that you can play through.The second problem is with the online... the game is started to look like the battle of endor in Star Wars... Flying motorbikes flying cars swimming cars indestructible trucks and planes with the armor of a tank.. I mean... if a plane goes into a helicopter with high speed the plane should get damaged or something and not flying like nothings happened... (5minutes later with at least 10 rockets into the plane and its still flying).GTA Online wasn't that bad it had some problems with the servers and lobby but lets just say that it was new for rockstar games... but I think the online free play mode had gone too far.I still recommend this game like i said the single player was worth it and there are still a few fun things that you can do in online too (heists races stunts etc...),Grand Theft Auto V

There is no good way to make money in the only line game play the whole online experience is designed to force you to buy shark cards. Just buying a fairly nice yacht which purely servs as a floating spawn point is 10 mil or 100USD.

2015-11-06,0,0,257,False,Not Recommended,This is more or less a disappointment from what I expected it to be there is alot that has been improved however it feels very stripped compared to gta 4 its visually very good but you essentially have 3 main hiests and thats it you also have random events between the characters that dont really progress the story they seem like fillers just to fill game time.Now I got this on sale because I couldnt justify the $60 price tag I have also discovered that this game makes modding very difficult if not game breaking. which is what made GTA 4 fun to play after the game was 100 percent completed.All in all this in the series has to the biggest let down out of all the series And i started playing at the beginning.Pros Pretty ( the graphics are incredible Vehicle mods are actually useful Traffic behavior is more true to lifeLarge Map ( Huge ) Cons Short Story mode No continuity between the characters they seem to have random events between them Which feels like death by exposition.Money system seems flawed you really only have 4 major ways to earn high dollar amounts in the game and 60 percent of the missions dont pay anything...Lamar seems to be useless and a added player to add missions to space fill.....All in all if your a true fan of the game series by all means buy it and play it like i did. but dont expect a giant improvement over gta 4.If you are on the fence Id wait till they loosen up and add workshop support for mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-21,0,0,278,False,Recommended,I am a huge Grand Theft Auto title fan and I pretty much respect Rockstar Games and their work. I was very excited years ago when the xBox 360 and PS3 versions were out. So I waited for a long time pre ordered it that means I have played it from the PC release day (14th of April) . I had many many funny moments online with friends and I also enjoyed most of the missions because they were just so intense. So I played around 180 hours then I sent it for a little holiday.After 5 6 months I decided to put this game on spot again after a long vacation. I loved this game so much in the first quater of the year after PC release booth the story and the online as well. But what I hear from every channel is that most of the people are facing with hacker issues. So I'm not really sure what's going on but in my opinion Rockstar have should keep maintain their online community with effective tools like VAC or that wouldn't be cheap / doable? But I'm not crying here so back to the point This is a really entertaining game well optimized very artistic and action based. Also atmospheric and has so much memorable moments (story mode) and fun (online mode). I love every single part of it. The story is very well the map composition and the graphics style also. I like the handling of those cars and weapons and the challenges as well while hunting for achievements or trying out myself online. Grand Theft Auto V for PC is definitely a Game Of The Year.

This game is really optimized with me having a gt750m and a quad i7 i can run the game smoothly with graphics that are a mix with current and next gen consoles graphics.Doing anything you can think of grand theft auto 5 really is a masterpiece. Everything from driving to shooting feels fluided and natural to the player and you wont think twice about ever going back to grand theft auto 4. new city new fun grand theft auto 5 takes place in the updated San Andreas giving the city new life. You can do almost anything in this city from golf tennis hunting scuba diving gas station holdups and more. The property management is making a return from grand theft auto San Andreas with an updated system for it. You can buy docks along with bussiness and make money on the side. Also added as the addition of first person mode which you look through the eyes of the person you are playing as also if you are in a car in first person mode you will find that the speedometer and the gear changer works just fine giving you accurate information about what gear you are in as well as how fast you are going. Also lets not forget the rockstar editor which allows you to make your own videos and movies in grand theft auto. the fun never ends If you thought that grand theft auto 5 could not get no better than you have not seen online yet. You can do even more stuff online as well as meet some new and current people through out your adventure in grand theft auto online. It is amazing the stuff you can do online from buying your own house to leveling up and buying new weapons and items the fun really never ends online. review this game is a one of a kind that does not feel like a port along with first person mode and the rockstar editor. Going back to grand theft auto 4 is a no. If you have anything above a gt9800 you should get this game you wont regreate it and you will become attacheted to grand theft auto 5 never wanting to let it go. i give grand theft auto 5 a 5/5 star rating.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-21,0,0,96,False,Not Recommended,I must preface that this is not a review base upon the core gameplay of GTA V! My decision to not recommend this game is purely based upon the very poor business practices of Take Two Interactive. Take Two s Cease and Desist to the OpenIV modding team is completely anti consumer and only worked to achieve the opposite affect of what was intended. I assure you that this move by Take Two has only made the online experience worse. It has created an F U attitude towards Take Two (for good reason) by pretty much all who still play the game online and because of this it has only served to increase the number of people who hack and cheat on the online servers. Not only does this negatively affect the online community but it also affects those of us that looked to GTA V s single player campaign as an open world sandbox with what could give you at one time almost unlimited possibilities. The sad thing is my review of this game would be fairly positive if it wasn't for this aspect. I would love to give this game positive reception but as it stands I cannot support the actions of Take Two and I refuse to give this game my recommendation until further notice.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-14,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,Take 2 and Rockstar have issued a cease and desist for open IV the backbone of Grand theft auto 5 modding making the game essentially useless for the people who just bought the game for the modding potential. To be honest i wouldve given this game a good review if it wernt for this. All they are doing is trying to push more people over to GTA online where they can charge you for micro transactions... Aparently it isnt enough to be the 2nd best selling game in the world after MineCraft. absolutely pathetic. What a thing to do to such a great game.,Grand Theft Auto V

I am refering to the recent issue regarding the downforce multiplier which is currently broken and the turning left oversteer issue a while back. And one more thing the grinding in gun running is the worst i can stand grinding when i can play the game but being FORCED to wait over 3 hours to research or pay 225k to fast track? This update is the worst by far. Not ony does the grinding in gun running make GTAO boring for me for the first time it impliments overpowered weapons and vehicles increasing the ammount of pvp griefers in free roam which in my mind are akin to online hackers.,Grand Theft Auto V

If this becomes precident imagine all of the games that will lose the reason we got them minecraft gta just cause just to name a few. Also think of all the great games that came from mods dota and thus the entire moba scene came from modding dayz as well. Modding is an integral part of gaming and if this becomes standard we lose the essence of what is pc gaming.I encourage you all to do the same protest against Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!

2015-07-01,0,0,459,False,Recommended,*See Update 01/01/16*GTA is a well established IP so I won't bore you with specifics about the gameplay just know that it improves on previous games in many ways. Where GTAV shines is in the solo story mode. The writing is fantastic the story is engaging the characters are genuine. Throw in the huge immersive world and a vast diverse soundtrack and you get a very complete solo experience.Things fall apart in multiplayer. Unfortunately the servers are absolutely infested with hackers and there doesn't seem to be much the developers can do to fix it. The only way to enjoy multiplayer is to create an invite only or friend only instance and hope you have enough (non hacking) friends to play with to keep things interesting. *Update 01/01/16* It appears that Rockstar has vastly improved the online experience by cracking down on hackers. Regardless of your stance on modding one cannot deny the vast improvement to GTA Online after the crackdown. Further Rockstar continues to very regularly provide additional content for GTA Online. This keeps things fresh and gives you more to work towards. GTA Online is now where I spend most of my time.In closing I would say that while I recommend the game I would tell anyone who is still on the fence to wait until it's on sale. The game has been out for a while now so $60 seems too steep unless you're a fan of the series or just have plenty of disposable income.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-25,1,1,296,False,Not Recommended,"So let me explaine some things first 1 I have minimal computer skills so i do not mod.2 Over 200 hours so i think ive had some time to test most things (i know not everything!) out from DLC to Experiencing hackers/modders (Yes there is a difference).3 Im usually a person that stays very neutral cause evey coin has 3 sides.So as i write this review (as it is only my 2nd I believe) i must say I weep a little. The time I have had on this game has been about 98% Fun and 2% Rage. Fun mostly because of all the Wacky and Zaney things you can do from driving around killing anyone and anything to having ""Escorts"" suddenly appear in your office and explode (thank you Mr. Modder!) to having someone go around and kill everyone with their fists or car (Yeah talking to you hack boy!). The only reason I even would log onto this game with my friends was because we knew that eventually someone would come on with thier ""Codes"" and cause some crazy chaos! But now the servers are filled with boring repeditivness because everyone is either afraid or want nothing to do with Take Two (NOT ROCKSTAR!). So because of this latest overwhelmingly negative decision that was made out of fear (AND BECAUSE THE SHARK CARDS FOR THE GUN RUNNERS DLC DIDNT SELL AS PLANNED!) I have decided to give this game a bad review. HOWEVER!!!!!Understand this. The game itself is amazing! I love it I just cant stand the fact that all the Fun/Soul has been taken by Take Two. And because of this now people that did mod out of love for the game just had all their work mean nothing! I know they knew the consecuences but still. Its very sad to see all that hard work go away. Much love for everyone that mods for the love of the game! You guys make it worth it!",Grand Theft Auto V

Ban which resets your characters. So Money and time I've spent playing this game is gone. So my ban got lifted today. I make a new character all is good when I log off. until I try to log back in and I have a perma ban. I played my new character for like 20 mins. Nice game rockstar.

Even better actually assuming you have a half way decent computer. Keyboard and mouse control is very good. However it may just be me but you might run into mouse acceleration/lag issues if you switch from controller to KB/M in game. I had to unplug my controller after switching. Other than that game runs great for me. As is the case with many people I've already played it on console. It's a very well put together world that is extremely fun to explore. Online is even better and the servers have been pretty good so far at least in Private/Invite Only lobbies.Also before I end this First Person Mode is very well done. It's not for everyone and aircraft can be tricky to control but it's obvious R* put a ton of effort into it. It's not a simple camera location change.

2017-06-21,1,1,414,False,Not Recommended,GTA Online is not worth playing anymore unless you have tons of money burning a hole in your pocket.Here are a few points Prices for DLC items are ludacriosly high. With the recent Gunrunning update Rockstar have introduced a ton of new items and feature such as armored vehicles gun upgrades bunkers awesome right? Untill you look at the prices with even the smallest scope for an SMG costing over $50k of in game money or over $3 million for a bike that can fly for a little while. There's no GOOD way to earn a lot of money. With the new update and it's bunkers they made a new way to make money... By waiting for literal HOURS for a payout of at least $100k. The only good way i can think of is completing heists but even then it takes hours and you will be turning a profit only if you crank up the cut % for yourself. Cheaters goddamn cheaters. With both of the points above people will look for ways to earn a lot of money really quickly and the simplest solution is to download a cheat. And with that comes a healthy bonus of tools to make any gta player suffer. Capturing you in a cage exploding a blimp on your head drowning you in the ocean stealing your weapons or just running around in god mode killing anybody that comes close are no big deal to pull off. With cheaters being able to spawn infinete amounts of money appear a lot of beggars that spam the chat with requesting money(that might not be a big deal for someone but it personally annoys me). Some cheaters think that everybody wants money and end up getting innocent player banned for no reason. The OpenIV drama. Take Two interactive decided that they are not making enough money from GTA Online so they deleted the only good tool for people to have fun in single player so players will have to play Online and pay for SharkCards. This is a bad move. Enough said.And that not covering the many bugs rude and racist players and etc.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-21,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,Great game bad publishers! How can you just punish the whole community because of a few rotten eggs? Why not work proactively work with the people who create the mods for the community to enjoy them? Both companies have gone down in my estimations! Not recommended in its current form!For the record this game has got to be my all time favourite along with all of the other games in the grand theft auto series. The singleplayer has a depth and structure that is rivalled by no other game in the same genre. And then there is the multiplayer (where most people spend there time on GTA nowadays). The multiplayer is just outstanding the fact that it is continually updated free of charge is great and keeps it fresh although you can clearly see this business model is done to gain extra cash through the shark cards. But it works! I enjoy the grind to earn the cash for all of the new gadgets and gear. Don't let my playtime of this game on steam fool you I have played over 600 hours on the PS4 excluding singleplayer and then the time I put into it on the PS3. Once I am confident that the publisher (Take Two) will not interfere with the positive modding community I will of course say that this is a game that you must have in your collection.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-22,0,0,508,False,Not Recommended,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME Great game but.... I have been playing GTA on PC since the very first GTA on pc. Rockstar Games have been pretty much ignoring to the point of unsulting their loyal PC base as of late. If the mess and lack of effort that porting GTA 4 to PC is any indication (a game that ran better on the abommination of a CPU called Cell on PS3 better than on a high end x86 PC even tho the game itself is made on a x86 PC... And lets not forget Games For Windows Live required DRM connection) Rocksstar has in fact told the PC community to F**k off for two straight generations and probably will continue to do so. This time Rockstar addressed the bad coding issues that plagued the last GTA and GTA 5 is actually a well made game running smooth as butter and since GFWL doesn't exist anymore we can avoid that nighmare. This time however Rockstar decided that getting $60 dollars out of you is not enough to keep you in gaming servers somewhat safe from hackers. Rockstar also decided that $60 is not enought to let you have the full expirience. They make you work for money (I already do enough of that in real life) making the process of buying property a repetitive slow and eventually boring. None of the money you earned in story mode transfers to the online part of the game and lets not get confused here that is where the bulk of the game and the fun is. You don't have access to a ""stock market"" online either so no way to bet yourself into some money. If you're like me and don't have countless hours or patience to do these stupid repetitive missions you're screwed out of the fun. You can't even have a scooter without a garage to put it in the garage cost money and even when you have the garage you can't ""steal it"" you have to buy it. Ironic on a game called GRAND THEFT AUTO! Rockstar's soution is to then use REAL ACTUAL PALNET EARTH MONEY to buy fake money and enjoy the game that you already payed $60 for pretty much holding the game's data hostage until you pay for it. If you're like me (not rich and no freebies in life) money matters and paying more than the $60 I payed for to enjoy my own game is kinda messed up. The fake money you buy is even more expensive than the game. To buy high end Stuff you need millions. To buy millions in fake cash is $99.99 of real planet earth american dollars. You need high end stuff because not only is it the reason we buy the game but because you can't do everything unless its high end. For example some characters can't visit you unless you have a high end home and it keeps on going like that on many other issues. To buy high end stuff for me it means I'd be giving Rockstar $160+ to enjoy my own game. I guess a lifetime of my money to Rockstar hasn't been enough. Of course to counter this insane and predatory ""Goldman Sachs"" style of business people hack for money. Hacking breads hacking and now the hackers are out of control. You might spend every last dime you had on a gun and suddenly BOOM hacker left you without guns. You might be running from the cops on a mission and BOOM hacker puts a plane in the way and you crash and loose. Yet!!!!!!! If you hack for money even without doing anything to anybody you get banned. Yes banned and it can be permanent. Rockstar doesn't care about the game they jut want your $99.99 for that fake money so you can unlock the rest of the game data they're holdingfor ransom. That also means that you spend $99.99 of your money to buy fake money to buy guns that a hacker can take away and yes you lost that money f**k you we don't care we're Rockstar so what if you gave us $60 if you want a whole game pay us more or go out and make your own game. So if Rockstar by some chance and miracle reads this Touche. You win. I'm nobody. It's a shame that a game that I have loved and has influenced my entertainment so much is no longer a part of me. That teaching my just born son to play GTA and chill with my family through the medium I have invested so much in is no longer a reality. I'm totally heart broken. I wish nothing but payback to Rockstar and I hope some goverment somewhere turns around to tax the living crap out Rockstar and tells them with a smile ""hey you know all that tax money you gave us? yeah well we want more and we're just gonna hold your rights and corporate protection ransom and keep over taxing you until we feel we have all your money"" DO NOT say you work for Rockstar around me I WILL charge you tripple for everything.",Grand Theft Auto V

Because every game decide how they should be played right? And this multiplayer really really suck people around the city. It's hard to find a gentle dude that will help you doing mission cooperate and be friends. Half of this community are childs well if they're not they ""act"" like a child. When you open your phone and got message from strangers that needs help to prep their heist you have 2 choice ignore the message or help them but in the end you'll get nothing but a blood on your face. The map is like a radar where you can see every players on it and i hate that why? Because people will know your place and shoot the out of you i feel bad for newcomers got harrassed by veteran (100lvl above) all day long. You will respawn near the location where you die and they will keep shooting you ""sometimes you can't believe other people"" but in this game ""You can't believe other people"" feels like playing DayZ only the difference is there's no punishment for the bad guy.There's actually some penalty if you go rogue like your icon going red on map and got bounty but it's just that. When you're dead the penalty is gone and you can continue to mess around.I don't think Rockstar is the guy who can make online game. The Multiplayer sucks it's not well designed and well organized you need friends that can cooperate with you in order to enjoy it. Some games are fun to play because the devs knew how to maintain the players.If you want to buy this game just think about it....It might be ""The Magnificent Grand Theft Auto V"" but please don't be blind sided this series were only magnificent because back in the day Open World title was just been introduced and there were no other Open World game that as good as GTA well Driver was pretty good too.Singleplayer was Great Multiplayer sucks.

History shows us that forbbiding stuff will not neccesary get you the wished results but often the expact opposite.

In short OpenIV is the program that allows mod creators to make mods and mod users to manage mods installed in their game without corrupting the actual game files. OpenIV is one of the largest and most popular mods for the game and it's death will have massive rippling effects across the entire modding community. The way I and many others see it Take Two is trying to push would be modders to instead use the micro transaction laden GTA Online. This action taken by Take Two shows to me that they care more about money than they do about their fan base and for that reason I cannot recommend that anyone purchase GTA V or any other Take Two Interactive game at this time. If you are still skeptical have a look at this questionable quote from Take Two's CEO.""We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a per user basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach which is delighting consumers."" Strauss ZelnickIn the language used in the cease and desist order Take Two claims that OpenIV ""allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation Take Two's rights."" This reasoning could be applied to any mod seeing as modifying the software is literally what modding is seriously modding is literally short for modifying. That being said there is no reason to expect that Take Two will not do the same thing to other mods so if you do in fact purchase this game do not expect to have the right to mod it.GTA V is a good game with tens of hours of unique story driven gameplay however I highly recommend that you do not buy it and show that you are against Take Two's recent corporate over consumer views.Sources Nerd³Jim SterlingGooD NTS gtaforums.com (OpenIV lead dev)the Escapist",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,1,1,577,False,Not Recommended,For 10 years now the Grand Theft Auto series has been edited and modded by people to make the game more enjoyable. Hundreds if not thousands of people have bought one or all of Grand Theft Auto SA Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V just to mod it. The modding of these games have been done mostly in singleplayer and with the help of OpenIV a software that lets you get into the game's files and replace vehicles scripts textures etc. The closing of OpenIV leaves 10 000s of people without access to be able to mod their games and leaves 10 000s of people without the ability to continue their hobbies. All modding used by OpenIV is for singleplayer use only to make the game more enjoyable the software OpenIV was never used to mod multiplayer or Grand Theft Auto Online so it does not harm anyone. Myself and other members of the LSPDFR and GTA modding community ask that OpenIV be allowed to continue distributing and running as a modding software and that the modding of the Grand Theft Auto series including SA IV and V be deemed legal again as Rockstar Games has said in the past. Thank you.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,374,False,Not Recommended,The 'I Feel Like Reading A Novel' Version A couple years back I had saved up for the better part of that year on virtually minimum wage to finally upgrade from a bare bones laptop to a much higher end computer and I distinctly remember that this game was finally on its way to PC and how excited I was to play it as one of my first games on my new rig along with a free copy of Witcher 3 graciously donated by a friend of mine.I had a blast. I really did. We all did. We used our stimulus package got ourselves apartments one high end car then proceeded to farm missions for cash shoot each other talk trash all that good stuff. It kept us reasonably well occupied for months. It was then that I noticed something something changing in the lives of me and my friends perhaps by coincidence. We started getting actual lives....Well maybe in the beginning it was more they were getting actual lives at first. We still managed to all hop on but I found the game wasn't as enjoyable without them I wasn't fond of online lobbies full of hackers which had been a problem since day one but I figured it came with the territory. Either way I still managed to have some fun by myself working towards better guns and more cars on my own and cherishing the time I had when my friends hopped on. As time went on though our time together got shorter and shorter. They were having relationships weddings kids or even just longer shifts at harder jobs. As all this was happening more and more DLC was pushed out at greater and greater prices and I too stopped having nearly enough time to 'catch up'. I couldn't just play this one game struggling at the same missions I had played a year previous due to my inability to find any sort of enjoyment from playing with the public.Thus I cheated. I found a way to get money without all the grind bought a yacht multiple apartments all the guns and military hardware I could purchase and filled those garages with cars. Before this and ever since I'd never resorted to something like that and at the time I felt very guilty.Notice that I said 'at the time'.I was caught obviously had my remaining funds removed and I was banned just like I should have been. I served my time gracefully hopped back on weeks later found I still had my other assets still available and for a short time felt on top of the world again. With all of my ill gotten gains I was able to convince my friends to come back for awhile so we could share them together and was more than happy to let them wreck these fine cars I hadn't earned but we had a great deal of fun. Then more DLC was released. Then more. All interesting all with shiny bells and whistles...but all at absurd prices. I can't even imagine how long it would have taken to legitimately earn all of the stuff on my account previously but to acquire all these new vehicles new properties new weapons...All at once I no longer felt badly at all for my previous actions. I only felt disgusted that I felt guilty in the first place.Needless to say I'm here today because of the recent attack on modders and content creators that are doing their best to freely and legally have some enjoyment with this medium like me and my friends had tried to way back when. It really got me thinking about the direction gaming in general is taking a pastime that has kept me above water for the past couple decades. I have other things now of course and in fact with my own work and relationship obligations my own time for such endeavors is dwindling and I have less time to hop onto this...well I'm not even sure if I could call it a game anymore at least just from my personal perspective. It feels so much like a job now except one that has no true payoff that I could get any real use out of. I just feel like if I wanted to struggle doing monotonous overly familiar nonsense to get a nice car I could do it in real life and get a real car. Games are supposed to pull us out of everyday struggles for a short while not remind us of exactly what we're trying to get a little break from.I guess I'm just rambling now and not making a lot of sense but I'm probably not the first person on the internet to do such a thing.The 'TL DR And I Have Important Stuff To Do' Version This has become a game geared increasingly towards minors. The content isn't fit for them but the time needed to grind the same missions over and over again for twelve hours straight obviously could only be feasibly accomplished by a child or teen with few to no responsibilities. Of course there are Shark Cards but I'm not even going to bother speaking on those nor do I have to.I'm just glad I was given Witcher 3 as well as it retains the same charm it had that very first day and never became something so...painful.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,276,False,Recommended,Made my year.Literally have been waiting (Just as long as the world I guess) for this since last year. I originally wanted this for the PC only to evade the population of console peasantry but since the game itself is alluring enough to capture my attention I played it for the PS3 to get a taste of the story. After playing for the PC all I can think is wow. Playing this game in 720p at 30fps then truely unlocking the beast at 1080p and 60fps (Even 4k capable). I loved the whole game story in the PS3 version of the game and it's essentially the same but since the PS3 version doesn't include 1st person this gives the game a whole new depth. It might even be necessary to say be carefull in 1st person driving especially with a motorbike. I literally was getting motion sickness with the insane realism of driving and my inability to operate motor vehicles after 3am. I was initially worried about the controls with adaption for the PC. I was planning on simply installing my controller from PS3 to deal with the crossover. After playing the game I'm actually incredibly surprised how much I love the keyboard and mouse for this game! Driving seems incredibly more responive as well as first person shooting naturally. The only downside of driving is the new method for pitching vehicles mid air which is shift and L Control by default. Something to definetly get used to but I think it will be worth it since driving actually seems easier now. It's actually even incredibly useful on motorcycles to lean forward with shift and still steer. Naturally every system of controls have Pro's and Con's but I think this might actually be an improvement.I had some time to experience GTA V Online for a couple hours and was very impressed. I never actually played online for the PS3 version of the game but I thought it was great. The character creation was fun and allowed a lot of choices and I had no technical difficulties playing missions online or interacting with other players. Granted this game was delayed at least 3 times but in the end I wish all games were released this well polished as a PC Port. I couldn't pick out any flaws with this game besides having to wait so long for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,1,1,222,False,Recommended,Pros Overall a great game for the pc. If you are used to how this game looks on the console you will be blown away by the graphical improvements and the GTA experience at over 30 frames per second. There are a rediculous amount of settings so you can customize the game to your liking. The controller support is also amazing since GTA V provides a seemless transition from keyboard to controller. I personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else. The game as a whole seems so smooth driving especially. Cons You have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isn't up to par. The obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens. Finding a GTA Online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time. Joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens. In the end I couldn't recommend this game enough. The game itself is among the funnest I've ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-26,0,0,159,False,Recommended,Probably one of the best games ever made. Has been an instant favourite since release on 360/PS3. Then I played it again on Xbox One then again on PC. It's just so good. I like all of three main characters and they all have their own hilarious quirks. There is soo much content hidden in this game that it's possible to almost always find something new. The story is excellent and the missions are all fun to play. The first half of the game is my favourite...Rockstar keep making amazing GTA games... I really hope they make a GTA Sydney or Melbourne but... We all know that probably won't happen. This game is near perfect. If I start playing it (offline) it's a struggle to stop. It just sucks you into it's highly detailed and immersive world. Online the game is also excellent. It can be frustrating for people at the start the mandatory tutorial and then being thrown in with all the high end players but it's rewarding in the end. Messing with other players has never been so much fun.... Example I was down near some dockyard type area and I see a player (dot on map) approaching me. Made a call to hide myself (dot) on map for 30 seconds? Got our my rifle and him as he was approaching in an SUV. Got in and realised he was trying to make a drop off because this car was worth 6k. Needless to say i collected that 6k and then to be a further A..... Put a bounty on said player while he endlessly tried to kill me. It doesn't punish you for dying. You won't lose all your weapons or money. I'd reccomend this game to anybody.,Grand Theft Auto V

Sadly because I was recently banned due to Rtards(Rockstar) Skynet level of anti cheat where if it sees one thing out of place It exterminates your account. I was falsely banned from GTA online. A hacker put me in a Gondola (sky car) and proceeded to spawn tens of thousands of dollars on me. I was awoken to an email from R* telling me my account is PERMANENTLY BANNED. Don't even try to get yourself unbanned... The support team will Ctrl+V a automated message telling you that you can not appeal bans.But I digress. I recommend this game because I played it since day 1. All my friends purchased this game and were siked to play. We continued to play this game days on end. Non Stop. This was probably one of the best gaming experiences I have. When all of us get on to play some GTA O It is some of the best times of my life. Staying up until 2am just dicking around. We never played seriously. We did all the heist and the 10 Mil. Challenge (also some of the best moments). The online was very fun (disregarding script kiddies). The single player is pretty good.

Where you will NEVER have enough money to afford the new content that rockstar keeps throwing at the online community accepting praise for ""Well orchestrated online play"" and ""fantastic content"" instead of fixing the broken and overpowered sh*t.Where you will have to grind ingame money for bDAYS /b at a time just to REACH anything remotely cool.So if you've stuck with me this far take off the rose tinted goggles and realize that GTAOnline is awful now and though the singleplayer is fantastic (and if you want a good story be my guest.)$60 for a decent story and sh*tty online sure rockstar. be my guest.",Grand Theft Auto V

RAN BY BUSINESSMEN WANTING YOUR MONEY AND ONLY YOUR MONEY.GTA Online spends more or less 15 20mins per hour of gameplay loading and connecting to servers and loading setups instead of precious gameplay times. And speaking of their server...After a year I'm beginning to realize how terrible the GTA Online servers can be and how Rockstar isn't doing anything to fix it in even the slightest way possible. If you join a public server be prepared to be auto teleported into airports and die each time you spawn. You may encounter free money drops due to the uncontrollable amount of hackers but Rockstar is banning almost everyone who gets too much in game cash in a small amount of time. If you get banned that's it you can't email them for lifts and a second ban is permanent. Also the first ban will delete your WHOLE GTA Online character which suggests that rockstar simply does not care.If you don't like waiting this game is not for you but really.....you'll still play anyway.AND that is why I changed my review.

I recently bought GTAV on Steam purely for the multiplayer aspect doing all the missions and just causing trouble with friends would have been fun. I was very disappointed when I got into my first lobby though. All I was getting was people that repeteadly kill low levels and invites to heists but the second you join and they see you're a low rank you will get kicked. You can't host a normal mission to try and level up to the correct level for specific heists either because no one wants to do those since you get more money from heists.I DO NOT recommend getting this game if you want the multiplayer version because of this issue.

2016-10-20,0,0,1288,False,Recommended,"While i did give GTA V a thumbs up please read my review for some cautionary advice and preparation before playing this game. Also i can only speak to the PC version and do not have any experience with the other console versions. OK I should start this by saying i have played and adored every GTA game since Vice City and i have been there since the birth of Rockstar (yea im old ya'll) and have never even had a need to contact their support untill this game. I want to say this is a great game because before the CEO and Bikers ""expansions"" it was amazing just like all the GTA games that came before it. It had everything i wanted from a story mode and the ability to FINALLY play a GTA with friends was nothing less than a dream come true. That being said there are some very serious issues going on in the online portion of the game that are not being addressed or even acknowledged by Rockstar. Ever since the CEO update my friends and I have experienced never ending sporadic issues when it comes to utilizing the new and amazing (in theory) features for making money in the online portion of the game. I have had deliveries that bug out on the last drop invisable and intangable items that are required to complete re supply missions repeated disconnects freezes black screens infinate loading and the dreaded ""unexpected close"" from the Social club during key moments in money making ventures the list could go on and on. These are issues that have been occuring for months to many people according to multiple forums and support threads yet they are not being fixed or acknowledged and Rockstar has even had the audacity to publicly post on their support site that ""this is the price you pay for doing these types of public missions"" as though these are the result of poor choices or lazy gameplay and not the crippling glitches they truly are. In fact the only support beyond pure denial or the insinuation of being a greedy liar my friends and i have been able to get from them was being told that we should be recording all our gameplay with a third party software and make a Youtube video of these bugs and crashes. Of which there are plenty if you check on Youtube yet still no fixes are being presented. I myself have lost about 1.6 million on CEO deliveries that bug out on me and i cannot complete due to missing supply social club drops for myself or assisting party members and even a bug that will not allow u to access any of the in game computers that are required to start said delivery missions. Sadly 2 of my IRL friends have perma quit after weeks of filling the largest warehouse which costs about 500k to the CEO with the promise of a 2.2 million dollar pay out and days of non stop repeat missions only to loose it all during a 10 minute delivery when the final 2 drops were not recognized leaving us with an empty plane and 2 drop sites that couldn't be supplied. Even i took some time off after that one... Now that being said I still love playing this game believe it or not. I have well over 500 hours put into it and i will keep playing it because it is great when it is working. I would only suggest to anyone to be persistant in reporting all issues and if you can do record any and all ""big deal"" moments as they suggest so that the mountain of proof becomes so undeniable they will hopefully be forced into action.",Grand Theft Auto V

However GTA was and always will be a great game. The strength of the modding community is a sign of this even the buggy unoptimized GTAIV has an enviable library of mods particularly real life cars (the main reason I play GTA on PC and not on console).However they slowly started to regain my faith with Max Payne 3 a surprisingly well optimized game that ran great at 1080p near maxed (except MSAA was off) on a 1GB GTX560 non Ti. I've since upgraded to a 4GB GTX760 Superclocked and since GTAV and Max Payne 3 have similar engines it comes as no surprise that GTAV runs like a dream!Optimization is superb. Full 4k resolution support (sadly I don't have a 4k display) highly scalable even on an Intel IGP (yes I tested it on my ultrabook it runs better than the X360/PS3 versions) keyboard/mouse controls that feel fluid and responsive (especially the driving) full action replay support a new first person interface developed exclusively for PC and next gen consoles and just jaw droppingly beautiful graphics. It's hard to believe that the same studio did GTAIV's port.The gameplay is the same old GTA we know and love set in sunny Los Santos San Andreas (an obvious parody of Los Angeles California). It takes a less serious tone than GTAIV did especially when Trevor Phillips (the world's greatest fictional Canadian bar none) is involved. I simply can't stress enough how awesome Trevor is. Just Google him. He should be the virtual spokesman for GTAV. I have heard negative things about GTA Online but I have not tried it nor do I plan to. Thus I will make no opinion about it. Overall the two year wait was well worth it. As of October 2015 real life car mods have made their way into the game and I'm going to spend more time than ever playing it.,Grand Theft Auto V

But there is a big nono in this game called hackers. some are really kind and do simply nothing or spawn in fun cars but then there is the f ed up side the people who want to ruin the game they make you lose money or lose your level. one time a hacker kept destroying cars under my name (yea i know how in the living is this posible) he made me lose a lot of money (like 9 mil) and made me bad sport. well why do i still recommend it? it is fun it really to play heists or simply races or hangout on your yacht.

Nice gunplay Cars dont drive like stranted whales now but drive like they would in real life Rockstar editor Make your own races deathmatches etc. Cons Hackers ruin the game for you DLC prices for ingame items are too much if you ask me A pain in the to connect to lobbys the connection is awfull sometimes while my internet is the best Holland can offerRating 8/10 its a really good game with a lot of potential and is a really fun sandbox but the hackers and connection issues sometimes ruin it. overrall good game and is a must buy if you like sandbox games.,Grand Theft Auto V

There are three types of playing you will find on gta online and those are the regular players the idiots and the modders. The idiots make up the majority of the player base. You will find more idiots then modders but only barely. Every server you join will have modders. Everytime you play you will come across them. I would never have believed an online game could have so many modders running around unchecked untill gta. The last group you will find composed of the regular players are unfortunately the smallest group and any experience with them will always be ruined by either the modders the idiots or both.I really want to like this game.

One of the biggest modding tools for GTA has been given a cease and desist which has essentially killed the game for me. GTA online is just a micro transaction filled atrocious nightmare of long loading times expensive product and unfair price tags. I bought this game day one for steam simply because of its massive modding community and gave it so many chances because all of the ""exclusive online content"" was available offline via mods making the game fun in the first place but now that s gone. I don t see the point of legally stopping mods other than financial gain which would not be acceptable in ANY market once you have purchased a product.

2017-06-19,0,0,489,False,Not Recommended,"I will preface this review by saying that I have had this game since it's release on the Xbox 360 which has as many if not more hours logged than my PC copy. I have had great fun with this game over the time I have played it and I have to give kudos to Rockstar for continuing to develop new content (this recent Gunrunning update for example which adds an appreciable amount of free content). THAT BEING SAID I can no longer in good conscience support this game or the business practices followed by Rockstar and Take Two Interactive. The basis for my conclusion rests mostly in the way the multiplayer GTA Online service has been handled. I have no problems with the single player Story mode besides the fact that no substantial new content was ever added to it limiting it immensely. As an avid player of this game it did not take long for me to have done everything worthwhile in the Story mode leaving me with the regularly updated multiplayer (and of course the option of simply replaying the Story mode which gets stale after the third time). Thus the only way for me to get any real entertainment out of the game at this point is through the multiplayer. At first Online was actually quite good in terms of what a player had to do in order to gain levels and money for what was available at the time (the most expensive single transaction being a Titan plane at GTA$2 million). Missions and races gave an appropriate amount of money and RP for the level of difficulty they presented and said difficulties made sense and were balanced. A player could easily afford anything they could want with an appropriate amount of playing and grinding said missions. At this point in time the Shark Cards were acceptable seeing as the time to money ratio was not terrible and the Shark Cards gave appropriate payouts that reflected the amout of grind skipped proportionate to the values of what was available at launch. However it became increasingly apparent at least to me that decisions were being made to make earning money more and more difficult while simultaneously making the DLCs more and more expensive in terms of in game GTA$. The largest initial step made to do this was an across the board nerfing of all missions' payouts and RP gain while also concurrently PUNISHING efficient players by instating a system that only allowed the full payout of a mission to be given only if more than (I believe) 20 minutes were spent playing said mission. It's not as if the payouts were reduced a little bit as many appropriately lucrative missions had their payouts reduced to almost if not more than 50% of their original payout. This severely neutered all player's ability to fairly gain money severely. All the while DLCs were released with new mor expensive items such as super cars that were significantly better than existing models (no original models of super car compare to newer ones in races anymore). I would not have had a problem with any of what I have said or about to say if one simple model were followed the value of real money to money gained through Shark Cards should have reflected the new content and increased difficulty of earning money by decreasing the real money needed per GTA$ as time went on. However cards such as the Great White Shark Card which gives GTA$1.25 million and costs $50 USD remained the same and their relative worth in the Online game only decreased. The real cost should have decreased or the amount of GTA$ given increased (or both at the same time) however this has obviously not been done in any way shape or form. Then came the Finance and Felony updates which promised new ways to earn big money . . . except for the fact that you needed more than GTA$1 million to even BEGIN USING THE NEW CONTENT. You had to purchase a CEO office the cheapest of which with no additions costs exactly GTA$1 million plus at least a small warehouse which all cost around GTA$100 000 or more. In addition the maximum payout for the cargo missions is GTA$2 million which can only be achieved with a large warehouse which cost significantly more than small OR medium warehouses. Thus to even be able to play the full content that was released you would need upwards of at least GTA$1.5 million. That price would have been realtively acceptable if not for the aforementioned fact that ALL players' ability to make any appreciable amount of money got severely cut down. The same case goes for Import/Export which required an office and vehicle warehouse. It also further encouraged other players to grief one another (for ludicrously paltry rewards too) which actually discouraged cooperation and interacting with other players and made many players seek out empty lobbies ultimately defeating the spirit of Online play in general. Not to mention the insane price tags on the special vehicles which were all in the multi million dollar price ranges. Even with these new ways to make money it would take full days of gameplay to even be able to make near GTA$2 million. Any player that plays the game fairly from scratch at this point would need hundreds of hours to be able to access all the content. The same goes for the Bikers update and Gunrunning which require millions of GTA$ to even become remotely profitable which is of course made worse by the fact that almost no player is going to have the amount of free time necessary to acquire the GTA$ needed to play all of said content (especially in the case of Gunrunning which not even Megalodon Shark Card at $100USD to GTA$8 million can afford you all the content therein). All of these factors lead me to conclude that the Online game has been molded to better push the sales of Shark Cards under the guise of ""free"" DLC. This content cannot be called ""free"" in any sense of the word if the only way to actually play it in any reasonable amount of time is to purchase hundreds of USD worth of Shark Cards. No normal human being will be able play the amount of hours needed to actually get the money fairly though the game unless they have no other obligations (job school family . . . literally anything else OTHER than playing this game). People rely on people who give cheated money or they cheat themselves simply because there is no other reasonable option (no buying hundreds of USD worth of Shark Cards is NOT REASONABLE ). Also the argument for the Shark Cards being a necessity to keep the DLC free would be more valid if not for the fact that GTA V has been in the top 10 bestselling games on the entirety of Steam SINCE IT'S PC RELEASE. Being priced at $60 USD (not to mention themassive sales of other Rockstar titles) that should be more than enough to sustain the release of the DLC. In addition to these factors it also seems as if Take Two Interactive wants to demolish the entire GTA V modding community with Cease and Desist orders against benign software such as Open IV (Their claims of it affecting Online play is a bold faced lie as Open IV cannot do anything to the Online on it's own and would require memory injection to have any affect whatsoever in additon to the fact that Open IV is not even used in this way either as there are better tools for affecting the Online game). Whatever your opinion of modifying GTA V there is much evidence pointing to mods improving the longevity of games. It is my opinion that GTA Online has reached a point where it is no longer viable for most people to play the game fairly and is thusly inappropriate for the publisher (Take Two) to lash out at these people when they should actually pay attention to their consumer base for once and fix the Online game's business model. Of course I doubt they would ever do this depsite all the negative press they are continually generating for themselves BECAUSE Money.",Grand Theft Auto V

You won't get rich in multiplayer without paying extra money for ingame currency.You can do multiple things to earn money but all of them are extremely time consuming and in the end not worth the effort. There's a lot of multiplayer exclusive vehicles so you'll have this annoying feeling you never got the full content. Physics are NOT like GTA 4. Ragdolls are simplified collisions are no longer fun to do there's no ing around with ragdolls anymore the system is simplified and rather disappointing compared to GTA 4's. Loading screens take AGES and often end up getting you stuck in them this may sound like something that can happen and is bearable but it often prevents you from continuing a series of heist missions online since the host will just end up having invited someone else by the time your game finally un ed itself.You cannot just boot this game up for less than an hour of playtime since it'll most likely consume 15 to 30 minutes if you're unlucky.Those are the main cons that make me kind of not like this game but it's still one of the best online open world experiences you can find it's just a shame it's so commercialised and requires extra payment to enjoy it to the fullest.,Grand Theft Auto V

But that doesn't change the fact that this is a desperate attempt to maintain profit as is ingame economy inflation. the attitude is all still there so it's an empty gesture.Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive were relatively small before the modding community of GTA San Andreas exploded. Since then hundreds of singleplayer only mods have extended the longevity and enjoyability and been promoted by Rockstar themselves and the partnership has become a AAA powerhouse whose community is largely made up of that same community dedicated to Singleplayer mods. Now in an effort to pour that playerbase into GTA Online which Rockstar themselves have stated is focused on profit over playability and contains a hyperinflated economy which forces constant dedication or literal hundreds of real dollars through microtransactions Take Two and Rockstar have taken brazen morally decripit legal action against the OpenIV team whose tools have been constructed down to Russian copyright standards and meticulously made to prevent abuse of the game or modification of its online counterparts with the contrived excuse that the tools and communties using them are purposefully tailored to abuse Rockstar's online games and profits. This behaviour is inexcusable and until Rockstar's and Take Two's gross negligence is resolved in a manner deemed satisfactory by the community I will no longer use or support Rockstar and Take Two services and encourage others to sign the petition calling for reparations at https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv.TL DR Go eat a boat you contemptible scrooges.,Grand Theft Auto V

There's no need to send you back to free mode just because one person in a heist DC'd the ready room would make more sense. There is no need to have to wait for 4 people for a mission when the mission can be done with 2.Many more problems await which you can find for yourself if you want... all else I'm going to say is that if you buy this game prepare to be annoyed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,OpenIV and the modding community on PC is the only reason why I bought the game on PC again after already buying it on PS4. I wanted to hold out on buying GTA V until it was coming out on PC. I felt that GTA V was still worth buying again on PC FOR THE MODS. Take Two's actions against OpenIV ruined literally everything that made GTA on PC special. The only reason I bought it on console to begin with was to give the game itself a shot when at first they wouldn't say if GTA V was going to release on PC at all. When it did release on PC I transferred my PS4 online stuff to the PC version. Now without modding support I don't see a reason to continue playing this game for the vanilla content. I've never finished the vanilla content in a GTA game anyway.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rince and repeat an average of 4 times to get into a lobby and start a heist/race/match within ten seconds of starting (which requires an additional load screen) you realise that your entire team is made up of 6 year olds.

If there was a ever a game that you could play over and over and still find something new to enjoy this is it! Constant updates keep the gameplay experience fresh and even if you experience everything GTA Online has to offer you can try out the thousands of user created jobs to complete!

Now that they have decided to completely destroy modding by filing a lawsuit against Open IV which is basically needed to create mods that game is dead for me. The Multiplayer part of it is just filled with hackers all the way and the prices for cars planes and so on are just ridiculious.

At first I wasn't sure about the split storyline between the three protagonists but they all grew in me and made me play the game a bit differently for every character. The music oh the music. The radio stations play memorable songs for every genre and made me drive around the block so many times for wanting to listen the song to an end. Only concern is the last quarter of the main storyline. It felt a bit rushed at times and they could've extort a little bit more about one's family or one's street roots or one's strip club.

2017-06-15,0,0,756,False,Not Recommended,I'm leaving a negative review on behalf of the OpenIV team. The cease and desist of their modding tool for the sake of selling shark cards is reprehensible. I have poured hours into this game but always resisted microtransactions in a full price game in no small part because it would INEVITABLY lead to this attempted shutdown of mods even for SINGLE PLAYER. They already started keeping new Online content out of Single Player mode to force you to go online to experience it and likely needing to pay real money to purchase it. That was almost understandable. This though is completely and blatantly anti consumer.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,190,False,Not Recommended,I have 150 hours on record. If that changes I would be amazed at this point. I preordered GTA V back in 2015 when the PC port came out. I was ecstatic. I played through the pretty decent story and started to play online. Back before many of the shark card changes inflation and updates that made your wallet drier than the gobi desert. Back then I was in love with this game.Since then Rockstar has taken our game and completely soiled it. These greedy moneygrabbing bastards that work at Rockstar gamed us. We paid $60 for a game. $100 gets you $8 000 000 of in game currency. Do you know what that gets you anymore? Nothing. A few fast ish cars maybe a yacht if you're lucky and that's it. $100 for 4 or 5 3D models many of which you won't drive or use because you're spending the rest of your time grinding missions for every penny they give you. (Normal missions yield you chump change compared to what they used to).Don't give any money to this greedy joke of a company they're like your crack dealing cousin who always needs money. It's disgusting. I will never purchase anything from these extortionist jerks again. When I pay $60 for a game I DO NOT expect to spend a DIME more for in game content. Gaming has been ruined by companies like Rockstar.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,280,False,Not Recommended,Overwhelmingly Negative. That's the response to a recent C&amp D sent out to one of the biggest GTA Modding supports out there. A anti modding statement like that alone is worth all the negativity it deserves. The game already had a bland singleplayer story riddled with ancient tropes that were only excused by a obvious cliche power fantasy and a online multiplayer with no balance or real reason behind it's design to be worth your time investing into.Before the C&amp D people excused and praised GTA because of it's high budget game engine open world and it's willingness to allow mods. (Which the developers have stated they support but issued the C&amp D.)Support modding and follow the outcry to punish developers for handicapping their games needlessly for the sake of pathetic profit lines. There's no other reason to prevent the modding community from prospering and any claims that this will reduce cheating are entirely false as cheating will always be in a game without any major firewall.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have over 1000 hours on GTA online alone and have never had a problem. however i turn the game on today and get a message saying they have corrected my account by $1982998 even tho i don't have hacked money and earned all my money legit in the game. i have heard of many other stories of people getting banned and having money taken away from them for no reason so for this reason i cannot recommend this game until they stop taking money and stop banning people that are legit players. It also wouldnt surprise me if Rockstar were doing this on purpose to get more people to buy shark cards (esspecially considering the comments Take2 have been makign about not charging enough for shark cards and how they should be makign more money from the game.),Grand Theft Auto V

Since then the mod tool is back and all is well.Except it isn't.I don't know it's it's Take Two or Rockstar but while GTA V still remains one of the best singleplayer games I've ever played the business practices behind this game's multiplayer are repulsive.Not only is it pay2win garbage with several overpriced DLC packs but Rockstar is constantly banning legitimate players for being targetted by hacking players.Furthermore that excellent singleplayer has received absolutely no support since this game's release on the PS3 and 360.So while I still love this game I still can't in good conscience recommend anyone pay money for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-16,0,0,994,False,Recommended,Alright560.9 hours total as I'm writing this review. How do I feel about it? I enjoy it its a fun game.I played through the story initially it's ok not a huge fan I'm more into the whole collecting cars and doing missions and just shooting bad guys and stuff (even though in this game you are sort of in a light a criminal yourself) But that's what makes alot of the fun.So to start with as I said I do enjoy the game. If you like shooter games and action involved with missions it's great. Once you complete the story if you have friends that play you can start online.Online its a little bit different I came from PS3 which you saw a modder/hacker rarely on PC version they're quite frequent Every other session most of the time. They tend to be jerks and will kill you multiple times just for the heck of doing it. The game isn't broken rockstar does try to combat these people who exploit scripts to grief others during their gameplay in which we are trying to enjoy the game while abiding by the rules laid out. The policy you agree to with almost any multiplayer game. Nothing strict.Moving on There's lots of cars to modify plenty of missions races pvp and just area to explore. I still discover new in game art that I didn't see and it's fun.The in game currency can be a bit grindy to earn. But worth it.Overall I would recommend it if you want to try it. It is fun but as with any game it does have its flaws.If you want to try it Just try it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,"One of the best games in the series. However the shutdown of Open IV was completely unreasonable even to fight hackers. The devs should fix this and Take Two the people responsible for said shutdown should really consider how this decision will affect sales of their future gamesWith that said the shutdown does not in any way affect the vanilla experience of the game. The game runs pretty well on my PC and the storyline isn't too bad. as a sandbox there's plenty of secrets to uncover activities to do great variation in vehicles a way to switch between first and third person view Really too many things to count.Edit There's a huge problem with your online when some hacker loser can do garbage like put a ""Cage"" over you or set your character to set on fire and respawn on fire.Wish there was a maybe button.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-12,0,0,586,False,Recommended,So I've owned this game since it came out on PC. Huge fan of the series. I've played pretty much all of them apart from GTA 3. So here's my verdict Great game. 10/10. Thanks for reading.......................Ok but seriously if you don't know about this game (which I find hard to believe) all you do is steal cars kill people and make money to buy stuff. Sounds simple enough? Game is also in 3rd person but can also be played in 1st person whenever you'd like. Although sometimes (in multiplayer) you might be forced into 1st person for a match. I know this because I've done this to my friends. The 1st person view of GTA V is incredibly daunting not to mention very jerky. Trying to strafe and aim is like trying to write an essay with a knife lodged in your arm it's possible but rage inducing. Plus you have less of an advantage in 1st person so that view is more for the hardcore people.Ton of cars to steal and own. Fast ones slow ones ones that fly ones that float on water. If it moves you can usually steal it. Decent amount of guns too to keep you occupied. Multiplayer locks you out of some weapons until you're a certain level. Same with some vehicle upgrades so keep that in mind. Multiplayer is about as fun as single player. You can use cheats in singleplayer to have more fun. Sometimes you run into hackers in multiplayer (as with any game). But Rockstar has been working on it for months and it's gotten a LOT better.You can play golf tennis do yoga do a marathon parachuting free falling darts pool BMX mountain biking and more (I don't think I can name every single thing honestly). There are so many mini games. This is on top of the missions heists deathmatches and objective modes that you can do in singleplayer and multiplayer. It's hard not to find stuff to do. Btw earning money does take a bit of grinding so I recommend doing the 2xp events whenever you get the chance.Probably the best 60 bucks I've spent. Great time waster and can really relieve stress. When it's on sale it's basically a steal. I should probably also mention mods but Rockstar doesn't really like that idea and if you mod you're subject to having your game rights taken away like you won't be able to log onto Social Club to play online. But yeah I recommend this game. Probably my favorite GTA so far.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-07,2,1,45,False,Not Recommended,You have to be very careful when buying multiplayer games like these. When you play p.c it increases the chances of hackers by alot because of how much faster and easier gettings hacks for video games is. Now im not at all saying this is a bad game. This is a great game but it faces the biggest problem when playing online by yourself. Hackers typicaly play on any online game they can find and will most likely have god mode on and be spamming money all over your character making you richer than bill gates on a budget. Hackers online can completely spoil and ruin the fun for new players and they are literaly everywhere. When i used to play gta 5 on xbox there was not a single hacker when i played it and im not saying that xbox is better than p.c im just saying that when you switch from xbox to p.c just be prepared for a lot of t that normally wouldnt happen when your playing xbox. I payed 35$ for this game on black friday for a steal but for what the game really is when you play online and become a god because of the hackers i couldnt regret more buying this game. Now the singleplayer is 100% ok and really fun but playing online by yourself isnt challenging and rewarding considering the amount of effort you put into picking up money from the hackers. You can play privately by yourself or with friends which i highly recommend if you already have the game. Now lets go over this LOTS OF PEOPLE PLAY ONLINE GARUNTEED MORE THAN SINGLEPLAYERPLAYING ONLINE BY YOURSELF OR WITH YOUR FRIENDS PUBLICLY WILL MOST LIKELY WILL HAVE A HACKER IN THE LOBBYWHEN THERE IS A HACKER NOTHING IS A CHALLENGE ANYMORE AS HE FEEDS YOUR BANK WITH LOADS OF MONEYI USED TO PLAY THIS GAME TO BE REWARDED FOR GRINDING MISSIONS FOR HOURS AND GET THE FEELING OF WORK PAYING OFF BUT NOW WHEN I PLAY ONLINE I TURN AUTOMATICALLY INTO A MONEY GOD AT NOT EVEN LEVEL 20Overall this is probrobly one of the greatest games of the 21st sentury and still lots of people play it and it lived up to its hype and beyond. But is it fun to play online freely with hackers eliminating every challenge you expected before you play online? No not for me no thank you. its ok though you can still play with your friends in a private session and play the singleplayer but just be aware you paying $60 for something you might not enjoy as much as other people. I rest my case......,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-22,0,0,1628,False,Recommended,First of all let me start with the fact that Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto Online are both very fun. Grand Theft Auto itself is very nice. It has a cool Story and a bunch of things you can do when not playing story mode missions. The Graphics are nice even when you are playing on a Laptop like I do. The Game mechanic's and AI of the NPC's in the Game are quite realistic. Even the fact that there are different car types in different Regions in the map makes GTA V a very realistic game. The mission's are nice and you can skip some of them if you failed them for the third time. You can use every vehicle instantly as long as you can find it somewhere across the map.The same things apply for GTA Online. The Gameplay is supprisingly fluid even with bad internet connection. The Heist Mission Thing allows you to make quite a lot of money if you play all of them through. (you will have to bring along your own ammunition though). Rockstargames really tries to improve GTA Online with every Update by implementing new Vehicles and Money Making Opportunities. You can buy an Office and be CEO of your own company with warehouses and sell high end cars or you can be a Motorcycle Club President ( I recommend this one for starters as a Clubhouse is much cheaper) and sell illegal goods like counterfeit money or drugs. Thanks to the latest Update you can now buy a Bunker (If you are CEO or Motorclub Owner) and sell illegal arms. A Bunker costs much money but I would recommend you to get one as it is a very good money making opportunity and will be needed to upgrade the new Vehicles that came in with the Gunrunning DLC.There are different types of missions and even if you are in freemode you can take part in so called 'Events' and make some money.All in all a great game with developers who really care for making it better with every Update.FAQ Question But wait I keep reading here in the other reviews 'Story mode great Online sucks' or 'bunch of hacker kids enjoy'. 'Money Grinding Mess'. Whats with those comments?Answer I do not deny the fact that there are a bunch of angry morrons in GTA Online. There are hackers yes but that is neither rockstargames fault nor a reason to not buy the game. The game is great and the result of many many work hours. Rockstargames tries everything to prevent hacking at the moment and I am very confident that they will find a sollution in near future. The money hacking thing has allready been made harder for hacker's as there are now limits for how much money hackers are able to drop. And in case of emergency there is still a possibility to report hackers via an Ingame GUI. The Rockstargames Support Office will read these Reports and Review automatically recorded Video Imagery of the reported Person .Question Then why is everyone so mad?Answer Just dont listen to them those are just kids who just got there supplies destroyed by some guy on an opressor bike or didnt get the hacked money they asked for and are now letting out there anger here.My conclusion is Buy the Game it is 90% worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-05,0,0,654,False,Recommended,"THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT THIS IS A REVIEW!Where do I begin being there for Rockstar since GTA III I loved the whimsical humor of the series from its unique dialog and its compelling story to every night I got my hands on it as a kid to as now a adult. I was however introduced to the community Rockstar was bulding for themselves and I loved it. Granted when I was first introduced to the series it was through a cousin's copy of the game since I never had much to call my own. But I digress the UI the character models the customization from what would seem like San Andreas quality customization is fantastic if not better. and the design to detail to the underwater life is breathtaking. One thing you can appreciate in this game is when you see a sight not many people see and you just take in what a beautiful game this truely is.One other thing I might add to this review is that the multiplayer aspect is great when you don't have modders coming into the mix and ruining the experience for you. I've had multiple experiences that I've of course filmed of where there has been npc's of militerized units dropped into my organizations what would seem like a earthquake made with bombs consectutively going off. To having to cut off my recording because some jerk thought it would be funny to drop in a economy class airplane through my apartment therefor following me around in games till I enevitably was forced to uninstall the game and reinstall it.If you came to this game and expect to go straight to the multiplayer aspect and mod it you deserve a special seat in the VAC ban wagon that alot of players who left negative reviews that were more like complaints.""But what if I didn't cheat?""Well either you did do it and its your word against rockstar's or you accepted the help of one who cheated the multiplayer game or you chose to stick around while a modder created havoc on the server you happened to plop down in. Eitherway any kind of reasoning anyone comments to this I say. ""Well there's always the option to quit the session and find a new one""Don't get me wrong the game is well made and fantastic something I was worthy of playing on day one on the 360 to the x1 to now the pc. And the multiplayer communities of the consoles fair a better chance of getting my prase than the ones who play it on the pc. There is a reason why Rockstar made a anti cheat and made it clear they do not want players having a hay day on their multiplayer servers. If you wanna mod one of their games go to GTA IV where there is no server based economy and leave this one alone you spoiled brats.",Grand Theft Auto V

The game has an in game recorder that will record about 2 mins of a moment that you're in that you can go back over and edit and mess around with. Not only that but theres a map editor. The map editor allows you to go on any location in the GTA V map and add props objectives spawns cars weapons and other snazzy stuff.

They can non stop everything up and generate as much money as they want and make it look like someone else is doing it. When hackers can screw up a game this badly and run circles around the devs you know they don't care about the player base or their game.

2017-08-08,0,0,393,False,Not Recommended,The online gameplay has become too tedious to play with the new online only DLC it makes it hard to buy any of the products in game without buying a shark card especially if Rockstar takes your money away and you have to start from scratch. the missions you play online to earn cash can be fun at first then they get repetitive and have such low payouts. the game also makes it hard for new players to have a chance of being successful in the online community because of the gap that is made when older players have a tank and a player just starting has a 9mm and can t get anything done due to them being killed about every 5 seconds.Recently my progress in my online business' has been repeatedly reset (product missing) making it even harder to earn money.Edit I have found new life in single player. I have started to play with SINGLE PLAYER mods such as LSPDFR. It is a great way to still have fun in single player as well as bring some new and online content to single player such as the new vehicles. Funnily enough I went on online today fully expecting my money to be gone because while I had mods in my game directory I accidentally tried to log into online (because of some inconvenient key binding) only to notice all my online money was still there furthering my beliefs in Rockstar s corruption. I want to make this absolutely clear I HAVE NEVER CHEATED IN AN ONLINE LOBBY.Bottom line I do not recommend buying this game purely for online because your experience will be very grindy and possibly short if you get rendomly banned. However single player is a ton of fun until you beat it.,Grand Theft Auto V

The MP was a buggy mess when released and full of hackers. Rockstar eventually fixed the hackers so they could push shark cards.

The whole point of GTA is to steal cars...yet you have to buy what you want here. Every update is a copy/paste of the last update's mission structure. So in order to enjoy the game people have resorted to mods which was giving the game some life back...and Take Two decides to put an end to that most likely out of spite that people are enjoying their game but not on their accord.

I strongly urge people to not purchase this game or any of the online content such as shark cards. You are only feeding into the mindlessness of the situation that Take Two and Rockstar are trying to force on us. Mods are a part of every game. Making them illegal is simply asinine and a HUGE mistake. They definitely lose my sale for the new Red Dead Redemption and future Grand Theft Auto titles. We are players that spent many hundreds and thousands of hours playing the excellent game that Rockstar has created but they put it up in flames that they sold their soul to microtransactions and robbing gamers of cash.

I still can't accept being taken for taken advantage on because PC is the best for modding games of all kinds on and if its attempted to be taken away 1. I know at somepoint we will find a way past it and 2. It's gonna be a never ending battle at some point because of it.Neither of which would be what I want because thats just causing an issue for both sides of having to find a way to either get past or stop one another.However I remain in the question did Take Two take Interactive it two far (no bad pun intened) when trying to remove modding from the game?I cannot recommend this game because of how poorly it has been treated by Take Two InteractiveI was glad to hear that rockstar did step in when it did at Take Two Interactive but the damage remains done and it just keeps getting worse for how they are handling it yes it takes away money for over priced shark cards but the game is supposed to be fun and having to spend $20 some days just to get somewhere initially after spending ther price that has not gone down in price at all besides on steam sales.Not sure if typing this up and saying modding will get this flagged for mentioning modders or not so my apologies if it offends anyone for some odd reason or my apologies if it gets flagged to steam for having to deal with it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-01,0,0,200,False,Recommended,Somewhat long review. Skip to Pros and Cons if you want to.Grand Theft Auto 5. A port from the PS3 and Xbox 360 game to the pc. Normally ports from those systems can be incredibly poor *cough*Devilmaycry3*cough* But in the controlls department the game has easy to learn controlls and a nice Xbox controller config. I have not played the story mode nor do I really intend to because Online is all I really wanted to play. My biggest problem with the game is optimisation. The optimisation is Horrible absolutely Dreaful and really needs to be fixed. Either it is my pc or it is the game but frequently I go from 150 fps to 23 fps for 2 to 5 seconds. And now. As the days go by the game gets worse in my case as when I first played it was 150 fps the next day 40 fps. I have tried everything to try and fix it but it just won't fix. On to the Online. The Online mode is the only mode I bother my time with and oh my lord is it so much fun my only problem with Online is that the Servers are absolutely GARBAGE sometimes my friends disconnect from the game and need to reset the entire online mode just to get back in missions. This is incredibly annoying in Heists where if one man leave the mission ends entirely. Now to a short list of Pros and ConsPros Very fun Online.Made a psychopath hillariously funny (Trevor)Wide veriaty of vehicles ranging from Cars and Motorcycles to even Submarines Boats Helicoptors and Planes.Amazing graphics if your game can run it.Incredibly fun and epic Heists in Online.Great controlls. Only changed 1 key so it can be my Push to talk on Teamspeak.Cons Horrible optimisation (in my case)Servers are trash.You have no choice of being a good guy (something Watch Dogs does really well but this is just a nitpick)Very big game file. Of course it is going to be big because it's a huge game. But this is just a nitpick once more.Overall. I recommend to anyone looking for an open world experience that you can have fun with your friends.I do NOT recommend it to anyone under 16 and even 16 you need to be mature to handle the story mode (something I did not do but did do research on)And I don't recommend it to people who have a bad heart or people who hate violence death drugs etc. And again I don't recommend it to people who want to try and be a good guy. Impossible in story mode and really hard in Online.I give this game a 7/10 just for the Online. But I give it an Ard's Recommended seal.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-08,1,1,1425,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto is maybe one of the best known video games. In my opinion and i guess in nearly every one elses too GTA San Andreas was the best one published so far. This situation was until GTA V was released. It s just epic how Rockstar managed to do this game.At first I write something about the singleplayer mode. Very exciting and believeable story. The difficulty of the missions fits perfectly some missions are easy and other need a few tries to get it the mix is very good and keeps you playing the kampaign. The characters (Michael Franklin and Trevor) are good animated and have a deep background story about their past and why they do what they do. In the prolog you get to know the protagonists and after that you have to play lots of missions with the different characters. In the beginning there are seperated story lines but in the end it all gets one big thing.Now the most important thing about GTA V the online mode It s just awesome how you can customize your character. You have hundrets of clothes hairstailes and tatoos it s simply impossible to try out everything. On of the main attractions are the heists. These are really fun to play and are an easy way to earn fast money in order to get all the things you can buy in the big world of grand theft auto online. You can spend houndrets of hours in this game because playing online with friends never gets boring. There are simply to many different things you can do.For me GTA V is definetly one of the best games since years. Absolutely recommended!!,Grand Theft Auto V

Though online has some stuttering issues currently it s only a mild annoyance in the bigger picture as the online is some of the most fun I have had in an online sandbox. So much content made even better by unscripted events and lots of players. Either singleplayer or online either one is worth it. Both are just overkill. In depth... ///PERFORMANCE/// At the moment it s mixed. Before the IGG update this game ran smooth and looked great. It still does but this IGG update has caused stuttering and considerable fps drops. Seems random and affects people differently so mileage with very. Other than that lots of settings and benchmark to fine tune your experience. ///GRAPHICS/// Simple the best adaptation of LA. Not only in looks but also the map. Of course dumbed down but the amount of similar architecture that is woven together to make this map is simple skilled. Really immersive as a result. Other than that this game looks great even considering the map size which is big. Both city and sandy shores look and feel different. From buildings vehicles to people and actions. The only drawback is textures in FP look washed out but I can let it slide as it was made as a TPS which does not needed as much detail. ///GAMEPLAY/// Flawless with a few gripes. If it s piloting a harrier sailing a boat driving a muscle car or engaging in a fire fight with rednecks everything feels different and feels good. It all works on how you would expect. Cap a guy in the head and they will go down like a sack of spuds. Clip a leg and they will fall and pull out a pistol to return fire or maybe a cop will run to help their friend. The customization of guns vehicle s and clothes are top notch (Better and more varied on online). A good mix of customization that are purely cosmetic and those that affect gameplay. Controls and movement has been improved tenfold. No more being super glued to cover or jumping over a wall instead of jumping on one. Story I felt started strong and ending stronger. The midpoint just lacks any really tension or differentiation from previous missions. My grips Singleplayer has a feature to swap characters in mission to play from their perspective and use their skills. This is good but sometimes they force you to swap when you would rather not. Heists in general are mixed bag. The first one is great till you realise both ways are almost identical. Then there is the sub one which is just awfully barebones and boring. Uneventful. Not all are bad like the F.I.B and the last one are great but most part outside of online heists (which is great) the singleplayer heists are bad. ///REPLAYABILITY/// Singleplayer alone for all the side missions collectibles customization is worth a replay and will keep you invested. The online on the other hand I have sunk 150hrs on just free roam without touching TDM Races and other games. So yeah there is a lot of content in this game. ///CONCLUSION///Overall aside from the stuttering glitch this game is a great port. It packed filled with content on both singleplayer and online. Everything matters and feels like you re getting to a higher rank. Your customization affects your look and playstyle.

2017-05-11,0,0,1080,False,Recommended,With 1000+ hours into the game I can tell you that the singleplayer is fantastic. Fun missions great story a good time as a whole. But when it comes to the extremely popular online mode things get a little mixed. Way back in the day the prices for vehicles homes and other stuff would be a little high in game but it was nothing a few missions or heists couldn't fix. Nowadays Rockstar makes little effort to hide the fact they are making all the new stuff super expensive enticing you to spend real world money to get it. So to get around this players resort to cheating in money to buy the new items. Oh right the cheaters. Dear god they are everywhere in this game. You can't go 10 lobbies without finding a modding shmuck. They will blow you up repeatedly until you leave teleport to you and shoot you turn you into a christmas tree (although thats not so bad.) among other things. However GTA Online is a blast to play with friends. So if you have 2 3 people to play with you you're in for a good time. Overall it's a good game with some glaring flaws.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-05,0,0,1009,False,Recommended,"I liked the part when I got killed by kids with flying bikes 11/10Now on a more serious note. This game is filled with kids and tryhards. I don't really know what's worse in this game kids or people over 18 that act though on an online game. Both types are cancerous anyway but this didn't stop me from getting almost 1000 hours of playtime. The game is great it's an open world game where you can do lots of stuff but some people don't see past the flying bikes and weaponized vehicles so there's a lot of griefing. And here some people will say ""iT's A PvP gAmE dOnT pLaY iT iF YoU dOnT wAnNa DiE"". First of all it's not a PvP game it's much more than that. It's not ing fartnite or any of that t. Can you do PvP? Yes you can but that's not the issue. I enjoy a good fight. My issues are KD warriors tryhards and kids with flying bikes. If they kill you and you're not in the mood for a fight and you just walk away they'll be like ""hahahah noob i'm so much better than you because I killed you in this game and you can't kill me back ahahaha my life is so great"". If you fight back they'll go into passive because you'll hurt their precious and fragile KD. My issue is with people that say you're bad at the game because you don't have good KD. Like I'm really sorry for you if you think the KD is the most important thing. Making money is utter t you'll have to grind like you have no personal life and GTA is your wife and kids. You can join grinders groups where you can help each other making the work easier. I don't know how it really works with these groups cause I played solo most of the time or with randoms.I played this game so much because it showed that there are some good people somewhere. I met lots of great and amazing people in this game. That's the only reason I play this game to find great people. I met nicer people in this game than I did in real life. So it's pretty much self explanatory.It's a fun game to play with friends. Just ignore any tryhards and KD warriors.",Grand Theft Auto V
2016-05-20,1,1,1485,False,Recommended,Revolutionized the GTA Series from the past few years. This is a masterpiece filled with large open world huge opportunities and provides many freedom of any activities especially in freemode.GTA V Singleplayer takes a new approach of having 3 protaginists to progress through the story of a familiar GTA environment that we know and love. Commiting crime just like old times and bring new opportunities to succeed crime to the next level. Not to spoil anything but having three endings was a great experience excluded the two endings that requires to sacfrice one of your 3 protaginists. The writitng is was very impressive that connects 3 of the protaginists and how they bond and work together throughout the story. Getting 100% completion was a long time but it was worth it for those who are still into the game.GTA Online Multiplayer is a different experience of GTA playing with many players can be chaos or sometimes fun. What's confusing the most is that the many people assume the GTA Online takes place before the GTA V lore but no it's basically a different universe of GTA. Sure you meet some cameos of the singleplayer but they have no connection to singleplayer. Besides that multiplayer is pretty much detable. On the one side playing with your friends is more fun than playing with random people. The point is that you cannot trust anyone because majority of them are mostly tryhards griefters or even trolls. Most people are toxic but I'm not gonna say that the game is bad just because of fans. Multiplayer allows players with many opportunities to progress their status by simply commit many kinds of crime. Robbing banks getting your own super cars planning heists drag race dogfights owning a business you can name anything that is possible. Content updates were added about a few months adding more weapons or vehicles to keep the game alive. Sure it's takes long to grind for them but if you go for the one thing you want it could be either bad or good. That's the issue with this game you might get somethings that looks good but once you get and tried it for a few minutes you might end up regretting it. I have about 1500 hours on this game and turns out I have quite a long adventure that I felt like I need to retire until there's a new update.Overall I recommend this game on sale and play with your friends for the best experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,418,False,Not Recommended,"I mostly play Online so this is entirely irrelevant to people who want to play for the singleplayer story.As my stats may show I've played the majority of my hours in just the last few weeks and unfortunately I've experienced a few ridiculous bugs to the point where I can't really recommend it yet. After doing an MC mission to hijack a prison bus all 8 prisoners succesfully board the helicopters BUT the mission FAILS instead so after all that trouble you get $1000 instead of $25000. Vehicles sometimes don't stop at all in 30 m when you break at 10 mph tho still making loud deep skid marks. Very annoying if you need to not roll into the ocean in a mission. Motorcycle Club Businesses 4 Motorcycle Deliveries sometimes bug out when you deliver 3 meaning you can randomly lose 25% of your profit which can be up to 105 k. The system that kicks ""idle"" players that have been afk for 15 minutes sometimes kicks you out after 3 minutes when you're alt tabbed. Following joining a new session after being kicked sometimes takes literally 30 minutes. At certain angles picking up your motorcycle from the ground causes you to die immediately and fly 100 feet away. Some motorcycles when fallen roll upside down and must be jumped over to turn them over again otherwise you will be unable to ride on them again. In certain freemode missions in certain areas such as resupply missions at Humane Labs where you must search crates you will sometimes be completely unable to enter a vehicle even the vehicle you brought in. You will be unable to request a vehicle as it is greyed out and must walk out to the entrance road possibly with 3 stars due to mission circumstances. Moreover sometimes when SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERING supplies to your MC business it simply disappears as horrendously tedious as some of these missions are your rewards can literally vanish whenever the game feels like it. When setting up heists the ""cut"" you can divide up sometimes suddenly all goes to 0% and cannot be raised resulting in 0 reward upon completion unless restarted. Although a rare and small issue it is still a bug. The swimming mechanics in this game are atrocious and poorly thought out. Seemingly more incompetence than just neglect.These are just some bugs I've experienced with an irrelevant copy paste ""it's your fault change your graphic settings"" response from support the one time I contacted them about delivery missions bugging out and money disappearing. Though I still enjoy the Online version greatly so feel free to disregard this review.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-30,0,0,387,False,Recommended,In the fifth installment of the Grand Theft Auto series The game picks up with three very deep characters that you can grow to love or hate depending on how you view them. The roughly 20 hour story is certainly something you'd not want to miss out on. But that's only half of it. The other half is better. With a thriving online community and unfortunately not a great Anti Cheat system fun is always to be had. With consistent updates there is always something to be done. However all of this free DLC is slightly expensive in ingame money.... which is the worst part of this game. Updates are released and most vehicles or whatever are too expensive to buy through mission earnings which is where Rockstar makes a killing on microtransactions. Overall this game is worth it to one who prefers a casual game of hit n run with a fun experience for friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,419,False,Not Recommended,R* have stopped making storyline expansions in favor of lazy multiplayer DLCs filled with cars and vehicles with obscene pricetags for the sole purpose of making microtransaction bux. They turn a blind eye from script kiddies ruining lobbies with invincibility cheats and RP resets but the minute someone receives modded cash they swing into action (because that impedes on their Shark Chard revenue). They take community feedback on what needs to be fixed in order to balance the game and do the complete opposite (explosive sniper rifle rounds? Really?).

2015-04-17,0,0,751,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V for the PC has proven to be amazing. The visuals performance and the PC experience makes GTA V shine brighter then it has on console. Of course with all good things there comes the bad. In this case GTA V suffers from players using trainers in Online. Of course R* bans them continually however the modding community is in jeopardy due to the mis use of modifications. Otherwise this game is an easy 10/10 for me and I believe that you will enjoy this as much as I did!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-19,0,0,56,False,Recommended,GTA as normal just better. Not tons of miles better but good enough to be better than IV.Massive open world tons of missions lots of side bits you can do the little unofficial personal rampages you can do in this series that make it worth the fun. It's hard to escape police unless you're low level which is how it needs to be. Online play is dependent on players but plays well enough.Most shocking is just how damn fast it runs on the same hardware as I played GTA IV on. I was expecting massive drop in speed it's parallel or even slightly faster despite being prettier. I have an old mobile nVidia card so I wasn't expecting that but I don't think you could get away with a run of the mill business PC with any nVidia card the first of the 64 bit only games I've seen and for a reason. But with quad cores and 8Gb RAM and a half decent DirectX 10/11 card it's more than playable at full res but it's just a question of what options you have turned on. Haven't seen any popping in issues but my hard drive is constantly streaming data when I'm playing.Great game looks great plays great tons of freedom huge world and more vehicles and missions than you can shake a stick at.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-22,0,0,226,False,Not Recommended,"This is a review of GTA V Online. I give GTA V 5/5 stars. GTA Online is the best/worse game I have ever played. It somehow creates this perfect balance between being absolutely fantastic with the detailed missions gameplay story and open world but at the same time completely pisses you off by requiring three other players to work with you as a ""team"" while simultaneously expecting you to complete missions with very specific requirements that aren't intuitive and must be learned from repeated failures. GTA 5 Online has a terrible learning curve that pays in negative dividends.The heists in particular are the worst. They are neat in concept but the execution is terrible especially when considering you HAVE to have three other people to do the mission.For example a heist called the Pacific Standard Job. During the final heist you have to rob a bank and escape on specific motorcycles the mission forces you to use and you are forced to get to those motorcycles through a very specific path while walking over checkpoints. MIss a checkpoint? Fail the mission. The motorcycles are a terrible choice for the mission and exist to only make the mission artificially more difficult. In fact ironically Rockstar had to eliminate the ability to stash an armored karuma because god forbid players would find a more practical solution to an impractical heist. And that my friends it the core of why I hate GTA Online. An open world game ironically on rails because players find better solutions to stupid problems Rockstar comes up with instead of making missions difficult because it makes sense. Ironically Rockstar is constantly releasing vehicles that cost millions of in game dollars that you can't use on certain missions. It's . I imagine it's because it fuels Rockstar's shark card business (i.e. pay to play business). The missions just end up being frustrating or the missions are a grind. Either way you lose. Most of the time the missions are difficult because the matchmaking is terrible and you're forced to either team up with noobs (who don't understand the details of the mission) or people from other countries who don't speak English. Imagine trying to work as a team with someone who doesn't even speak your language? It sucks.Also the newer DLC missions like CEO Bunker or Hanger are just grind fests to obtain new vehicles. Some of the missions are fun but you end up doing all of the missions dozens of times in order to make money to buy new vehicles that you ironically can't use on certain missions because it would be too easy. lol The most frustrating thing of all is knowing that on rare occasions everything falls into place. You have the right team with the right skills and the right equipment and for a minute or perhaps an hour the game is the most amazing experience ever. I guess if you buy this game with three other dedicated buddies you will have an amazing time. But if you lack even one of those three enjoy the frustration of having a random Chinese dude who doesn't speak english doesn't give a about playing as a team and will screw over your team over and over again before you smash your keyboard on the hardwood floor.",Grand Theft Auto V

You could EVEN (once again) spend hours just watching (very funny) TV stations. The campaign is excellent with only a few bad missions. I played this back on the PS3 and recall it taking me more than 40 hours just to do the main missions. A very cynical parody/exaggeration of modern life and culture. Taking the game literally you will easily get offended but the game essentially channels the style of a Tarantino film. If you have played the game before then you know it is worth replaying.

2015-05-15,0,0,178,False,Recommended,After waiting a year and a half I have to say. It was worth it. Even though it could have been released earlier but hey.So GTA V. We all know GTA IVs optimisation sucked and I'm happy to say that it was done very well on V as there are many settings which you can customise to your liking. I personally had stuttering issues in cutscenes and it happening constantly in the game. However after a 200MB update and turning on V Sync it runs a little bit smoother. But there are still a few stuttering parts here and there but I can live with it.There are so many things to do you of course have the single player campaign which I have barely sunk my teeth into as there is just so much to do such as random events you may come accross doing triathlons car races customising cars getting into police pursuits doing tons of side missions the list goes on and on. Needless to say it's very long. You can also jump between multiple characters as well which I really like as it makes the game feel more open longer and more interesting as each character Michael Franklin and Trevor have their own missions side missions story and background and special abilities. For example the black character Franklin can have slow motion in driving making it easier to turn corners and past cars which wouldn't be possible in non slowmotion mode.The multiplayer just. Wow. Again much like Single Player countless countless things to do. The easiest way I can describe it is imagine single player but bigger and more awesome. You can do heists make tons of money by robbing banks shops do races Team Deathmatch Deathmatch dedicated multiplayer missions... You can also train up your characters statistics such as Stamina Sneaking Driving and Shooting skill as you perform these actions more and more and level up.Not to mention like GTA IV you have the Rockstar Editor which in other words you can save a clip thats been recorded in the last 30 seconds of playing you can then edit it and mess around with different camera angles of that clip slow it down etc. Except this time in GTA V it's more advanced and geared towards those who make machinima videos like for example if you encounter a character in single player on a mission you can switch to that player model in your recorded clip. Check out this video to get the full detail https //www.youtube.com/watch?v He5pZypleqEThe only flaws that I can think of for this game is that there are no casinos no shops/stores or restaurants to walk into to purchase something that will boost your health like in San Andreas San Fierro (a city much like San Francisco) doesn't exist in this game for some reason but it did in San Andreas. Grove Street (where CJ lived) is pretty much unrecognisable and looks completely different for whatever reason R* wanted to make a part of the SA universe non existent in this game yet they brought in and mention GTA IV characters. They still mention the gangster group ballas.Performance issues again this isn't much of a problem to me but it would be nice if R* fixed some of the stuttering issues that I and many others have like in this video https //www.youtube.com/watch?v yuQu y0GnPMThat's pretty much all of the flaws that I can think of right now I've had so much fun with this game and I'm only around 70 hours in mostly playing multiplayer. The single player is quite long if you do all the other activities and not solely concentrate on the main storyline missions. I have played around 27 30 hours of the campaign which does include messing around like getting into firefights with the police etc. I'm getting closer to the ending but I'm not quite there yet.Overall GTA V is fantastic it really is a fun and immersive game to play and I highly recommend it. I wouldn't say it's better than San Andreas though as it's missing minor features like casinos restaurants etc. Plus I've had a lot of fond memories playing SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) which will not be able to beat GTA V or any future GTA due to the classic feel of San Andreas. But regardless GTA V is no doubt still worth playing as it's definitely a game that can last you hundreds of hours of gameplay time.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-01,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,Now where do i start with sutch a game as GTA V? The negatives ofc. Well we can start with the fact that the map is REALLY BIG but it is not populated at all. You cant go into houses and the few shops you CAN go into looks all the same. The bugs are everywhere from the sucky matchmaking to the cars randomly apearing in the air this is really just an unfinnished hyped games the graphics are not up to PC standards when you pay ing 60 bucks for this piece of From the get go i was really dissappointed.Player movements are literally it is not up to 60 buck standard you look like a ing retard when you are running swimming and walking. Nothing is natural. YOU HAVE TO USE ROCKSTAR SOCIAL. This is a big minus since it is just as buggy as the game and YOU WILL NEVER USE IT.Also there are NO private servers this is not supported. Witch is yet another reason you should just pirate this game the online part of it is broken.Now lets get into the positives. Driving is fun and driving with your friends is even funner.

2015-08-12,0,0,374,False,Recommended,Finally! A GTA game that actually has a great story and doesn't have alot of repetitive missions.PROS Story Mode Each character has their own unique skill to use (wont spoil it) You can level up stats for each character Guns can be customized Missions are not repetitive and quiet like other GTA games and always makes you want to keep playing to know what'll happen next Missions also have checkpoints so you don't need to put in another 10 mins doing the same crap after dying Optional First person mode. (If you've ever played Mirrors edge you'll love this!) Graphics are amazing! People act like real shmeeple Ambience and atmosphere are amazing you'll love taking screenshots! Car Customization is back! And Much Much More! (Sorry for the yelling lol)CONS Story Mode Silenced weapons only work on specific missions other than that they're useless (might be a bug) You're limited in hair/clothes which kinda bothers me You can't go in restraunts and get fat or build muscle (dont know why but I loved that in San Andreas ps2) Cops have auto aim and can ing murder you from a distance lol seriously You can die pretty easily but then again that's what makes this game so fun and realistic First person cover peeking causes you to get shot while third person cover peeking doesn't (bug) Using melee can sometimes be a pain in the because it's soo slowOnline Mode takes place before the events of Story Mode which I thought was really interesting.PROS Online Mode Great character customization! (Male or Female) A HUGE variety in clothes and hair styles Guns can be customized (tho need to be unlocked first) You can level up your characters stats First Person Mode is amazing (Mirrors Edge much?) Buyable Apts and Homes Interactions from characters in story mode There's a rediculious amount of to do aside from freeroaming in circles killing other people (which is fun too) Try roleplaying on a solo server and doing w/e the hell you want it's pretty funCONS Online Mode Can get boring pretty fast if your not working towards an ingame goal Quickly! Press M and change the all talk to friends only lol seriously some people are annoying over voice chat. Press M again and make it so people dont take your car lol set it to passangers so people can carpool with you in Missions/Heists. Silenced weapons are still useless and only work in specific missions You die too easily more so online than story mode which will kinda frustrate you at times if your a noob Cops/Gangs/and even Pedestrians have a better shot at shooting you from a distance than you do lol You need to shoot 100 people to unlock a color for a gun? Too many Parachuting missions (Parachuting is fun but not THAT fun) Using melee can sometimes be a pain in the because it's soo slow There are still hackers every now and then modding for story mode is fine but online will cause you to get BANNED so be careful The only way to restore health in missions is to be a fatass and eat snacks? Sometimes it will be hard to do co op missions with others online which can get annoying after putting almost 20 mins in a mission and at the last minute one guy decides to either rage quit gets disconnected due to poor internet gets killed on purpose or accident decides to troll you with a group of friends out of their own amusement etc. (Not all online players are like that but the ones that are are pretty vicious)The Conclusion I think this game is really badass! You actually get your moneys worth unlike other $59.99 games.Great to play with friends and I really enjoyed Role Playing in First Person Mode.Rockstar is still adding new content and I recommend giving this game a shot!9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,2,2,293,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto are one of my favourite game series. GTA V is the best GTA game after San Andreas which I loved due to it being my childhood game and being the game to bring new things that year and with a huge map and possibilities. I have played this game both on Xbox360 and PC. It's amazing. The storyline is amazing the graphics are great the PC port is AWESOME (works smoother than on X360) comparing to GTA IV's port (which was on PC very bad performance issues). The Online is great as long as you don't play to grind it and have some friends to play it. Anyways the PC version &gt Console is that there's some new features and the files were already opened and modding should be available soon thus we will see some good mods with no doubt. Truly a game of the year for 2015 too.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-10-30,1,2,46,False,Not Recommended,I actually really enjoy the game...on my ps4. I bought it and tried to play with a friend however I ran into an issue where there was two cinimatic black borders on either side of my screen whenever I pulled up the phone went into a cutscene or tried to go into the first person mode. It didnt shrink the screen either so I was literally playing with half my screen cut off.Now I could look past this since it is rare that you need those things...except you at least need your phone otherwise youll have all your money stolen. When I put in a ticket Rockstar acknowledged the issue before saying 'We are sorry you are encountering this issue but it only effects a small portion of our players so we have no intention of patching this issue'Really? I'm sorry but that is not the mentality you should have ever. I'd be happier if I was lied to rather than knowing that everyone who has this issue receives a big ol' middle finger. That is the quickest way to lose customers.Now the mod support is kinda crapy but it is still there. However the hacking in the game is rediculous even in 'secure' and 'verified' servers youll find people with immortality mods and people flying around and my personal favorite the 'everyone I dont like dies' hackers.Yea if you want the game get it on the ps4 or the one. If you however dont have one of those or your a 'hardcore pc only' gamer...I honestly cant recommend this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,143,False,Recommended,This review isn't taking into account the 530 extra days that Rockstar had to make this essentially I'm reviewing it as if it just came out.Compared to many other game developers and how they deal when the game is out for the first few hours I have to say Rockstar did well. By far at least for me it was one of the smoothest launches ever only taking about 20 minutes to decrypt the pre loaded files and at about 7 30 I logged in to social club and was playing within minutes. For me there weren't any big technical issues that I could see (although I had a few friends who experienced some buggy lines around their character) The game runs smooth and is very well optimized along with having a myriad of settings to appeal to either high end gaming PCs or a laptop. It has reccommended settings for your PC and has a tool that shows you how much VRAM you will be using when the settings are applied. This feature is useful but I've noticed that you can choose to ignore the tool that stops you from applying the settings when over the suggested amount and I've gone about 500 600 MBs of VRAM over the limit and it has still been running well. Not to mention the graphics look amazing. A great engine paired with an original beachside city design that has had a lot of work done on it leads to a great looking game. I own it on Xbox 360 and PS3 and the difference is stunning. When i first got into single player it made me play the prolouge (I had already finished the game on console beforehand) and after I finished the prolouge since I had a bunch of friends waiting for me to tell them if they could get on GTA Online I just pulled up the options menu and launched an Online session. I had the ability to transfer my charachter from either console over to the PC version and unlike the consoles on first glance the Online was quite fine tuned to fit the PC with no server lag lowered textures or anything. As for the Story It's great. It features a great storyline that is based around three characters with very different stories for each and they all revolve around eachother which include humor action drama and customization. Everything you want in a story mode. Same goes for the online game mode. Overall this game in my opinion this is one of the best titles released ever and I feel it will stay at the top of the charts for a long while just like GTA IV. Enjoy playing and IMO it was worth the wait.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,1,2,62,False,Recommended,This is a good game but I find it difficult to play it for many hours due to me already playing on Xbox 360 when it was originally released for the console. It's very similar to the Xbox One and PS4 release apart from obviously 60 FPS (frames per second) and better graphics.I can tell a difference in the graphics and the game looks incredible and isn't very demanding which is good. The game suffers from a large about of bugs due to the new and recent release but nothing that can't be fixed. It honestly sucks that we had to wait just under 2 years for the PC port and it's still full of irritating and game breaking bugs which effect the overall game experience.But putting that aside By the far the best GTA in the series IMO and a good port apart from the bugs. I recommend this game to any GTA fan and anybody who wants to experience an unrealistic machine gun town 3rd person/1st person shooter.,Grand Theft Auto V

With a near infinite amount of races activities adversary modes and team kill modes there is always something to do not to mention the freeworld fun of ceo work and biker gands (and just messing around with friends) as for the story its alright nothing terrible though.

2017-06-18,0,0,379,False,Not Recommended,The game as a whole is amazing experience. Single player is a lot of hours of great fun. Multi player is also fun however it's filled with grind as TakeTwo Interactive has told Rockstar Games to kindly put as much grind as possible so people have to buy Shark Cards in order to progress quicker. In it's current state progression in this game feels like a Free to Play game because of absurd amount of cash and time required to get access to anything good. And you probably already heard that recently TakeTwo have decided to completely ban all modding for GTAV clamining that mods influence GTA O and it ruines experince when this is not the case. Mods dont to anything to GTA O simply because they have a saveguard that doesn't allow you to go into GTA O with mods installed. Trainers however do. Because of TakeTwo's inability to understand the difference and how not to transform a Guiness record holding game into a pay to skip experience like it's a free to play game I strongly recommend not to buy this game. Not because of the quality but because of the shady business practice of owners of Rockstar Games. Avoid spending any money on this game don't fuel their business practice. When and if this is over it's a great game to enjoy for many many hours but as of right now don't. Spend your money on something more valuable like food drinks or maybe some other game that doesn't have worse than EA business practice.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is cool but SPOILER ALERT I don't like that one of the characters has to die and you can't do his missions anymore.Missions 10. Coolest missions I've ever seen.Graphics 10. Play with the graphics session to get your optimal graphics.Animation 10. From shooting to climbing the animations are perfect.Side stuff 10. Plenty of things to do even if you completed the story.Online 9. It's alright but needs a little fixing here and there.This game is worth evrey cent you pay. BUY IT!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,154,False,Recommended,I've played it on console but wanted to have it on PC too as I thought it would be fun to play through again with a mouse.How wrong was I...It isn't just more fun or a simple port of a console game. This game is a masterpiece and it's optimized for PC superbly. The graphics are truly some of the best in game I've ever seen It runs fine on my PC which I guess isn't basic or average but certainly it isn't high end. I'm running it on a GTX970 i7 3.6ghz and 16GB ram and nearly all of the settings are maxed and I'm getting about 50fps even in the times of highest action.The Rockstar editor and director suite are amazing tools and the creative minds among us will be able to create some brilliant videos with this software even I managed to create quite a cool police chase. I reckon you could create a 'movie' with it if you could find some decent voice actors and some people to help make scenes.I'm looking forward to the modding community going berserk with this game not that there is anything missing from the game but just the additional features that could be loaded in future. Like a mod that allows you to play as a cop and find crimes in the city.Anyway it's an epic game and without any doubt thus far (April) it's my game of the year and genuinely I can't see that changing. Nothing is in the pipeline to beat this.If you buy just one AAA game this year let this be it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-08,0,0,1451,False,Recommended,Indeed quite amazing. By far the best game I own. The multiplayer is hard to quit the story mode is loads of fun and will keep you entertained for hours. With all of the improvements from the other Grand Theft Auto games with graphics multiplayer enhancments car customization and other great features. Over all I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone witth a PC capable of running it.*EDIT*Now aside from being prodded like a cash cow for shark cards this game is still insanely fun to play. The updates are ehh anymore all we've gotten in a while was car updates which is great and all but it's pretty much just giving you more to waste money on. I mean at this moment I have 640 some odd hours almost 650 and I would EASILY spend another 650 doing the same thing but new map content or new heists would also be nice. I mean it's not that I don't loooooooveeee getting to the point where I'm able to repeat the very words that Lester speaks during your first online heist. Aside from that I can only think of 3 BIG problems with this game.1) Way too many hackers/modders.2)Needs more content.3)SEE REASON NUMBER 2I mean this is easily the best game I own. The online mode is so much better then storymode fyi. Going online with some friends running around messing with people doing some races or just going around creating carnage till the cops put a bullet through your brain.*Update*With now well over 1000 hours I can say that there has been reasonable enough content to want to continue to play this amazing product far after you might believe that you've run out of things to do.,Grand Theft Auto V

It was worth every penny. except for the bad Net Code on Xbox 360 right now preventing me from playing with my friend the PC version is hands down the most Bada$$ version I've played. The Singleplayer touches on all kinds of current day issues and doesn't manage to offend most people in the long run. The extreme detail of the game is awsome and there is plenty of room for inprovement on Rockstars side Now on the topic of mods I enjoy using them in single player and believe that only certain mods should be allowed in multiplayer like FOV etc. but that is no excuse to go around aimboting or giving people infinite money and so on.Overall 9/10 Singleplayer 10/10Multiplayer 8/10Update I have been very upset with a lot of the hackers in the game lately I try to report them all but unfortunatley Rockstar only lets you report someone every few minutes which is rather annoying when there are multiple hackers in the lobby!,Grand Theft Auto V

I sold my PlayStation to start gaming only on my PC and Rockstar doesn't allow you to transfer characters anymore. But a support issue stated you could. Don't be scammed by this corporation. The game has been ultimately ruined due to the fact that we have to start from scratch even after investing some sort of cash from grinding or from real life into the game.

2017-07-02,0,0,674,False,Not Recommended,I'm a little split down the middle weather I recommend this game of not (Yes even if I have over 600 hours of gameplay)GTA Storymode Storymode is amazing I love all the characters the character shifting keeps it fast paced and it's a big map full of dumb to do. Though it was t that they got rid of offline modding at least OpenIV is back. Story mode is top notch.GTA Online Online is where I spent the majority of my 600+ hours there's plenty to do and with friends you can spend a long time of having fun on this. The problem though is that fact that everything simply costs too much money and anytime players find a good way to make money in game that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out Rockstar nerfs it (*cough* the kuruma method in PS heist *cough*). The lack of being able to do the heist different (non hack/mod/exploits) ways makes getting money a chore and usually more annoying than what it's worth. Though of course it's like this to get players to spend REAL money on shark cards a very and greedy move.Not only that but I find innocent non hackers/modders getting banned and punished more often than the actual hackers/modders. Hackers/Modders run rampant more so lately than usualy which (if you run into the douchey ones) can make the game crappy to play.The story mode itself is a great and fun experiance but with online in the state that it is I just can't bring myself to recommend the game to someone unless you get it for cheap or something.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-17,1,3,165,False,Recommended,This is exciting So far the PC version of GTA 5 is almost everything I could possibly want from a port outside of timely of course. After a nearly 60GB download and resetting my Rockstar Social Club password (because who remembers that?) my first few hours of driving running and gunning my way through Rockstar s masterpiece of a virtual city looked performed and controlled better than it does on any other platform.First a warning Rockstar s QA somehow managed to miss a bug that potentially renders GTA 5 unplayable if your Windows user name contains any special characters meaning anything other than letters and numbers. If your account is for example Dave s PC or Steve &amp Jane you might not be able to play until it s patched unless you create an alternate user account. To Rockstar s credit there s currently a warning on the Steam store page and Rockstar is offering refunds if you re not willing to wait for the fix so at least they re handling this the right way.Assuming your user name is compliant then everything else is rosy. Graphics options are plentiful and powerful with everything from standard quality and view distance adjustments to a field of view slider (though it s more limited than discriminating FOV players might want I expect modders will remedy that shortly). It ll support 4K resolutions and multi monitor layouts. Controls are customizable and you can play your own music library on the in game radio. It s hard to complain much about that.And those options are actually extremely useful because optimization looks to be on point. My GeForce GTX 660Ti (a 25000 card) is able to run with most settings maxed out at 1600*900 without dipping below 50 frames per second. Once I tune it precisely I ll let you know where I ve landed with my settings to maintain a smooth 60 I m not someone who demands more than 30 frames to find a game enjoyable but I sure do appreciate the smoothness you get from double that performance. The PC version is the only way you can play GTA like this and it d be really tough to go back.For the most part the menus are well done and feel good to use with the mouse. That s best exemplified with the web browser which feels like you d expect navigating a web page with a mouse to feel. The one place this breaks down a little is in the score menus it s still a little tougher to navigate an Ammunation s wares with a D pad or arrow keys but it s still totally workable.Shooting control is good enough that it risks making things too easy. I don t pretend to be a brilliant marksman but if you re a bad guy (or a cop) in Los Santos your odds of even making it out of your car to start shooting drop considerably when the hand that guides the gun is using a mouse. Without the scourge of auto aim dragging the targeting reticule down toward center mass I found myself picking off most enemies with a single shot to the head especially when playing in first person mode.Nice PC specific control touches like not having to hammer a button to keep up running speed (just hold down Shift) and being able to hit a single button (Caps Lock by default) to activate a special ability make everything feel like a native PC game. You don t get the annoying horizontal drift when running in first person like you do in the PS4 and Xbox One versions either.One of my favorite things about the control setup though is that like GTA 4 and a select few other games before it GTA 5 lets you seamlessly swap between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad on the fly. No need to go into a menu and swap just push a button on one or the other and all on screen prompts change to reflect what you re using. It s a fantastic thing for a game like this where running and gunning is more precise with a mouse and keyboard but driving or especially flying benefits greatly from the analog input of a thumbstick.In fact you don t even have to choose one or the other! In our first Review in Progress video you can see a second player and I share control of a vehicle him driving with the gamepad and me shooting with the mouse. Sure it s a little tough to drive when someone else is controlling what you can see but it s a crazy kind of co op control that you should try out if you like to shoot more than drive and have a friend who prefers to be behind the wheel.I ve yet to delve into the Rockstar Editor movie maker or GTA Online that s on my agenda for the next couple of days. The one thing I ve noticed that s a tad annoying about the movie maker so far is that as I progress through the story missions I m unlocking characters like Michael s family for use in my movies. That seems like the sort of meaningless progression system that just gets in the way of doing what I want to do when I want to do it for the sake of giving me an extra reward. Not a big deal obviously.The other FYI is that I haven't had any luck getting cloud saves to work which means all the progress I made at home last night remains... at home.The VerdictGrand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open world games aspire and it s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do explore and play with both in single player and multiplayer plus great creative tools it s truly amazing on multiple levels.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Franco was always a gentleman and when he would see a woman he would always greet her with m'lady.When Quince turned 30 he decided to move to Los Santos San Andreas to pursue his career in the hat making industry. He was a fine Fedora maker and a proud wearer of one he had made.Franco one day decided with all his funds to buy a brand new Adder sports car. Franco being fat and short could see past the steering wheel making driving a test.Franco in his Adder met Lamar. Lamar frankly was a very sketchy black man. Lamar wanted to race 'ol Franco and beat Franco his 1975 Imperial. Franco decided his destiny was in drug making after that day.With his Fedora Cane and Cloak Franco and his friends performed a heist against the Union Depostitory which was only raided by the famous Michael Townley once.Franco wanted to be the hero let the charge and started to stuff gold in his cloak pockets.Franco was shot 47 times in his gut and still has half health. He fought bravely and survived with over a million dollars worth of gold.Franco with the gold heads to the local gas station to deposit the gold into the ATM.Before Franco could reach the ATM he was struck by a sqeaker driver in a hijacked car.Franco died of his injuries leaving the squeaker to take his fortune of over a million dollars.TLDR USE THE D A M N ATM.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's got countess of hours of entertainment and lots of fun activities for me to play by my self or with freinds. I sincerely love this game and give it 900/11 bazing guns. I even broke my record for longest time played in a row 13.2 hours.IDEA FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT One feature i woud enjoy being added though is the abiity to drag corpses and the ability to knock out players rather than killing them so you can drag their body and then put it in your trunk. The player would be knocked out for 30 45 secs and would have to ability to beat their way out of the trunk (if stong enough). I think this could be used both in missions/heist and in the daily joys of trolling peope in GTA online. Now there is one problem with this a players corpse being dragged send then the player seeing his own corpse being dragged. A solution for this is that only people whom have been ""knocked out"" can be dragged.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-17,0,0,433,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a game set within the fictional state of San Andreas which is based on Southern California and its developers has done a great job of replicating real world locations. The game is very well optimized as well compared to the previous title Grand Theft Auto IV which was such a disastrous game to run.The gameplay is quite fast paced gunplay feels fun and satisfying. Driving in this game stroke a minor controversy as it felt a bit too 'casual' compared to the previous major installment GTA 4. The graphics are phenomenal for an open world game and the level of detail in the world is incredible and the city feels very lively with a variety of NPC pedestrians scattered across the map . The story is fun and well written. There are three led protagonists throughout single player and players can switch between them. Each of every mission in the game's story mode is unique so they don't feel very repetitive. When the story is over there really isn't much left to do however there are a number of activities in which you can engage in single player such as racing hanging out with your friends hunting down the wild life and playing sports but they're not as fun as they ought to be. GTA Online is probably the main reason why people get this game but in my opinion it barely has any redeeming qualities and I don't know why people are buying the game just for this. Firstly the concept of playing around in a huge open world with friends just simply sounds fun and it actually is surprisingly. There are a couple of things you can play in Online mode missions heists races and adversary mode which has a variety of game modes. But that's pretty much about it for the fun aspects of Online now for the cons. Online is very very grindy and is just pretty repetitive overall. Let's just say that you have a wish to buy a vehicle that costs around 2 million dollars (just a reference) which is pretty easy to get in single player but it's different Online. You will have to repeatedly do the same missions / heists / works over and over until you get enough money and by the time you get the vehicle you will feel a sense of satisfaction for a short while until you find another vehicle you want to get. Sure there are micro transactions called shark cards which add money into your character but for the price it's not worth it at all. Another negative of the Online mode is hackers they ruin the fun of the game and makes it worse especially when the game itself isn't much fun.To sum it up I think the game is pretty good especially the single player campaign but I do not think that it is worth spending $60 USD just for it and the multiplayer is trash in my opinion but do buy this on a sale if you have money to spare.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-28,0,0,237,False,Recommended,I pre ordered the game before it came out. I waited many many months and got when they delayed the game. I expected something extraordinary. When the game finally game out I was impressed. The graphics were amazing GTA Online wasn't as bad as my friends described it to me as and single player was fun. However one day I was doing an informal 1v1 with a guy on GTA online. I was cornered in a dock so I jumped off into the water. I had no clue that people could mod on GTA Online. The other player's body kept spawning on top of him and falling on him which disabled his ability to fight. Then a guy appeared on his back apparently riding him. (not in a sexual way) Soon after the same thing happened to me. AFTER THAT A CAR SPAWNED ON ME FOLLOWED BY A HUGE TENNIS BALL. I couldn't see. I don't want to talk about it anymore. In summary GTA Online has been going downhill. Modders and flamers ruin the experience. Single Player is fun an exciting especially mods. The graphics are great.Additionally I hate that the vehicles are so ridiculously expensive.Final Rating 5/10. Would not recommend or not recommend the game. I only gave it a Yes because I have to give it something.,Grand Theft Auto V

The vehicular control is just terrible The griefing is unreal I don't know anything about these so called bans because I just came to the game recently So this negative review has nothing to do with that at all. I simply don't like this game its just not as crazy and fun as I thought it would be. Yes this is my first go with GTA online of any kind and no I simply don't recommend it if you're looking for something absurd and not too serious like say maybe Saints row iv multiplayer. I really came in expecting we could just do what ever we really wanted to without penalty (aside from TKing other players) But thats not entirely the case. Yeah Yeah I should have done more delving into the game to understand what I was buying but with no demo for online multi and youtube videos really only showcasing the over the top awesome moments I just.. I don't find that at all so far in this game. I want THAT game that I see on youtube where is it here?TL DRMy experience so far shows that there is no jets helicopters or tanks rolling around gunning each other down and stuff such as this going on at all.. so far my experience is sitting around waiting for a quick job driving around yields no other players to interact with or any players interested in interacting outside of a job.

It makes the game unplayable you can fix the stuttering for 30 mins to and hour by RESTARTING the game.2. The controls for everything easy to get used to but...you have to dual wield a controller and keyboard to fly or drive cars correctly.3. Oh man it sure is great running into game BREAKING people.

2015-04-14,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Initial impressions of the port after a few hours gameplay.I have an i7 4770 and GTX 780. I have almost everything maxed at Ultra or Very High apart from Nvidia Shadows and High Definition Shadows. The game runs between 40fps at it's occasional lowest and 80 fps at its highest. It levels most of the time at around 50 60fps. Considering the leaps and bounds in graphic fidelity compared to even the current gen versions on consoles which ran at 30fps I am very happy with how the game performs.As for the quality of the game well the 4 hours I've played so far seem very good and is a promising start. I've seen some having issues with Social Club login which they need to fix and for some reason Steam overlay hides a crucial button during activation in Social Club which makes no sense but apart from that I had zero issues and logs in all the time before the first splash screen appears for me.Update 12 hours in Frame rates take a massive nose dive once reaching the country and moving from the city. Turning the Grass to Very High from Ultra can claw some frames back but I'm willing to play with the sub 30fps due to how nice it all looks. The game is still great and the mission variety has begun to open up now including my first raid which was brilliant made difficult by the fact I took an inexperienced hacker who alerted the cops before I was done. So far my favourite GTA since Vice City.Final Edit After finishing the single player and spending a few hours in online I can safely say this is the best GTA in a number of years. The single player is a blast with all the heist missions adding some needed variety to the GTA mission formula although the endings are not very satisfying at all and the option to get the good ending is a bit vague in its description compared to the other two. That said all in all the single player portion is a fantastic experience set in a massively detailed and intricate map. The online so far also has been fun. I have just hit level 12 so haven't touched heists yet online and the loading times between jobs can be a massive frustration but the fun of co op and multiplayer missions with others makes the loading a small price to pay. Great overall package and one everyone should play if their PC can handle it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-26,0,0,352,False,Recommended,I'm not sure if I recommend it or not. Just read.Pros +The game is amaing graphically+Very well optimized for the PC so even computers that fit minimum requirements can run at least 30 FPS and still make the game look good. Just be sure to read information on each of the settings and how they affect performance.+Gameplay is great+Great mechanics+Love the characters+Online is fun and highly customizableCons Not as interesting of a story as GTA IV in my opinion. Rockstar makes some pretty shady moves. They increased the price of the game by 30% right before the sale so the price would remain default. To combat it they offered free shark cards. That's an extremely shady buisness move and I highly doubt that they would stop there. Online mode is absolutely chocked full of hackers and cheaters who enjoy nothing more than to ruin the game for everyone else. Rockstar keeps saying they will do something about it but I have yet to see much improvement. Like a lot of game nowadays there are in game purchases (mostly for shark cards) which reach pretty high prices especially since the game itself is $60. Lot of updates to multiplayers but most are really not worth the effort. Even with updates the game is still full of bugs with connection errors sudden performance drops and several other in game problems. Lot of online players are simply not fun to play with (whether they cheat or not.) The game is similar to Call of Duty where tryhards absolutely infest the game like termites on wood. For example. you're driving to put an upgrade on your car and suddenly a tank comes in and blows it up. You could go into passive mode but then you cannot really do anything other than just sit on the sidelines which is not very fun. Final Comments The game is fun overall which is why I recommend it. I'd still say if you're going to play online stick to playing with friends because online public people will not respect you and let you enjoy the game ESPEICALLY if you are a new player.,Grand Theft Auto V

With that said I've been reading a lot of posts on here and from what I've been reading it looks like Rockstar is banning people for using MODs. Really???? This is a PC game. One of the biggest selling points in any PC game is the fact that the gaming community and well known modders can mod the game. This is rediculous. What's even worse is that apparently people are getting banned from single player as well for using MODs??? I have not modded the game so I have not been banned but I'm scared to even try now.

2016-12-18,0,0,325,False,Recommended,TL DR Rockstar is ripping us off. My problem with the increasing cost of vehicles is the following So now you have to spend 3 4 times more money than you used to for the newest cars. It seems fair at first because the newer missions opened new ways to grind for more money in less time. But the costs have been growing so much that the effects are similar to an inflation. When buying Shark Cards you still get the same amount of money as you used to. But with 75 spent you merely can afford three of the most expensive cars. So basically with 75 you get less value from it than before which is why this system is unbalanced. Either the cost of the cars has to sink or the value of missions and especially Shark Cards needs to increase to balance out the costs. All in all I still recommend this because let's face it private sessions and singleplayer campaign are the best.,Grand Theft Auto V

Thank you rockstar for being absolute crap plain and simple absolute crap. I spent way to much on this amazing game to have your rediculous client it all up and whats more is you dont even have the decency to get onto your own forums (After 3 months of this now) and help figure out your problems.

2015-11-28,1,1,217,False,Not Recommended,I'll focus on GTA Online. This game has been out for 7.5 months and it has technical issues it shouldn't even have had on day 1. Freezes crashes the game simply taking 15 minutes to load or not loading buggy behaviour it's quite horrendous and close to unplayable.When it does work the matchmaking for online missions is quite absurd and it can take you several minutes of waiting to get a very few players together. And you have to repeat the process for every new different game you want to do. There are some pretty bad design choices involved. And the cheating... Forget about aimbots here you get 4 5 people killed all at once all over the map instantly by one cheater. Frequently! R* coders clearly have no idea that the first rule of making a multiplayer game is don't trust the client. Every other studio understands that but no not R*! I'll keep it short the single player is good although the scripted missions are weak but it's quite obvious that R* isn't competent enough to make a multiplayer game that works let alone that would be more enjoyable than frustrating. Somehow the MTA SA folks get the multiplayer experience much better and they do it for free with a 10 year old game engine that didn't contain a single line of network code. Maybe R* should consider hiring some of them and firing whoever is to be blamed for the technical mess that is GTA Online.Edit technically my experience lately has been much better though not so much on the cheating from except for the temporary respite we get from the recent update,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-17,0,0,272,False,Recommended,Fantastic game with great optimization. The single player has a great story with a lot of side missions to do (although they get tiring after a while) and GTA Online is lots of fun with heists missions and all the different chaos you can cause with friends. It looks beautiful and runs at around 70 80 FPS with nearly everything on Very High on my Nvidia 970. There has been controversy with mods on this game but there are simple solutions to make sure that you don't get banned. If playing single player keep the mods in your GTA folder but if you want to play GTA Online put them in a different folder. It is a bit of a hassle but it is necessary at the moment. GTA Online has its problems namely people who use mods in multipayer and that can detract from the fun a bit but nevertheless this game is outstanding and definitely worth it even at full price.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-07,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,Incredible game completely ruined by hackers/modders and Rockstar's complete lack of action in curbing their actions. It's nigh on impossible to find a server without hackers unless you play on a private server which unless you have lots of friends currently playing GTA Online is going to be pretty much deserted. The lack of a proper server browser means that it's a complete lottery which after unreasonable loading times you're 99% likely to lose.The way the hackers/modders just kill everybody else on sight has meant that griefing has spread to regular players too. Encountering another player in the past created a tense moment where neither of you were sure if you could trust the other. Nowadays players have become so tired of being killed by invincible cheaters that if they see another player anywhere in their range they're sure as hell going to open fire. No questions asked. It has become self preservation. Combine this with the toxicity of many of the players and you'll be getting griefed while being taunted and abused over voice and text chat.Worse still killing you in game is the nicest way a hacker will treat you. In my experience they are more likely to delete your personal vehicle and spawn hundreds of objects on you crashing your game and anybody who might be looking at you.Whatever measures Rockstar ever had against hackers/modders are now completely useless meaning that hacking is completely out of control. However Rockstar are not even beginning to address this gamebreaking issue and are instead only updating the game with a couple of new vehicles and the occasional new mission type while constantly pushing the micro transactions that are more and more visible with every update.Having said all that GTA V and GTA Online have both given me some extremely enjoyable unforgettable gaming experiences. I'm just glad that I was playing the game before hackers became ubiquitous and being griefed became the rule rather than the exception. The likelihood of having that kind of fun these days is closer to zero than it has ever been which is a huge shame.Somehow still have never played GTA V and want to play a fantastic campaign? Sure it's worth playing. Great characters good writing a fun and varied campaign a vast open world to get lost in... it's fantastic. If single player is all you want then I'd say it's worth the purchase.But what should be the selling point of this purchase GTA Online has just become a cesspool of hackers with absolutely no moderation and no fix in sight.At this point if you're looking to buy this game to play online do not waste your time and money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Gameplay itselfs is alot of fun!!If you are considering getting this game Its always easy to find players for a group Invite system is great!. Never fail to get a team for something!I played this game on console.. I was actually gonna start all over again. I realised that I could transfer my console status to PC. So i got to carry on where i left off. So thats a great feature (Any console account can be transfered)For me I think the game is better on the PC.. And was well worth the wait!I have had alot of fun on this.. But a decent amount of time in since i've had this game alone and with friends.The reason for the 9 is simply..... When you are playing with friends in a server session (Driving around in open world killing other players for example ) You would be randomly disconnected from that session but it actually says everyone left..So i don't know if thats one of us having issues or weather its a game issue.Most of the time performance is great!So my verdict is..GET THIS GAME!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-22,0,0,134,False,Recommended,I really would recommend this game but a really down side to this game is that after you do all the story missions in singleplayer there isn't much reason to replay the game. And the multiplayer won't allow mods which was pretty much the whole reason I bought the game. I had it originally on the xbox360 but I wanted it for mods on pc. I guess it is fun with mods on singleplayer but multiplayer with mods would definitely make the game a lot better.

2015-06-27,0,0,133,False,Not Recommended,"GTA 5 is a pretty good game. Solid gameplay and the online alone is almost worth the money if you have friends to play it with. I haven't even so much as dabbled in the singleplayer because the online gameplay has been enough to keep me plenty busy. That being said GTA 5 has a very serious problem with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 graphics card and this is the basis for my negative review.Anyone with this graphics card Beware. From the moment I started the game it would crash at least every 30 minutes sometimes less sometimes more. This often happened during heists jobs or other very important sequences in the game making it damn near unplayable. I'm posting this after already trying literally every fix I could find online changing the graphics settings extensively and contacting Rockstar support multiple times.I would highly advise anyone with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 graphics card to not buy the game until this issue is fixed.That isn't the only reason for my negative rating however. Rockstar's recent shady business practices (see the steam summer sale) and their incompetence with my issue have really changed my view on the company all for the worse. I contacted their customer support and to my surprise they were extremely unhelpful almost to the point that they seemed to be trying. They refused to do anything other than repeatedly send me copy and pasted emails with quick fixes I'd tried before and they would not deal with my actual issue even when I attempted to bring up what I had tried and what I had not what I was dealing with and what my computer specs were. On that basis alone I would not recommend the game simply because the company behind it has proven itself not to be a good one (also in the past see their other PC ports). On top of that the game isn't a great port. A few of the DRM practices are really bugged (causing my game to take twice as long to enter online mode as normal because I have to ""enter online"" twice) and shouldn't be there in the first place and some features that should obviously be integrated into the game simply aren't. Hackers and connectivity hiccups are rampant online the loading times alone are enough to kill the game and overall the game feels somewhat unfinished. At this point I don't consider the game to be worth the money. After all the hype GTA 5 was really a disappointment and I've since uninstalled it because it's not even worth my time. I'd ask for my money back but we all know how steam is about that...",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-23,0,0,489,False,Not Recommended,Id really like that Rockstar read this the game is awesome. It has incredible graphics and all the things. You guys made what you promised. But theres one big big problem the game lags and freezes A LOT and its not my pc's fault (i5 4460 8gb ddr3 gtx 970). Im using the NVIDIA recommendatios and still it is very hard to have a constant 60fps. This way i guess playing on the xbox 360 or ps3 is way better cause they dont have the same lag as the pc version has. If you guys fix this ill surely come back here and change my vote. Thanks.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-10,0,0,106,False,Not Recommended,GTAV offers beyond a doubt a vast array of activities you can do even after finnishing the main campaign. However I personally do not enjoy most of them. Whilst Rockstar clearly put a lot of effort into offering a lot of recreational activities in the game I feel that they somewhat neglected their core gameplay mechanics (which are supposed to form the foundation of the game) I experince frequently high input lag where my character receives his orders about 1 5 seconds too late The gunplay is dated. Especially those who are not used to playing third person shooters may find gunplay inaccessible and punishing especially in Online mode. First person mode isn't too good of an alternative either especially in Online mode seeing as the thrid person view offers better tactical awareness Bad stealth mechanics. Sure this game isn't a stealth game but if they want to include them then they should make sure that these mechanics are somewhat good. This is the type of stealth where as soon as you are spotted every enemy on the entire map is immediately alerted to your exact position even if you killed the enemy finding you before he could even gasp in shock Dated flying mechanics. The flying in this game has barely been improved on. Sure the controls are somewhat solid but not really good. It may be fun to bombard enemies in Online mode with a jet (as much fun as griefing can be) but the mechanics are not good enough to make the effort required to procure a jet worthwhile on its ownAside from these bad core mechanics Rockstars bad customer support and their sanctions against modders further points unfavourably upon this entire experience.You might feel tempted to buy it just to see what all the fuss is about but ultimately I would not recommend it. I tried to force myself to find an aspect of it that I like but to no avail. The campaign offers too little replay value singleplayer outside the campaign gets dull incredibly fast Online mode also gets dull and annoying if you do not have friends to play with and the Rockstar's take on service culture is the final insult. I wish I hadn't spent 40 GBP on it I know I will most certainly not spend any money on Rockstar products in the future.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-22,0,0,936,False,Recommended,10/10While the singleplayer story is somewhat lacking in depth compared to previous titles in the series the characters nevertheless leave and impact on the player. The ability to switch between 3 possible player characters keeps the game from getting too stale and offers a unique perspective into each of thier lives. When switching between them it feels like your suddenly dropped into their life at that moment. You gain control of them as they go about their business in the world. Expect the typical GTA style missions involving shooting driving and blowing stuff up. While nothing new they are nevertheless just as fun as the first time. The Multiplayer is where this game truly shines. You can store and keep your customized cars for online play. Even if they are destroyed you can have your insurence company replace them. The majority of the missions are just as fun the 100th time as they are the first time. The idea of a GTA MMO sounds crazy but GTA online is insanely fun! Especially with a group of friends running missions togehter it brings an aspect to the game thats sadly been missing in the single player modes. The online world feels more alive like there are things happening all over all the time. Players driving around killing eachother racing pulling heists or completing jobs. Its worth checking out.,Grand Theft Auto V

Some of the minigames are fun but like I mentioned people just no life this game like every other try hard multiplayer game and it kills the fun because you generally have no chance making money is SLOW. apparently now people are losing the money they did have too. this game is a show. dont support it dont buy it Do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-07,1,1,248,False,Recommended,This game is essentially two in one so I will separate my review into two parts.GTA V Story Mode A new approach in the GTA series that allows you to play with three very different characters. While the story is goofy it is very fun with all of the heists you get to do and you grow attached to all three of them. I loved the story mode and I think it's awesome that Rockstar allows us to replay missions without having to start the story mode over.GTA Online An amazing feature that I absolutely love. There are people with hundreds of hours into this game that haven't even touched the story mode yet because GTA Online is so much fun! Doing missions heists and races are very fun! I do think the matchmaking could use some improvement so you don't have empty lobbies and load times could use some improvement as well. It's very hard to get an actual heist team together but there are forums online that allow you to find dedicated members that will play a heist with you. Overall this is my most played game on Steam and you will see why once you start playing it. People that are getting mad at Rockstar for banning for using FOV mods etc. are just mad because they weren't more careful when reading the rules of GTA Online or probably didn't disable it when going from Single Player to Online.,Grand Theft Auto V

I bought this game in February and I still play this game every day. Yes i may have a little over 100 mods (including car mods) in SP but that doesn't give the game all the fun.

Whether you LAND a crop duster into the open hatch of a cargo plane rob a county bank in a suit of military grade bulletproof armor or the death of a loved GTA personality......this game is seriously just gonna blow blow your ING mind. And that's just the Story Mode! In GTA Online everything else happens. There were two degenerates riding together in a car and were just trying to gun me down in their wonderfully expensive looking car. I was a little faster than them in my motorbike but they were gaining. So I prepared a nice little present of a wonderful proximity mine along the road for them. They didn't know what hit them. They left me alone after that. This brings me to something that's a bit of a stigma in the game. You will have to be utterly careful around this game's Online Mode mainly because of the fact that when you give a gun/bomb/RPG/grenade launcher to a trigger happy neanderthal then multiply that by about a million or more and then set them lose in an online sandbox game you're gonna have a bad time. Passive Mode is Rockstar's answer for players that would rather not deal with said crowd and there's no shame in it when you get to watch the carnage that other players do unto themselves. However if you really want to try your luck against such people then be wise on the players you're going to tackle. Obviously higher leveled people are gonna have better gear than you are so don't be an overachiever. Yet there is one other depraving stigma in this game and that is the hackers. Luckily I've only come across only two hackers in the game and one was easily managed with the help of Passive Mode while the other...not so much. The latter was in a Deathmatch game and was clearly using a cheat as he couldn't even be gunned down in addition to him tossing an endless amount of grenades. Don't bother asking me about whether I took a snapshot or wrote down the player's name for Rockstar to look into it. The ""arena"" was an enclosed area and was nearly impossible to take anything down as he was spawn camping me and the other players.I'm not gonna bother much with the content of Online Mode because most of it comprises you of just having to take on Jobs to earn money. Honestly money comes easy in the game if you work hard for it. Robbing stores are a fun way to start off to get your ""honest pay's work"" as they're pretty much always available and only entails you to run from the cops as far and as fast as you can. A good tip for earning money is jacking cars and selling them to Los Santos Customs the right car could get you a pretty nice chunk of change. Heists are where its at though as they have the highest payout. But they are HEAVILY reliant on teamwork and moreso when you tackle on the Finale of the Heists. So know your players and make sure to be respectful of the Leaders as they're the ones that'll be splitting the loot at the end of every Heist. And to the Leaders make sure to split it nice and even for everyone in your team. 20% is the most agreeable cut. Story Mode is awesome and Online Mode is manageable. But overall this game is just a friggin' wizard experience.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-28,0,0,111,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V. Wow a long time waiting for this game. Anyway GTA V is the fith installment of the GTA series lets talk about how well it runs how good the story is and just overall. Now GTA V for PC isnt perfect why? Well its because the frames stutteres and yet Rockstar needs to fix it. Other than that the game runs amazingly the optimisation is HUGE. Currently i am running it on Very High with a GTX 970 and a resoulution of 5760x1080 and my god its amazing. Anyway on with the story GTA V takes place with 3 characters (note i am not going to spoil the endings or anything like that) those 3 characters are Franklin Michael ( my fav &lt 3) and Trevor. Now you unlock these characters as you go with Franklin being your started and Trevor for last. A really fun part that i loved of this game is the Heists man was it fun planning these out. And once you beat the game thats not it. If you go to the Epsilon Program website (as Michael) and then donate 500 dollars you will start getting the Epsilon Program missions. (You can do this as soon as you unlock Michael. In the end of it though you have 2 options take 2 million dollars or take a tractor (yes i said a tractor.) After all of that once you beat the game SAVE YOUR MONEY! If you want like 2 billion dollars (BIllion with a B) do the Lester assination missions once you beat the game and donate ALL of your money into the Stock that Lester says. The voice acting in this game is so GOOD it really immersies you in the game and its like your there. After beating the game you will unlock the outfits you used in the game like The Spec Ops outfit once you beat the game you will unlock it. In the end when you 100% GTA V you unlock 1 final mission im not going to spoil it but if you want to know what it is then search it up. The content in this game though is HUGE and if it wasent big enough ITS PC THERES MODS!!! Even though they arent the best but it will get there infact some are getting creative. If you the 2 billion dollars but you dont want to go through all of that trouble? Then get Alexanders Native Trainer + Script Hook you can give yourself a million dollars and keep on going. One thing that i wish for though is that the Garage only holds 4 cars. A MEASLY 4 cars. There needs to be one that holds 10. But i guess thats what....no....not online the most broken i've seen it the hackers THEY WONT STOP THEY WONT STOP!!! Lets steer away from that and lets talk about the Grapixs and my god i havent even seen them on Ultra but on Very High its pretty amazing the reflections are wonderfull the city lights look amazing. There is shirt physics and hair physics and also if you shave your beard and your head you will grow it back and my god the game is realistic although what i dont understand is if its based on Los Angeles then why is San Andreas a ISLAND! Just look on your map water surronds it. Anyway you can interact with Michaels family just call them and press Hang Out and you can have all of them come you can also hang out with Trevor and Franklin or Franklin and Michael and ect. 1 last thing The Rockstar Editor and holy crap is it amazing there is so many options like slow mo filters camera shake changing cameras pretty much what anybody would want i learned it all by myself. It was pretty amazing and fun i love making those videos. Anyway GTA V is an amazing game but SO CLOSE TO BEING PERFECT but i have to give it a 9.5/10 to the people who just not recommend it because the online is broken then why? The point of the review is to help people say yes or no to a game WITH MOST OF THE CONTENT IN THE REVIEW. Now its not Online i am decuting .5 from its the stuttering and it really can get annoying sometimes but i've grown use to it. Now i hope you enjoyed the review and i will see you in the next review. Bye!,Grand Theft Auto V

Grand Theft Auto V is THE BEST GTA game. Period. The story keeps you wanting to play more of it and finish it the characters are interesting and have depth to them the missions all fun and different instead of drive here shoot this and boom missions over. The heists are the best part of the single player game. Grand Theft Auto Online however is where this game is really the best. It's the grand theft auto online experience I always wanted. You start off creating your character which is then let loose into Los Santos to do whatever they please. I would love to go into great detail of how much of a blast online is but there is way too much to really narrow it down (and I'm lazy). I recommend Grand Theft Auto V to all.

2016-09-05,0,0,199,False,Recommended,Looking through these reviews most people seem to be giving this game a bad review for it's multiplayer issues. However most people don't seem to remember that this game was originally a single player game and a damn good one at that. Yes the multiplayer side while being extremely fun at times with friends doesn't have much support from the developers when it comes to network issues and hackers at least at the time of this review. One good I think I can say about the multiplayer is that there is new FREE content being released every new month that adds more and more new things to the game. But this is mostly a singleplayer game. GTA 5'S open world story characters well written dialouge and beautiful graphics makes this game (this applies only to singleplayer) one of the best I've ever played. The story is entertaining satirical funny and raises some good and interesting points about American culture. The characters are enganging and hilarous and the game is very easy to get lost in. There are countless amounts of side quests interesting hidden areas and sites to see. I highly recommend this game just for it's singleplayer aspect alone. It's well worth full price in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-17,0,0,290,False,Recommended,"Ah GTA 5 the best game ever made.Rockstar Games made yet another masterpiece. Grand Theft Auto V it tells the story of three criminals trying to team up for a series of daring yet very profitable heists in the corrupt city of Los Santos. From what you can already tell the game is set in a fictional city of Los Santos (inspired by L.A.) and there are three playable characters each with their own story and skills in the game. There's the gang member (Franklin) who tries to stick to the life on the streets mugging people dealing drugs and selling drugs. But all that changes when he meets up with a professional ex robber (Michael) looking for different opportunities and big bags of money. Then there's... the crazy one the one everyone's scared of Trevor who is a violent maniac driven by the chance of the next big score. But obviously it can't be easy.Okay enough of the story telling. As I said before there are three characters Franklin Michael and Trevor each with ther own different skills. Franklin has the ability to slow down time while in a vehicle which gives the player a much wider turning circle and a speed boost. Michael is very skilled with his guns at his disposal it allows him to slow down time (much like the Bullet Time in the Max Payne series) and gives the player the ability to get some sick headshots. Trevor is easily off which means that he deals more damage and takes less damage.Now comes the graphics. They are amazing from the blinding lens flares to the very beautiful sunsets to the lovely looking city in the night the game looks amazing like that. Any computer can run this game not on the highest settings of course but it is still playable and the game still looks gorgeous on low settings. There is a down side though. Texture pop ins which is very annoying while flying. There is a setting however to crank the view distance up although it does help there are still texture pop ins.Gameplay is smooth as silk. And the missions are amazing and the heists are fun. The heists start of like this. First you have choose how you want to approach the heist. You either go in guns blazing and butt . Or you channel your inner ninja skills and approach that way. That is always up to you. Second obviously you're not doing it alone so you need a crew. There are a few different ways you can do that. You can choose the people that the game already has to offer but most of them are cheap and terrible while the others are experienced but rather expensive. Throughout the game you will find yourself in ""random events"" those vary from civilians getting mugged and you either get the money back and return it or you keep it for yourself. Some of those ""random events"" involve acting as a getaway for a heist. Which leads to if you decide to help them of course them being at your disposal and then you can select them in the heist setup. Last but not least you need the stuff. Which usually involves one of the three characters or all of them if you please to steal cars for a getaway and guns for when the hits the fan which always happens. There are so many things you can do in GTA 5 you can hang out with friends and go for a drink or have yourself a little private dance with the lovely ladies of the night. And then there's the big thing. GTA Online. Which is set before the events of the single player. You basically create your own character and do whatever the hell you want really. You can race hold up stores participate in deathmatches or as of the new DLC be a CEO of your organzation and sell illegal goods which results in a payout. There isn't really much to say about GTA Online other then it's very much fun with friends.Rockstar Games never fails to disapoint us with this series. And GTA 5 is no doubt the best one. The voice acting is outstanding acting is amazing and the story telling better than any movie you have ever seen.10/10 It's a masterpiece allright. This is a must have you won't be disapointed.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-18,0,0,217,False,Not Recommended,The single player for this game is fine pretty much what you would expect from a GTA game you drive places and shoot people etc etc. The online however is a joke rockstar did not bother with dedicated servers so you spend 8 minutes trying to join an online session as the load times are hard scripted.. Then you finally land in the game and the ping is horrible and everyone is lagging as all the servers are peer to peer so 90% of the time your connected to some dippy kid who is trying to host from his almost dial up net. Soo you leave and try and join another game and 8 minutes later it drops you back in the same game.So the TLDR If you want a single player game get it it. If you want a multiplayer game get a different game with dedicated servers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-03,0,0,298,False,Not Recommended,It's a multiplayer game that fails miserably at actually getting multiple players together. There is so much content but that content demands you be removed from your current session so you can stare at a lobby for who knows how long. There are so many jobs that it's unlikely you will have many people wanting to play the same thing at the same time and in their infinite wisdom they decided to split the community into 3 different aiming modes.The thing that really baffles me more than anything is that they can't figure out how to get people together in free mode even with the stuff they have in it already. It seems like a simple thing to do. The crate drops are pretty worthless and too infrequent. The stuff you do for Lester is also pretty worthless and again too infrequent. Why not have these events occur more often and have bigger rewards so they will get the attention of more players? How hard would it be to have an armored truck drop 25k announce its location a few minutes before it spawns and actually increase its armor so it's tough to rob?What about making event zones that task players to do different things and maybe even allow them to work together by disabling friendly fire while you are in that zone? They could spawn a powerful tank that rampages through the city and everybody could try to destroy it. Pedestrians could riot and players could be rewarded for killing them. A plane could explode over the mountains dropping bags of drugs everywhere. Aerial checkpoints for cash could appear and players on the ground could be rewarded for destroying the players attempting to hit the checkpoints. There is tons of stuff that could be done with the content that's ALREADY in the game but Rockstar's idea of improving the game is adding more cars clothes and guns. Fun...,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-11,2,1,172,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V the game is four years old and it's still kicking Although we never saw a story mode DLC and we might never the story mode was still fantastic. It's set in the sun soaked city of Los Santos a place where everyone is grinding for money. You meet three characters. There's Franklin just a hustler trying to get out of his situation and make some paper. Michael a retired bank robber who went into the Witness Protection Program but after a series of unfortunate events has to put retirement on hold. Trevor a former associate of Michael and now a psychotic drug dealer. We follow them up to the point where they all meet. And then it's just chaos from there. Now Online is a bit different I played it at the launch of it on the 360. You create a character Lamar Davis greets you introduces you to the City of Saints and lets you go. Your character is much like Franklin just somebody tyring to get rich. There's heists you can do you'll need a crew for that and there's the GTA freeroam we all love. This game is wonderful we can see why Rockstar put like six years into it. I've been playing the story mode doing the strangers and freaks collecting scraps and spaceship parts and I'm happy to say I love it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Otherwise it can get boring after a few hours of gameplay.If you have no friends and are planning on primarily playing online I find it hard to recommend the title.

2017-07-04,1,1,1173,False,Not Recommended,"Originally I was hyped to get this game when it was first launched back in 2015 as it looked like Rockstar had returned to form after their darker outing of GTA IV. However time and ever more expensive updates has ultimately moved this game from good to awful in my rankings of games to play to unwind. Whilst the Single Player campaign is pretty solid in terms of game play the characters are basically forgettable when you stop to think about them with two out of the three (Franklin and Trevor) having no real character growth whilst Michael only grows in the sense that he makes friends with Trevor again and is making steps to be closer to his family. Compared to the protagonists of previous GTA games such as CJ of San Andreas Niko of GTAIV and Tommy of GTA Vice City they all go through their own proper character arcs and you learn to appreciate who they are. GTAV just feels like a severe step down from this with focus needing to be given to either one or maybe two characters at most. Three ultimately just seems to result in things becoming spread thin. Summing up the Single player game play it has some good steps in right directions but still seems to lack greatly when compared to its older 3D generation counterparts.With regards to the On line aspect this has pretty much turned into a Grindfest with ever more expensive DLC resulting in you having to turn your spare time into work so as to get any amount of money to buy the items you might want or having to shell out real world money for in game currency which could ultimately be used to buy another game to have fun with instead. Along with this the complete failure to moderate Hackers/Modder/Griefers means that when you try to earn money via CEO Biker or Gunrunning activates you run the constant gambit of losing all the progress you have made. This means the time you have spent stocking up of items to sell becomes wasted due to one selfish person who decides to be a complete for the sake of ""playing the game as it should be played"". Along with this having the constant server glitches lag or drop out risks to contend with also results in you risking losing what little progress you have made in your spare time. This will often result in you trying to confine yourself to a single player public server so as to mitigate the issues but at the same time cutting yourself off from the social aspect the game is meant to have. Ultimately when a game becomes a chore to play rather than fun it has stopped being a game worth play.I await to see what GTAVI might hold but if from what I am seeing from GTAV carries through to the next game (be it due to Rockstars decisions or TakeTwos ) this is one game franchise I will not be bothering with again.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,658,False,Not Recommended,"While I have well over 500 hours clocked on this game I simply cannot recommend it to new players. It's very clear that Rockstar no longer cares about their game and hasn't since the release of Heists update back when it was re released for current gen consoles and PC.Pros Single player is fun. The game is very beautiful especially for a 2013 release. Driving/racing/car customization is very in depth and has tons of content. Performance is pretty good game can run on low end hardware. Online updates have been free from the start.Cons Single player has been unsupported in terms of new content for well over a year. PvP is horribly unbalanced and honestly has almost no depth or skill requirements to it like you would see in many other PvP games. Rockstar/Take Two very obviously does not care about the game anymore and simply wants to push more microtransactions. Take Two has decided to shut down modding of the game entirely recently. The game is not ""welcoming"" and unless a hacker gives you money (which could be taken away by Rockstar) making money takes a very long time especially for a new player. Hackers are in nearly every lobby. New content tends to be prohibitively expensive requiring many hours of grinding to become affordable.",Grand Theft Auto V

Also the game in Online mode runs like sh*t compared to singleplayer I have a 1080 Ti and a 6700K at 5ghz and in singleplayer at max settings (except for Grass and MSAA) I get around 170fps. In Online however I only get around 90 fps or so and that's with settings turned down too.(I know that's still a lot of fps but I have a 144hz monitor and the difference to my eyes is quite substantial).

2016-02-12,0,0,233,False,Recommended,This took me long to review considering the fact that I had the game for almost a year. This game didn't have a stroy just like the other games but it was okay. Many people only play this for the Multiplayer. You can do many thing online. As Rockstar still continues to update the game there is always new events and ways to play with your friends.For the PC version it's a little different than the console. A main difference is that PC can run the game 60 frames or more while the console versions just locks the FPS to 30. I also recomend getting one of the new graphics card they have or installing a new driver. The game is meant to be played so that the quality reaches a level beyond the next gen consoles. However if your PC couldn't handle it you might want to be recomended to optimized settings only if you have an AMD or NVIDIA. If your PC still cound't run it just put the lowest settings maxium. Personally I can run the game at Ultra Settings within a 65 75 FPS range using MSI afterburner.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-21,2,1,199,False,Recommended,I have owned this game on the following platforms PS3 Xbox 360 and PS4. I bought this yesterday and the download for the fourth time obviously took ages. When I opened the game I was very happy. I found the keyboard and mouse controls easy to learn considering I was changing opinions on whether or not to buy it. After watching a few reviews on this version I was under the impression that it was practically impossible to use the keyboard and mouse. This was not the case. The only thing in the game I found difficult was flying. So I would suggest using a controller for that element of the game. The only other downside I can think of is that it requires a high end gaming machine to run in true HD with 60 fps. Other than that I would thoroughly recommend that people spend their money on this product.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-14,0,0,126,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.The Good Incredible world Gripping story Spectacular heists Bitingly funnyThe Bad GTA Online issuesIn my opinion a sandbox of extraordinary scope created with a masterful attention to detail. A patchy campaign doesn't spoil this wonderful evocative city. So henceforth this is a masterpiece.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-18,0,0,186,False,Not Recommended,"I recently bought this game to play with one of my friends. They have been playing it since its release date online on their own and managed to grind up to 3 million dollars with their online character in that time... And it is EXTREMELY hard to get any cash online. They spent a long period of time building up their account on their own because the playerbase sucks. There are hackers random death matches spawnkilling and general chaos where everyone is out to rip everyone else's throats out And that's not even mentioning the ""anti cheat system"" they have in place which is the reason I'm writing this review!After they built up their account and I finally decided I wanted to get the game we played in friends only sessions for a couple of weeks. When I decided to try the public servers I talked him into it and he knew it was a bad idea. Things had seemed relatively okay until all but two other people had left the server They proceeded to run me down with their biker gang and repeatedly shoot me to death wherever I spawned and my shotgun did absolutely nothing to them. My friend and I assumed they were modding the game (though they did die for another reason a few minutes prior) and left for another friends only session. We thought we were safe there and that it was over but we were dead wrong.We played on friends only until my internet bugged out as it normally does. I couldn't join his server. We tried multiple times to get back in a friends only session but we were blocked because of ""incompatible assets "" which as it turned out consisted of my friend somehow having 999999999 of every one of the snacks.Confused he submitted a ticket to Rockstar. We didn't think anything would come of it if it was reported. We thought Rockstar would help that he wouldn't get banned because of one of THEIR glitches THEIR mistakes but again we were wrong.My friend was permenantly banned by their anti cheat bot an hour after he sent the ticket.We tried contacting Rockstar multiple times to get it revoked but they were absolutely no help. They run the servers and they should have control over the ability to unban people. And they do They made the game after all. But they don't help anyone. Tl dr My friend was banned for submitting a ticket over one of Rockstar's glitches and mistakes and they won't do to help. Don't get this game soely for online. Community sucks support sucks and innocent people are permabanned for no reason. Online isn't fun unless you have a friend and even in a friends only session you can be banned for nothing. It takes years of in game hard work on your own if you have no friends that play this game with absolutely no fun after the hundredth time around the race track to grind up your ranks and cash to be able to enjoy any of the better features of the game. Unless you want to deal with the community or pay real money for one of Rockstar's ""shark cards"" for in game cash (COUGH MICROTRANSACTIONS COUGH) you're going to find it hard to actually accrue anything of worth. Don't bother.GTA V itself on story mode is alright. But permabanning people from online over false claims or t glitches that are the game's or anti cheat system's fault and refusing to revoke the ban just shows how much Rockstar doesn't care about you only your cash.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-15,0,0,443,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V...man oh man...GTA V...It's a great game I have thousands of hours in this game across three platforms mainly Online. I pre ordered this game three times one copy for PS3 Xbox 360 and PC and bought two other copies brand new for PS3 and Xbox 360 for friends and family. I have literally paid my dues. I have more fun in GTA V than just about any other game I play. Though you may notice my low low hours in GTA V on Steam. Why you may ask? Well simply put there are a lot of malicious script kiddies and modders out there almost always Russian or Chinese with the occasional English speaking modder. I've gotten about 8 people banned showed proof of their modding/cheating with video evidence and reported to Rockstar. If someone is using mods and scripts to fart around I have NO issue with them doing so what I hate are people who maliciously go around the server ruining it for everyone. Also those 8 people are only ones that have been confirmed to me via email where I get a reply back saying ""Action has been taken thank you for your report and helping to keep Online safe for all players."" I've reported probably around 30 or so people with picture or video proof and reported probably hundreds with the in game report feature. Most of these people admit to it too which is where I get my picture proof. I ONLY report people who are blantantly cheating some people try to be sneaky but I know the ins and outs of it all. I NEVER make false reports ever. They completely ruin the online experience with randoms. It was a cheat fest on PS3 but PC is 100x worse because of how easy it is to do so.Secondly this game even though it's very well optimized still has some glaring performance issues the custom radio station always causes huge slowdowns and some areas will make your FPS tank the game also has a huge memory leak so 16GBs of RAM is recommended which I have. Thirdly there are still a lot of latency issues with other players and NO PING CAP I'm always thrown into a server with Chinese players who teleport everywhere and take no damage but kill you while they're blocks away from you. I've experienced the same with quite a few Australian peeps as well. A player with high ping always has the advantage in this game. I also almost never see Euro players I think our regions are out of whack or something.Fourthly Heists are always a pain in the to setup players will always drop out mid match and ruin the entire thing or sometimes they just won't start due to Rockstar server errors. And most of the added game modes kind of suck.Fifthly this game is a grind fest and everything is way beyond expensive. Almost everything added to the game is just rehashed vehicles from previous GTA games but smoothed out to look better I mean christ one of the most expensive items in the game is the same old private jet you see everywhere but it's gold plated and it's $10M that would set you back over $100 in real life money if you purchased Shark Cards to afford it. Limited edition item that comes with a motorcycle or vehicle? $2M per vehicle to unlock that special item. Some cars are around $4M and with upgrades on top of that you're looking at another $1 2M there are also insanely expensive houses and yachts most houses being between $500K and $2M and yatchs are around $9M. Because of this Rockstar has held back/cancelled all singleplayer DLC and pushed back/cancelled planned mission DLC for Online like another set of Heists. Shark Cards are also insanely expensive NOT worth it AT ALL. Ammo prices are insane and you lose TONS of ammo if you die that's doubly so if a modder drains you of all your ammo and weapons using a script or kills you so many times that it'll just leave you with absolutely nothing. If you die while holding a grenade launcher it wipes half your ammo out now imagine that but with a modder who makes it impossible for you to even enter passive mode to be able to even leave the session because if you get killed while in the pause menu it'll boot you back out to the death screen. Weapons are also insanely expensive most addons are between $5K and $60K PER GUN. In a way this game is also pay to win. If you have no money you can't buy ammo yet the rich punk can buy ammo from his menu screen over and over and over. It's completely unfair especially when they're driving around tanks or flying around in their expensive jets blowing you up because you can't defend yourself without money. You also lose money on death even if it's in your bank you lose like $500 to $1K per death I've seen players drop upwards of $10K on death before.Sixthly Rockstar is full of they ban people for no reason. I'm afraid to use any kind of screen recording software with GTA V now because I've had friends banned for using any kind of overlay. Two friends to be precise both of which NEVER CHEATED. You can also be banned for receiving money unwillingly from modders. So now I have no way to make videos of GTA V unless I had an external screen recording solution AND I now have absolutely NO WAY to report players with absolute certainty to Rockstar. They did a huge ban wave and managed to miss almost all the cheaters and modders. It seems almost worst now than it was.So see now I have a hard decision to make do I recommend GTA V or not? I do LOVE this game everything about it's actual gameplay even in Online is great controls are super tight and the game looks amazing but all these issues affecting the Online community need MAJOR work. So I think for now sadly I'll have to Not Recommend it until Rockstar changes things. I will however continue to play it. It's still amazingly great fun with friends in a private server.Also people seem to have an issue with the ""Toxic"" players. But I say if you're good enough at this game there are no toxic players only cannon fodder. I routinely clear servers of clans (3 or more people as a group) who think it's funny to pick on people especially low level peeps that I defend. I'm pretty damn good at GTA V I've been playing it for over 3 years now and have invested a large amount of time there isn't much I don't know about this game I know how every vehicle handles exactly the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon and vehicle and the perfect vantage points around the entire map of GTA. So really if you want to play in random public servers then you'll need to become a better player because as it is all the guards in place to keep toxic players down do not work at all and I see no way of solving that without ruining other aspects of the game. I hold a 2.0+ KDR even with all the cheaters in the game that love to waste me over and over before I can even go passive mode and find another server if there were no cheaters I'd probably be pushing a 4.0 KDR even with all the latency issues. I never toot my own horn but I am when it comes to this game. I'm one hard mother er to kill and will generally take on at least three other players who are working together at a time and take them out a good five or so times before they pick me off that's 15 kills before they can finally kill me a lot of singular players I will go 1 20 with if they don't try to leave after the first ten times I killed them in a row so no I'm not bad at this game. Which is another reason I'm able to spot cheaters so efficiently. Again I require ABSOLUTE proof a player is cheating before I make a report. I'm not one of those people who reports players because they're better than me.",Grand Theft Auto V

Why? 16 player limit per server You can see where all the other players are on the map and hunt them which is dumb. Heists are repetetive playing against AI cops instead of players makes it sooo boring and easy. People either cashed in or cheated themselves some nice money. I won't do either.

But I love the confrontation generated when you start fighting people in Online Mode. I give this game a solid 9/10 because it's well optimized there are no fps drops and the server stability is very good. You can barely feel the lag even when you are connected to a server in another region.You can do so many things because it's an open world type of game so I definitely recommend buying the game. If you think the price is too much usually on Steam sales the game drops down to about 25 bucks.Enjoy!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-29,0,0,562,False,Recommended,Firstable I am just talking about the multiplayer now. I never really played the story mode.I love this game but there are a lot of things pretty bad. The customer support sucks the community is mostly toxic and back in the early days of the MP were a hell of a lot cheaters.I've had so many great moments I can't count them at all. It's such a fun game IF you play with friends. Trust me. Never EVER try to play a heist with randoms. You'll lose your faith in humanity sometimes.At this point I would call the game pretty balanced. They listen to the community (mostly and sometimes slow but at least they do) and things get patched very fast if they don't work. The weapons feel good to play with the races are fun and the courses well designed. The character design is awesome because they actually have their own personality. I couldn't imagine this game without Lester even if he's an annoying little pedophile f**kward.The heists are well designed and very fun! It can be quite frustrating though when you finally got everyone out the prison alive you land your plane correctly without ramming any police cars then getting everyone into your plane just to get exploded by a kamikaze police car that just decides to ram your plane frontal outta nowhere.The last thing because I'm too lazy to write any stuff anymore. I love the cars. They might seem overpriced at first but if you play the game enaugh you'll realise it isn't THAT expensive. It's sad that the cars don't handle a little more like in GTA IV but a lot have different opinions on this.Did you really read that whole wall of text?! If you had this much time to do so you might leave a comment with your opinion then lol.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-22,0,0,322,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a magnificent game. It has such a good single player experience that requires an insane amount of hours to %100. If you are just playing the main missions of single player you will not be dissapointed. Single player has a ton of humour in it and has a couple of wacky missions you can get very invensted into it. Did I mention that single player supports mods? GTA 5 Online is another huge aspect. Online is such a blast especially with friends there are a ton of things to do like HeistsMissionsRacesSpecial MinigamesEventsMake a CEO or Motercycle ClubRobs Storesand a TON more!Online can be fun playing by yourself but I highly recommend playing with friends as it will make your experience so much better.GTA 5 online is still being supported 6 years after launch with waves of FREE content! Grand Theft Auto V is a game you need in your steam library especially during the %50 sale. It is worth every penny.NOTE Some people are reporting that they are randomly getting banned for unvalid reasons I'm not entirely sure how often this occurs but I can tell you I have never been banned and that no one I know has been banned.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-16,0,0,108,False,Recommended,I was scepticle at first whether to buy this game. I had played San Andreas parts of Vice City and IV (Episodes aswell) I spent months not knowing this game until PC version came out. I saw and in a few months i got it.TURNS OUT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST AND WELL MADE GTA'S OF ALL TIME.It's not as fun as the classics the Grand Theft Auto has been replaced with buying the cars legally. The gangstas have been replaced with cops and robbers bank heists. Campaign is mediocre no one plays it anyways. A few good missions until you get some serious cash when now the game is too easy. Multiplayer on the other hand is more a sandbox filled with hackers and modders guys with better equipment destroying you those who blow up your car and kill you for no reason or set bountys on you for no reason.BUT when you EVENTUALLY find a match you Can't stop playing untl everyone leaves and you leave the lobby ONLY TO GET KILLED AND YOUR CASH TAKEN FROM YOUR DEAD CORPSE. The robbing stores chilling with freinds heists(if you find one).This game is fun the multiplayer 'Jobs' are REALLY fun if you have freinds and ridding around stealing killing on a rampage is fun but there are thsoe who want to ruin everyone elses enjoyment just for a laugh.THIS IS A TRICKY ONE. I play the CRAP out of this game even with all these cons but there are a small amount of pros that completely annihiltate the cons. 8/10 IGN Aliens helped made this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-23,0,0,702,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 never gets old. Rockstar is always trying to add something new to the game so players keep coming back to play and they succeed at doing this. When they brung heists into the mix it was the best thing the game company did. But now that almost everyone apart from players new to next generation consoles have completed the heists rockstar has put out there is no real fun in that area.However the game company is coming out with brand new DLCs and they do not disappoint. If only the company brung out things that the community wanted more then the game would never have to move onto the next number.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-10,0,0,493,False,Not Recommended,"Although I would love to give this game a thumbs up I just can't. The singleplayer is good. Like really good. Replayable explorable and enjoyable. If this review was for Grand Theft Auto V Singleplayer it would be a positive 9/10. If you're going to get the game just to play single player which depending on how casual/hardcore you are can be anywhere from 10 hours to pretty much until you get bored (trust me it takes a while) get it.However the reason why this is a negative review is quite simple Grand Theft Auto Online. While in itself it is very similar to the main game using the same map mostly the same assets and the same entertaining AI the key difference and the part that lets the game down is the sheer number of online players who think that it's perfectly acceptable to run modded files.If you're bad at a game you're bad at a game. Sure you can practice to get better but we live in a society that wants to be able to do anything without putting in any effort and that thinks it's unfair when someone who is naturally good at something or has more experience at it is better than someone else. There is simply no excuse for using mods or scripts which do any (or all) of the following Teleporting God Mode Prop Spawning causing every player/vehicle in the game to explode simultaneously setting burn times to infinite money dropping money leeching. As if these aren't bad enough the people that run them are actually encouraged by large amounts of the community to keep doing it and nearly every server you join you can see people asking for modders/scripters/hackers to drop money. Couple that with the delinquents that spawn jets and proceed to wreck anyone and everyone that they see and it's not long before one starts doubting whether there's any actual reason to play the game anymore.Rockstar do very little in the way of helping. So you've encountered multiple hackers and you're going through reporting them all? Funny that because reporting a large number of people in a short length of time somehow puts your account under suspension while an investigation happens but piggy back riding random players while dropping rhino tanks on them is perfectly acceptable? You've got video evidence of someone blatantly exploiting the game? Nope sorry there was nothing that the player did which violates the terms of service.Gone are the days of auto banning people who run modded files. Gone are the days of actually listening to your playerbase. I guess we're starting to see the effects of ""It's ok he's allowed to do it because it hurts his feelings if you tell him not to"" online as much as we are in the real world.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,"I've been hating this game for at least a year now so I'm jumping on the hate bandwagon to tell you all of the reasons why !So there are lots of problems with this game. Let's start with the single player problems. 1.The game doesn't encourage creativity and/or fun. It does that in multiple ways. The main one for me is that on the admittedly huge and very pretty map there are ONLY 3 RESPAWN POINTS. It makes it incredibly frustrating to die especially since very little cars tend to spawn next to the respawn points forcing you to wait or run around for sometimes minutes before finding something that'll help you go back where you died.Another way the single player finds to discourage creativity is by making money making slow. See at the end of story each character has a buckload of cash but even if it seems like you're going to never need anymore than that when you look at the price of things in the game you'll realise that you may need A LOT more and there aren't really any ways to get it apart from waiting for your bisnesses to give you a few bucks.Another really annoying thing is that you can't save cars this means that once you spend a quarter of your money on a nice car if you lose it it's gone forever and you'll have to spend a third of the money you have left if you want to buy it again. 2.The game is a to people who don't play the online mode. By that I mean you can't access ANY vehicle from it and can't access a lot of areas either. They're doing this expecting you to spend real money on the online to get access to that. A few days ago you could bypass most of these problems via the use of mods (I didn't because I'm not a big fan of the gameplay but that's just me ). But because they hate people they're preventing the use of mods as much as they can wich is probably the dickest of moves they could do. You should hate them for that.So that was for the single player campaign. Let's go over the Online Mode. (please note I quickly gave up on the online and stopped playing it so I'll probably forget TONS of problems.)The Online Mode is a ""micro"" transaction hell hole. if you want to buy anything in it I hope you're willing to spend twice if not more the price of the whole game! Instead of being a fun gamemode where everyone has lots of guns tons of cars and jets and whatever kind of sandbox you're stuck with having a pistol as your only weapon for a few levels then having to spend all your money on a few weapons finding a cheap car somewhere and claiming it as your own all that while being harassed by dickholes who murder you on sight with their dozens of weapons and un breakable armored cars.One would argue the heists get around the lack of money problems but they don't. First you need some kind of house as well as quite a lot of money to initiate one and if you want to join someone else's be prepared to have a 5% cut of the money after struggling for an hour on a single mission because someone kept dying so some people left so you had to wait for a dozen minutes for people to join again only to see them dying loads again.Point is the game's I'd love to get a refund and you shouldn't buy it in the first place.",Grand Theft Auto V

I'm not running it quite maxed out and have the occasional frame rate hiccough in certain circumstances but it isn't anywhere near bad enough to say it's not a good ""port"". If anything it could do with the settings menu being less annoying to navigate. The intro movies could also do with being skippable after first launch they get very annoying when playing with settings that require a reboot.I have experienced a consistant bug with the benchmark going crazy and failing a mission halfway through (It seems to start a new story mode at the same time or something) (PC gamer had the same issue) which made setting up a bit more of a hassle than it needed to be.",Grand Theft Auto V

Great optimization at least in my opinion. Many things to keep you from beind bored. Like races parachuting killing your friends and acting to be innocent and so on. Many variation of styles to choose form to distinguish you from your friends. Heists are AMAZINGLY fun requires you to have friends though.. ' ) And many more I can't put in a review. Cons Many players tend to be s but I guess I can understand why as this is a ""M for Mature"" rated game. Some graphic settings will tend to cause you lag in multiplayer.

2016-09-14,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,This game is fairly good but I can't recommend it for a few reasons.1. The main reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the broken cop system. The main mechanic to GTA is the police and police evasion and it is very poorly implemented. The cops are unrealistic to the point that modders had to come out with a fix to make the cops more life like in their behavior in how they chase and search for you.2. The game does not support flight stick joysticks so the flying missions are HORRIBLE. Luckily during the heights there is usually and option that doesn't involve flying and good thing too because flying with the keyboard controls is awful.,Grand Theft Auto V

It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open world games aspire and it s incredibly dense with excellent content.

2015-05-10,0,0,90,False,Recommended,GTA V is definitely packed with crazy and more challenging missions. I would at least died 1 2 times before completing the hard mission. Before playing it for the first time saw many complaints on how they were unable to launch the game or crashes during the game even with high end rigs. I was worried at first but once i launched the game it felt like they were talking about another game lol.Played for many hours now I don't even encounter a single problem. Running it smoothly at 60 64 fps. Note that it doesn't have an Ultra setting most is at Very high which i assume is the ultra level. I have a typical high end built rig just the usual stuff i7 4790k 16gb ram with a single gpu asus strix gtx 970.Game has never crash at all through hours of play.There are lots to do indeed in the big world. However no game is ever made to perfection and its not possible either since everyone's expectation and own liking are different.Cons (Single player experience only) No option to let you change your default car. (I hate Michaels dumb car! pimping it does not make any much difference..) You can't drop your old guns...it gets annoying once you buy better guns and needed to switch a few times to use it. You can't go topless by freedom. Sometimes i just want the character to go topless to show off the tattoos having the bad look when they're about to commit crimes like Saint Rows.It only happens during mission randomly and you can't have the option to do so. That's all i could think of for now..This is still an awesome open world game. I really really do not recommend this game for anyone under 13. Very heavy vulgarities on language and actions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-29,1,2,578,False,Not Recommended,"Welp since I got banned from GTA Online I figure I'd share my expierence along with some info to try and explain how much of a joke GTA Online has become.tl dr the ridiculous grind and pay to win aspects drove me to hacking.Now let me preface by saying I wasn't a malicious hacker. I never blew people up or griefed I just spawned money for myself. Why you may ask? Because the grind in this game isn't just big. It's downright absurd. Take the new Night Rider car Rockstar added in the latest update Import/Export. It has built in machine guns a parachute etc. It can't shoot down a hydra but it's a fun little car to mess around with. How much does it cost? Well assuming you're a CEO and you've grinded out car thefts and completed the car's special mission that let's you buy it at a discount it costs $4 320 000. Now let's assume I were to say ""screw that I'm not spending weeks grinding for a car that can't outpace a super car and can't shoot down a hydra I'll just buy a shark card."" since $4 320 000 is an odd number the shark card that comes closest in value is the Whale Shark card which is $3 500 000. How much is 3.5 million fake dollars to Rockstar? $49.99. But that's not enough. You'll also need two Bull Shark cards to reach the minimum price tag. A Bull Shark card gives you $500 000 for $9.99. So accord to Rockstar a gimmicky underperforming retextured vehicle is worth about $70 the price of a brand new triple A title. And people wonder why GTA Online is filled with hackers. This isn't even bringing up the prices of CEO offices garages motorcycle clubs safehouses etc.If you want to play GTA's excellent single player mode pick this game up on sale or on Otherwise don't waste your time especially with the p2w fest that is GTA Online.",Grand Theft Auto V

The online mode is my personal favourite+Rockstar frequently releases free dlc/updates for everyone so even if you get bored at one time come back in 3 months and there will be plenty more too do.Cons Quite a few hackers on PC and there are a few situations where players can be banned for things they didnt do (for example getting money dropped on you by a hacker.) Some microtransactions that can range from quite small to rather large. This can also be seen as a pro though because it is completely optional as you can reach the amount of funds that are available to purchase within a few days of grinding missions and these microtransactions are what keep the free dlc coming.Overall 9.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Kinda like why some americans own guns Becasue they can and they have the right to do that. Most europeans dont. Why do you think that taking away the right of modding is right?. When we have been able to mod the game since day 1. But now all of a sudden modding in singleplayer were it dosent affect anyone but you is wrong?. Here is the resson why take 2 decided to take away mods.They are gonna try making people buy mods. And some of that money will go to take 2. They want their finger in the modding community pie. Or they are gonna remove mods from the game and they will instead try to force you to buy their own custom mods. Witch ofc will cost 10 euro+. Take 2 is not stupid they are a multi billion dollar company and they know what to do to make even more money.Rockstar and take 2 have a huge influence in gaming. And when take 2 will force this on the modding community and on the gaming community other company's will follow in their way of doing busniess.Hope you found this review informative.Thank you for the attention.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game is super grindy to the point where it is no longer fun to get on with friends and to try to complete missions to get the money for the new content. Because the missions themselves are repetative and simply require you to drive long distances instead of it being a challange.

2015-08-19,0,0,200,False,Not Recommended,Cannot recommend this game anymore. The amount of overpriced in game items is stupid. Unless you spend hundreds of real life dollars don t bother playing this game because you can t unlock anything. I have nearly 200 hours and haven t unlocked a quarter of the vehicles that I want. To unlock a vehicle you must grind for a bunker for like 12 hours of boring grinding. Then you must grind another 12 hours to unlock the vehicle. So you can spend 3 hours enjoying it at which point they release about 10 new awesome vehicles which they make you get a new building for and the vehicles are upwards of 5 mill in game. Single player is great but let s be honest most people these days just care about online wish they sold single player separately.

You COULD grind it out sure but if you're gonna get smoked every few minutes or trolled while in Peaceful mode I really just ain't for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-08,0,0,1223,False,Not Recommended,Ok all the hours I put into this game and I still can't get the FPS to stop dropping into the single digits. My build is the amd 1100t six core processor with 8 gigs of 1600 ram. Got a standard 7 200 rpm hard drive with plenty of space left on it after game is installed. I have a 3gb 660ti gtx graphics card and the settings all turned down even directx 10 in stead of 11. This game will not run smooth enough to drive a vehicle. Rendering distances are scaled all the way day in every option. What's really bad is that you can't get a refund for this because by the time you figure out it's not going to work right for you you've owned it too long. I installed when I bought it back in april and couldn't figure out what the issue was. I had other games to play like far cry 3 and 4 to check out (which ran beautifully without changing the graphic settings and they're on UPLAY so figure THAT OUT!) and finally got back around to this just recently. I found out it was twice the size I remembered the game being which was insane but it was a while ago so maybe I remembered the incorrect file size. All the game play time you see was trying to figure out a way to fix this game. I think a did one stunt jump by accident when it was lagging. It just doesn't want to run like they claim. They won't give you a refund. DO NOT BUY. Rockstar has become PC gamers BIGGEST troll.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-25,0,0,480,False,Recommended,"Definitely one of my favorite games of all times. Pros Has impressive graphics for the time if was released (you can also download graphics mods for singleplayer). Has a multiplayer that is easy to play with friends. Has incredible replayability. Has a great open world with several things to do in it. Is open to modding. Has an incredibly accurate map of Los Angelas.Cons Rockstar patches out glitches that aren't really breaking the game. For instance rockstar patched out several wall breaches around the map of Los Santos. It is hard to get lots of money to buy the dlc vehicles/whatever they release without grinding missions or heists for days. The game still has some bugs such as the ""Purchase all ammo bug"" in GTA Online.In conclusion if you have a friend to play with this is a must have game in your library. If you don't have a friend to play with but you enjoy a good long story this is a good game to have for the singleplayer. If you want to have incredible graphics and/or mod the game definitely buy this game as in my opinion this game is the perfect game to mod.This is a perfect 10/10 for me",Grand Theft Auto V

The entire Grand Theft Auto Online 'experience' is a complete ing joke and is riddled with micro transactions and hackers which can empty your bank account on an instant and blow up your vehicles which has you having to pay up up to $50 000 from your own bank account to bring it back.GTA has been out since 2013 so it's coming up to 4 years old and instead of TakeTwo actively trying to ban the hackers and scripters that can be found in pretty much every Online game they spend their time destroying the work of modders and harassing the community with acts such as removing all opinions constructive critisism feedback and genuine concers towards the game's direction from their comment sections on their social media over 70 000 comments deleted in just 2 years on their newswire alone. (news article below)The average time taken to gain around a million in game is around 10 hours although it can take a lot longer. I genuinely wouldn't mind if it was 10 hours of good quality content but it's not at all. Most of the 'gameplay' is purely repetitive bullsh*t that is designed so you are rewarded the bare minimum in an effort to tempt you to buy a shark card instead. All of the 'content' they add is for the most part absolute garbage including the 'businesses' designed to be extremely expensive and give off the illusion you can somehow make that money back and as for vehicles it seems almost every couple of months they add an even quicker car right after you bought what you thought was the best car after many wasted hours of grinding.If you do buy this game my plea for you is to stay away from 'shark cards# as it only further condones their awful business acts treatment to the community and modders alike and ultimately their f*cking awful microtransaction business model.Source / TakeTwo silencing GTA community https //zerolives.com/article/UJxP1yc1/gta modders rockstar games removed 70 000 newswire comments between january 2015 and september 2016,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,447,False,Recommended,Overall impression Very well optimized game with breathtaking visuals lifelike animations (most of the time very rare glitches are hilarious) incredible attention for detail enjoyable shooting mechanics great gameplay top notch dialogues and voice acting and good soundtrack. Lots and lots of things to do huge open world bazillion of side missions and activities which you can (but don't have to) participate in. The world is so detailed it's almost ridiculous.9/10Single player only As said gameplay and visuals aside top notch dialogues and voice acting is one of the strongest points. The first two thirds of the story are great. Characters introduction their motives interaction progress and story itself (including side missions) are simply great and it is a pleasure to play. The final third of the story felt a bit rushed to me motives become a bit illogical and it's overall kind of uh.... meh. I was disappointed by the final act. Which is a shame. Might be only my opinion though.9/10 for first two thirds of the story and side missions 6/10 for the final third.Multiplayer only Lots of loading screens. Not kidding. The loading screen would get burned into old 90's monitors. Apart from this you have to prepare for the fact that most people are d1cks and some of them are cheaters on top of that. Also doing Heists (long co op missions with great rewards) with strangers is not impossible but not recommended (as soon as anyone from your team ragequits the Heist ends for all of you and its progress is lost). Apart from these things what's left is awesome. Co op missions versus missions deathmatches races sports challenges just roaming around and wreaking havoc you name it. It's much better with friends though. Protip do not install any mods if you plan on playing the multiplayer you will get banned. You have been warned do not go crying in the community hub afterwards like all the other people you will get laughed at.7/10 without friends 8.5/10 with friendsFinal verdict A must have piece of gaming history to proudly shine in your library.

Don't let my hours decieve you it says I only played an hour but I've actually played probably 500 hours into this game and beaten the story mode two times about to play it a third time.I haven't gone near the online part probably never will. I didn't even go online in GTAIV just played singleplayer. For the time I played GTAV I'd say it's worth a try. The story is funny action packed and cliche but surprisingly I enjoyed the cliches. There's plenty to do after beating the game like finding hidden objects and completing time trial missions. There are also hundreds of mods out there that you can download to enhance this game. My biggest complaint is they ditched pool from GTAIV I played pool so much it was the best part of GTAIV.My favourite mod is probably the body guard mod because getting 4 strippers armed with assault rifles is good times.Something memorable is driving along the highway just as the sun is rising it's quite relaxing. Flying an airplane or jet through the mountains and valleys. Driving a dirt bike over the sand dunes. Taking a sail boat through 2 storey high waves in the middle of a thunder storm (can make those waves bigger with a mod but I found them big enough). Or stealing a passenger jet from the airport and flying off with it then ditching it at high altitude and parachuting. Exploring the bottom of the ocean as a fish. Flying around the whole map as a bird. Playing as a monkey and running around decking people with my monkey fists. Starting a traffic jams and creating fist fights between NPCs. Getting someone to chase me and make them punch me in front of the police and then he gets shot to death by them. Crash landing a jet in the mountains and managing to barely survive.Car customization is a lot better than GTAIV. You can do a lot more and add a lot more to the cars. It was fun to take a car and upgrade it with a bunch of stuff. Funniest thing is taking a rusty beater car and adding chrome paint and big off road SUV tires to it.Not sure what else to say it's good and will keep you busy for a while.Pros Tons of cars bikes boats submarines utility military and air vehicles.A lot of customization for vehicles.A lot of gun customization.Funny NPCs.Decent story with humorous cliches.Fun police chases.Relaxing atmosphere.Well built world with believable locations. (Even the bottom of the ocean is detailed with seaweed and coral which you will almost certainly never see in a normal playthrough)Custom radio station which announces your music it's been in other GTA's too but it's my favourite returning feature.Princess Robot Bubblegum. Nuff said.Wide variety of wild life from cats dogs birds fish mountain lions monkeys whales and sharks and more I forgot.Tennis mini game is fun.A lot of story mode locations are still accessible after beating the game.They brought back the military having Marines as body guards is pretty bad .Some cool secrets and easter eggs.Free game updates.Cons No pool.No girlfriends. (except for Michael's wife and sex contacts which don't really count)Fewer television and radio shows than GTAIV.Can't go to restaurants anymore. Only source of food are soda machines.Can't sell drugs... This was my favourite feature in China Town Wars I made hundreds of thousands of dollars in that game buying and selling drugs.End game payout is too low.Johnny Klebitz dies and is less of a bad . The writers portrayed Johnny as this really hard core stone cold killer in the Episodes of Liberty City but in GTAV he acts like a scared little boy and gets his head kicked in by Trever Philips. Doesn't make much sense. I think the version of Johnny from Episodes would've been more than a match for Trevor.Neutral I haven't been able to see a huge difference between a silenced weapon and an unsilenced weapon. Both seem to scare people easily.Driving a boat outside the map will cause it to eventually randomly sink. Driving an air plane outside the map will cause it's engines to eventually die out. this isn't a pro or a con but I'm putting it here because I have a phobia of deep water and this was probably the scariest thing in the game for me. It literally sent chills down my spine when my boat sank in the middle of no where.The game tries to make hunting a thing but it doesn't really fly since you're doing it between two busy highways. Didn't feel authentic.The buildings under contruction remain under contruction for the whole game and are never ever completed.Ordering a blimp via cell phone. Ordering a freakin' mother en' blimp with your god damn cell phone. That makes no sense strangest feature in this game imo.I almost never used my cell phone. I often used my cell phone in GTAIV for activities but in GTAV it's less of a presence in terms of features and can be easily ignored.That's not everything but it's an idea of what I think about this game. It's really worth your time in terms of singleplayer I had a blast with it and continue playing it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Damn they were good.The singleplayer along with the modded capabilities make this mode a time burning modeTHERE IS SO MUCH TO DOSeriously it's amazingOnline GTA online is quite a conumdrummaybe it's because I didn't buy the game day 1 and they just updated it as the player base ran through stuff to do but I found it extremely grind y.It is enjoyable with friends but if your expecting to do the crazy things from singleplayer you will be disappointed as it requires alot of moneyMoney which is cheatable through the shark cards (buyable ingame money)It will be fun for a while but don't expect it to be as involving as singleplayerConculsion I enjoyed GTA5 and both of it's modesSingleplayer was more engaging for me but if you have friends and aren't planning on doing anything crazy without grinding online will be enjoyable if not it will still be enjoyable but don't expect it to be as good as singleplayer.in the end I'd recommend it,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-28,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,I don't recommend this game to anyone interested in single player gameplay. The story mode has become an afterthought for Rockstar due to the success of GTA Online. They make so much money through Shark Cards that they have abandoned the single player game.I am disappointed by the decision to focus all development on GTA Online I won't be buying GTA games if they try and pull this off with future GTA titles. The online mode sucks as it is a waste of development time and resources that would be better spent on making new story content. I don't enjoy online games they are boring and are only improved slightly with 4 or more friends with the game. The problem is only made worse by the people that fund the online experience through shark card purchases that are a requirement to get any of the awesome DLC items.,Grand Theft Auto V

But to suddenly backstab and ostrasize a huge part of your customerbase for indulging in your product and making it their own just because you want players to buy overly priced digital currency has got to have been the most ridiculous business move I have ever seen.I seriously hope R* feels the community backlash like a kick in the teeth because they deserve it for letting this happen.Oy Vey amirite?,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-28,0,0,1265,False,Not Recommended,Lets start by saying i have played every gta from the first to the last (with the exeption of gta london) and have owned all and still own most of them. So when GTA V came out as ussual i preordered it with big expectations. Now the story line is somewhat unike compaired with the previews versions but not much diference as in the end you still have to basically follow the set outcome instead of having a actual free choice in what action to take and what caracter you play with. The graphics are not as good as they could be the storyline is repetitive and as said the free choices arn't free (aright they added Trevor got to give him some love best edition EVER). There's tons of stuff you can buy but not a real way to make the money so you can afford them (not knowing the lester missions yet and even with that knolage it SUCKS). 100 Million for the golf club allone.. Without cheats how am i supposed to make that kind of money? Traiding on a halve baked stockmarket..?As side from all that is wrong with the single player there's the gta online... Now gta and online do not go in the same sentence in my opinion and i buy the game purely and ONLY for the single player as i am sure there's many others that do so. This mean that all the extra's that where promiced and where supposed to be also added to the single player never came as rockstar (or take two wich ever did it) dissided to add the shark cards. They made enough in the first week of the release to cover ALL the expenses making the game and still they want more those greedy basterds.. This allone ruined the rest of the game for as far i was stil clinging on to my gta obsession. In my opinion you are better off buying gta 3 san andreas or gta IV or any other wich still is the real deal. Rockstar made a wrong turn i hope senceraly that the next gta will be improved drastically and i hope they concidder the singleplayer as much as the online part (not against online just not my thing). PLease rockstar listen to us the gamers not just to your bank account! Just take a step back re think your strategy and build us the best ever gta. I'd pay twice the money if the game was genuely good in all aspects Tho mostly single player).,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-23,1,3,261,False,Recommended,"There's something about this game that provides a bittersweet taste for me.I've spent roughly 1500 hours playing according to my social club spanning over Xbox 360 and PC.I don't have a lot to say about the singleplayer since not much needs to be said. It's an incredibly complex accumilation of thousands of scripted lines cinematics events characters and story made by a talented team which cannot be doubted. Opinions of the storyline are a differnet thing but fact stands that it took a great deal of complex work to make the game possible for that I happily approve and encourage people to purchase this game for this experience.Multiplayer is a different prospect entirely.Back in the old days of 360 there was a terrible hacking ""DNS"" storm. Money everywhere for everyone. Want to kill someone for that sweet $9000 bounty? Go ahead. Oh what was that? You just gained 500 billion dollars? Money bags spawning out of the sky as a giant alien spaceship flies about wind turbines crashing the game for all? Why can you buy so many expensive houses upgrades cars bases drug houses giant yachts bunkers jets and helicopters for monetary amounts that take literally months of playing to aquire? Why are the prices of all things implemented at a much earlier time of this game's life so much cheaper than the assets of today?Why does a bike from 2017 cost $2 000 000 as opposed to a 2015 $51 000 bike?The money + level hacks of the first generation consoles. The only platforms the game existed on when it was released. Rockstar did a lovely thing which was putting hard work into free DLC. The problem is everyone aquired everything immdiately. There was no feeling of challenge and progression. In time all hacked money was removed but the posessions aquired from hacked money were kept. Hackers still dominated many multiplayer lobbies. Missions were inconsistent and boring in comparrison to ""I will just stay in freemode and wait for a hacker to drop money.""You could say that the actions of Rockstar today can be justified for this. They worked hard they were on the fence about adding a PC port because of past exploitations but they did it anyway. They put so much in and got a giant *screw you* from the community as a whole in return.Bans are alot more brutal current DLC's encourage shark card microtransactions everything is extremely expensive there's an ""elephant in the room"" feeling to the multiplayer world now. You could even say the addition of all of these extra ""games within a game"" modes are generous.However on the other hand there's a lot Rockstar has to answer for. Unfair bannings is the main one. The hackers tha do exist (not as many but still quite a few) have the ability to remove money from your account or add it. Kill you constantly in many different ways prevent movement prevent most mechanics of your game... the list can go on. This game is very complex and with that many deep rooted oppertunities for hackers to manipulate. Rockstar respond terribly to this. When I mentioned the bannings were brutal they often hit the innocent as opposed to the guilty. So to conclude. A lot has happened and a lot has changed for this game. As it stands now it's pretty good. But unfair for someone not involved with the events of above. To join in on the content is to grind for months or to pay more in game money. I am unhappy with that state of the game. The reason I stopped playing is because I am scared my account will be banned modified or ruined through unfair reasons that Rockstar will be unwilling to help with.But as an overall experience I don't regret it.

By then I didn't even care. I just closed it. However. The pros for this game. Racing is extremely fun. With different modes. You can now play solo in GTA online. Which is great when you don't want 4 year olds messing up a mission for you. I love doing heists. Its exactly like payday 2. BUT BETTER. Tons of weapons mods.

Now I've finally made it throughout the game after so many years I haven't been interested in the storyline by simply not being the ""story guy"". I can say it's been an amazing journey to say so. I'd definitely recommend finishing the game if you haven't yet. 11/10 on this segment.Seeing the Online feature of the same game it's quite fun and kept updated often. Provided that they have taken out the modders roaming around their servers it really gets ten times better.

The story is as good as ever and is visually pleasing due to high enough graphics. The game is an extremely good pc port unlike GTA 4. Alot of people complain about the online and hackers are a problem yes but if you find a good lobby or even a closed one for you and your friends you can have hours upon hours of entertainment.

2018-04-14,0,0,572,False,Recommended,I've had this game for years mainly on console but came over to pc for the new content. This game is probably one the best for those who genuinely love to grind your way to the top. A lot of bad reviews are mainly because of false bans but people forget that you have the option to LEAVE THE SERVER WITH THE MODDER AND FIND A NEW ONE. This game isnt for everyone but I would still recommend it. It's best you make friends with someone around lvl 150+ if you plan on getting anywhere online or you and some friends can coordinate for grindfests. Rockstar has admittidly strayed from their usual formula of cars worth the money and entertaining missions for gameplay modes to bait out true grinders and people who can afford to buy tons of shark cards. The cars arent really worth the price (the new ones especially minus the Pariah) and with the recent updates older vehicles and aircraft are worthless. Rockstar hasnt legitimately balanced any vehicles since the Banshee 900R controversy but all in all if you want to grind in online and want a decent story mode buy it. Just make sure your rig can run this because this game is punishing on lower end systems and if you're on a laptop like me.......... get a super powerful cooling pad. Cause between the shadows and the stuff to render your internals are gonna get slow cooked. Thanks for reading hope this helped.,Grand Theft Auto V

Not satisfied ? well there is still online a place where you and your friends or random people do the most crazy random create havoc in any kind of way robbing banks and stores racing or my personal favourite deathmatch and alot more.The stuff to do on this game is endless this game is truly gorgeous if you want to have a good time have a lust for adventure or an adrenaline rush but dont want to leave your basement and go outside and do life then this is the game for you.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-19,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,"This game crashes too much to be fun. I've had nothing but problems since I installed it. My first issue was not getting any of the key prompts in the tutorial mode (need to buy new clothes? Sorry! Can't interact with the counter). Next after my bf had to use his computer to run my account through the tutorial I joined a mission with friends only to get loaded into and stuck in a garden unable to get out because the spacebar wasn't working (not due to the keyboard it's 3 months old and works fine in other games/applications) and then the game crashed. My bf fixed an issue I was having where multiple messages would get sent to the game due to frame loss which made most of the game unplayable especially driving. Now whenever I join a mission/heist in GTA online with a friend the game glitches or someone's connection is dropped or the game crashes we fail over and over and some times for no apparent reason. I can play the same missions solo with no connection problems (I still occasionally crash) but I didn't buy this game to play alone. I'm not a software engineer I've tried my best to fix these issues on my own and with the help of my bf. I'm not going to put my entire system at risk just to play a game that can't reliably work in the first place. Unfortunately neither Steam nor Rockstar will refund your money if you have these problems or playability issues. Steam says you have to ""prove"" that you've tried to make the game run by showing chat logs with Rockstar Support stating they can't fix it. Rockstar simply has a ""No Refund"" policy. So I'm stuck with this broken software and out the money.All in all there are too many problems for me to enjoy the game at all.

For starters everything for sale in GTA online is quite literally 2x 10x more expensive than its single player counterpart. On top of that money is about twice as hard to make in online mode. This is because Rockstar wants to sell SharkCards and they continue this business model because YOU idiots keep buying shark cards. At the best SharkCard exchange rate ($100 IRL for $8mil in game) $1 of IRL money gets you $80k of GTA Online money. This means that for their latest update you would need to buy over $500 f*cking dollars worth of shark cards. Rockstar has valued their own DLC at $500 f*cking dollars.

2015-05-04,0,0,911,False,Recommended,GTAV's campaign is pretty cool definitely has some cringe moments and some annoying characters but who would play this game for its Campaign?BOOMGTAV's Online Multiplayer has been pretty mixed since launch on 360 and PS3. Personally I was around for the first day of Launch and lost my character which was only lv13. But it was an exciting experience to play with friends having a ton of fun! It was a bit lacklustre of a grind to say the least but nevertheless I enjoyed it.BOOMHeists are here the intended endgame for GTAV Online and added in some memorable missions but was nothing more than tedious missions which required teamwork and became hair pulling especially if teammates were lacking.But it did break the ice and introduced the best vehicles that have stood the test of time The Hydra a harrier jump jet with an arsenal of the Lazer but can be called in via pegasus.The Insurgent an SUV which is classed as Off Road but takes more rockets than a tank and has some serious collision physics with other vehicles.The Armoured Kuruma one of the hosting bullet proof windows that you can fire out of it takes PvE to the next level possibly the most used vehicle in GTAV Online to date beside the Zentorno.BOOMFast forward to 2018 the online is still booming with popularity and we have a lot to cover Between heists and now there has been many Expansions given for free to players and oh my do they deliver a punch.The Initial garage system was neat you had an Apartment with a garage or a standalone garage which could house 10 vehicles excluding aircraft boats utility cop and military. Really neat but now you can have more storage than ever now you can get a 60 car garage by owning an office and being a CEO!What's a CEO? A CEO is a special person who owns a company and works in an office can spawn vehicles and start global lobby missions on demand recruit players as members and the start of a business! It gave an alternative money making source from doing contact missions! By being a CEO you can buy a warehouse for supplies which is as tedious as stubbing your toe on the bed every hour! It allowed you to Buy &gt Collect &gt Sell supplies for a big profit but has downsides which make it not worth the time.Alongside this Supply Warehouse you can own a Vehicle Warehouse a godsend for money making and storing some cool vehicles! With this warehouse you are able to source Standard Range/Mid Range/Top Range vehicles free of charge steal them from whoever owns them (PvE by the way) and then store them in this Warehouse once stored they can be sold using a variety of options (Top Range) $0 upfront payment with a total pay of $40k $10K upfront payment with a total pay of 70K or the big one which is the best $20k upfront payment with a total payout of $100k. Amazing money generation for time investment takes about 20min each to carry out!Now about these cool vehicles you can house you can buy them from the Warstock store at standard price or trade price the trade price is considerably cheaper but requires you to source a certain number of vehicles and then you need to complete the mission tied to them. Some examples are the Phantom Wedge it's a hauler with a giant cone stuck on the front and launches vehicles into the sky upon ramming them.BOOMFollowing in the footsteps of the CEO we have the motorcycle gangs a way to show off your motorbikes and to invest into the drug trafficking. You get a clubhouse to hang in and to view the progress of the sites you can own the three main sites are Weed Cocaine and Meth manufacturing.It's also the first instalment of the lazy money essentially you go to a site and resupply it by stealing supplies (once again it's PvE) when you steal these supplies the workers get hard at work by manufacturing which generates a profit you just need to check up on them to see when it's the right time to sell or resupply. Only issue with this is that it includes a lot of management it can be quite overwhelming compared to vehicle selling. But the payout is fantastic especially for the Meth and Cocaine sites only downside is that because people are doing the work you get a big bill every 48mins (24 hours in game) in a server if you have 3 up and running it's about 24k.BOOMNow we have gunrunning you start off by purchasing a newly made bunker these buildings host your new weapon of destruction and way to access trade prices for some even cooler vehicles The MOC (Mobile Operations Centre). This is a mobile fortress a hauler with a bunker on the back equipped with a tank gun on the front and an additional two on the back however those two require research to unlock.What's research? We're onto the second instalment of the lazy money you go out and resupply the bunker but the supplies can be split into three paths here Research only for upgrades to vehicles in Gunrunning as well as weapon modifications Manufacturing which is similar to how the farms work for the MC gangs except you can sell for a lot more and you need to resupply less and finally both. Both is the slowest path but gives you both at once which isn't anything to complain about.What are these even cooler vehicles? Remember when I was going on about garages not allowing Military vehicles? Rockstar reconsidered with this expansion and allowed you to store an APC Half Track A flying bike which has rockets Weaponised Tampa which is a car with a minigun rockets and back facing mortars Insurgent Pick up and many more in your garage. The APC is stronger than the Rhino and has a tank gun of its own and is a personal vehicle. How cool is that!?BOOMNow we have Smuggler's Run the gunrunning of air but also the second instalment of CEO's supply warehouse. It's got a really cool feature of allowing your pegasus air vehicles to be personal vehicles and allows you to repaint them.It adds a few iconic aircraft like the Apache Helicopter and the Spitfire plane but that's as good as it gets it's not as fun as gunrunning and the supply stealing can be very tedious at times.BOOM Current day we are in the Doomsday Heist the better endgame heist that is split up into 3 parts pretty lacking until the 3rd act which is great to do. I won't spoil anything here.This expansion added the Facility where this heist can be launched from and also where some of the new vehicles are stored. Let me introduce you to the Avenger.Okay so remember the MOC I was on about? Well this is the same except it's an Osprey Gunship and can fly and has 3 tank guns spread around it with excellent coverage as well as droppable bombs. The Osprey is capable of VTOL and can flick the giant propellers forward to become as fast as a plane. It's a flying fortress and something to be feared especially with its armor!Alright now we have the Chernobog the Avenger counter it's an anti air vehicle which launches a volley of missiles able to lock on at a range of 400m. On top of this we have the Akula which is a stealth helicopter a new tank that is able to hold 4 players in with the arsenal of a tank gun/rail gun 2 grenade launchers and .50 cal machine gun.We also have the Barrage which is the light buggy able to have 2 miniguns on it one with 360 degree coverage and another on the back with about 120 degree coverage.Skipping to the cherry on top we have the Deluxo a car which is based off the DeLorean from Back to the Future it can hover on water fly through the air and can even be equipped with the best tracking missiles in GTAV Online.Lastly I wanted to keep this out but the facility can be equipped with an orbital cannon which can kill any players on demand and can be launched anywhere on the map every 48mins a bit unfair...The payout for the heist acts isn't anything special but it's still welcomed. Personally i'm looking forward as to what else Rockstar are going to deliver considering how it's been so far the future is bright!,Grand Theft Auto V

I like many others was banned forever for modding the game when I booted up multiplayer. I had been spawning and money and such. I was modding in money becuase I again like many others was tired of doing the borring repetitive missions for the overpriced items online. Ultimately I'm in the wrong but what's important is the reason why I turned to modding in the first place the stupid expensive items and the horribly expensive shark cars. Great game horrible business practice. Do not buy in current state.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-25,0,0,1546,False,Not Recommended,First of all I wanna say this game is great.Especially when you exclude the multiplayer.The singleplayer is awesome it has great visuals good story line and is overall just good.but the thing about this game is when you finished the story or grow tired of it most people will go to the multiplayer section of this game.The multiplayer is just overall of course you get the usual play with your friends session but when it comes to 'not being able to play with friends or something like that.' You will find yourself in a difficult position because the public lobies in this game are just plain aids. There's hackers everywhere In every public I've been in there's been at least one or sometimes none. Second of all the tryhards don't even get me started on those. the moment you come across one just discornnect or go passive or something because they will not stop killing you. and that's what really makes me dislike this game. I can't go in a public lobby without someome just coming at me with a Hydra or an Akula or Hunter. You almost can't get them out of there and when they do they just go first person spam the flying out of their A and D button and grab a marksman sniper and when they're done spamming they'll just call an APC or some other kind of OP vehicle in the game. It's like you're just dying for no reason just because these s just want to up their K/D. I guess this is just more of a hate relief or something but take this as a warning then berfore you buy the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,372,False,Recommended,I'd like to start by saying I never played the console verison so I am a fresh player to GTA V.The launch There was basically no day one issues sure online went down until the morning but it really wasn't for long and we expected this. Well done Rockstar for cleaning it up quickly. The game installed fine and for once Social Club was not a pain in the The play The story is incredible. I am about 1/4 of the way into it and level 18 on GTA O and its amazing. I cannot fault it it has kept me hooked (48 hours into release 26 hours played).Ok this game is extremely optimised no kidding if your PC meets the minimum requirements you will have no problem at least playing on low. Rockstar did a much better job on V than the absolute failure that was IV.The graphics are intense. Never played Next Gen Console so I can't really compare but the graphics are breath taking indeed. I can run the game on very high but choose to run it on just high so I can avoid ALL frame drops. 60 fps is something I do not want to give up. Although there really isn't any noticable differnce from high and very high so its fine.The bugs Only one or two such as camera getting stuck once in GTA O (fixed by tabbing in and out again) and a few crashes but nothing game breaking. The delayed launches were definitely worth it for this very near almost bug free game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-01,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,Disappointed with how dead this game feels. There are many significant landmarks such as sprawling processing plants and daunting military bases but they're all dead. There's absolutely no reason to visit these places. For example take the military base next to where you get your first plane there are only a few soldiers walking around in this HUGE complex and you'll only get several soldiers to appear if you go inside and shoot one of the few soldiers walking around. Even with five stars as I said there are only several soldiers and a few helicopters. It just doesn't seem like what would happen in any real life situation which completely kills the immersion. Aside from this 90 percent of the missions are boring and unimaginative the option to select from three characters kills any sense of personal progression (which Vice City did so well) and building on the first point the world isn't interactive enough. Don't waste your money on this game you will thank me later. Positive reviews are from fanboys who aren't capable of judging without bias.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-08,1,4,52,False,Not Recommended,To be completely honest this game did not wow me. It also did not live up to my expectations. I thought that it was going to have more action more adventure and more badassery. In reality half the game is just you driving to a location shooting it up getting money and losing the cops. All the quest and missions sort of have the same backbone to it. After doing ht first 10 or 15 missions you get tired of the same old pattern. Sure it's a fun game but it's not worth the price tag of 59.99. You can get so many better games at that price point. Plus Grand Theft Auto Online is complete trash. Community sucks.

2017-06-09,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,After almost 4 years of following this game and the content that's been added to the online scene it has become increasingly difficult to justify booting the game up or keeping it on my hard drive due to the amount of greed that Take Two has exhumed with this entry in the GTA franchise.But first some positives. The single player side of the game is great. It has a fantastic story with some unevolving but interesting characters (Trevor Phillips especially for obvious reasons) fun missions a bit of GTA fan service sprinkled throughout and mod support which is being taken advantage of to the fullest by the fans. Sure the actual side content is pretty sparse and there really isn't much to unlock outside of a moddified dune buggy as well as some race cars an armored muscle car and a submarine (if you bothered to play it on the Xbox 360 or PS3 anyway) but overall still worth purchasing on that note.However where it really falls flat is the online portion. It's no secret that GTA Online's anti cheat system just does not work as intended. It bans players that use any sort of program that implements an overlay like an FPS counter or chat system unless it's Steam while still letting godmodders and money spawners go on unpunished. Then again I can't really blame anyone for resorting to cheating like this when you consider what changes Rockstar made to the way payouts work since the October 2013 release. Simply put making money in GTA Online is a slog. Missions pay less the faster you complete them you cannot directly replay a mission the mission Rooftop Rumble has been redesigned so many times to counteract the speedrunners that it's not worth playing anymore and the best you can hope to make in one mission is around $18 000. Now that wouldn't be so bad if things like vehicles and the CEO/Biker related properties (Gunrunning properties soon to be added to this list I'm sure when it gets released) weren't so damned expensive.All of the really fun stuff is made ridiculously expensive and because you're earning money at a really slow rate it's not uncommon to find yourself spending literal days trying to scrounge up enough cash to buy it all. But ButterBro I may hear you ask isn't there also heists and CEO/Biker related missions you can do to make more money than by doing missions? There are but good luck with either. Heists require both some spending cash to setup the heist as well as three other shmucks who are actually decent at the game and have a good enough connection to not just drop out during the loading screen from lobby to prep. Not to mention that you don't just buy in and then do the heist. You have to go through the setups first which consumes time and doesn't pay anything for you if you're the one hosting it. And then there's the CEO/Biker stuff which requires literal millions to get the most out of them.Yeah. You have to spend millions of dollars to get them to make the most money they can. And even then you still have to pay for supplies and properties to store them in. Not to mention moving everything yourself with maybe 1 7 other people who decided to be nice and accept your invite to join your group and not try to blow up your hard work that you've sunk so much time and money in. Because nearly every single person in every single free roam session loves nothing more than pointless endless deathmatching with other players and are more concerned with racking up kills and rivals than they are actually working towards the next big purchase. And good luck finding another person willing to let you join their CEO/Biker group let alone one that's actually doing missions and getting him and his associates paid.So yeah overall GTA V is only worth playing for it's single player experience and the modding scene. GTA Online is just too much of an aggrivating grindfest to give it a recommended play and the steps it takes to push you towards buy cash packs is slimy as hell. If you want to play a multiplayer free roam game with a lot of things to play with and people to blow up with as well as shoot up with you're better off with something like Just Cause 2 and the multiplayer mod.,Grand Theft Auto V

I started playing online and quickly realised that this game is a cashgrab. beach bum dlc weapons were like 1k each. now weapons even pistols are upwards of 10k just so that rockstar can get more money from shark cards. I said "" this"" and downloaded an online trainer gave myself an empire! lodes of mone! and what do you know? I get banned a few days later! one month for a first crime! i am extremely impatient so I uninstalled GTA for a while. When i see my ban had passed on Feb. 2nd 2017 I felt relief! i install GTA which took about an eternity and a half and I cant log in! i contact their support and an hour later i get a response! ""your account ""************"" no longer exists. Best regards Rockstar Support"" REGARD MY YOU S!!!! So now I no longer play GTA not that i can but I stopped not only due to being banned but because grand theft auto is just a cashgrab. free DLC Microtransactions. people are whining about battlefront 2 having microtransactions yet GTA 5 was the first. It did it before it was cool. Now with the new dlc i can see that there may never be a 6th installment. and i'm fine with that. GTA's only playerbase is retard let's players and little kids who shouldn't even touch ing webkins that's how old they are. they are barely alive and playing GTA like it is the only way to live. I got the trainer to give myself money. that's it. that's all I did and I got a month ban for it. you rockstar.Rockstar you can go royally yourself for being a load of scamming s who make deals with companies to not let players have fun with a game once it's over. with OPEN4 dying and your reviews on steam turning to mush i wish you good luck with the future and by that i mean I hope you go bankrupt and your entire office building gets a jet straight through the lounge just like we could never do in game.GAME REVIEWStory 0/10 pretty ing cliche for a GTA game (GTA IV was ing way better even though it was tedious)Characters 0/10 (see above )customisation 2/10 you can change shoes and other things you'll never pay attention to!vehicles 0/10 they dont have any cool cars that arent DLC (see below)DLC 0/10 first few could be played in SP but now everything that attracted me to the DLC (the cars) is MP only so you have to deal with hackers trying to blow up your new car on the way to your apartmentand now the part you've all been waiting for! M U L T I P L A Y E RMP is they start you off with clothes and a pistol. no house. no car. nothing. cheapest house? 100k. heists are level restricted so that way of making money. everything else is expensive. they make you pay to progress. it's a pay to play AND a pay to win game. congrats! it's a Turd!you can get banned for giving yourself money but the people who are somehow level 2000 in the lobby aren't banned for reasons and such.other players? oh well here are some typesThe murdererThe Hide and Go Seek kidThe killerThe MurdererThe Rich MurdererSee the difference? there is none. you'll get run over by a supercar shot by a hydra jet or RDM'd by a little kid with his dad's PayPal. This is why you should never ing consider buying grand theft auto. I made that mistake and I regret it to this day.thanks a ing lot rockstar you really managed to ruin something that had amazing potential like fallout 4 or other games that could be good but turned out bad. your game's reviews are currently all negative and you haven't made a good game or any game in 4 years since this turd came out. yeah it's been 4 years. talk about beating a dead horse well here's your example folks! your company's practically built on this game and the supports are falling. people are going to other games with greater value and potential. this game has been $60 for 4 years and has barely ever gone on sale.Please please for the love of all that is holy DO NOT GET THIS STEAMING BAG OF 4 YEAR OLD TRASH it is a vacuum for money and you'll regret your purchasehonestly I could go on for ages but I'm afraid I'll have to cut it shorthey rockstar! lemme intimidate you for the end of my review!

2015-04-15,0,0,580,False,Recommended,"What can I say? I'm hooked.I first played GTA in 1998 with the PlayStation release of GTA I that was quickly followed by GTA II and its successors all the way to IV.Unfortunately my console became broken and I was unable to purchase or play GTAV when it was released in 2013. Since then I had been following popular communities that streamed it onto Twitch and Youtube saying to myself ""I can't wait to play this on PC"".Thankfully despite the wait Rockstar has done it again. They've done the right thing in making this game a true PC port and not something like Skyrim where it's overwhelmingly console orientated.The gameplay is amazing I've yet to experience single player the Heists are fun or depressing depending on whom you play with the Online experience helps bring GTAV to life.There have been a few hiccups in the past 24 hours what with the surge of new players I have encountered connection issues and one client side crash. However this game is so heavily optimized to PC's I can't complain especially since I capped at 114FPS last night and a constant 60FPS when recording using Mirillis Action! through Steam.Overall I am happy that we can now experience the glory of Los Santos and San Andreas from the comfort of deskchairs instead of hulking lots of money into an expensive console with less features.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,489,False,Not Recommended,Recently Take Two the publisher of GTA V ordered a cease and desist order on OpenIV the mod that makes most other mods work. As a PC gamer mods are a rather large part of why I purchased this game and now an important part of what makes this game fun for me has been removed. Take Two don't just want to make money they want to make ALL the money. They have cancelled SP DLC won't allow GTA Online vehicles into the single player (including the Hydra ffs) and the whole of GTA Online is designed to make players buy microtransactions. Two years ago GTA Online made nearly half a BILLION dollars for Take Two but apparently that is not enough. As Take Two are intent on damaging the SP as much as possible in order to force people to use GTA Online and its microtransaction pit of hell I cannot give this game a positive rating.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-29,1,1,297,False,Not Recommended,Please listen to my review. (There is a TL DR below) I got this game on release for original release on consoles as well as on release for PC. God did I want to see mods soar. BUT. Do NOT buy this game for GTA Online the story is long and sort of replayable even there is a community for mods although the mods are not entirely... always good. There is a RP community which I would seperate entirely from GTA Online. As a new player (although including anyone) you will find the experience with any random people (The point of GTA Online) is completely ruined by people who either payed money or cheated in all the P2W dlc updates from Rockstar. Sure there is a few legit players who didnt pay but they probably don't ever play anything else and grind solo HARD. Forgot to type this in at the start but 8 million jewbucks (Rockstar money not official) is $100 real dollarinos. And most of the newest content averages 6 8mil.First let me start by saying after some research I found that a majority of the people who actively play GTA Online heavily support Rockstars updates and tells anyone else to off or just stop playing. They are at LEAST mildly hostile to anyone who disagrees or complains about the updates they are the ones who yell the loudest and the ones still around to respond to people with legitimate greivences on insanely unfair and cheat like content behind virtual paywalls.If you want to stand level with all of the people who are already god tier in this paid game either by grinding for thousands of hours or paying real money you will also have to pay real money or spend an insane amount of time grinding it out in the same boring t missions with low rewards (compared to the GOOD you need to save up to buy). Again as far as I have seen people who still play love that p2w mmm gimmie more THOSE POOR COMMONERS DONT HAVE. GIVE ME THAT THAT WILL GIVE ME AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. LOL P2W? THERES NO WIN MESSAGE LOL WHERES THE OBJECTIVE HOW CAN YOU WIN. (Kill &gt Death Winning). if (end credit screen 0) then (p2w false) else (yourwronganyways mustjustifymy2000dollargame) How the game is P2W (andeveryonewhobelievesotherwiseisignorant) There can be a blurry line between whether something is pay to win or slightly pay to win. However if you believe P2W and P2W faster are different you're ing dumb. They are the same ing thing. Before you even finish saying it you are already sayingp a y t o w i nA game which includes a way to gain an uncontested advantage over other players is already bad enough being able to buy your way there is Whether you can do it free or do it with money you are capable of giving yourself an incredible and I mean INCREDIBLE advantage over others who have not paid money. Of course people can reach that height by grinding it out but thats the same for people who have also paid money. Just because you can EVENTUALLY get it for free its NOT PAY TO WIN FALSEYOUDUMB .Paying to win gives you a much larger advantage over others by paying money. off its not pay to win half the ing game is killing other people and it isn't fun to be tossed around like a ragdoll by tanks jets and weapons that are so powerful they outclass both of the former mentions by a GODDAMN MILE. Why did people like GTA IV free roam so much? I'm not answering that but Online convinced me how much better IV is. WHY the game is P2W I've mostly hinted it so far but the tanks are honestly not THAT BAD... except the only way to truly be able to fight back is once you unlock an RPG at level 100 (WHICH IS SOO EASY TO GET TO.) cough t no its not coughIf you do nothing but play games all day leveling is easy. If you have a normal god damn life its not easy to get to a level where the things you unlock naturally are useless now anyways. You can get a lock on launcher but you will go broke refilling the ammo while the with a tank pays nothing to call in a new one whenever he needs to.Over time Rockstar has done this sort of power creep in a PvP intended enviroment where every update the things they release cost more and more. Two million jewbucks use to be the HEIGHT of expensive things people got once they farmed the same mission over and over just because it was slightly faster than the rest. Now people run around with jets that can shoot infinite no reload explosive ammo that one shots anything except worthless armored land VEHCLES. A simple fix for that if they every cared to but instead their fix was to add in THERMAL SCOPED HEAVY SNIPER RIFLES WITH EXPLOSIVE AMMO THAT CAN ONE SHOT NEARLY EVERY VEHICLE AND PLAYER IN THE GAME. (But they FIXED IT says the greasy ing keyboard warrior). Okay to people over level 100 (More health per 10 levels up to level 100) can take TWO SHOTS. Oh so you have a chance to shoot back? No because explosive ammo ragdolls you and forces you into a 3 10 second animation of flopping around like a seizure patient then attempting to stand up while discount Deadeye on the other side of the mountain ing thermal scopes zooms in to you like a ing psychopath and takes the second and easier shot to finish you off.If you haven't seen GTAO then you probably don't know this is only a very small problem where an ammo type (Not only for snipers) makes you a walking fortress of death turning driving around goofing off into hoping some player doesn't have a ing god weapon and feels like using it. There are motorcycles that fly and shoot homing rockets that lock on to ing anything impossible to shoot down. Maybe it sounds fun yeah it probably is fun. But a majority of these items cost 4 8+ million meaning any normal player who doesnt dedicate themselves to this game alone (Which I payed 60 for) completely useless and at the mercy of those who payed or cheated their way up.I personally reached around level 130 and had all the good stuff even with all the time I've spent in game I could do nothing about the people with all this new content. RPGs heavy snipers LMGs Homing missles grenades remote bombs shotguns ARs. Non of it could help me defeat a wad with a sniper+explsive ammo and an with a futuristic bike. (FYI most new content ranges 6 8 mil and 8mil 100$)TL DRThe game is P2W for Online which exists and here is why. Explosive ammo which one shots almost anything including armored vehicles. One shots anyone under level 100. Will ragdoll you anyways.Armored AND armed vehicles become useless to this gun (Which is one of the hardest things to obtain playing without paying)Armed and armored vehicles which are insanely powerful such as a flying bike with rockets that lock on to players (Very very hard to shoot these bike riders)Vehicles with unlimited ammo such as tanks jets (with explosive ammo) more tanks helicopters which shoot volleys of rockets etc ALL very hard to get while also having fun playing because its ONE BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIG GRIND. And thats coming from someone who has played dozens of MMOs.Please believe that when I say its a huge grind to get anything I mentioned I mean its a big ing grind. I don't feel like looking through this review to remove redundencies anymore. Dont wanna fix it up hope its not too bad.Story mode is pree fun doe. lul long text wall is over. take advice from a who has played every GTA (And Red Dead Redemption) game. including those with online since the day they came out. i still boots me up some delishous GTA 4.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-14,1,1,158,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V has so many things to offer. Let me start off by talking about the general information.The music played on the radio in this game may surprise you especially if you're into Rap like me. For example you might hear a couple of tunes by N.W.A. on the West Coast Classics station. The background music provided by Rockstar fits really well. It doesn't give a certain vibe that many people may not like. It also fits the situation you are in. For the most part it is just electronic but sometimes the music changes mood for example when you're being chased by cops.The graphics are very nice but the issue with them is that they make the game difficult to play. This is of course for low medium budget gaming PC users. If you want to max out the graphics on this game and get a solid count of 60 frames per second on average then you're gonna need a beast of a computer. I am currently running the game on an AMD FX 6300 with 3.5 GHz and six cores. With medium high settings enabled in 1920x1080 my frames per second can vary. If I am driving down central Los Santos in my new whip I might get around 20 40. If I'm cruising in a low populated area with not much activity I can probably get 40 60. If I am just chilling in the crib I can easily reach 60. In combat it can vary because it depends where I am. It doesn't matter though because the game is playable to me in pretty much all situations.The gameplay is fine but not amazing. It works smoothly and I haven't seemed to notice any bugs or issues but nothing has really stood out to me. This game has so much content which is why I currently like this game so much. There is endless customization that is for weapons attire vehicles etc. The Single Player mode provides plenty of missions for you to complete with unexpectingly hilarious dialogue and interesting characters. The Multiplayer mode provides you with all kinds of things to do. In Free Roam you can hang out and mess around with friends steal cars rob stores fight other players and more. In Multiplayer you can also do all different kinds of jobs as well as heists. Heists are where you can get most of your money so I recommend doing them frequently if you want to get rich. Unfortunately though the community of GTA Online is basically the definition of cancer. You have those five year olds constantly asking you to meet up with them at the airport bloodthirsty s who will keep hunting you down just so that they can kill you and take your $100 (which is almost nothing in GTA V) and worst of all hackers. The hackers in this game are the scum of the earth. I don't mind them using it only by affecting themselves but when they mess with other players it ruins the fun makes you not want to play Grand Theft Auto at all. Try not to be too annoying in the voice chat because those s will figure out who you are and with you for the rest of your time playing until the next time you hop on (meaning that the effects that they use against you can be removed by the rebooting of the game). They are merciless and they will most likely never stop harassing you. Sometimes they'll bother you even if you're not annoying them in any way.I give this game a rating of 8.5/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

If I can remember correctly it costs 100 real US dollars for 6 billion in game dollars. 6 Billion in game dollars doesn't even get you the yacht. And this game was sixty dollars...

2017-08-09,0,0,725,False,Recommended,"Honestly the game is fun YES it does have its flaws like the fact that you will always find modders be in sessions with higher levels (if you are new or aren't super experienced) and will always have trouble making money no matter how you play the game (even if you get modded money it can be taken away and can get your account reset if you are given free levels). The game itself tries to be as fair as possible. I often find myself in sessions with high and low levels. If you don't have a problem ""grinding"" your way from the bottom to the top of the food chain then this game would be for you. To give advice to new players always be careful if someone is nice to you remember that not everyone has to be and some people will shoot for little to no reason. Some people will attack you regardless of how strong you are. You could have millions and millions of dollars but still someone may want to f*ck with you. I do like the game it is just the community that makes it tough and frustrating to play with and against. I often find myself in conflict with guys over 100 trying to f*ck me over and get a laugh out of it. They often just end up wasting time and money trying to be the winner of the ""duel"". I do recommend this game. Why? Because it is fun if you play with friends the grind to the ""top"" isn't so bad. Sure you will find times where you can't be on top but no game will just let you be the winner at all times. I have had my vechicle cargo regular cargo resupply and my own property being harrassed by guys or gals thinking they are cool and want to show off. Like I said buy the game if you really aren't convinced by some guy on the internet wasting like 5 10 minutes telling you about the game in detail most people don't go into then by all means keep looking through the reviews maybe you will end up buying it maybe not.

People get fed up with big companies trying to push onto others we bought your ing game (some people THREE TIMES) let us do what we want with it. In one day Take Two made the reviews for GTA V go from positive to overwhelmingly negative. Also they just bought Kerbal Space Program I hope to hell they don't plan on doing the same thing with KSP they're doing with GTA V mods are the backbone of that game always have always will be. If Take Two really doesn't want mods then give the SINGLE PLAYER some UPDATES.

2017-05-17,0,0,26,False,Recommended,The Grand Theft Auto series has long been one of the most popular video game series. Starting off in 1997 as a nodescript top down crime simulator the series has since blown into a megahit that has defined Open World gaming. Grand Theft Auto V is the latest installment and is in my opinion the best of the series. Superior to its predecessors in all aspects it took the world by storm and I believe it was the fastest selling entertainment product in history with over $1 billion made in gross profit over a 72 hour period upon release.Pro's + Fantastic and gripping narrative with an emphasis on satire that manages to amuse on multiple occasions.+ Polished and refined visuals. Considering it was originally designed to run on the ancient tech of the PS3 and Xbox 360 Rockstar have done a tremendous job polishing and improving the same base models and textures to reach this level of graphical fidelity.+ Great soundtrack both from the Rockstar composed OST to the licensed music featured on the in game radio. There are few moments in gaming as satisfying as driving around the visually stunning San Andreas state to the Los Santos Rock Radio. + The world building of Grand Theft Auto is astounding. Los Santos and San Andreas in general feel like a living and breathing world with a large attention to detail. + Superior optimisation to its predecessor GTA IV. While hard to run on older rigs you don't need to have a GTX 1080 Ti with Kaby Lakes finest i7 in order to play GTA V at an acceptable graphical fidelity.Cons + GTA Online is an inconsistent experience. Most of the players are more aggressive than a Russian on Methamphetamine and Rockstar have messed up the economy system in an attempt to maximise Shark Card sales. Unless you wish to spend real money you will have to spam Last Team Standing or Heist missions in order to gain the money required for the games more expensive cars and properties. Don't even get me started on the prices of those yacht's. All that aside real money is needed for the definitive GTA Online experience.+ While I don't mind the more mature aspects of the game a surprisingly high number of people complained about the levels of violence language and sexual content found in the game. To put it simply if you are a Social Justice Warrior or a halfwit who cannot distinguish fiction from reality this game may not be for you.All in all GTA V is a great game. While it has its flaws it is a great experience overall and well worth a purchase.,Grand Theft Auto V

I am constantly hit with Rockstar servers errors that leave you in 8min loading screens. None of this happens in story mode.I am constantly dropped after just jioning a server. Which again can take plus of 5 minutes including rejion.This is all due to Rockstars bad servers and horrible authentication process which takes for ever. Yet I see many MMO's free to play ect that have none of these issues.You are happy to sell this game with online as a key function. And Rockstar happily take your cash on the online store for in game cash BUT with all the billions they have made they cant get good server protocals? tThe joke of all this is Rockstar can code for 360 ect and have stable online. Yet PC as usual gets no love.I have cable internet at 40mbs per second DL and 8mps upload.

Pretty much every mission plays out the same with forgettable side characters and a few (often relatively dated) quips about society. Having been a long time fan of Rockstar games it just feels so soulless compared to their older behemoth titles like San Andreas or Red Dead. Add that to their controversies with modders and hackers and it's really tough to recommend this game. That said the single player campaign isn't so bland it's unplayable and online can be fun if you have people to play with. But between being an almost three year old game and having a strong emphasis on online and microtransactions I'd say it's worth at most $30.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-20,1,1,614,False,Recommended,To start this review off if you guys think Gta V is not worth buying because of the whole summer sale thing. Here's some news. Thats over! Its been over for awhile now and the sale for it wasent bad you were still paying 60 bucks for it and a free 20 doller shark card. So if you dident like it at that time you could maybe like rockstar not adding a free 20 doller shark card and maybe make you buy it yourself. )Now about Gta VPro's Huge area to explore! Gta V is very huge and highly detailed you wont get this if you have it on low settings that means you wont be able to see the small detailes. That dosent mean you wont be mindblown by the huge area's and even the underwater area to explore! Very fun! Even if you have Gta V on the low settings that wont mean that you're not gonna have fun with single player and online. Amazing single player! Gta V singleplayer just took the Grand Theft Auto franchise to awhole new level with just how much you can do now in singleplayer with heist mind blowing missions side missions and the amazing cutscenes! Gta Online! The amazing online mode is back and is just amazing. You get to buy amazing sport cars and just random other cars along with some planes and choppers with some boats too. Besides all these amazing things to buy off of your phone but this isent all. You got missions and heist both really fun to do along with the amazing feeling of finishing a mission and getting your wonderful pay of a load of cash for your spending spree of ammo and at the strip club! Make it rain. Free Dlc! So Rockstar gives us free dlc such as adding new clothes guns and cars to online also giving you the cars for free in singleplayer but the clothes and gun arnt free. For online nothings free such as you cant get the cars guns and clothes for free but at least they arnt making you buy the dlc then buy the cars and such like some other games do.Con's Hackers online. Now we all know about hackers being everywhere online but. but. This problem can be avoided by getting some friends or playing by yourself in a invite only session and that isent bad its pretty fun! Gta V has only been out for 3 months at the moment. So the pc version of Gta V has only been out for 3 months at the moment as we know and that dosent mean the game is gonna be amazing right now but we most likely are gonna have a long time till Gta 6 comes out so that means the game is gonna improve more and more over time.Overall Gta V is a amazing game and Im sure that the game will get better and better overtime with more and more free dlc and more updates.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-19,0,0,26,False,Recommended,Alright let me get this out of the way. GTAV/Online is a great game and I'd say it's worth the full price (Even though the Shark card thing is annoying) However I do have a few issues with the game that I'd like to point out. First the wanted system is a bit annoying in missions. How do they find me when I only have one star and I'm unseeable by the POV they're at? Why am I still wanted after I die? Also the incentive for shark cards is a bit too pushy but it doesn't really matter much to me. Plus the single player plot of GTAV is a bit underwhelming to me and the swimming controls are However the game is fun with or without friends and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes being the antagonist TPS games stealing cars running people over or any serial killers that have a steam account!

2016-10-14,0,0,1132,False,Not Recommended,this game was amazing it was legendary i loved it i spent a 2 years total on this game and a whole 2 months (my entire summer) on it nonstop with one of my friends grinding CEO missions away until i reached lvl200 and earned myself a hydra jet. not to forget to mention i had around 110 friends on there they were all grand and kind to me as i was to them id sometimes even spend days with them individually. and now i will mention honestly i did mod for the following reasons that the community was/still is toxic and earning money took days months even which is then why i only used godmode money drops and other fun stuff to do with friends like flying boats and such nothing harmful i didn't ever bother get in the way of other people playing who dislike modders or because they instantly assume that im one of those who abuse their power. anyway im just going to skip ahead to the point now i've been banned four times on two different accounts. 120 dollars practically down the drain and along with that happening i have of course already promised myself i am not buying this crap anymore because it makes me realize hardcore that the ceo/producers of this game or whomever bans you for stuff are careless and don't actually realize the things you do compared to other people if anything i think they should specifically track whether or not the player is abusing others rather than dropping money or just doing stuff for fun with mods that is harmless. i've seen one way too many that would keep throwing objects on people and blowing them up mindlessly now what i may be saying now might just be useless cause uh F*CK T2 DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ESPECIALY IF YOU THINK YOU'D END UP MODDING IT TO GIVE YOURSELF MORE ENTERTAINMENT.like theres tons of other games out there y'know? gta5 is overrated anyway.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-30,0,0,298,False,Not Recommended,Hours played Xbox360 Over 800 hrs.Xbox One Over 600 hrs.PC Over 200 hrs.Total hours playing GTAV 1400+ Hrs. (Over the span of the games lifetime)I feel I can leave a real review on this game after all the time I have played it. I bought it for the 360 on the midnight release. Once I finally got my Xbox One I bought this game with the system. I got it for PC a few months after it dropped for pc (was waiting for a friend to get it as well.) I have even bought the game for my wife on PC and I have even spent real money buying shark cards. 4 total. Spending a total of about 320$ (roughly) on this game.Pros (Always start with the pros.) The game is just fun I have spent so much time just driving around the world ramping my motorcycle off of EVERYTHING!! Cool vehicles and always adding new ones. Ramp car + Rocket car AWESOME JUMPS! Expansive world there is so much to see and do in the world. Its fun just to stalk around the city and listen to the NPC chatter. Single player Well the first time through it was fun after that it gets kind of boring. Great graphics And it just got better with each system change. YAY PC!! Multiplayer chaos Going on a rampage through the streets with other players is just a fun pass time. Updates There is always something new coming out in this game.Cons Economy WTF Take Two / RockStar ( RS and TT)?? To get the rocket car you must first buy the business building 1.5 mill$ then the special garage to store it in that s another 1.5 mill$ (and these are for the cheapest setups) Now the car becomes available for you to buy at a cost of your first born child and maybe your second (Around 3 4 mil$ if I remember right). And you only get a few thousand $ for doing jobs. So you basically would have to play for 8 hrs a day for almost a month to afford just the ramp car. I understand them wanting to sell the shark cards and all but this is ridiculous. And they wonder why people mod it to get money. Modders Yes I m talking to all of you out there that hack the damn game.. I understand why it is done I even believe there should be specific servers made just for people that want to play modded games however if I am in a live game and someone is just running around with god mode on and killing everyone well that s just annoying and makes me not want to even play the damn game. Server Lag There is and always has ben horrible server lag. In a closed lobby with just myself and my friend we experience massive lag. Just hop in the passenger seat of their car and start shooting at cops. You may be fine for a second but it will defiantly start to lag out on you they will be driving on their screen and you guys will be stopped on yours. This lag has ben following the game from day one. (Here s a random idea Maybe RS and TT should spend some time fixing server issues and optimizing the world a bit better than worrying about how many millions of $ the next car should cost. ECONEMY (Had to state it again) It truly is ridiculous how much they make things cost. Loss of mission payouts Ok so this may need a slight explanation. When farming for money in this game (which is what you find yourself doing more often than not just to get a dumb car) there are only a hand full of missions that pay out around the 20K$ range. If you keep playing those missions after about the 3rd one you will begin to get smaller payouts. They want you to farm for money but if you do they reprimand you for it. Ultimately they really want you to buy the shark cards.There are a few more complaints I have with this game but they are opinion based and I am trying to just state facts for the most part.My over all opinion on this game is this 1400+ hours played and I feel like RS and TT are taking advantage of their player base. This truly is a great game in the sense that it is extremely fun with friends the world is great and there is so much to see and do in it. However with the reality that this game is fully based on the micro transactions of the shark cards has made me stop playing it. This review has nothing to do with the Open IV thing mainly because I have never modded this game. I understand why people are upset about it however I do not feel that should be grounds for this mass uprising against the game creators. I am giving this game a true review on only what RockStar and Take Two have made for and given us. Nothing more.Final grades When game launched 9/10Where the game is now 3/10 (If the game launched with this broken economy I would have never played it in the first place.)God I wish I could be leaving a better review for this game I truly had a lot of fun playing it and spend many sleepless nights in shoot outs with LSPD. But as it stands now I no longer have the time to just farm for months on end just to get one of the new cars. I truly believe if things didn t cost so much in game there would be a lot less modders in multi player. So ultimately Rockstar and Take Two have shot themselves in the foot they brought it on themselves. They just got to greedy with the shark cards.Do I recommend this game?? Not any more....P.S.Let them mod Single player there is no harm in that. I agree they should be banned for modding multi player though Just fix the damn economy.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-16,0,0,194,False,Recommended,"Pros The solo play campaign is rich and rewarding. It challenges you to make judgement calls while also offering difficult game play against outrages odds. All of the characters are fun and definitely offer an escape from reality. Whether you enjoy killing stealing or whoring or a simple game of tennis then this game is for you. You can put off the quests and screw around or do side mission after side mission forever. The ending is a challenge but it allows YOU to make it which I always appreciate in games. Online game play constantly has content updated into it with the ""Free"" launches of ""DLC"". Missions heists criminal activity all added every so often to keep the experience new and fresh. Nonsense EVERYWHERE. You can play with friends or randoms on the very large map. Rarely is their peace between players but the turf wars can be fun. Sometimes you just want to grind your missions and make dough and you keep getting interrupted but that's GTA for you. Rockstar put a TON of time in this game. Their are even TV shows and short films you can watch in the game on your homes TV or cell phone. Cons Solo play is fun but doesn't offer you a realistic expectation of the meat of the game Online. You get rich fast in solo which leads you to believe it'll be the same in online. WRONG. Hackers. Are. Everywhere. Nothing worse than finishing a mission only to be teleported into the sea miles from shore or have aimbotting asshats spawn sniping you until you leave. And if the hacker is kind and gives you dosh report it because Rockstar will punish you and take all your dough and if you spent it it'll be compensated one way or another. Grinding takes forever and rarely will people allow you to do your missions to make money. As a CEO I mostly break even from missions because I'm often stopped my cargo destroyed or vehicles wrecked by other players. You can make solo lobby's through jumping through loops but eventually others will join and it's a hassle to keep remaking. Do stuff with friends and you won't have as big a problem. Content is all the same missions the same and no new heists. Some of the vehicles are great and things look real nice but it's all just resprayed from a previous thing. The Warstock vehicles are all cool though so there is that at least. All and all I give the game a big thumbs up because I've had countless experiences I've enjoyed and still love booting this title with friends to play with. Just don't buy shark cards I've bought this game four times over maybe more with how much in shark cards I've bought.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-06,0,0,75,False,Recommended,It's an R rated episode of The A Team where the 'A' stands for ' '. The campaign's best moments come when your cigar chomping master strategist insane former military pilot and talented driver come together and when you're given the power to choose how to use each of them. These heists are set piece missions where you pick an approach and perform set up tasks in the open world before setting out on the job itself. In the best of them which occur later in the campaign it really does evoke the satisfaction of having a plan come together. Perhaps you position Trevor on the high ground with a rocket launcher Michael on foot with a stealth approach and Franklin in an armoured ram raider. With a button press you can flick between the three dynamically orchestrating a crime caper on your own terms.It is also in these moments that Rockstar's most ambitious storytelling takes place. Your choice of character crew and even certain in game actions have subtle effects on the dialogue. In an early heist a crewmember dropped part of the score but as Franklin I was able to retrieve it a side objective that I'd set for myself but that was subsequently reflected in a later conversation between him and Michael. This is another example of Rockstar's extraordinary attention to detail and if the rest of the campaign respected your agency in this way it might overcome its weaker moments.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-29,1,3,140,False,Not Recommended,If you plan on buying this game remeber everything rockstar does is to make money. They don't care about reputation or about user enjoyment. Meaning every new release every car every in game purchase is designed to cost in game money which they then sell you. Starting this game is practically impossible the best ways to make money start at over a million each and good luck getting that winnning a race grants you a grand or two same with robbing stores. Oh but what about heists? That requires 3 other friends randoms don't help or join you there is never enough people to try your luck at starting heists with the hope random people will join you. Also a complete heist only grants you about 60k so you gotta really work for that money. Maybe you'll just buy a cheap car and not go for the exspensive money making endevors. Well too ing bad. Cheap cars that actually work start at 150k 250k. Plus if you want to change anything about them be prepared to shell out 50k+. This all comes back to shark cards besides cheaters the only resonable way to make money in the game something thats required to enjoy the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-19,0,0,125,False,Recommended,This is one of the best casual games out there. The single player campaign is amazing and will have you invest your emotions heavily on the 3 protagonists. The level of detail and the great performance from the voice actors were the icing on the beautifully crafted cake. Bugs and crashes are extremely rare or almost non existent without modding or strenuous settings. The game would always be fun even after you finish the main campaign and I strongly recommend going through those Strangers and Freaks missions because they're fantastic. On the single player alone 9.5/10Online Mode however suffers from quite a lot of problems. One of the problems being the extremely long unnecessary and idiotic loading screens. You join a new session *enters loading screen* and if the session's full you would have to press return to your own session which you were always in with another loading screen. Playing heists with random players especially new players would be a pain. They ruin the game and then left due to frustration and being punish with... NOTHING. During this process of loading in and redoing the heists there is probably 50% of loading screens which could be easily fixed or removed. If the loading screens aren't the worst cheaters and modders are everywhere literally and they will ruin your experience. Overall I did have fun doing the heists regardless but still often frustrated with the leavers and the loading screens. With those points I've stated I've decide to give this mode a 7/10 and if those problems were rectified it could easily be a 9/10 experience. Final verdict GTA in general is one of the best games there is up to date and you're missing out in life if you haven't finished the campaign and grind the multiplayer. I understand that the targeted audiences are casuals (no offense) and it is an outstanding casual game! I had loads of fun with my friends online and loads of fun with the single player. 8.5/10 Must Own,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-24,1,1,339,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is an incredibly great game after buying 3 seperate copies for Xbox 360 I decided to switch over to the PC master race.I was quite skeptical at first as I knew there was a huge issue with hackers. Other reviewers said there was a 1/3 chance of meeting one. In my entire time playing I have not yet encountered a single hacker since Rockstar has recently been cracking down on them hard.Online is quite a grind but is definitely fun and one of my most favourite experiences.I would check your VRAM and specifications before buying this as this can be quite greedy also causes DirectX 10 graphical issues on ATI cards with black chunks taking up entire portions of the screen. As a developer the graphics as well as the graphical options are one of the most impressive things I have ever seen.TLDR Haven't met a hacker online is fun game is greedy on specs but looks brilliant.,Grand Theft Auto V

Want to get revenge on some guy that killed you? NOPE! GUY LAUGHS SAYS WATCH THIS AND YOUR GAME CRASHES. This is an everyday occurance on GTA V online and it's ruining the game. Rockstar doesn't care about players who play by the rules getting owned by hackers BUT GOD FORBID THESE PLAYERS EVER GET ANY MONEY SPAWNED ON THEM BY A HACKER. After all how is Rockstar going to make money off of shark cards for people who don't want to grind to buy the over priced items in the game? The new import/export expansion prices mad eme laugh. BE WARNED! Grinding while possible will take much longer with the hackers killing everything and using godmode.

2015-08-02,0,0,90,False,Recommended,This game is easily worth the 60 dollars if you have a good enough computer. Everything about this game feels good the combat the driving the flying the tennis everything. Single player has a ton of replayability with all the bonus things you can do plus with the addition of single player trainers it makes the experience so much more enjoyable with the ability to turn into a whale and cause massive amounts of damage after which you visit the strip club as a monkey and online feels with the endless amounts of side jobs at your disposal. If you scroll past reviews you'll see so many negative reviews because of the amount of modders present. They say its incredibly difficult to find a session void of any modders but I have found plenty and when you do it feels great wether just driving around Los Santos going on a tank rampage raiding the military base dicking around with friends heists its just fantastic.This game is currently a 9/10 for me mostly because most of my friends aren't into the pc scene and modders do exist and do ruin the fun to some degree. But this game is easily 10/10 when the whole modding is cleared up and is 11/10 when playing with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's really not that big of an issue. Hackers are kind of an issue though as they have the ability to spawn things in game that could get a legitimate player banned.

2017-06-17,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,"First of all... GTA5 is an absolutely brilliant game and if you care nothing about your own personal security integrity value as a human individual and consumer... then I can recommend GTA5 to you.TLDR (version) We can't allow companies to have legal authority over what we got on our own personal computers and accepting a behaviour like this not only allows it but also promotes it all in the name of making more money.Extensive (version) To everyone else who cares more than to allow greedy companies to step over you... do not EVER buy any ANY Take Two interactive game ever again until they have come out with a formal apology AND have gone back on the Cease and Desist (I don't even know if that's possible to do but never the less a requirement) to allow extensive singleplayer modding back into the game again.Here's why That OpenIV got taken down is not the biggest deal in the world all things considered you can still mod your game but the mods that used that can't be used anymore and will have to use other tools instead. More of a hassle but in the grand scheme of things... this is not the big deal.This is...If Take Two's way to make their own content more popular than that of other people's content that is 100% within' the realms of legal proceedings to modify your own VERSION of the game... if that's being targeted as an illegal action that demonstrates just how far they are willing to prevent additional content being developed that doesn't push a money making machine down people's throats.What if let's say a multiplayer only vehicle gets introduced to the game that is not available in the singleplayer and the only way to get it in the multiplayer is through a repetition of actions that's designed to be as drawn out as possible ... that is subject to unfair treatment of a consumer as nothing else but cash for grab essentially.Let's say another area gets introduced or another set of modes or whatever gets introduced to the online game. Take Two is perfectly within' reason both able and legally correct to take down anyone who messes with a product that's for sale in the game if it is made... It isn't within' their legal right to ban what we got on our computers tho' that's where they fall short.Let me put this another way then...Let's say you buy a product that's accessable online. With this product you receive a launcher. In order to get access to the online product you need to pay a set fee after booting up the launcher.ALL of this you have agreed on so everyone's fair and everyone's happy.However... an update comes along and changes without your permission the launcher on your computer not the getting to the online program that you agreed to pay for. So now you need to pay whenever you boot up your computer because the launcher you got on your computer would be technically be for the company who handles the ONLINE aspect...This may look muddy but this is essentially what it is Take Two has every right to protect their own products that they sell no sane person argues against that. You can argue that they sell it at a fair price or not that's not the point... the point is that when Take Two does NOT sell a product that they have made available they can't change that. They can't be in charge over what we got on OUR computers PHYSICALLY over something that we otherwise have to intentionally log onto THEIR servers to access THEIR PHYSICAL information.It is within' their legal reason but the problem is that if we simply allow this to go on the absurd example I stated where a company all of a sudden have legal authority over what we got ON OUR OWN PERSONAL COMPUTERS ... that's far more feasible as a direct result. It is an extreme case yes but this is where we are heading if we allow Take Two to continue like this or any other company for that matter!Update Yay they did stuff with OpenIV huzzah' now to take down the negative reviews... right? no.Here's why one should STILL state that the game cannot under any circumstance including that of Take Two's other products or hell even Rockstar's for that matters...They have only stated 'They are working with OpenIV'... how are they working with it? Yah' it works. Wonderful everything's happy am'i'rite?They stated ""Mods that does not infringe on copyright claims"" that's oddly specific don't you think? I mean theoretically if one bought GTA 5 and updates came to the Online section but not singleplayer section and it was INTENTIONALLY unavailable to the singleplayer section and the only way to get to it...Is 'that' gonna be a way they will use this particular line? How about the number of mods that have names like 'Force mod' can you have Force Powers in the game just because its called 'Force'? How about you make a cardgame in the singleplayer section and you name it something with 'Scrolls' in it?Point is... they haven't fixed jack they have given out a statement that's designed to damage control their up. It is NOW one HAS TO hold 'em by their throats or else more t will occur.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,Abysmal online cheat protection. Not only did I very frequently see players with invincibility impossilby high ranks and infinite money but actively saw cheaters instant kill everyone in the server and do other such things that affect players other than themselves.With this said I myself was banned and had my character reset for reasons unknown. I had never cheated on my character and while I had accidently gotten into a game where someone immediately ranked me up 50 times and/or started dropping money on my head I immediately left. My character was imported from the Xbox 360 version and as you might notice I do not have a lot of time logged on the PC version. Quite a bit of it in fact is in single player mode which...Has quite a few issues. Primarily with an impossibility to complete or even see certain levels. Troubleshooting didn't do much to help and creating a new playthrough would fix some while others remained. Effectively removing my ability to complete the game. One such issue was very early on in the game right after unlocking Michael. No missions would appear and even after hours of fooling around reading and attempting to force them to unlock the missions would not appear. Again inability to complete the game. Some of this is fixed but I do not intend to play again just to run into another one down the line.Back to online microtransactions absolutely destroy any sort of pacing in the game. Races that allow custom cars (which every single host allows) you will see people with maxed or at least significantly faster/better cars than you simply because they have a higher level. This isn't necessarily because of microtransactions but... even if you have a car in a class completely maxed you simply cannot compete with someone who bought an extremely expensive car with microtransactions. There is a motorcycle that costs 50 real dollars. One single motorcycle. It's not even that good. Outrageous. Some things in the online mode would cost over a hundred real dollars it's simply outrageous. The amount of real dollars you have to spend to buy anything at all is insane. Clearly Rockstar just wants you to spend more money more often by making things very expensive and not giving you much for your real money.Lastly the whole issue we see now with mods and Take2. I'm not going to get into this but it's stupid. They do not care about their players and their interests at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

However it's where all the new vehicles and other toys are. Thankfully you can get a trainer and spawn those things into the singleplayer to enjoy without having to fork over your hard earned cash.GTA Online was the worst thing to happen to this franchise and I fear for its micro transaction fueled future.

2017-06-18,0,0,235,False,Not Recommended,"I've owned and played every major Grand Theft Auto game since GTA 2 in 1999. It has been one of my favorite series as long as I have played video games. And now here I am writing a review for GTA V the supposed biggest and best one yet. I got this game in 2013 on release day for PS3. I bought it again for PS4. I bought it on sale a third time for PC. I know this game and this series very very well.I'll lay my point down right away. I don't recommend this game because I don't like what Rockstar has done with the series as a result. The game itself works. You can buy it you can play it. You can play the story and be entertained for 20 hours or so. GTA Online is an absolute trainwreck of half baked ideas and terrible execution topped with what feels like zero effort to combat cheaters.They made very clear what kind of market this game was aimed at. The story is considerably shorter than other games in the series for a start. My first playthrough in which I took my time explored and did side missions was over in roughly 18 hours. GTA IV has an achievement for completing its main story in 20 hours.The characters are not relatable. They are meant to be spectacles. The writing is at times shallow and inconsistent. If that's not what you're interested in playing GTA then that won't bother you.The entire game has pacing issues and arbitrary limitations. The story has a handful of invisible ""checkpoints "" before which chunks of content are cut off. You aren't really rewarded for exploring the world in the way of weapons that you'd normally be unable to buy or unique vehicles. Some vehicles have a decent number of customization options some don't with no real explanation why. You can't make any decent money outside of the set piece heists in the story even though there is an emphasis on spending money as you see fit.A selling point is that this game has the most vehicles and the most weapons of any GTA game to date. It's a shame that all of them feel the same. All of the cars and trucks with exceptions I can count on one hand feel exactly the same. The sports cars accelerate a bit faster. That's about it. The weapons all feel the same and unfortunately that feeling is unsatisfying. All the guns share the same generic modernized look sound weak and don't handle differently enough from one another to develop a personal loadout. Every pistol feels the same every assault rifle and machine gun feels the same etc. It's filler.Little bits of gameplay mechanics were added that had absolutely no place in a game like this. Things like cars explode if you land too hard in a game famous for stunting and screwing around with cars. Needlessly frustrating things like trying to walk down a slope then losing control as you ragdoll like you're having a stroke not getting up until you come to a complete stop or eventually die. If you die in a cool way you don't get to see the aftermath you get your wasted message in slow mo and off you go.The music selection isn't outright terrible but it's considerably smaller. You will get tired of it soon even if you listen to multiple stations. The ""original score"" isn't bad either but it's rather bland.The single player game has its flaws but that is the reason you should buy this game if at all. The official multiplayer is a truly awful experience. I'll keep my reasons why brief It is not fair it is not maintained or moderated it is not well connected and it is not rewarding.Chances are if you're someone who isn't new to the series you've been through it all already and you're reading the reviews to catch up on the latest drama or look for people who feel the same way you do. If you are reading this as a review though I encourage you to look elsewhere. I would recommend Saints Row as a more enjoyable sandbox/shooter to this. I would recommend Mafia II as an infinitely better written game with a similar style of play. Hell I'd recommend any GTA prior though the old ones have technical issues these days.I regret buying this three times over.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,As somebody that enjoys mods like the rest of this community that has been responding this way they have this response coming.There is a fine line between mods and hacks modding is adding stuff to the game that Rockstar haven't added or won't. This gives the community a nice way of having flexability with their purchases without hurting others. The mods are said to be one of the biggest drives for this game and in the end it probably is. I remember buying GTA IV just to play the mods and I bought this game wanting to play some of those mods if they got updated.Coming from another perspective I program a lot. I started to get into programming mods for GTAV and it may have been rather annoying at times I really enjoyed adding things and changing things that I never really liked or thought I could make better myself. The ability to do that made me have so much fun and try to get other people to come and play my mods and see how they worked for them.Basically your little mod crackdown has ed up your community and its only going to get worse if you keep going. Listen to your community modders arent the ones that are ruining the multiplayer we are the ones that just want to add stuff for fun.

Rockstar nailed it again with another masterpiece recreating a world which is set apart from the others Los Santos a city full to the brim with sunny weather curvy girls and colorful atmosphere but also with crime corruption and people struggling to get out of the ghettos and make something of themselves. The graphics and gameplay are superb and the story though pretty short is exactly what makes this game a living legend. Plus the combination between an aspiring robber a sociopathic used to be robber and a terrifying but lovable psychopath makes for a truly comical experience that satirizes the American stereotypes.All in all a great game. 11/10 would kill Devin Weston again.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-01,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,Be warned this is a subjective review and has less to do with how the game is now and more to do with how good I feel it could have been. Unless you are only interested in multiplayer which I have no interest in what so ever be warned Rockstar has shown no interest that I have seen in doing anything for the singleplayer side of things since GTA Online released. This is sad because many of the updates to multiplayer would have been awesome and added depth to some aspects of singleplayer without breaking the game. Unfortunately we may never see any of that wonderful Rockstar DLC for singleplayer GTA V and this honestly leaves me feeling ripped off. You can add the recent flap between Open IV and Take Two to my list of grievences.The last thing I want to mention is in the Xbox 360 version you can play around with the Online only cars in Story Mode for free this is not possible on PC that I have figured out without mods and we shouldn't need mods to add a feature that was on a more than 10 year old console.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-18,0,0,269,False,Recommended,So... I got into PC Gaming at the end of the 90's when 3D games were just coming into existence.... I remember my 1st purchased &amp installed graphics card was a 3dfx Voodoo 3 2000 PCI card. It was one of the 1st 3D graphics cards that could also do 2D graphics too..... But It was also a time when I remember discovering the original GTA... which wasn't 3D but took my attention away from the fps's of the time.We would play it after school at a friends house using 2 networked computers back when everybody else was playing it on the original Playstation to deathmatch against each other. Jacking peoples cars shooting them in the tiny tiny pixelated face and running from the Po po at high speeds splattering pedestrians and slamming into everything because the top down view was redonkulous and hard to handle at high speeds.... Then as I got older I went through GTA II 3 and Vice City but then I kind of fell off of the face of the earth for a few years....When I came back to PC gaming I was starting to attend school for a degree in IT. So I built a nice rig &amp started collecting/playing games again. I played a lot of games and ended up at 4 main games I would play... World of Tanks Skyrim Simcity 4 and SpinTires. But.... one day that all changed as GTA V was released &amp a fellow IT co worker bought me GTA V while I was recovering from surgery on the day it was released! At that moment after completing the massive massive download (only complaint but it's not really a complaint) When I fired it up (in more ways than 1 ) ) and loaded into GTA V in full HD with settings maxed out completely a long dormant passion awoke inside of me.... As I was car jacking sports cars &amp running from the cops while shooting pedestians in the face &amp then powerbreaking it and lighting up the tires on their lifeless bodies afterwards... I discveredd that I actually was experiencing real true fun again real enjoyment from experiencing this video game that was unhindered and innocent in nature. It took me back to those days growing up and playing against others but so much beter than it was back in the day.... It was just a hilariously fun and entertaining experience that really satisfied my hunger for dark humor violence great music and all the other unmentionalbe things that this game allows. So I have to say thank you to the guys at Rockstar for making a game that is actually fun in fact more fun than I've had in years when it comes to gaming!So to summarize everything above... I have to say.Buy it steal some cars then get some weapons then it's all fun in the sun after that..... for you not the citizens of the game that will be terrorized by your very existence as you decimate them over the course of your adventures.Good times,Grand Theft Auto V

Unfortunately while Rockstar Games is known for releasing some top notch titles its track record with porting its games to PC hasn t been stellar.When Grand Theft Auto IV came out for the PC platform back in 2008 about eight months after the console version it was criticized as a poor port at the time. Suffering from performance issues and requiring users to be signed in to Windows Live to save their progress it frustrated many users in many ways that its console counterparts did not. Though the PC version has some superior aspects as well. The same can be said about Grand Theft Auto V to some extent.But we ll get to that later on in the review.Read the rest of the review over at Hot Hardware http //hothardware.com/reviews/grand theft auto v gameplay and performance review is the pc version the definitive one,Grand Theft Auto V

This is PC gaming we can add anything. This game died when it came out for next gen consoles to be honest the DLC has broken the game and made it pay2win. So sad that this game has come this way.

2017-06-17,0,0,221,False,Not Recommended,I have incredibly mixed feelings about this game. The Single player experience in this game is the most detailed complete open world in gaming Not the mention this game is absolutely gorgeous. But like if you went to a restaurant and ordered a 80$ steak it doesn t matter how absolutely amazing it is you won t enjoy it at all if the chef takes a huge steaming on your plate. That s what TakeTwo has done they have done everything in their power to alienate as many people as possible for profit. For example they have placed a huge amount of supposedly free content behind a paywall while some argue that all the content can be purchased with in game currency it is still highly impractical as the amount of time to make that money is asinine. You have to grind and grind and grind to afford anything. It you take months of playing 10 hours a day to unlock all the content and don t mistake that for replayability you will play the same ten or so missions again and again doing the same thing over and over. At this point it s no longer fun it s a job. And if you consider you can make 100000$ in game an hour and 100000 in game dollars is worth 2.99 CAD you are making less then minimum wage. It would be more efficient to get a job a job just to pay for GTA currency. If that does not sound absolutely ing ridiculous then you need help. But it doesn t stop there. Why would TakeTwo stop there there are still pennies left to pinch at our expense. A huge facet of not just GTA5 but also its Predecessors GTA4 and Episodes from Liberty city is its modding community. Modding kept GTA4 and it permutations relevant for half a decade after release. A huge part of this modding scene was the good folks at OpenIV who created the software to mod that game. But these dedicated coders also made modding in GTA5 a possibility. This team has being working on this as a passion project for nearly a decade. But in this last Week Good ole Take Two decided there would be no fun aloud and sent a cease and desist letter to the OpenIV team. While what they were doing was covered under fair use the costs of a court battle would have been astronomical and they decided it was not worth the time and money to fight. Just like that TakeTwo took their first steps toward killing the modding of their game. Their reasoning was that the tool would allow hackers to ruin the experience of other players. What TakeTwo refuses to see though is that hackers will find a way they will always find a way. Modders will give up if the feat is too great but hackers never will. Hackers have plagued this game since launch and instead of fixing it for the good players they take more way from them. A good example would be a school teacher who sees a student kicking sand in another students face so they just give detention to everyone except the offender also they expel the student who had sand kicked at them. If you were in that school you would be wouldn t you? Take two has done everything they can to alienate their audience. This used to be a masterpiece but even the Mona Lisa would be worthless if you and all over it. I m terrified to see the absolutely horrific monetization they will inevitably role out for RD2. This game is amazing but it s not worth it. The enjoyment of playing is not worth knowing you re paying TakeTwo to the game up worse. TakeTwo Has cemented themselves as the second worse gaming publisher of the last few years. The fact that they are so close on the heels of Konami scares me. Why are these companies racing to the bottom of the pile? What Treasure do they expect to find down there? I don t know what s going through their minds but I know one thing at the bottom of that ..It s just more,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-21,0,0,621,False,Not Recommended,Ive played GTA V for well over 2000 hours across xbox 360 PS3 and PC. having purchased 2 copies for PS3 one for 360m and one for PC I can certainly say I love the game. but take 2 has really crossed the line this time. They have been ing with the game for the worse for years raising prices and pushing their shark cards and they are destroying the company. But now banning OpenIV a piece of software created to mod OFFLINE GTA has dropped to a new low and I myself wont stand for it. They have gotten to be so petty as to ban offline mods thinking it will bolster their online sales for their extremely overpriced content that I personally don't believe is anywhere near worth it. If you want GTA don't bother it isn't worth it anymore take 2 has destroyed what was once an amazing thing.**EDIT**Even with OPEN IV coming back some they still screwed up and they havent met all promises from the past such as single player DLC and the prices are still too insanely high. The game will always have a place in my heart but i cant bring myself to recommend it at this time.,Grand Theft Auto V

You're not stealing cars you're getting banned for making mods or using them if you prefer.Your only attack is this embarrassing dinky little punch which can't harm anything unless it's right up in your Or should I say your car's not your that's riding in the car.

I might as well just leave it at ""It's bad."" But the truth is it's even worse. At least we could check out the ending. ""They arrive safely in Los Santos and a gangster visits Michael.""(The game returns to the title screen.)And... that's it? Did anything else happen? Did the gangster say anything? Did the sight of the gangster make Michael sick in his stomach? Did the car stalk them in their sleep? What HAPPENED? I assumed that I pressed the button by mistake and actually cancelled the rest of the ending but no I've actually beaten the game multiple times just to try and solve this mystery and the SAME THING HAPPENS! It just stays on this screen until you press something and it returns you to the main menu.But I'm aware the last screen is supposed be playing text that says ""Give your money to Rockstar "" but I'm not seeing it so I'm assuming I'm supposed to beat all 5 games to see the true ending and I'm not going through all that trouble.

People already payed (not cheap) 50 bucks for the game. It's on their own to mod it at their will. As for online gaming experience. Easy! just separate 2 multiplayer rooms one where modding is allowed and another one for people who just want to play the plain game. I'm just saying at the end of the day these are the people who give you the money right? So just let them do what they want.

2017-11-26,0,0,251,False,Not Recommended,TL DRRockstar is greedy since they force people to pay cash or grind to get cool stuff. Many hackers do a service to people by providing a shortcut to grinding and having fun with players. The game was pretty boring after 240 hours of grinding so I became a hacker so I could have fun with my friends on a private server. The regular game wasnt fun so the only way to have a good time was to cheat. I got permanently banned anyways. A server for banned players would be really nice so everyone could still have a good time. Give me your thoughts and I urge you to use constructive critisism. )250 hours put into this game specifically the online mode... My experience was a mix of fun frustration boredom and excitment.I had plenty of fun roaming around killing people doing stunts goofing off with friends completing new missions racing and experimenting with the latest DLCsFrustration came in when missions took many tries to complete when I still didnt have nearly enough money to buy new items after hours of grinding and when players and cheaters would constantly keep killing you for fun especially when those players are using vehicles that I cant nearly affordBoredom came in when I am forced to grind one specific mission for hours and hours on end just to save up cash for a new vehicle I wantI got excited when ever something cool happens. For instance I could have landed a cool stunt or I finally got to buy and use that vehicle I saved up for or I finally killed that player that keeps killing me over and over again or when a hacker gives me millions and millions of dollarsI will be brutally honest i was one of those plebs that would always follow a hacker around and do what he said until he gave me money. It is the best shortcut to getting those awesome vehicles that everyone else has. Grinding and grinding was not worth it after a while. Buying money with real cash is definetly not worth it. Having fun and screwing around in Gta V is the fun part and unfortunatly rockstar forces everyone to spend hours on end to be able to have fun and screw around with things like jets and helicopters. People who buy shark cards dont have to spend a second on missions to get those items. I would be sooo happy when I finally got to buy the expensive cars but i couldnt have obtained them without hackers. The hours and hours I spent grinding really wasnt worth it at all. It took a few minutes to obtain millions from a hacker as opposed to only obtaining a few hundred thousand after many many hours of straight grinding a single boring mission out. IMHO the hackers that give people money are great. They stick their middle fingers up at Rockstar and give people cash so they dont have to grind or buy shark cards. I doubt anyone wants to grind hours and hours of boring missions and im sure everyone would rather get money for free rather than buy it from shark cards. The hackers that like to simply have fun and use their cheats to have fun with people are also great! These hackers dont run around killing people instantly with explosions they do stuff like drive people around in a flying car. The point of a game is to have fun and these hackers are doing just that. They are also sticking up their middle fingers at Rockstar because they are saying that they dont have to pay money or grind to have a good time in Gta V.It is the hackers that are running around killing everybody and making things impossible for everyone that deserve to be banned and punished. These hackers do nothing but make the game unfun for everyone so they ruin the point of the game.So after around 240 hours of grinding screwing around and gaining money from hackers I decided to get my own cheats. Yep I am owning up to the fact that i became a hacker in Gta V. The thing is that I didnt even touch a public lobby I simply went into a private lobby with my friend so we could have a good time. We did things like teleport around and drive vehicles at the speed of light shoot exploding bullets at cars. We gave ourselves all the expensive vehicles and had an absolute blast. It is funny because this is the most fun we have had on Gta V in a very very long time. Now I could have always just gone into the single player and installed mods and hacks there but I couldnt play with my friends there. I had no choice but to play in private lobbies in order to play with my friends.Unfortunatly all good things come to an end. In the middle of me and my friend teleporting to Mt Chiliad with the phantom wedge I got the sad message that I had been permanently banned. My level 98 character was deleted. My 250 hours of gameplay was wasted. It is what it is. I could say that I had deserved it because I was hacking online and many people would say that. I wasnt mad at this however because in all honesty most of that 250 hours was just grinding missions. Most of that 250 hours was pointless to begin with. I didnt technically earn most of my vehicles anyways. I am only sad because I lost a high level character and I can no longer play with my friends. I could care less about being banned from online play with other people I just want to screw around with my friends.I would honestly recommend Gta V for its online multiplayer if it wasnt for the fact that you are going to be forced to grind or pay cash in order to have fun in the end. No body wants to spend real hard earned cash on in game money. No body wants to spend hundreds of hours of their precious life constantly grinding the same mission over and over again. If you want to get a sense of good fun in Gta V Online with friends you are unfortunatly going to have to cheat. If you have no friends stick to single player. But if you are like me and just want to have fun with friends you need to cheat. The crazy number of fun cheats you can use to have a great time is well worth it. Unfortunatly Rockstar doesnt approve of fun. Rockstar will ban you and make you suffer if you dare have fun on their watch. If all you want to do is have a ton of fun with your friends Rockstar will punish you with a ban. Simple as that. So no I do not recommend Gta V Online because it is just a waste of time unless you enjoy grinding. Many people are banned for having fun in this game which is unfortunate but I have a solution to that problem.Rockstar should make servers specifically for banned players. This would make everyone happy. Cheaters get to play with cheaters but at least they get to play the game. At least players wrongfully banned could still play the game. At least players who just want to have fun could still have fun. These servers for banned players wouldnt have any regulation on cheats so players are free to cheat all they want. Players could still join private lobbies with friends if they choose to not be bothered by other cheaters. This would make Gta V Online worth playing IMHO. Players who want to stay legit will be in the unbanned servers. Players who want to cheat and have fun will stay in the banned player servers.And feel free to bash me all you want about me cheating. I dont think I can be mad about being banned because it was risky but i dont regret anything. I knew the risks of hacking and did it anyway. I gave plenty of good reason in this review for me to cheat and hack. Tell me your thoughts i just prefer you use constructive critisism. )BTW I have never played the single player campaign so I cant officially say anything about it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-27,0,0,1036,False,Not Recommended,"A great game but won't recommend it. I have 2 reasons 1. (Minor reason) I pre ordered the game for $50 and I got in game money for Story mode and Online.Guess what? Summer sale is here and the game is $47.61 (cheaper of course) but they will get more in game money for Online. Is that fair for people that pre ordered? I think it's a terrible joke.2. (Main reason) The game is full of hackers modders and cheaters. You will either find 'hackers' with all the best vehicles (even flashing vehicles) or story mode only vehicles. Or you'll find 'hackers' with god mode on so you won't be able to kill them and they will usually grief killing you nonstop. Or you'll find 'hackers' that spawns all kinds of vehicles (even UFOs) and they will give you lots of in game money which ruins the economy ._.So you'll spend a lot of time trying to find a 'good' server with no hackers but you won't find any. And you'll end up in a server with at least 2 hackers and you'll go into passivo mode everytime they approach you but they won't be able to kill you so they'll get mad and they will crash your game and... more time wasted.Check for the latest updates and if Rockstar hasn't got rid of the hackers (they should say it in announcements) then DON'T BUY IT.Are you wondering why I have so many hours? I don't play with randoms just with friends and I enjoy story mode too.EDIT Rockstar posted this on the News tab ""Rockstar rolls out new cheat detection systems in GTA Online.""Since then I haven't seen any difference. Hackers/Modders are still in every lobby. And also I've noticed that the game crashes more often at random times.EDIT2 Rockstar has a new system for detecting cheats. It's not true the only difference is that if you find hackers/modders they won't spawn stuff anymore or drop money they'll just grief you with auto aim.EDIT3 Still playing and they really don't care about hackers. Hackers own GTA V Online. I don't think they get banned. The horrible part is that Rockstar takes away all your money (your legit money) just so they can get rid of all the hacked money.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-03-21,0,0,155,False,Recommended,GTAV is one of the best games I've ever played both for single player and for multiplayer with friends. The story alone is enough to warrant anyone on the fence about this game. Its fun with but interesting characters cool missions great combat and one of the best stories I've gotten to play though in my years of gaming. The multiplayer aspect of the game is really amazing as well as long as you have a few friends to play it with. At the time I'm doing this review having a corporation or a motorcycle club are both really cool ways to enjoy the game and sink a few hours into. For me personally the crown jewel of the multiplayer is the inclusion of heists. Heist are pretty similar to the ones found in the single player story and aside from one or two independent missions they are all excellent and definitely worth playing.,Grand Theft Auto V

From pre order last year playing up to now has been a whole year past the total time 575h+ I and many many have abandoned pits and semi abandoned pits or has not abandoned pits of old players together witness the myth of a game industry is how to step by step to go extinct.If it is the first half of the year I will give the game from because whether the screen operation world view play are impeccable even beyond my expectations of the GTA series. It is one of the best optimization my notebook is usedI7+GT755m graphics card 8G memory still can drive in the high quality picture frames basically didn't have 40 frames.Half a year ago right is half a year ago plug and anti plug in mechanism let it all began to change.When I was a new one I often get rid of PVP enthusiasts then I think if you can use the plug to kill him. Later the technology has been improved to no longer have a similar idea but someone actually put this idea into reality. I don't know what time to start the war in the public began to brush money invincible even gods of war. In other players these people are disturbing the environment of the game bugs and once had the idea of hanging out I only see a group of losers carnival.The plug in is more and more rampant that never experience large scale online games operator R star began to rectify the occasion to hang on the wall. Yes I said occasion because r star treatment find a few jump very powerful guy ban for 15 days and put out.That is quite a long period of time game player is only through the Forum on the wall.Later the activities of the hanging wall began to lose control R star finally realized that the existence of external stores will not only affect the player's gaming experience but also affect their income. For example the DAYZ next door is a living example. R star operator shot forehead decided to design aAnti hang system thrown into the game.Since then my game frame has not been 30.R star method is very rough anti external plug in system detected all players are banned. However this system can not only detect the wall hanging wall but also detect the hanging wall brush money kill and even with the task of normal players. The foot step ahead hang also gradually evolvedOut of the anti detection mechanism so the anti plug R star turned into Anti players many players shouted to be mistaken that is the reason. And anti external plug in because of a considerable number of computing resources occupied making the game has been very smooth experience also appeared Caton a so called God of the game Caton began to lose frame which represents what?Because r star as a plug in rampant occupied forum declared hanging open degrees of innocence in the first half of this year I do not know have many players are broken heart in anti cheat system card to even alone are not playing silently deleted the game select theAbandoned pit. As I play now from the GTA2 R star idiotic powder make sure not to delete the game of anger. Rao is so from January this year to the present I have not been on the game for a long time.Two days ago I idle on line to play for a while. Because of fear of being a star recently R then spread to the ban I saw no one friend of war. Sit in the empty Ferris wheel overlooking the empty city suddenly feel noseAcetify. Not long ago my friends and I are still for the completion of the summit challenges make every effort to a sudden inspiration racked their brains. Now the friends I know have deleted the game or have not been on the game for a long time. Still adhere to the gameOf the people already left me one.Sorry the year before I came to Los Shengdu I never wrote this comment. If it is that time I will probably write 1 of the game is very strong 2 exquisite picture 3 online is fun and so on down to turn ten of the review areaNine of the evaluation bar. But now......By the end of the sentence with the white.GTA5 what no matter what.Because there is no more content it is worth to play.Absolutely empty friends and war was not needed.Because no one has been able to play together.Now R should be desperate for Chinese players.R star technology how high you can not consider the game to stop for a week.This week you work overtime to improve security to those permanently disappeared!After you do this you will not want to make money after the R star.,Grand Theft Auto V

ALMOSTEven after it have been out for about 2 years it's still a huge buggy mess. I can't really imagine those bugs being releated to just the PC version.Heists are barely even working sometimes resulting you having to restart the game. If I'm right heists are a quite recent update after about 5 retries I finally completed the first heist without having the game bugging out for me.Other than heists stores sometimes don't spawn in time physics glitches etc. etc.And yea a huge memory leak issue which I still think is there.

Because it's really fun and if I can enjoy a game at such low frames than you should be able to enjoy it at 30+.

Games of old (enemy territory call of duty etc) all used a similar cheat system called punk buster which worked great but Rockstar seem unable write such an anti cheat system to control whats going on in their servers which seems ludicris considering the game they have actually written and theres no point in playing the game until something is done about it which is a shame as i dont believe Rockstar really care about the problem.,Grand Theft Auto V

I don't regret it but it's definitely taught me to be very cautious about AAA games.The singleplayer is fantastic being able to switch between three different characters at once is great the missions are great and the overall gameplay is great as well. The game is in my opinion worth the price for the singleplayer alone.And that is good because GTA Online could have been a lot better. Progress is slow for every level you gain you will only unlock one or two things that you actually care about. Also purchasing vehicles for your garages is disproportionally expensive (a mediocre sports car from the '70s costs $400 000) compared to what the missions earn you (completing the last and most expensive heist at the heighest difficulty will earn at most $1 250 000 split across four players). Rockstar have done this so that they can sell you shark cards. Yeah. Microtransactions that go up to 75 in a 60 title. Moreover the servers are filled with hackers who can be very annoying. Some will just give players money but a lot of them have only found creative ways to annoy you or make the game unplayable for you.Besides the fact that GTA V's PC port is much better than that of GTA IV doesn't mean that Rockstar Games are finally fully supporting the PC as a platform they are still doing everything they can do to make modding the game more difficult and the Ill Gotten Gains Part 2 update objectively made the game run poorer (I myself have experienced the framerate dropping from 60fps all the way down to 14 in certain situations since the last update).So in conclusion the singleplayer is great and probably worth the price Online definitely isn't and don't expect Rockstar to support you and the other PC gamers. They still don't.,Grand Theft Auto V

But the worst thing is... It is a ant colony for hackers and those who ruins the community and games Cons Hackers will ruin the immersion R* intended us to feel. Hackers kill you on sight. Afterwards spam killing you (Hacker's best) 5% chance of meeting nice people depends... People who suck at doing heist or ruin the heist intentionally.

2018-01-11,0,0,264,False,Not Recommended,Reason for me writing the review is not cause i dislike playing the game including Online. In Story Mode the game doesnt have any major issues from what I have experienced the problem and the reason for this negative review and why I don't recommand this game if you are someone who is like me and likes playing online to the point where this is the first game I have ever bothered with making a review of. Reasons Why online is Not Recommanded1. The game has so many issues with online and R* don't even bother or care for the players to even fix them and these issues have stayed for years.2. Major connections issues chances that you will even manage to get into a lobby of a heist or any other jobs is low. in which you will just get stuck in a loading screen and will have to restart the game and wait for it to take forever to load up as for me its around 5mins to connect to online servers.3. Being spammed by your own ******* phone. For no reason at all you get calls constantly about the same thing. Trying to get you to buy things or do things you will have no interest in. (Would be nice to have a setting to turn them off) they dont ofcourse4. Hackers... So many in which you have to deal with getting teleporting getting killed constantly any time you spawn being camped and can't anything about it since they can't be killed. You can just join another sessions but there is going to be another hacker in which most of the time go through the same thing. So from my judgement if you are planning on getting this game for its online mode in which mine and many other reviews will warn you on is to NOT GET THIS GAME. R* gives zero and will not change the game to make it playable and one can not expect any support from them.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-02,0,0,362,False,Not Recommended,"I got this game because I knew it was going to be fun and because I've played it on my other consoles.The game was very very fun until I found out that people that do glitches go into wall breaches and many other things count as being a cheater.Now prior to this I did go into a few wall breaches and then yesterday I go into GTA start playing it and what I didn't realise was that I had a few reports to my name as people thought I was hacking/modding.I played the game for about an hour and then I ended up getting a notification saying ""We are now tracking you as a possible cheater. Start behaving yourself"". What I don't get is if they wanted us to stop going into the glitches all they had to do was patch them maybe just by adding an extra wall behind the glitches instead of saying to us that glitching counts as cheating and you will be banned for it like come on Rockstar yes it is a good game but you need to start being a little more serious and think before you do something maybe try and listen to what the players are saying a little more instead of hiding in your shells and doing your own little things to make the game so strict.Yes glitching is bad but when you state that it now counts as cheating like come on.First we did nothing wrong.Second if you want us to stay out of glitches then patch them.Third in my opinion this is just really really stupid as people are getting banned for Rockstar's issues.If they're trying to stop people from playing the game then go a head but seriously stop being pathetic and actually fix the issues instead of ruining the game for everyone.That's not my only issue with the game I also am against the reporting system.Some of us players are people that don't actually cheat yet we get reported a few times then get banned.Like where is the logic in that.A lot of Rockstar's things don't make any sense and it is becoming too much.At this point I really don't know why they even bother working on GTA if they're not going to do it properly.Not saying I could do a better job but I could atleast fix the issues in the game.Honestly it's not that hard to do a few simple fixes.In my opinion it is a good game until you play the game for a while and realise how bad things are getting just because of a few simple glitches that they cannot seem to fix.",Grand Theft Auto V

You will have a hard time being able to afford anything in game (All good cars being over $1 000 000)Hackers fill the games of Online and can cause you to be banned as well (As if they will ever get banned)Which makes the game annoying to play online because of random deaths or being scared to get money and being banned for it. (And yes. Giving yourself money or getting money from a hacker can and will get you banned now. The idea that not putting it in the in game bank will keep you from being banned is no longer an option with their improvements to the game) But if the hackers aren't nice to just hand out money you can die every 3 seconds and not be able to find a new session or go Passive mode.If you have friends that have it I do suggest getting it and playing it an invite only session. If not Good luck.(This review is coming from someone who has been banned 2 times because hackers decided to give me money. 3rd time I quickly left the session and reported it right away that helped me not be banned but it's still a big issue),Grand Theft Auto V

Gun running was a joke so many differernt forms of anti air vehicles and weapons yet they all suffered from the same thing the homing launcher did.(I.E jets being able to out run the missile by flying in a circle at top speed.) making best thing coming from the update to use agenst air units is now explosive rounds for the heavy sniper rifle. while also simply making flight or driving around in unarmoured cars annoying.,Grand Theft Auto V

The changes in agriculture significantly altered and changed global populations. The most significant immediate impact of the Columbian Exchange was the cultural exchanges and the transfer of people between continents.The new contact between the global population circulated a wide variety of crops and livestock which supported increases in population in both hemispheres although diseases initially caused precipitous declines in the numbers of indigenous peoples of the Americas.

2018-03-05,0,0,382,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR... Stay far far away from this POS game (Unless that is if you're playing the story mode thats alright i guess). As for the online mode... If you hold even the faintest spec of self respect in you left you will leave this game alone. This review is aimed at the mode i like and play the most The Heists for further references i'm pretty sure you can find a fitting review further below.Now that being said sadly i don't think i'll stop playing this game any time soon. It is extremely addictive and borderline venomous you won't notice how many hours of your life will be wasted away in it it's got a very special type of charisma that lures you into a trap from which you'll most likely never come out.GTA V online has some of the most fantastic gameplay i've ever experienced in an open world online videogame. Perform jobs and missions with friends or randoms online to earn a pretty penny form part of a crew to execute ""meticulously"" planned heists to earn the big bucks or even orchestrate the heists as the team leader to earn a greter cut of the job. If thats not your thing if you prefer to earn cash in a smaller but more constant magnitude. Employ yourself as an enforcer for another player requesting of escort services for his criminal empire (or if you have the money run that empire yourself) and use your hard earned cash to buy houses luxury cars bunkers attack choppers FREAKING ORBITAL CANNONS and whatnot.This all sound really fun right? RIGHT?! But thanks to Rockstars pisspoor game infrastructure all of these fantastic features and content fall flat on their STUPID. FAT. FACES... Lets see where to begin?...Let's talk about the way player lobbies work. You set up a heist put on some tweaks here and there the difficulty etcetera. And once you launch it to look for players you are tossed into the closest thing there is on earth to the purgatory. This dumbass screen where you sit and wait... and wait... and wait... for what it feels for hours (40 minutes is my record) to get your heist crew players to arrive despite there being millions of people playing this game and you only need FOUR of them... it takes such a tormenting amount of time to get things going. I've got 90 hours of gameplay and i can guarantee you that 30% of those hours are of me (and every other player) sitting on my fiddling my thumbs waiting for the go ahead. Oh and don't forget you need those 4 players in your game at all times so if somebody leaves either because their internet connection broke down their mom told them to turn off the game inmediately or if they just simply decided to on your cereal.. that's it your mission is f.ked and you're back to the street or if you are playing a mission in the middle of goddamn nowhere thats were you'll be ditched out.Players types in this game are all over the place. You've got your good bros your hotheaded players some straight up d.ickheads those very impolite kids with power fantasies. You've got hackers griefers shady money earning facilitators and ragequitting scrubs. If you are lucky you'll assemble a good solid team every 6 games.... per week (That is of you keep picking up randoms assemble a team of IRL friends and you'll put some weight off your mind). To make things worse Rockstar's smeared servers will throttle their warty malformed c.ocks down your windpipe by crashing your game... which brings me to my next point.......Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooading screeeeensThis game is soooo slooow and whenever it's got the chance it will crash (did i forget to mention that it takes around 10 minutes to log into GTA V online?) and you'll be s.hit out of luck. Loading into a heist? *crash* Just finished a mission and you are heading back to the game session? *infinite loading screen of agonizing death* That final dude you need for the mission is loading in? *lol nope let's keep him loading there for eternity*And last but not least. Feedback and report features if you ever get griefed (of course you will) or hacked or griefed/hacked and hope for Rockstar to step up to your aid (of course you won t). Theres is no such report theres a few checkboxes you can select ""i'm being bullied (does this account for it?)"" ""i'm being impersonated"" ""muh rights"" ""muh intellectual rights"" and some other doodoo i can t even remember... wheres the ""This sumbitc.h is straight up typing console commands murdering everyone on the game instantly"" checkbox? or the ""This di.ckbag quitted our heist 10 meters away from the mission success"" checkbox?Good lord... i could spend the entire day talking about this game and i would not finish until next week. But for my sake and yours i'll just stop with this final sentence.Don't play it... Wait for a very VERY heavy fix to their game or if you alrdeady have well... i guess i'll be seeing you around.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,381,False,Recommended,"GeneralThe world is amazing. Plenty of space (given I was really skeptical about only having just one island). I like the First Person camera at times but it is still amazing that first person is a choice. The AI seem great and more persistent than ever. I was really excited about the things they brought back from GTA SA Buy Houses (and more) Planes Helicopters Train Truck &amp Trailer tons of car chooses Tanks and tons more! I disliked GTA IV because it only had the Annihilator helicopter that had guns on it and made the game just boring because there wasn't much to do in it. Strip Clubs and hookers are even better than ever though nothing is really new about hookers (when will there ever be? P). Car customization is back and nice though I would enjoy it more if there were more tune up options. From my world experience it is just fantastic. There's a lot more to do in GTAV than imagined. Though there are a large amount of disappointments in my playtime.General Disappointments/Annoyance The game got boring pretty quickly but not as boring as GTA IV was. Too many static GameObjects. Most bushes and poles are static. Benches small to medium rocks and small to medium trees are static. I don't get why there's so many static GameObjects. It makes me think a little badly about the game because of this. Where's gambling? If this is coming in DLC I don't mind I guess but it is disappointing to not be already implemented in the game. P.S I'm not talking about the ""bets"" you can place in multiplayer because that's dull. Police shoot you even if you have one star instead of two stars. Police helicopter respond time after downing a helicopter is annoying and way too fast. Police in their cars aren't as great in GTAV than they were in the previous games. They can't for the life of them even tail you in their car and they give up chasing you when you try to get away with stars blinking (which is all the time). AI tend to have 95% 100% accuracy even when shooting at random while in cover. AI not wearing armor can sometimes take forever to kill via body shots. Makes no sense.OnlineI really enjoy character customization since (if I remember) they didn't have anything like this in the previous game. The clothing choices are undecidable because there's so many! The amount of mini games is great as well golf tennis darts arm wrestling and more. Playing mini games with friends is very fun. Leveling is somewhat slow (it seems) I'm level 100+ and it took me awhile (given half my time played was playing around having fun). I enjoy the Jobs we can choose from because there's so many of them. The Jobs also have good RP and money at the end too. I enjoy the survivals and NPC (Gerald Ron etc) related jobs more than racing etc. I did some racing but it was only to unlock all the car mods. Racing online either turns into a collision fest (if the settings weren't set right) and it is pretty annoying. The fact that you can keep your guns in online play is great (no more running around finding guns). It is funny when a civilian places a bounty on you when you steal their vehicle since it is open game for other players or your friends to get the bounty. There are disappointments and some annoying things in Online play too.Online Disappointments/Annoyance Having to go to Single Player just to make a closed crew/friend session is annoying. Other players spamming invitations like crazy. There should be a way in making your invitations show up from crew or friends only. Pressing R to reload near a player kills them even if it wasn't your intentation to kill them. Targeting with a gun can sometimes target your friend/other near you and you hit them. No animals (or at least I haven't seen any). Steam overlay can sometimes bug out and you can't Shift + Tab to release the game controls. After doing a job with friends it sometimes doesn't put you back in your closed session. Cops don't patrol at all. (Not sure if it's like this in SP as well) Vehicles despawn way too fastOnline HeistsI was actually excited about this. Heists unlock at rank 12 and when you unlock it you get to rob banks steal coke and do all kinds of things. However I didn't expect it to be how it was. It went by setup missions that you do to proceed to the end of a heist. There's also mini games you can do which are fun and nerve wrecking at times. Heists is a very interesting idea on how it is executed. I enjoyed doing heists with friends it was fun. But it has disappointments.Online Heists Disappointments The fact that beyond Fleeca Bank heist requires 4 players to do the heists is pretty disappointing. I believe it should scale to support less players. Having 4 friends doing heists with you is dandy until you have to ""pug"" it with a random player. Better yet sometimes finding a ""random"" player is annoying. If heists was at minimum 2 4 players it would be great. Of course each person has a job to do but scaling should have AI doing the other parts of a setup or just skip it saying ""we already done X"". As a leader in all my heists at the finale I dislike the setup board. Assuming this can be abused by a leader if that's their intentions. I'm not sure of the limitations other than you can't go higher than 70% of the cut. Once buying a heist and you're still at the first lobby &amp you leave the heist goes away and you lose your money. Once buying a heist and you leave (not immediately) it should have it saved leaving all the missions listed on the board regardless of your position (lobby or where ever). This has happened to me twice because I couldn't get a 4th person.Bare in mind I'm not saying Online Online Heists or the game is generally bad because of my disappointments.Story 5/10 (typical dull story that Rockstar always come up with)Online Play 7/10 (This includes Heists)Overall 6/10",Grand Theft Auto V

The plot is one of my favorite for a GTA game (second to Chinatown Wars) Los Stantos really shines and the driving is my favorite for an open world game. If you want GTA V for its story I say go get it.However GTA Online is a cancer on the gaming industry. First of all it's boring and the activities aren't fun. But more importantly it has fostered a community of prestige where only the few who are willing to pay get to have much fun (not to mention all of the hackers on PC). Paying $50 on a single in game item on top of the $60 game among other expensive in game purchases is nothing short of unfettered greed on the part of Take Two. Take Two has also made it clear that all of its future games will plan to have microtransactions and I can only fear for Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar used to come out with a new game every year but buy the time Red Dead 2 comes out it will have been 5 since its last. Rockstar also used to make some of the best single player expansions but now only focus on exploiting thier online cash cow which makes hundreds of millions every year. GTA Online has forever altered Rockstar's fate from making good games into extracting as much money from a game as possible amd that is why GTA Online deserves to die in a fire.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's adds alot of variety and I found to play differently depending on the character I used.The missions are varied and memorable the voice acting and animation work is amazing. I enjoyed every fourty or so hours of the main story. Afterwords I finished all side quests and in about another twenty hours. 5/5MultiplayerIn theory it should deliver a fun sandbox rump with other players in Los Santos. Takling missions heists racing etc with other players like yourself. I.E not a cheater.Unfortunately it's full of cheaters to be honest I dont fully blaim them. Online requires a lot of grinding as the money making machine that is heists is broken at least if playing with randoms as everything you do online suffers from long waiting times seemingly due to R* server lag. Meaning it can take a eaon to get into a match but if someone drops out or decides to leave everyone is dumped back to the lobby. After over ten hours of trying I have not been able to complete the heists.Then you have the general sandbox which is full of cheaters. When ever I decide to play online it's to check out the new content R* had released however I only now do so in a closed lobby by myself which should speak for itself for just how bad the online component is.1/5GraphicsStunning...Beautifully optimised has all of the bells and whistles you expect in a AAA pc game.5/5VerdictI'm not into online mutiplayer in general.

2017-06-18,0,0,1360,False,Not Recommended,Take Two Modding Yadda yadda yadda.But seriously even outside of the recent controversy I can't recommend this game or at least GTA Online.I've been playing GTAV since release day back in 2013. Early on there wasn't a ton of stuff to do in GTAO but the novelty of playing with other people kept me hooked until the PC release day.Then again that's also the same reason I have thousands of hours logged in MMO's like Elder Scrolls Online. The only thing that keeps me playing these games is the fun of experiencing something with friends no matter how crappy the core game is. And the core game is crappy trust me.First let's look at the core of GTAO the thing that keeps everyone playing money. Money can be earned in petty ways like convenience store robberies selling cars mugging NPCs etc. But unfortunately everything in the game that's worth spending money on is super expensive far more expensive than someone just doing petty crimes could afford. Because of this playing missions and heists are essential. I remember it took me almost a month back on console to raise enough to buy a decent apartment but now you can make that money super quick! And that isn't a bad thing well it WOULDN'T be a bad thing if the ways you earned money were interesting. However the sad truth of the matter is that missions are repetitive boring timesucks. &lt &lt DRIVE 6.82 MILES TO RETRIEVE A VAN THEN DRIVE THE SLOW VAN BACK TO WHERE YOU STARTED&gt &gt Yeah not fun.So what are your options for getting cool stuff if you don't want to grind out repetitive missions? Well you have two options.1) Buy Shark Cards via microtransactions (A better term would be macrotransactions these deals are laughably bad some of the cards going above and beyond the original pricetag of the game.)2) Have a modder drop money around you for you to pick up.So lots of people went with the second option beg modders for money so they could buy the things you need to make the gameplay actually fun. Unfortunately it seems with the latest update Rockstar has checked everyone's balances and deducted an arbitrary amount for what they deemed was obtained through exploits. I should also add that they did a particularly poor job determining what was hacked in and what wasn't I lost five million dollars of money that I actually earned.So after all this what's left? An open world with boring missions content locked behind an in game paywall and an upset community who's bitter about the game.IN CONCLUSION If you and your friends want to just d*ck around and have fun then sure buy the game when it's on sale. But outside of that? There isn't much good to say about this game.3/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-12,0,0,62,False,Recommended,There are times when I look at Los Santos and think 'why would you even think to build that?' This is appropriately a thought that I often have about Los Angeles. In GTA 5's case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled y'know despair. Rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit. I look at it and I wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so. I marvel at the care evident in San Andreas' gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfully chosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience. Everything about Los Santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years. The abiding irony of Grand Theft Auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in Los Santos hates it there.,Grand Theft Auto V

They allow hackers to roam in online and ruin everyone's good time. The sad thing though is that I honestly love this game so much. The single player is great the graphics are great the setting is great the amount of things you can do in singleplayer and multiplayer is staggering and great again. The decision to include first person mode was such a right move and the free dlc they have launched over the game's lifetime is something every developer should pay attention to. It just doesn't make sense to me why they would on it's playerbase like this. It is for that reason why I can only recommend this game to people who don't care about Rockstar and their terrible policies on modding and if they only want to play singleplayer. I cannot recommend multiplayer in it's current state with the hackers right now. It is unplayable.,Grand Theft Auto V

Multiple times have I played when I get randomly disconnected and have to ""sit"" in the clouds to go back to singleplayer and rejoin GTA V Online.

I played last week and I couldn't even get to play 2 heist setups before losing connection randomly.

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-01,0,0,407,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Singleplayer is fun but multuplayer is WAY to biased for people with WAY TO MUCH real money than they know what to do with. If you dont mind never being able to get all to cool things they add then maybe you can find some long term enjoyment out of the game.The Single player is really good. The story is pretty good although a little crazy at times. However the best thing about the game is the online. I cant recommend the game though because of the online though. It is very grindy and nearly impossible to get any of the cool stuff they really advertise. To give you an idea of how much and how long it takes I will try to break down some of the cost. To get a really fast sports car it takes around $1 million. Unless you get first place in a race you generally only get 5k for about 10 to 15 minutes of work. Thats about 200 races. Heist are a good way to get money but you have to pay to set one up and eventually get around 200k for around 3 4 hours of work. That time includes the eternity it takes for GTA online to match you up with people for the actual missions. So to get a basic sports car it takes a really long time even with the fasted way of making money. It also takes about the cars initail ammount to fully upgrade it. So really its double the sticker price to get it to a fast speed. Then the apartments that you need to do any heist are about $1.25 million. The cars in the import export dlc are cool but cost an insane amount of money. The ruiner 2000 (the car that jumps has rockets and a parachute) cost $5 6 million (you get a discounted rate for doing a mission. You would have to grind for days of non stop play to get it. Thats not to mention the $1 million warehouse you need to store those kinds of vehichles. They remove the grind with the player being able to purchase shark cards. These are laughably useless. Anything below the $20 card is really useless. The $20 one gets you $1.25 million. Keep in mind this is enough for a single unupgraded sports car or 1 apartment. The $100 card is only $8 million ingame dollars. That is such a laughable amount of useless money. Remember the ruiner 2000 that I mentioned? Thats about $60 or $70 REALT WORLD MONEY for a virtual car. The multiplayer is pretty poorly balanced but you can always just leave for a new lobby so its not to bad. So unless you have a ton of time or a ton of disposable income you $60 is better spent elsewhere in a game that isnt so clearly abusing microtransactions.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can go online and play with friends. You can also mod your game with some cool mods! (All mods are free). In story mode Gta 5 offers so many fun exciting missions. You get money from the missions and with that money you can buy cool things such as clothes boats planes cars and so much more! But thats only story mode. On online you get the same thing money for doing missions (except there like jobs I'll cover those later) and with that money you can get all of that stuff you can get in story mode. Well thats the basics let's get more in depth.Online Probably one of the best parts of this game is the online mode. In online you can join with friends from all over the world! With those friends you can do jobs which are like little games you play to earn money. You can also buy a property such as an apartment or even house! You can do awesome fun races and just so many cool stuff. Also on online you create your own character and with him/her you play! I haven't even gone deep into online thats just the basics. Online is a very fun part of GTA 5.Story Mode A nice story of the characters Michal Trevor and Franklin. Now I don't wanna give any spoilers of what happens in the story so yeah... anyways you play with these 3 characters in a bunch of missions. I think there are over 60 missions. Each of these missions are very fun and challenging in some way. On story mode you cannot play with friends it is a single player version of GTA 5. Again I mentioned you can get mods for story mode (not for online you'll get banned) on gta5 mods.com That website has some of the coolest mods in GTA 5. If you're interested in modding here's a little video on how to get started Oh and just so you know his channel name is TmarTn2. Sub and like his vid! https //youtu.be/u_p8ihzljxcThats about it for story mode and yeah it's great!Conclusion Gta 5 is an open world game that offers many fun gamemodes. In it you can get brutal creative and playful! This game will take a long time to download up to 2 3 hours but it's worth it! And yeah I hope this review helped you with deciding about this game! Definetly recommend it! Well peace!Side notes This game is rated M for 17+.This game is 68GB big.Have an awesome day!,Grand Theft Auto V

Online is totally f*c*ed cuz of the damn microtransactions and EVERYTHING being ridiculously overpriced. The fact that we will probably NEVER get any SinglePlayer DLC is what makes this the worst release in Rockstar history. I can't think of a more blatant middle finger to the true fans of the game and series than this.. It's absurd that they'd totally sidestep SP DLC for their own greed.

2017-06-15,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,"I put over 200 hours into this game. I played through the story thrice. I've messed about with mods for countless hours. GTA itself was a masterpiece of a game but with mods... GTA itself was just a box. It was just a container for the infinite possibilities of mods. That's what made me pay $60 for a game I already paid $120 for on two console generations once it arrived on PC. Mods were the most important part of the GTA V PC experience.At least until Take Two Interactive issued a cease and desist order to the team behind OpenIV the software that permits all substantial modding for GTA IV and V. It's been running for nearly ten years undisturbed... until June 14 2017 when it had to shut down because Take Two declared modding effectively illegal despite tolerating it (and even celebrating it) for nearly a decade.Because of that I can't reccomend GTA V on PC. Don't get it. If you're getting it for a proper game don't. You can get it on console but I can't reccomend that because it supports Take Two Interactive. If you're getting it for mods don't. You'll be disappointed. There is nothing to reccomend about GTA V PC any longer. Unless and until Take Two reverses this decision this negative review will stick and the rest of the reviews will continue dropping. In honor of the OpenIV devs ""recent"" reviews will reach a low of ""Overwhelmingly Negative."" That'll get some press attention and it will certainly get Take Two's attention.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-21,0,0,295,False,Not Recommended,Pros Best large open worldGood graphics for 2013Cons Loading times. I have a fast SSD and an unlocked 5th gen i5. Want to hop in and play with your friends? Click on GTA V. A minute or two later you can choose GTA V or online. Choosing singleplayer will take a minute or two to load. Choosing multiplayer will take a couple minutes as it loads the singleplayer anyway then a couple more as it loads you into a multiplayer session. Then add a couple more to join your friends' private session. Almost ten minutes to get into a server easily. At least now you can play GTA. Unless...Stability issues occur. The game crashes consistently with no reason on my PC and my friend's machine. Which wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to wait for so long to play.But when it's working you get to explore the wonderful world of Los Santos. Unfortunately every way of interacting with said world is infuriatingly bad.Player movement on foot unusable will get you killed frequently due to your character running into gunfire or off a cliff 20 feet away despite you instructing them to go elsewhere.Cameras default to an angle which is far too low. If you move your mouse to fix them they auto reset every 2 seconds anyway even if this is turned off in settings.Flying autocenters controls even when disabled in settings. Do you like scrolling your mouse all the way forwards across your desk picking it up and doing it again and agin just to fly a helicopter in a straight line? Buy this game!Driving surprisingly good mechanics actually. Unfortunately PC players can't use a wheel... so you can only use the brute force of arrow keys. Oh well. The driving mechanics have issues hit curbs to gain speed pedestrians interfering in races etc but nothing compares to arrow keys.User Interface Again terrible. A user interface designed for consoles hasn't even been changed for PC. Not going into detail. If you play you'll see what I mean. Add to this the game's tendency to remove clicks or only count a map vote/setting change/etc after 3+ clicks or the left/right selectors tendency to not respond properly after a change in the width of the content.Shooting mechanics Not so much that they are bad it's that they're nonexistent. Recoil hardly matters. All automatic weapons feel inaccurate and put far too much luck into already chaotic conflict. The AP pistol and heavy sniper make all other weapons irrelevant anyway(except explosives).And then finally we have Rockstar's updates.This game(which is already expensive 4 years after release) is even after you buy in essentially a grind or pay2win game. like a free2play title. Rockstar prefers to put out the newest supercars(that take several hours of grinding to get just one of) instead of making actual content. But that's not too bad. More concerning are the armored cars APCs etc that completely change the combat and add a huge tax to GTA combat. Either have 8+ million for the gunrunning DLC content and more for the included APC and rocket bike and their ilk or die to those who do. Public GTA combat has been completely ruined by this cash grab update.This is the only game I've ever regretted buying.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-31,1,2,240,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V or GTA 5 is a open world shooter/ racer with an assortment of differnent things to do in the world. However and I am sorry for those who enjoy this game dearly the game gets tirelessly boring without any money and the constant abuse of hackers does not help. I know that Rockstar is trying to put a stop to hackers but it's no there fault it is the game for becoming so slow. The lack of Heists and ways to get money is just deflating and thats why people turn to hacking to gen some money so they may have fun again. It's good for the first 20 30 hours after that don't bother till they figure out how to fix the money issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-09,0,0,144,False,Recommended,I am going to give my honest opinion. I never really cared for really any kind of modding in this game (singleplayer or rp servers). I know that take two has messed up if that wasn't obvious from all the other 99% of reviews. I know it's not because of taking Opev VI was asked to stop it's the reason from what I know there wasn't any reason to make Open VI stop. However you should not be getting mad about something that is not even really meant to be in the game in the first place. This does make me want to try an RP server or mod in singleplayer a bit more. I just wish all these reviews were about the base game which they should be. About the base game The start is always the hardest part about most games especially this one. All you have to do is grind and find ways to make money and have fun at the same time. Modders in multiplayer are a problem but you can just find a new session.I find this game to be somewhat addictive when you are always making objectives for yourself about what thing you want next (car tank office building etc).Trolls in multiplayer can sometimes give you a laugh but the ones who just shoot you out of your car for no reason kinda ruin the fun sometimes.This is my honest opinion so far about this game and what has happened in the GTA V Modding community,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-30,0,0,36,False,Recommended,From a technical and design perspective Grand Theft Auto V sets new limts in the gaming world. The world it presents is unrivalled in authenticity and vibrancy. It feels fluid and alive to play. Time passes organically characters' lives progress and there is a simply astounding quantity of side activities in which to engage. It's quite possible to explore the state of San Andreas for hours without moving the main story forward a stitch. In fact that's part of the fun. And it's all been polished to a glossy sheen. The controls feel great the visuals are lush and a brilliant graphical interface empowers players giving them all the information they need and only the information they need exactly when they need it. However the writing isn't quite as sharp as it has been in previous installments the humor is a bit broader and less sophisticated and the main characters aren't as well developed (probably because there are now three) but this only impacts the overall experience a little. It remains a very impressive game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-20,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,I bought the PC version of GTA 5 recently as you can see by the number of hours I've played and I genearlly don't review games but I feel that I should warn people about buying this one especially with Christmas discounts coming up. I played the PS3 version when it initially came out but stopped because I was the only one playing it out of my friends. I recently decided to pick it up again to play with friends online. However if you like to play with friends online on public servers be prepared for RAMPANT hacking. The hackers and cheaters completely ruin the game and the experience of being a crazy criminal. Ironic I know but when the server is constantly nuked over and over again being killed by invincible players and simply dealing with it every few minutes is not a fun experience. The game itself is amazing the vehicles the missions the graphics the open world and so on and if you're buying it for the single player then go ahead but be warned Hackers run this game online and basically make it unplayable unless you like putting up with this kind of thing. Save your money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Upon seconds of logging in gave a player who drove by the middle finger who decided to reverse his car next me because he thought I needed a ride. I shot him in the face and stole his car and drove it off a cliff. The player placed a 9 000 dollar bounty on my head which had every player in the city coming for this sweet piece of a$$. I went into a 7/11 and robbed the owner and found a player hiding in the back room waiting to kill me. I laid his punk *** out and stole his car and took off. Old lady ran into my car at an intersection so I got out of the car pulled her out of it and stomped her down and stole her car and drove off.

2017-08-28,0,0,143,False,Recommended,NOTE This review only covers the single player content of Grand Theft Auto V.What can be said about Grand Theft Auto V that you already don't know? This game is an absolute masterpiece that shows why the series is the father and king of the open world genre. For me it's definitely one the best videogames that i ever played. I played it to 100% and except for when i was hunting for collectables i enjoyed every minute of it. What sets this game apart for the competition is the obsessive attention to detail in everything. You can see the effort put in creating this masterpiece. The story isn't as engaging as past GTA titles but still manages to be pretty good and well written with interesting characters especially the main trio. Playing with 3 different charactes brings some freshness even if they mostly play the same. The motion capture and voice acting work are great making the cutscenes cinematic in a good way. Personally i didn't found the soundtrack to be that good and lacked some variety. The gameplay however is pretty good from shooting to driving and during most of the minigames and extra activities. The mission variety is good even if the game is easier than past titles. The checkpoint and especially the mission replay systems are more than welcome. The map has the right size but it could be better designed especially in the country areas. It didn't felt like forests or deserts but a big mountainous area that lacked variety. And the game is missing casino minigames and the freaking jetpack! That was awesome in San Andreas and it's absence here is disappointing. It's interesting that for me what i didn't like here wasn't the game's flaws but the lack of some content. The game is big and packed with quality content so it's normal what i wanted even more. Even without Grand Theft Auto Online this game easily deserves the full price.I also need to point out that the PC version is great. The game is superbly optimized for a lot of systems and even on low end machines it'll look great. The new first player perspective may feel like a bonus but at 60 FPS and on a keyboard and mouse is a great way perphaps not to play (i recommend using the normal camera the first time you play the game) but to replay this amazing masterpiece. The PC version is clearly superior.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-11-22,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,Ehh the Game is OK. There are a couple of major problems. one of the problems is that some of the textures will refuse to load and everything looks like it's floating. Rockstar said they have fixed it but they havent it's still a major problem. Also the online community is worse than leagues and there are so many hackers on there its un real.

2015-12-22,0,0,178,False,Recommended,So I am going to go very detailed into this review. Keep in mind this reveiw was made on 22nd December 2015 so there may of been changes made. So I am going to say benefits and cons for both Storymode and GTA Online.GTA V Storymode Benefits A really nice story (In my opinion)Fun to mess around in with mods.It can be played offline but not as enjoyable as onlineOpen world where you cant find anyone that will annoy you (as its offline xD)3 Characters to play from which I think is a great concept.Cons You cant play with friends in storymodeCan get boring after a while especially if you done completed the whole story.Thats really all I can put about StorymodeGTA V Online Benefits You can play with friends!You can do mini games as well as some missions!Custom mini games.Most updates are made on that such as the Festive Suprise 2015Takes a while for you to get bored on.Customizable characters cars.You can buy garages and houses to keep your precious 1 million dollar car safe.Cons Too many script kiddies (hackers).People constantly kill eachother.Inoccent people get banned just because they pick up money bags that where given by hackers /You will need good internet.Some of the community arent very repectful. /Well thats all I can say! Overall Rating 9/10Optimization (Unecessary) There was an update 2 months ago (I didnt play this back then). Apparently it made it very laggy and I can see that I can run Crysis 3 with medium high graphics just fine but in GTA V I am always getting between 30 50 FPS and the frames can stutter. There is no way to fix it but only to put all your graphicss to the lowest and hope for the best (doesnt work anyway...)Storymode 8.5/10Online 9/10 (only because of the hackers you find EVERYWHERE)I hope you found this reveiw helpful Pear,Grand Theft Auto V

And I have an 80mbps Internet connection!It takes a ton of time if you want to switch session but sometimes in the middle of exporting my cars i get instantly put into a session all on my own.

Of course there are a few bad people out there but if you get into a good lobby the good SEVERELY outweighs the bad. The game's controls are great and it isn't hard to get used to. The singleplayer story is awesome as well as adding the ability to play as more than one character and the ability to choose your own ending.The game is constantly pumping out new and awesome DLCs that keep the online experience fresh and awesome as well as the main online missions that came with GTA Online when it came out are also awesome and the apartments and Heists are great.They've also added customisable apartments and ""Stilt Apartments"" (A.K.A Houses) which is pretty cool.Cars are cool and are a main element in the game the fact that they keep bringing out more and more is really cool and makes races and custom missions really fun.Basically Grand Theft Auto V is a fun game that most likely won't get old until close to the next installment in the series' release and if you think you'll want it I definitley recommend buying it.

2017-07-08,0,0,164,False,Recommended,This installment might create mixed feelings but what it does deliver on is GTA content regardless of you agreeing or not. First off the free roaming might feel more limited however you get more detail on the fly. GTA San Andreas had a wider area to offer but with limited area to roam (albeit still a big area) you ll definitely get more bang for the buck. GTA IV? Yeah it s probably on line with that franchise albeit even there might be smaller. Missions are pretty good and you WILL get challenged. No worries. The storyline makes good sense and it doesn t throw you off in the middle of nowhere like Vice City and especially GTA IV could at some points losing some ends here and there. That sucked. First person mode. Yes. You heard me. That s seriously an awesome idea! What sucks? The police. In single player mode they have been tuned up so high that any small mistake will have you wasted in mere seconds. In online mode (which you ll probably be playing the most anyway) they have been tuned a bit down to the levels of GTA IV police albeit a bit better AI. They have brains trust me. You get bang for the buck. However the poop detail You are facing a huge price. Sadly. Otherwise if you can get it for cheap you are looking at an awesome game. ...What cheaters? Well no you know Valve doesn t have cheaters in neither their games nor the franchises they sell on their website. Kappa,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-11,0,0,834,False,Not Recommended,I'm really conflicted on how to review this. I'm giving it negative for now I'll almost definitely change it later. This is my favorite game. No question. Over 700 hours of play time and I don't plan on stopping. Single player is great. It's long it has good characters a good story it's well written and voice acted fun missions and a little replay value. Probably worth the $60 on its own. Online is where I've put +600 hours. It's a little grindy but I don't mind putting in the work in order to get actually different items properties weapons vehicles. There is are updates with fun new stuff every few months. You get to be psychotic in a huge open area with your fiends. It's really great. Modders. Ruined it for me. I don't really care when they blow me up or put a campfire in my chest or take away my weapons. I just go to a different server. I mind when they drop money. One person gave me 30 million. It seemed great I got a yacht that was too much to work to buy I got cars and places to keep them I got outfits. I got banned. I got my rank 150 character reset. It sucks and I was but really I can just play more. Nope. After my 30 day ban I went on and 2 hours in for no reason I was permanently banned from GTA 5 Online. I mean what the ? I was in a private session on a jetski and they kill me. I write a ticket and get an automated response. I call and get an automated response. A lake has better customer support than rockstar.

The tiniest of details are included in this game. Car 'cooling down' noises when you get out first person mode tinting different colors depending on the color of sunglasses you are wearing the dashboard radio visually changing as you change radio stations... there is so much more. The detail in this game is just amazing down to the smallest thing. This really makes the world feel alive and not dead or static like a lot of other open world games. Cool little color coded VRAM 'notification bar' letting you know how much of your GPU's memory you are using and how hard you are pushing your card with the settings that you choose in the graphics options. This bar updates in real time when changing settings.Some Cons Having 3 characters can sometimes make collecting things like clothes/cars/guns more of a chore than a joy Online is pretty buggy and crashes frequently It is very obvious that GTA's Online mode end game is to make you either grind for money and/or buy ""Shark Cards"" with RL $ for GTA cash for some reasons below *If you take car parts off it costs the same amount to put them back on (you have to re buy them there is no 'car part inventory' like there is with clothes and car parts can get very expensive) *You get penalized for defending yourself against aggressive players (If someone is chasing you in an armored car and trying to kill you you have to pay their insurance if you blow them up which can get expensive if they are driving something expensive) Small inconveniences make online mode a pain sometimes these include *Being split up from your group after every heist setup mission *Game crashing right after or during a heist mission *Random game crashes/session time outs with generic or no error messages *Rubber banding/laggy cars/people in online that make PVP difficult and defending yourself difficult in open public sessions difficult as well *Hackers/Cheaters in online (there are a lot) that use tools for god mode or to shoot money bags at people as well as spawning random things in the game world that make it unfun and annoying to play in public sessions *Load times are painfully long even on an SSD. This can sort of sap the fun out of chaining missions with a group or just bouncing between sessions. *If your game crashes or lags out during a mission it counts as you 'quitting' the mission and will mark against you as a ""Bad Sport"" which will put you in lobbies with actual griefers/quitters *If your game crashes or lags out during a mission you lose all ammo you used on that mission (which can be very expensive depending on what you used). (This is unlike when you legit fail a mission and have to restart where the game will give you money to compensate for ammo spent. If you lag out/crash its lost)Some things to note that are neither pros/cons Game is decently optimized but takes some beefy hardware to completely max it out and keep 60fps/1080p Playing in Online mode with random people or ""pugs"" can be frustrating. A lot of people quit mid mission or just generally don't know how to communicate well. In my opinion the best way to play Online mode is with a group of friends in a crew within private crew sessions. It took me about 50 hours to complete the main campaign and that was with a handful of things left around the map. I am currently sitting around 75% on the ""100% checklist"" in game.Things to think about IMO This game is very much about the journey and not the destination. HAVE FUN while you are playing and enjoy all the gameplay for what it's worth. Don't ""grind"" in online mode to get that next car part or that next weapon unlock or you will get it and think ""...so what now?"" Just have fun and enjoy the game as it comes. It's a great game and I recommend it.",Grand Theft Auto V

It is honestly an amazing game alone or with friends and considering I wasn't 100% on board on getting it my mind has definitely been changed for the better.Single PlayerThe single player campaign is extremely good and fleshed out amazing if you have a weekend or so without internet and need a catching and enjoyable story to play. While lacking after completion modding is definitely something to consider if you are careful with your installations and an amazing community means there is always something to try out.PRO's Great story with 3 great characters leads me to believe a new GTA won't be able to ever beat it. Characters are interesting to say the least but all lead to an overall amazing. Open world is diverse with countless opportunities for chaos and shenanigans.

2015-04-14,0,0,225,False,Recommended,I am not exactly sure how to start this review. It's been a long wait. I bought the game 20.1.2015 and since then all I did was wait for it to go live.After a few delays last night it finaly DID go live. And all my waiting was worth it.Before I ever launched it I went on the steam forums and checked what were the first impressions of everyone else. What I saw was kinda troubling for me. A lot of people were complaining how they couldn't launch the game load it completely had terrible fps drops... So when it finnaly happened when I launched my game for the first time I expected the same problems. ... I HAD NONE. The Social Club account I already had (was required for GTA IV too) was easily linked to GTA V. The game didn't crash ONCE. It launched as any other game does (performing first time setup etc.) True it took some time to get the graphics settings just right for my gear (I have a GTX 660 and a quad core AMD 3.1 Ghz which is a bit too weak but manages to run the game nicely) and I do expirience some fps drops most of the time. But honestly I did expect this. Texture quality I use is normal (any other setting demands more video memory than I have). Even so I think the game looks amazing. I can only IMAGINWE how it looks for people with ''supercharged'' computers.My final impression is 10/10. And my advice for everyone woth problems at the start be patient. Wait for the load to finish itself try different graphic settings make the game run nicely on your computer before reviewing it negatively. It deserves respect and patience. We have been witing for this masterpiece for a very long time.,Grand Theft Auto V

There wasn't too much effort put into actually optimizing the game for PC so don't expect maximum performance and even if you do manage to patch that then you get to deal with all the memory leaks that Rockstar didn't care enough to fix.I must be the only person in the world who hated the story mode in this game. The story wasn't really well thought out the characters aren't particularly likeable and the actually missions themselves are awful. You have to do heists which require you to gather some stuff to prepare for them which feels like such a chore and is not fun. It's just steal a vehicle and park it here go to this store and buy some stuff steal another vehicle and park it here steal another vehicle and ok we can do the heist now. Just half filler to make the fact that there are only about half the missions that San Andreas had less noticeable.It's not horrible but this game is heavily overrated and not worth the $60 asking price.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-11,0,0,232,False,Recommended,The single player part is great. I enjoyed the story had a blast. The online multiplayer part had (and still has) great potential. Unfortunately that part of the game has been ruined by tons of hackers. God mode warping around in their tanks forcing people into duels and alot of other stupidity only the dumbest of children enjoy. To this day its rampant and rockstar has done NOTHING to stop it. It wont take you 10 minutes to run into one of these idiots in multiplayer...changing shards doesnt help..there's more idiots there too. Will probably NEVER be fixed. Great game ruined by letting idiots run loose and hack the game to pieces.TL DR I recommend the single player part A+ there. Wait until it's on sale for 20 bucks or less. Then you'll get your money's worth for the single player and whatever fun you can get out of the online part before the hackers make it completely unplayable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,103,False,Recommended,The single player story is an exhilarating series of increasingly fun missions. And if you have the muscle to run it at max settings the visual fidelity is astonishing. Driving through the city at night in a storm neon signs reflecting in the puddles and on the rain slicked hood of your car it almost looks photorealistic. And it all takes place in one of the richest densest most skillfully constructed game worlds ever built. The sense of place these details evoke is lightyears ahead of other open world games. And the fact you can share it with other players makes it all the more exciting. GTA Online is a game in itself mixing GTA s sandbox chaos with elements of MMORPG. 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-20,0,0,334,False,Recommended,Great game all around with some hit and misses mixed in. I will list my pros and cons of this game below.Pros 1) Variety From solo storyline to 20+ player races to full lobby all out bloodbaths there is something for just about every one.2) Graphics From the woods to the ocean and to the burning of exploded cars you will enjoy a eyeorgy of beauty.3) Garages and Homes With the Ability to own up to 4 Homes and Garages from ghetto to upclass stilt houses on the side of a mountain to simple 2 to 10 car garages you will have a wide range of places to park your rides aswell as your rear.4) Customization The Ability to customize your characters Hair/beards/clothing/weapons/cars/planes/Homes/ even Yacht (yes you can even own Yachts) this game has alot to do.5) Updates The Multiplayer aspect of this game gets free DLC content quite often.6) RPGs VS Insurgents and Snipers vs Stunters Two of the best underplayed multiplayer activities in game. Cons 1) Cheaters If you play on public lobbys you will eventually come into contact with the lowest form of gamers in any game but in GTA 5 where so much of the game is based on you being in Public Lobbys their existence can make for a very annoying time.2) Public Lobbys Multiplayer is very much based around Public Lobbys. Unless you just want to run around robbing small stores and causing general chaos you will be forced to play in a Public Lobby which leaves you easy pray to Above mentioned Con. From running CEO jobs to challenges if there is a cheater in the Lobby they will do their best to mess with you.3) NPCs calling you In Multiplayer especially there is nothing as annoying as being in a drive by or fleeing from someone trying to kill you when all the sudden your phone pops up blocking part of your view and ringing till you answer it and causing you to fail/die because of the distraction. There is others that could be added in the Pros and Cons grouping but that can be said about any game. for $60 normally and currently $40 on sale its cost to entertainment value is well worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-04,0,0,623,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer Awesome.Miltiplayer Absolute disaster. Hackers and modders are ruining the game for normal players without any repercussion what so ever. I've expierienced dozens of situations where hackers got people locked in cages at their own houses droped people from high altittudes teleported people together and bombed them stole millions of dollars worth of their money and even got people banned. Changing the session doesn't help since literally every single session has around 2 4 active cheaters on it that just seek to ruin peoples' gameplay which prooves that the Rockstar's anti cheating system (Assuming that it even exist) is failing miserably. I have never seen such scale of online cheating ever in any of the multiplayer games I've played in my life. If this will not change radically I guarantee that GTA V's ratings will continue falling down.Seriously. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.,Grand Theft Auto V

I had heard of problems with the console version before but thought that after a year of development plus several months of waiting that things would get sorted out. Boy was I wrong.First title I've had a refund issued for. It's not worth the price they're asking for it and moreso if you had already played the SP on console.Consider the following If this is your first time buying the game and you're mainly interested in the single player experience everything here is fine and plays as expected with the added benefit of visual fidelity you wouldn't get on either a last or current generation console.

2017-06-13,0,0,508,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar is essentially the Anti Fun Police being run by Chief Take Two Ineractive regarding GTA Online.Why you may ask? Well let me demonstrate.They release 'free' DLC. 'Free' but only if you grind harder than a stripper trying to get a raise or blow more money than the guy paying for that grinding. Rockstar doesn't want you to enjoy their game they want you to thrive on it and basically slap you if you don't give them their money even though you already paid a 60 DOLLAR PRICE POINT FOR A SEVERAL YEAR OLD GAME!Updates come frequently sure. But if you don't have 3 4 5 million dollars plus whatever side expenses that don't come with those addons you won't get to play it and you certainly won't make more money doing it. As example if you want to play the Import/Export expansion you have to first buy a CEO Tower then you have to follow up and buy a warehouse for those cars. Something that can cost way more money than you were willing to get in for. On top of this missions don't pay as much as they should in order for you to maintain at least a level of wealth in this game. Small basic missions pay as much as $10 000 dollars no where near enough to even pay for a decent car upgrade. When the difficulties start getting harder it still doesn't pay as much as it should. Harder missions only pay out at best $25 000 somewhere still no where near what should be given out. If payments were more fair then it'd be fine. Such as $75 000 $100 000 would be much more fair but Rockstar doesn't want that as you'll buy Shark Cards out of frustration. Heists are another level of a joke though. Heists once again pay no where near what they should. Making only several hundred grand for a 3 5 level setup followed by the heist itself. The heists 'split' payment is dumb amongst itself. Only at most $1 000 000 to a player if all other players take a small 5% hit. Not to mention on top of this the difficulty curve of these are extremely unrealistic in terms of gameplay. Bots have aimbot like aim capable of hitting you in the head with pin point accuracy with a submachine gun that even a high level player couldn't do even if they tried. In the end this game is a joke multiplayer wise. The development team clearly cares very little for it now as all they do is take away fun whenever there is some to be had by nerfing or removing things to get clear of problems. The people in charge are nothing but greedy old men that clearly have no understanding of the modern game industry and need to be fired and/or removed from their position of power. You want fun? Go play a game that doesn't force you to look to spending more money than it's already worth.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,366,False,Not Recommended,Wow all I have to say is wow.Personally I don't belive this game was ever cracked up to what it was supposed to be but I can't say I haven't had a good time on this game before now that's completely changed.For the longest time I was always hopeful for R* to get the funding and development support from Take Two so that they could make new heists (because the amount that is current is just laughable). Yeah that never happened. The only thing that they've added in the last few years are novelty cars most of which aren't even good a few guns a few gamemodes and pointless new missions (like the whole CEO and Gun Runners thing) just so you have a chance at affording the massively overpriced stuff they add in these updates.This game is a pay to win grind at the very best. There are people that will literally spend hundreds of dollars of real money for the currency in game just to buy the newest most overpowered vehicles first. There is no real reason to try and beat these guys because all they do is buy more and more items in game with real cash. The only ways you can catch up to them areA Grind missions for literally dozens of hours B Pay money to catch up and get all the cool new stuffC Randomly come across a hacker that's dropping money (obviously not the preferred way)And now Take Two shuts down the SINGLEPLAYER MODDING COMMUNITY. There is no reason for them to honestly do that except to get more people to play multiplayer so that they generate more revenue. This makes me worry about all the other games that Take Two owns (like Kerbal Space Program) because who knows what else they'll do if we let them get away with being a bunch of like this.TL DR DON'T BUY THIS GAME. All it will do is frustrate you whenever you don't have money because you'll have to grind missions for hours just so you can avoid dying from the people who spend hundreds to pay to win. And on the singleplayer side of things they shut down literally the only reason to play singleplayer because the story is mediocre at best. Take Two are a bunch of and R* is a money .,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-24,1,1,18,False,Recommended,"Firstly please keep in mind this review comes from someone who played Vice City (PSP) and IV (PC) and wasn't very fond of either this isn't written from an experienced GTA player.What first got me to like this game was how well made it was how smooth and polished it was on the tutorial and later open word was then there was the attention to detail after I found myself watching 15minutes of real time watching ingame telivision yeah... I was kind of impressed. Gun play to me seemed very well made practical compared to the previous two games I played not including Vice City as that was on a PSP not fair to compare.I won't mention the story for obvious spoiler all I'll say is so far I'm enjoying it.As with all open world games I love the various ways to do things whether meaningless or story based.

2017-12-09,0,0,348,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well realised world and tells a story that s gripping thrilling and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and there s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,OpenIV is back to GTA V on PC! PC Gamers win again!However I will not retract my negative review from this game. TakeTwo tried to screw us and they deserve to have lowered ratings because of their anti consumer behaiviour. Besides that there are tons of other reasons not to buy this game.Micro transactions are shoved up your left and right in this game. Grinding is okay but the sheer amount of hours you have to put in to make enough money is insane. Unless you have all the time in the world you'd have to buy shark cards which is all part of R*'s plan to milk us as much as possible.The story is decent but there wasn't ONE SINGLE MISSION which was challenging. This is not an exaggeration. I know the game isn't supposed to be a real challenge but come on give me something.Many of the side missions have no substance to them. They are obviously included just to increase the time to reach 100% completion. Tons of these side missions just have you running aorund looking for parts evading the police or rampaging.Now that mods are back GTA is fun. However I don't really think you should support these guys. I would say they're almost as bad as EA/Ubisoft at this point.I love the GTA games but please think about your supporters!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-01,0,0,103,False,Recommended,This review is really for those who want it for the single player as I wouldn't dare touch the multi player with all it's hackers campers and God only knows what else. Gameplay wise this game is pretty good however it isn't perfect. Combat plays similar to FarCry (if you couldn't heal without med kits) in my opinion. The first person mode makes shooting easier for some but the view is variable (obviously). Melee is somewhat strange to me as simply attacking with any weapon up close triggers it. This could be useful to some but I would have to get used to it for me to enjoy it myself. If you want this game for combat it's fairly good but not worth $60 alone for. The features in this game are pretty cool as you can customize a variety of things such as your characters appearance. The driving is decent but realistic (ish). There are quite a few extra activities which could push for much longer gameplay. The story is good but not insanely good. The controls for basic movement/combat are good but flight controls could do better. Lastly the graphics in my opinion are pretty good. You wouldn't mistake the graphics for real life but they are pretty good.My honest opinion is that this game is worth playing but not worth irresponsibly blowing extra cash into the SHARK cards or anything. I would recommend getting it on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-23,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Definitely a worthy successor to GTA IV (cousin! let us go bowling!) GTA V takes the classic 3D era GTA formula and runs away with it. With a map of unpresidented size new vehicles and weapons as well as many gameplay elements that will seem very familiar to seasoned GTA players V is clearly one of the best GTA games to date. The graphical fidelity in the PC release is incredible (especially if coupled with the many graphical mods that are available) and rockstar has taken the time to make the controls of a title that was originally meant for consoles be adequite for a keyboard as well. One thing that disappointed me was that the first person mode one of the main selling points of the rework is not really viable. The gun models are large and visibility is generally limited making first person mode a generally worse experience. And while in theory a first person GTA game would be incredible the execution of this plan by rockstar seems like it was not given enough time. Had it been more polished this may not be true. However as it stands the first person mode is not viable will inhibit your experience if you try to play the whole game with it and serves only as a gimmick to attract a disgruntled market demographic that waited two years after release to get it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Did not go to work for 2 days and put in about 20 hrs during those 2 days 2015/10 will skip work againand to be really honest this is the first GTA I have played and it absolutely held my attention from the first moment I launched the game its that good. Did not have any launch problems and got a sold 60 fps nealry all the time. It shows the amount of time they have put into the port with all the plethora of options available to the PC gamers.Not a single crash occurred during the 43 hours of gameplay between me and my roommate (yes we are pretty cheap and share a single copy of the game xD ).And to all the detractors out there you need to understand that when a million copies are sold not all will work on day one and atleast 20 percent of the purchaser base wont be able to play it. Buy this game its an absolute delight you wont regret it a single bit and it will also show that PC ports can be an absolute delight if done right (yes im talking to you ubisoft you suck and someone should wipe you out of the face of this earth)Anyways to conclude BUY THIS U WONT REGRET IT,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-01,0,0,261,False,Recommended,The game is centered around three characters Michael Trevor and Franklin. Michael is a retired crook in witness protection sitting on his money and raising his family. Trevor is Michael s old friend and accomplice in crime and is a complete psychopath who just wants to kill steal and get drunk all at the same time. Franklin is the young gangster wanting to do more that sling dope and throw up gang signs. He wants to rob banks and then live it up in a mansion.The game starts out with Franklin and his homie Lamar repoing some cars for their boss Simian he is a car dealer who scammed people out of money. Franklin eventually ends up trying to take Michael's sons car. Michael is hiding in the back of the car when Franklin takes it from his Michael s house. Michael tells Franklin to drive the car in to the front of Simian dealership. Michael tells Franklin to quit his job stealing cars and join him and rob a jewelry store. Trevor sees the jewelry robbery on the news and recognizes that Michael did the robbery. Trevor hasn't seen Michael in 19 years. He goes and finds Michael at his home in Los Santos (a fictional patrol of Los Angeles) and finds him. They decide to pull a big heist and then retire.Gameplay is mostly like all other GTA s. You walk around and steal cars and get into trouble. The car s handling has changed drasikley from GTA 4 No more of the heavy realistic driving now its very arcady I didn't really like this change I prefer realism in my games. The cars are too floaty and they seem to bounce off everything they touch. The shooting is vastly improved from all the other GTA s. The music selection is bad and I mean BAD. There are no recognizable songs apart from 10 15 songs that are good out of the 240 licensed songs! If you think thats no big deal then what are you supposed to listen to in the car while driving?The driving and the music are the only two things that frustrated me the most in this installment. But I digress I love this game I've put about 500hrs into the game on the Xbox 360 and PS4 and I still can't get enough of it. If you're a fan of GTA it s a must buy. If you like a good story this game s got it. If you like open world games buy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-19,0,0,1073,False,Recommended,GTA V provides a lot of improves over its previous installments in both the single player and multiplayer areas of the game. For one the ability to change protaginists through the story in V is one of the greatest additions to the franchise in recent years. The characters themselves have the ability to elicit emotions from the player (good or bad your be the judge) but overall really make you become invested in the story and the outcome.The single player game from start to finish is quite lengthy and most people would find it impossible to even finish the story missions in one day. While there are a lot of side missions a lot of them really feel like padding and contribute little to nothing to the other all game. The same can be said for the collectables. It feels more like a chore than a treat to have to search for each and every special collectable without a proper map system to make finding them easier. I am willing to accept the fact that these are meant to be difficult to find but some were more frustrating than they had to be.Breaking it down the spaceship parts and the letters were fairly straight forward. Most of their locations were easy to find and you could do it realtively quickly. The Nuke waste was different and required the use of the trackify app. Unfortunatly due to the span in which all the nuke waste was scattered around the ocean trackify would often show that you would need to head directly through the centre of the map in order to get to the next cannister. Several times this resulted in me beaching the sub. The Knife Flights and Under The Bridges challenges were again nothing special. Not hard just tedious. By far however the most frustrating to get of all them are the stunt jumps. Odd landing zones finiky camera controls and poorly planned landing areas lead to many hours of frustration (pro tip use a quick save) due to the fact that the actual landing zones are never clear. Sometimes you would have to clear a certain object or land on a certain roof rather than actually clearing said object. For the core gameplay however and story this game alone is worth the cost most of the qualms I have are with the majority of tasks that 99% of people will not do anyways.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-02-08,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,Overall a fun game but I can swim IRL and can't in this game.

I guess I'll just stick with the RD franchise instead it was better anyway just isn't on PC. (,Grand Theft Auto V

Steering wheel and flight stick is not supported though which is a shame. people got problems making their laptop gpu running the game.GTA is GTA you run around blow up stuff doing missions climbing the ranks and making cash. The game has got crazy characters and during the game you get to play as different characters with different lives. despite this during game they will meet and work together to achieve their goals. When you arent doing missions there is also tons of activities you can do. My overall impression is that GTA 5 is just a little bit different in terms of features compared to GTA 5 but it still feels way more fun and overall higher quality.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Not much has to be said about the Grand Theft Auto series as Rockstar always manages to deliver an outstanding experience.The single player campaign starts slow and somewhat lackluster but eventually builds momentum as you're introduced to more exciting personalities and missions. Some of the story elements are oddly written at times and feel a bit off enough to kill the excitement. The second half of the game is pretty on point with no real complaints. Lots of great dialogue and setpiece moments as expected. Tons of content here even if you just do the main story missions... expect 20 hours or more of gameplay just for the main story.GTA Online leaves a lot to be desired. Getting into a game with friends can be a real challenge sometimes. Starting missions and heists causes you and others to connect to a new game instance. The swapping from freeroam to missions and back causes so many loading screens that it gets really obnoxious really quickly. When you go back to freeroam there is no guarantee you're even playing with the same people you were originally. It's a real headache just trying to do a variety of things with friends. Console players are also allowed to transfer their characters over meaning you could be facing level 100+ people as a person who just started playing for the first time. The online mode should have been done differently more like how APB handles it. It's a real letdown but still can be good fun if you enjoy the sandboxing.Overall it's GTA on PC. It looks great and it runs great. Definitely worth the money.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can blame Rockstar Take Two o whoever you want but people is like that. There's no online game without toxic people and this game is a good place for them. Some people will try to ruin your game just for fun.Biggest problem modders. You will find a hacker in every two games. I find it unbelievable how usual it is to find a hacker. I really can't understand how Rockstar doesn't have anything prepared to detect them as soon as they're triggered because they're everywhere literally. It's a huge problem you'll have to find a new server very often. Also you'll see a lot of kids asking for modders in the chat.If you can get around hackers and toxic people you will find a great game. You can do missions play minigames races and make a lot different things. It's hard to get all the stuff you want though as things are expensive and you'll need to spend a lot of time to get all the money you need to buy them.Apart from the online you have the singleplayer wich is very good too although you'll end up playing online or not playing at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar Editor is absolute garbage you can't do anything useful with it apart from changing camera angle and now I can't use mods to make decent videos. Take Two claim they've pulled mods to stop hackers but what they've actually done is crushed the GTA community and slit the throats of the fandom who hunger for new content in the form of pictures and videos. These mods have been active for years why pull them now? It makes no sense and it's killed the creativity of hundreds if not thousands of people who have produced these mods in the first place or use them to create content for GTA fans. Mods are literally the only thing giving this game life and they just pulled the plug on them! Take Two suck. I don't care how good RDR2 will be GTA 6 may as well never happen for me because unless something is done to reinstate the existing mods I will never buy another game associated with T2 and if it were possible I'd be taking action against them to claim money back for downloading GTA5 from Steam (AND buying the damn disks) and getting a gaming PC specifically for modding to make videos. Take Two are either too lazy or too stupid to find a way to block hackers and instead they've just crushed a community of people who just want to have fun offline/in story mode. We weren't hurting anyone least of all Take Two and now years of people's hard work and investment have gone down the drain because of T2's greed and stupidity. Take Two you're a disgrace.

2017-06-17,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,"The story is terrible. All of the characters are unlikeable malicious who basically all become evil for no real reason with no redeeming qualities aside from ""well at least they're not as bad as Trevor."" All of the game's social commentary is blunt and forced as to make no sense within the game world such as the game's Apple equivalent bragging to people on stage about how they're stealing everyone's personal information and calling everyone idiots to their faces and then they applaud for... being called idiots i guess???Gameplay is pretty bland. A solid 70% of the game is driving from mission to mission. And the mission will normally either be shooting (which I admit is rather polished and feels quite good) driving (that's really fun. Driving to a mission it's a driving mission and then you drive to the next mission which is also a driving mission etc) or the game's forced melee combat / stealth / whatever useless minigame they decide to throw at you. The game is plagued by overproduction in a lot of places such as a mandatory ""cut through a steel grate"" minigame near the end of the game that takes a solid 2 minutes to complete and isn't even really a game. You just slowly drag a steel cuter over a grate. There's no time limit or imminent threat or reason for the minigame to even BE there outside of showing off the game's production value with no regard to actual gameplay or flow. So unless you're shooting stuff the game usually feels pretty bland or uninteresting.Multiplayer is constantly updated but can be borderline impossible to play without friends. You MUST complete missions to level up and you cannot play missions by yourself. My experience with the online of this game has been waiting in lobbies for THREE hours total and not getting a single game cause nobody wants to join the new players game so effectively I'm not allowed to play the multiplayer in a $60 triple A product because the devs decided to level gate 99% of the content and that matchmaking shouldn't be a thing.Oh and also they killed the game's modding which was the only thing that could make the game interesting in a lot of ways. So there's that too.",Grand Theft Auto V

Lets suppose the last update the smugglers update which is set you to make money while the reality is that few days of heavy grinding (by yourself) will grant you under a million thats ofcourse if a player in a hydra will not make all of these crates vanish. So the conclusion is that lots of work will give you a low payout. Another thing to that is the ""hydra"" mentioned before of which players use such vechicle to gain satisfaction over killing or stealing another weaker players crates a.k.a s.

The online is a pile of stinking The amount of time grinding to get somewhere its just like Rockstar wants you to spend 50 quid on the shark card system. And if you like the shiny new cars and plane in the smugglers run dlc learn how to get mods and spawn them in on singleplayer. But as i say with the addition of first person it so more immersive and fantastic.

2018-07-09,0,0,805,False,Recommended,"Steam having ""mixed"" ratings for a game like GTAV is confirmation that the overall Steam ratings community is squewed toward indie developers niche interests and other views that simply aren't reliable when compared to other review sources. I think there's a legitimate comparison (and critisim) between the great ratings of obscure indie films just aren't that great (unless you're burnt out from film school and having burt the last several years trying to make indie movies) and great ratings of obscure indie games on Steam. I realize that making a video game with your college firend or w/e is hard and worth some level or praise maybe a considerable level of praise (I certainly couldn't do it) but video game development has moved passed such development structure regardless of how smart you may be. No I'm not interested on what could arguably be compared to somethign I had on my NES decades ago and here's a reason Nintendo isn't either. It's not really fresh and it's just not really that great. So while my sense is that there's enough cheerleaders that are fans of niche interest games and that's great I think my point stand that Steam review represent a disproportionate aggregate of such views and therefore isn't that relevant for the rest of us that are merely average (or below average in my case) intellence. So carry on with your video game analogs of a black and white russion indie movie about nuns suicide and w/e. I'll look for my reviews elsewhere. GTA V was awesome.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-04,2,1,1046,False,Not Recommended,"(WARNING! this is a rant that gets out of hand)I cant lie and say i never had fun on this game and really i still do but honestly they ruined this game. I'm not even a modder whatsoever even for singleplayer so them getting rid of mods didn't even affect me at all. That being said they still ruined the game with the new gun running dlc. If you thought the rail gun would be OP in multiplayer the explosive sniper makes the rail gun look stupid and the other vehicles and weapons are just as OP to the point where if you were to try to play the game now as a level 1 with no money you would get absolutely defecated on by people like me who know the game inside out and have everything. BST which doubles the damage you do and halves the damage you take + Bullet proof Helmet + Armor + being whatever level it is that gives you the maximum ammount of health actually makes you unkillable unless you were to literally stand still and do nothing. The first pistol in the game would literally have just about a 0 percent chance to kill someone in the new vehicles unless you were within 1 shot headshot range and they weren't wearing a helmet which negates the extra headshot damage. It just makes the PvP completely unenjoyable for experienced players. Now part of that isn't technically the game's fault. It's everyone else that tries to use sticky bombs to blow up your car but then when you shoot them in the head with 1 bullet before the sticky even leaves their hand they call you a hacker. Then as soon as they spawn they try to kill you again so as soon as they turn the corner you 1 tap them them with the carbine rifle while they try to spin up the minigun they call you a hacker then when you proceed to kill everyone in the lobby with the marksman rifle everyone calls you a hacker... Then you get kicked from the lobby because GTA V is apparently now like the game Second Life. It's no longer about shooting people it's about driving your super cars in a completely broken physics engine. Look up the RE7B speed glitch.... Now they did patch that but most people dont know that kind of still applies to the 811 the Comet Retro Custom the Rapid GT and a bunch of other cars Then god forbid you actually know a thing or two about driving a car and you do races. Not even counting the broken cars i just mentioned and many more broken mechanics like the attribute they give to some cars called ""tires can clip"" basically.... You equip off road tires.... and basically... your car becomes a rocket powered siberian sprinting cheetah with the agility of... idk something really agile.... *get's called hacker again* yet they for some reason make bikes more agile? despite the fact that in real life bikes actually handle a lot worse than cars. Now after all of that i do have to point out that i am indeed a car enthusiast and i play a lot of simulators like Assetto Corsa so obviously after having a game like GTA IV where the handling was realistic i feel like i was let down with GTA V. also most super cars only have a top speed of 120mph/193kmh. Yup that's right... cant even go faster than a real life ae86. Cause a stock 1980's toyota corolla should definitely be faster than every super car in this game. Actually it should... The car is legendary it's even in this game... Called the Futo... Which is supposed to mean Tofu plus they have rims in the game called Fujiwara... cause Initial D cause tofu delivery. That's about the only good thing in the game except it's not a sprinter trueno but instead a levin coupe... Still ae86 and still good though. Enough about cars back to the game. Rockstar has definitely messed up on this game big time. lets not forget the ammount of times they delayed the game advertised heists in the online TRAILER then the game came out online wasn't available for at weeks.... Then it didn't work for a solid month then you found out that heists wasn't in the game then you found out it was coming out in the winter then they said they were gonna release it in spring summer? hello????????? They had so long to develop heists then BAMMMMMMMMMM huge let down. Once heists finally came out.... I had no desire to play it. Everyone only did and still only does the Pacific Standard Job I've done it too many times i know all the glitches in the setup to skip certain steps in some of the setup missions and the kuruma glitch. What does this have to do with anything? Ohhhhh yeah that's right the fact that unless you get lucky with modders and DONT get banned and unless you want to hand over more money to Rockstar for shark cards..... YOU GOTTA GRIND. Not too bad if people actually did half the activities. Even when the game was at it's peak half the stuff was still dead. As much as i hate this game i still enjoy it so if you want an open world game where you can do just about anything It's still nice to pick up on sale and play with some friends. Honestly if you get the game now you might not be as disappointed because your expectations won't be as high!

They have terrible connection always seem to boot people and send you back into single player mode. Everyone has issues with getting kicked from sessions and lagging out for no apparent reason. and from mine and friends experience if 1 person is lagging in the lobby everybody lags it doesnt even have to be the host.secondly there are far too many modders not being banned. everyone seems to get away with modding and playing the game unfairly.thirdly the heists engineering is terrible. it all starts in the lobby where people join and leave constantly then you get into game and someone either leaves or dies for 1 you shouldnt have to wait 25 minutes to start up a heist and when you get in game if someone leave or dies that isnt critical to the heist the heist should continue (example. 2 people need to steal a cop car one leaves the other should be able to carry on solo). and at the bottom line if people leave heist they should be either banned or placed on a very punishing timer until they can do heists or missions again.all in all this game is a joke rockstar have no priority maintaining the game or fixing the issues. the game would be great if people didnt leave and if the heists didnt quit over deaths or players leaving. and lastly fix the sessions and servers so i dont get thrown into single player all the time.tamaug gives 3/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-22,0,0,138,False,Recommended,One of the best open world sandbox games you will find if not THEE best. However the company seems to recognize this to a degree that is a bit sickening.If you shell out the $ required to become OP on this game then you will have fun to the point where you start missing work and require an addiction counselor at some point. Just the fact that you have to spend hundreds of IRL dollars to gain your power or be willing to put hundreds of hours in to get to that level it creates an experience so depthy that it starts to infatuate.This game is so bittersweet it is the definition.Example Buy GTA 5($60)Realize it's a bomb af open world experience GTA 5 online and is just unique and groundbreaking in concept.*If you just stop there and find satisfaction just stop trust me the rest is f*ckin brutality in a cycle.Buy 20 dollar shark/steam card to fund your experience buy a house a car some guns armor other cool sh*t. You've bought one or the other and now suddenly realize you just spent 20 dollars on that 1 f*ckin thing either you've just bought a house with no cars in the garage or a car with no garage to put it in it's mad expensive.So now a bit annoyed you decide to go pump another 20 in REAL QUICK and be done with it. You're all setup with a car and a house now it's time to make some money without spending more real money!You go around and steal cars do missions etc... you play for 5 hours doing nothing but grinding and earn about 50 150k You suddenly realize that you just spent 5 hours earning roughly 1 2(irl) dollars.*By this time real frustration kicks in it is becoming obvious what they want you to do now. You research into it a little bit and realize that you need to be spending even more $$$ to have the oppertunity(yes the oppertunity) to have a shot at making more money doing special missions activated only by spending millions more. There is a crossroads at this point if you've come this far(which I'm willing to wager a good portion of people who own this game have put in 20 50 dollars at least one time.) you can either pump more $ in play as is or just abandon.Example ends here I chose to end here because there is a pattern in this game and i've laid it all out already you can chose to insert a few different titles here and there and you will have the same pattern but an entirely different portion of the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-10,0,0,490,False,Not Recommended,After over 450 hours put into GTA V and GTA Online I'm finally calling it quits. It's become such a chore to play every time a friend asks. The game itself is beautiful and very well made save for the immense grinds to get the money to buy anything. But the online community is awful and the devs are far more concerned with earning money than dealing with modders and griefers. I would not recommend it to anyone that I know and I will not recommend it here. I used to love this game and I kept coming back to it hoping that it would be better. But it's only gotten worse. I'd say that it's like an abusive relationship but at least you don't have to pay money for one of those.,Grand Theft Auto V

Sure the contents there but when you have to wait an hour to do ANYTHING online then its not worth experiencing. OK so you have heists that need all players to survive in order to complete an interesting gameplay mechanic which would otherwise be fine if you didn't have to sit with your thumb up your waiting for the missions to reload for 10 minutes at a time. Task this with the endless ery that people commit in online lobbies and its practically impossible to complete a single heist in one playthrough. Hell it's hard to get a heist going with 2 extra friends waiting for that extra person to complete heists with you. Imagine running a heist by yourself? You NEED people who you know and are willing to play this for hours on end in a single playthrough and honestly that's just not viable in this day and age.,Grand Theft Auto V

If someone dies/quits/blinks everyone fails.5) No online cheat protection. You could see people level 300 on the first week of its release.6) Too many money sinks. (example if you customize a car with wheel A then switch to wheel B you'll have to pay full price again to switch back to A)If you got banned by the recent ban wave you either A) were a cheater/hacker and deserve the banB) used something to modify a game which may or not have given you an unfair advantage and knew the risk you were takingSo suck it up and stop writing bad reviews because you were banned.

2015-07-29,0,0,413,False,Recommended,Played GTA 5 since back on PS3 had tones of fun lvled up 2 chars and even thought Rockstar ed the game up with some patches (Online mode) the game is still amazing inside out the story mode (offline) is awesome and it takes a while to complete not a 1 day game (unless you have no life but then still not sure if you could finish it in 24 hours) epic way of using 3 characters instead of 1 Main. Well long story short it's worth to buy the game just for the Online tones of players loads of fun updates now and then that add great contect and so I not only bought the PS3 version but spend another 40 odd quid to buy the PC version as well.Game worth buying as it gives thousands of hours of playing (I did 120h+ on pc but I played over 500h on PS3 before so I had my char transferred and all that so I don't have to spend so much time on it now).,Grand Theft Auto V

The graphics are stunning gameplay is very fun and tons to do.The problem is with the lackluster response to hacking that has primarily killed the online player base. Along with the lack of mod support from Rockstar. Had gta5 been an open source modable game it would have joined the ranks of games you can't get rid of but that is sadly not the case.

Honestly if you're a 12 year old haHAA then you are fine to go online and be a and do anything you want because cops are a joke. If you want realism this is not it period. If you want to play this game solo this game is not for you. If you even want to go on and try to make friends and do stuff with people.... this game is not for you. If you already have a group of friends and want to play the game do stuff together well it might be for you as long as you don't join a full up server.Everything that you do out in the open is flagged for everyone to see which is what makes this game a giant dog turd online. If it was a bit more realistic and you actually had to find the things that were going on ""behind the scenes"" like they should be it would be way better. Hey want to go online and do some drug shipments or maybe deliver some other goods from our warehouses... welp ya can't why? Because everyone on that server sees what you are doing and everyone will gun for you. Every step of the way you are tracked.... hell even just walking around you are flagged... on the map. Who the f*** is this game for other than complete a$$***** no one.The single player is a lot of fun well put together and you can run around in this giant world trying to build an empire... but... you can only do so much. They force you into multiplayer in order to do new content like the biker gangs warehouses and such. I really feel as if they robbed me from content I figured would all be a part of the game. I don't understand how they feel it is all right to publish all of this content and never mention that... by the way... its only in multiplayer. And what I don't get is why? The game has already been killed off by hackers all of the records have been claimed by them billions of dollars have been given away.... but you have to do this stuff online with other people... why?? Why can't me and a few friends get together in private and do them together? and allow everyone to do that? I just don't get it and if you think you have a point to make I haven't thought of you're fooling yourself. I get for races and deathmatch and all that stuff needs to happen online vs other people duhr but all of this new stuff should be allowed in private. You still send that information to them when you do them there is no difference. And why is everything flagged from where people are to shipments running around the map to planes boats people are driving. It makes absolutely no sense and ruins the immersion for me. Single player probably 9/10 multiplayer 1/10 only because it has it.Remember this is my personal opinion I am not looking for fanboys to come flame I've loved gta since the very first this one just misses the mark because they add all of this stuff and it is just something I'll never be able to see.

All three characters Michael Franklin and Trevor have no personality what so ever. I mean you know nothing about Franklin and he's arguably the main character. Michael has a little background and Trevor has the most.Not to mention it's been getting major lag problems even when I'm on high FPS and a strong internet connection the game is delayed when I turn my car it's delayed by a few seconds and sometimes my car and character continue to go forward despite me not holding a key down. In short too little time went into the story and lag issues.For a game that brought in 2 Billion on the first day what a let down. Online is tedious for me and the story is horrible. I could sum the story up in a sentence. ""Three guys who rob banks"" I mean yeah Michael has some family problems but they took over too much of the game's time ones that don't relate to the story and are involving Michael's family should stay as stranger's and freak's missions. Franklin does nothing but shoot and gangbang we learn all about his ex Girl. Like I said the most developed character is Trevor. In the small funny cutscenes we get when we switch the Trevor reveals more about his character than Michael and Franklin do in the whole game.Ending statement Too many developers getting paid big money too little effort.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-02-02,0,0,776,False,Recommended,The most expanssive GTA game in the frasnchise. With things like an active stock market and an in game internet this chapter of GTA takes it to a entirely new level. My only warning is this your Campaign mode save file is saved locally on your hard drive. It is not backed up to Rockstar cloud servers like your multiplayer progression. If you choose to reformat the drive containing your save file make sure to back it up. I made this mistake and I am now replaying the campaign mode that I previously had beat. However the game is good enough to enjoy the campaign mode all over again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-31,1,2,142,False,Recommended,"Both halves of GTA5 are probably best described as ""Great game but pacing problems.""Single player gives you a great story great world great characters satisfying driving and shooting. The problem lies in the 7 boring fetch missions you do for every mind blowing pedal to the metal heist. They go all out on making you feel the slice of life criminal story which means you're going to do a LOT of grunt work and not get paid for it.Multi player is a lot of fun but there's 5 minutes of load times when you join someone's game and then 5 minutes of load times when you leave their game (return to yours). This happens absolutely every time you switch players or missions. It is entirely possible to load for 5 arrive at a player's game have him quit and then load for 5 to get back.That's awful.

2017-08-30,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,Nope. Single player story is so so nothing compared to GTA VC or SA so the online game is basically everything you really got for buying this. However honest and creative modders are constantly banned and nothing happens to the actual hackers while legit players are punished for being in a session with one of them. Also online items prices are so high and requires a lot of grinding time unless you're hacking. By the way the online community is getting smaller and smaller...I can't really recommend this even though I had some fun at the beginning. Now I'd just advice to pop in any previous GTA installments and give it a go for the old times.,Grand Theft Auto V

I absolutely cannot recommend this game until they figure out how to get the game running without Social Club DRM failing to initialize. Don't get me wrong. The game itself is epic. The problem here for me at least is that I can maybe play 30 seconds to up to 30 minutes before the game game crashes and an error message stating ""Failed to initialize"" appears on the Rockstar Social Club overlay. I contacted support about this and they gave me all sorts of suggestions in the first couple of days none of which fixed the issue. Then suddenly no more response from Rockstar. They basically just left me hanging. I originally bought this game on my PS3...so I've already played through it. I bought it on PC because I was excited to use mods then the crashes started happening then I read this article http //www.pcgamer.com/grand theft auto 5 patch kills mod support/So buyer beware as of this review constant game crashes and no mod support. My review for this game will change if these two issues are fixed.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-30,1,1,74,False,Not Recommended,I bought this for the single player. I was very disappointed with Grand Theft Auto 4's crazy lag. GTA San Andreas was good until the flying mission. Didn't play much of Vice City but it didn't impress me. GTA3 was probably the laggiest most unplayable game in the history of video games. I liked the 2d games but those were from ages ago and not the direction that the franchise went with.So I didn't really have high hopes for GTA5. But all the reviews were glowing. So I reluctantly bought it at a premium price ( 40 or something).Well it doesn't lag on my computer so it has GTA3 and GTA4 beat. But it's not fun. It's boring. And crazy easy. The checkpoints are good because I didn't like having to drive to the mission again in previous games. But there's numerous checkpoints within the mission. There should have just been one at the start. And even then if you don't want to do the missions you can skip them. But how bad a player would you have to be to not be able to complete the missions? I've nearly finished the game and there was only one mission I had trouble with. But in order to solve this problem I just reloaded to an earlier save and bought some armour. I can write a book on why this game isn't any good but I'll leave it here. I haven't played the online portion but from what I've read I'm not missing anything.Pwninator score 2/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-22,0,0,526,False,Not Recommended,This is one of the greatest games ever made ruined by the desire for profits. People used mods because the base game play is so grindy that it feels like it was designed with the sole purpose of making you purchase a shark card. I wouldn't mind this so much if shark cards weren't so overpriced. 20 dollars for 1.25 million dollars? Are you me? That's about half of some of the high end cars in the game an even smaller fraction of a modified car or many of the other toys you can buy. The grind for money isn't fun neither is paying real money for paltry amounts of online cash (especially when things like musical horns for cars are $25000 and mines are $5000 a pop.) Either drastically increase the payouts give way more money for shark cards alla 1m/1$ to start or better yet get rid of them altogether.Or allow mods. I have never modded V myself. (did mod IV)P.s. remember when we petitioned to get GTA on the pc platform at all?

GTA V brings a good variety of memorable characters and dialogue that make a fun singleplayer story with a lot of cool missions.I wouldn't recommend this for multiplayer only as it becomes quite dull. Even though the content for Online looks overwhelming at first there just isn't very much to do in Online. Pretty much 90% of the people play Freemode only and modes like races and deathmatches rarely fill up with a decent amount of players. It's still worth playing Online but I don't feel like the price is justified when you buy it for just the Online component (even though I did spend a majority of my time on it I mostly just screwed around explored like I would in Singleplayer and spent time modifying cars and create weird outfits),Grand Theft Auto V

The drop in price did not lead to any sort of value being attained as the game is still unplayable for some people due to a D3D_GFX error. Googling the problem solved noting for me as most discussions on this issue were a year old and the general consensus was to de clock your video card in order to play for longer stretches of time before the error. Unacceptable R*. Absolutely unacceptable. Steam was excellent though and issued a refund within a few days. For all the hate Steam gets they sure do get a lot of things right.

The story mode is pretty lengthy yet somewhat weaker in my personal opinion than other GTAs especially IV but it is a nice balance between the GTA IV and GTA SA atmosphere. There are plenty of side missions to part take in like bike races state wide triathalons by running swimming and biking... Shooting range challanges and more... Get a sports car and take part in street races.Hang out with friends which is now optional to hear unique conversations like in IV.Darts are back too bad it's only available on one spot on the entire map.Plenty of collectibles some are VERY interesting I have to say. The little Peyote minigame which has ITS OWN secrets R* style is a unique and very welcome change of gameplay!You can poop on people as a bird and do other stuff as other animals.&amp quot .. I'm a dolphin!""You can even use the submarine and dive underwater to see whales sharks dolphins sea turtles... and much... much... MUCH MORE.GTA OnlineAnd if that's not enough... dive into GTA Online create your own character and do all the above alone or with friends where you can rise from being a petty drug delivery boy for some local hoods... to a major CEO of your own company.Purchase and achieve anything you've ever wanted from Buying one of many houses apartments or condos in the game.Purchasing a car motorcycle bicycle boat... helicopter... ect...If that's nothing for you... How about a luxury yacht or your very own attack helicopter or APC!Ever wanted to start your own Motorcycle Club? You can buy and costimuze a clubhouse and run guns drugs or stolen goods with your friends!Or perhaps you've always wanted to rob your very first major bank.If not... You could always buy your multi million dollar underground bunker and research new and unique weapon attachments and maybe even encounter some extraterestrial individuals!Grand Theft Auto V delivers in all it's aspects and is truly a masterpiece!*My only problem with this game is the somewhat lazy writing the lack of Singleplayer DLC which was promised and the overpriced economy in GTA Online. That said I'm still playing regularly even on singleplayer. No mods besides a trainer and some beta stuff.",Grand Theft Auto V

But cause of a friend begging me to get it so I could play it with him +there was a sale that time I decided to risk my money and go ahead.Knowing that so many innocents get banned I got the idea that the number of hackers/cheaters would be nicely under control...Well............. I was wrong...Let's just say before getting this game I have encountered something like 2 or 3 hackers/cheaters throughout my entire gaming life. ONLY 3 HACKERS IN 14 YEARS!!! (I started to game since I was 5 and now I'm 19)Aaaand now? Let's just say I see 2 or 3 EVRY BLEEDING DAY!!!Hackers that just ruin all the fun and take away the opportunity for the poor new people to earn some money the fair way...Newbie abuse Is also a big thing here (Veteran players that take the weakness of this one player of being new to an advantage to screw him over.Don't get me wrong I sometimes find nice people that help me and even become friends with me but for gods sakes the amount of griefers and cheaters Just makes it to be not even CLOSE to redeeming it.So many problems and yet rockstar does nothing but adding new content... And that stupid OP flying bike with homing missiles I just want to kill anyone that uses it.I still play the game cause its fun but god dammit the player base cause me to rage so much that I shouted to the point of my neighbors calling the police.And removing the ability for one to create his own private session and allow only his friends to join ""HELPS TO MUCH""I'm being rather sarcastic cause rockstar is so damn greedy and selfish about their player base that I just don't want to take this seriously. And to be honest... I'd love if rockstar ban me for this review cause it will make me have an even better proof of how people they are. Yes I'd have my money wasted on a game I can't play anymore but hey! I'll pay way more then the price of this game if its to expose a greedy and selfish dev team since I actually want to do some good!Just know if your looking for a fun and enjoyable game with a fair bit of stuff to do then go ahead and get this game but I'm warning you You won't be able to avoid those griefers and cheaters they're just everywhere and I bet you'll be a victim of a bunch of them in the first day just like I was.",Grand Theft Auto V

I have little to say regarding the main story it was alright I guess. Although gta online is a mess. Not only have they wen't with P2P servers enabling hacking to be a piece of cake but they now just wen't out of their way to shutdown the most important singleplayer modding tool. Rockstar support seems to be useless they don't even allow ban appeals because there are so many requests that they just don't want to deal with it anymore despite many false positives. (I haven't been banned or anything) They moved their focus to sharkcards and it feels almost a requirement if you want to get the new vehicles priced usually around 2 3mil. Which takes about 4 6 hours of non stop grinding missions to get or you know pay for it. Eitherway point is I love the game and it's really fun with friends. But the way the game was handled and how the servers are p2p just caused so many problems that it's just no excusable anymore especially when they released the game 3 times ps3/xbox360 + ps4/xbone + pc. There no excuses for this poor management. I'm not recommending this game because you'll end up frustrated and dissapoited.

2018-10-10,0,0,383,False,Not Recommended,Generally it is an average adventure game. Developers haven't done good work and the game definitely isn't worth full price. I bought it for reasonable 50 %.It is not race game it is not shooting game it is not economic strategy. It would like to be but if you want one of these you'd better play specialized game.More I played it more I didn't like it.Pros ++ Decent world with some logic and many places to discover.++ Freedom of movement. You can move almost in every possible way on earth water in air or under water.++ Online game. Almost no development limits possibility to play with friends...Great!+ Some character development. Even it's not a merit of the game but it gives some interesting aspects. Unfortunately I can't think of anything more what can bring me to play it again.Cons Graphics. I really don't know why it is so hardware consuming. The final effect doesn't correspond to it! Offensive language. I understand it is gangland game. But in some dialogues I thought that swearing is the really sense of it not move the plot on. During game flow it becomes more and more annoying. Handling. Probably it's because I played PC version may be console version don't need 3 hands sometimes. But anyway why it sets different keys to do same action in different situation? Why character catches on every small corner or other object in the way? Why it is so difficult to enter narrow corridor or stairs? Hand to hand fight etc. AI. AI drivers in the streets but also you AI team mates often do their best to make some accident. Why there is achievement to survive 3 star situation for 5? minutes with all 3 characters? Because AI controlled characters tend to commit suicide. Physics. One of the most important aspects of the game is to drive vehicles. But physical models (especially cars) fit to 2000s not to 2015 game. Online game. There are no rules (except no cheating) and the game and most challenges encourage aggression. Only reason to cooperate is that you are not able to move all goods alone. Instead of cooperation players tend to shoot others on sight Police. You hit a sign in front of a police station and you have 1 star wanted level. Police wants you to stop the car follow the police instructions police shoots you.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-10-07,0,0,67,False,Recommended,"It's a great GTA game I've been playing the series off and on for years and got really depressed when I learned that my system was ""too good"" to handle GTA4 and the earlier games. i7 920 and an Evga GTX770FTW 4GB card and even Liberty City stories runs in the lowest resolution with the least amount of graphics and still stutters at up to 22fps. Tried patches tried fixes but it refuses to run properly I have the DVD version not sure I want to risk buying the Steam version and hoping it will work...maybe when they're on sale.GTA5 is pretty incredible and offers a fairly large plot of land to do whatever you really want to do. Sometimes you are forced into story line mode but there is plenty of free range roaming to do. Buildings are almost all closed off which sucks you do have the ability to switch back and forth between three characters these days but I've noticed that sometimes your favorite car disappears from a garage you bought or you switch to a character who just decided to start a massive gunfight the second you decided to take over. Or for fans of Harbinger ""assuming control""Sadly it feels like a console port...I wish companies would remember that PCs have better power and more control options games optimized for consoles run a tad weak on PCs I don't want to start fooling around with mods before I finish the game but I'm pretty sure there will be a few added later on. Large city loads of vehicles houses businesses to buy a lot of roads good graphicsBUT there seems to be a lot of little things that made GTA so wild that are missing. I spent several hours searching back alleys and random trails thinking I'd find some kind of collectible or statue or bag of dope but so far nothing. Not sure if it's something unlockable or if they just decided not to play the 'hide n go seek' that made Vice City so interesting. It's still a great game though don't get me wrong it's always fun to load a ton of your own music into radio mode borrow a nice car and go for a long joy ride or high speed chase or engage in a massive shootout but it needs better ramps at the airport like earlier games had also needs a five star response team. no tanks and no military showing up?!?I wanted to like it more and I really do like this game but it really feels like a simple console port so I have to go with a 7 out of 10 here. There are mods available so there is a good chance at improving things that are missing and adding new content I haven't tried online multiplayer modes but there's a fair amount of updates that keep popping up from time to time. I wanted it to be a full price game but I recommend it when it's on sale",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-05,0,0,294,False,Not Recommended,Fun single player but would not reccoment online. GTA Online has turned into garbage. You could spend 100$ on a shark card and get almost nowhere in game. Thats $8 000 000 of in game currency that gets you nowhere. The cars weapons and retail options are very expencive. Every item's price is EXTREMELY inflated and is continuing to get more and more expencive with every new update. Even if you painstakingly complete every tedious mission in the game and earn enough money to buy a company or start a club or whatever it isn't worth it. The rewards for company missions for example do not fulfill the requirements needed to begin said mission. You could buy a 4 000 000 dollar car and only get a handful of cash and rp for completing the one mission the car can be used in. And after you spend evough time and are finally able to enjoy some of your rewards you get banned for no reason at all or get hacked by a cheater and lose everything that way.

Kind of a bad community coupled with a convoluted multiplayer system.....Seriously.... why not have dedicated servers running massive 300 player cities? Consoles that's why.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-11-12,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,First off I love this game... .. . .. ...in single player.It is very well made (tho I wish we had a lot more ability to make our avatars' shape and size in online... I wanted to make a fat guy)It looks beautiful at night and good framerates on my low end 5670's on normal settings... I honestly expected worse performance and was pleasantly surprised.I like the characters we play as in SP and even the radio stations and television shows are hilarious... particularly the 'talk radio' station.I eventually went to online mode and that's where I get disgusted...Lots of losers hacking and cheating all over the place pretty much overrunning the place unchecked by the host making it no place for a regular player who wants to play the actual game and compete with others.If you have to cheat to make something of yourself in a game you're the biggest loser in the gaming community and it is just gonna drive me away from the game and find something else to play with creators that actually give a damn about policing their games...One perfect example... one of the random events was to cause as much damage as you can in a limited time... winner was over 35 million dollars worth... I was watching from a distance he was spawning vehicles rapid fire into the air and getting credit for the damage... 2nd place was a hundred thousand dollars or so.This kind of crap just ruins the game for everyone else.I am a hacker type... I have no problem with modding games to do other things and competing against other people with the same mods or in a private instance where they can free for all all they want to that can be fun.... but not in the general public servers and that's where they've just been taking over.If you are looking for multi player fun keep looking elsewhere. You'll only get off here as long as Rockstar continues to not care about it. Smoov,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-04,0,0,157,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Anyone still complaining about hackers ruining the game are bs. Since one of gta's major updates ( cant recall when but it was after jan) hacking gta isn't click click done anymore. Before the security patch hacks and mod menus were extremely easy to use and anyone could do it. That was before the patch. Now most hacks are blocked most mod menus are blocked and the ones that aren't blocked are hard to use. Just trying to teleport to someone now requires you to some how know their Coords and and much more. You gotta find strings of text in cheat engine if you want god mode ( which can take awhile ) and....well im going to stop their. You dont need to know how.My point is its going to be rare youll find a hacker anymore. And if you do theres a good chance he cant spawn stuff on you kill you freeze etc etc etc etc. GTA stepped up their game and its no longer fun to hack the game in MP take it from a former modder.

2016-09-01,0,0,600,False,Recommended,This game is awesome! I have currently spent 255 hours on this game and thats with a reason! This game lets you do the things you have always wanted to do IRL. For example steal a car from the street and run off have a fight kill someone online get an aircraft and just cruise around and you can do very funny and money making heists. In the last heist you actually rob a bank! The pacific standars bank. When you do enough missions heists or jobs you can afford awesome vehicles or apartments for youself! You can even kill people with a tank! This game is 100% worth it. The only bad thing about the game is that they have removed some great features from the past and replaced them with the online events. Sadly they might never return but the features that replaced them is still awesome and fun as well. If you are planning to buy this game make sure to buy a high end apartment as soon as possible because when you reach lvl 12 you can actually host the heist for youself and earn the bigger buck.

2015-12-13,0,0,201,False,Not Recommended,"I've always loved GTA growing up. The sense of freedom I got from the various worlds was always amazing.Freedom is dead in GTA 5.The developers are constantly trying as hard as they can to ruin anything that would make people purchase less Shark Cards. They've tried killing modding a few times. They refuse to add single player DLC. They've banned people who were creating mods they find ""harmful"" to their business. Their publisher has even sent hired goons to a modders house (GTAMP) to scare him into dropping the project. All of this leads to super lackluster updates that revolve more around expensive new cars and clothes that can only be afforded by those with 1000+ hours or $1000+ in real life cash. All of that while everything that's broken remains as such because it's not priority. Only getting more money for Rockstar is priority. The game just isn't fun. It's either pay to win on a game I already payed for or play every minute I'm not working my real life job in hopes that I can put a turbo on my car after a week.This game could be great. But it's nothing but a cash grabber.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-30,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,"There's alot I can say about GTA V. Somewhere beneath all the is something that resembles a good game but they did their very best to completely foul it up. Its way less fun then Saints Row. Its not as cathartic as Just Cause. Its not as good a shooter as Mercenaries. its not nearly as good a versus game as Battleborn. Its not as good a driving game as Mad Max. Its not as good a motorcycle game as Road Redemption. Its not as good a helicopter game as Thunder Wolves. Its not as good a flight game as like Ace Combat Assault Horizon even. Its not as well written as Sleeping Dogs. Its not as good a heist game as Payday. Its not as good a coop game as almost any of them Killing Floor 2 for example. Its not even as good a custom gametype vehicle as like Doom 2016. Or even Garry's Mod.In short its not good. Especially if you're stuck playing it solo like me because people who don't hate themselvse as much have moved on.In general its wildly inconsistent quality and unhealthy focus on the dark side that is to say the only side of capitalism at multiple levels the plot of the single player the structure of the multiplayer and of course its business model make it a game I cannot recommend to most people. There are backwards design decisions from the ground up and it was the first game I gifted a particular friend of mine that he refunded which was something of a milestone. A lot of the gameplay that GTA Online offers can be found elsewhere in a better form but the complete experience is actually fairly unique and thats unfortunate because its built on such a shoddy foundation and forces you to endure hours of long load times lackluster vanilla content and being blown up by twelve year olds with C4 before you can get to any of the good stuff as its all locked behind in game paywalls in the neighborhood of millions. I've seen this happen before with City of Heroes Matrix Online and APB which granted had all different sets of problems. But I am convinced it is possible to make a good ""urban MMO"" and I've yet to see it done.My big beef is the awful control scheme and damage model both of which have been endemic to the series since GTA III indicating that they had no intention of ever improving either. Having played it on Xbox 360 I was accostomed to for example walking in a drunken half circle when I wanted to turn around instead of turning in place like virtually ANY other game. So it came as a surprise when the first was eventually somewhat rectified by the addition of a first person option but there are still major issues like how some AI enemies can somehow take MORE shots then you. How do you up PvE that badly? Firing from cover is awkward holding sprint locks your movement in your cameras direction switching weapons is a hassle especially in a vehicle where you can only scroll the weapon wheel one way... Its a mess. It also manages to somehow have armor even more useless then Counter Strike an ignoble achievement indeed. Your character is incredibly sluggish by the standards of either third or first person action games and some functions seem to just happen when they want to like trying to get into a car when you're under fire or trying NOT to walk off a ing cliff while turning around. The driving controls I thought were much improved from GTA IV but it's no Mad Max and it definate errs on the side of frustration over fun. My friend thought they were crap too so I guess I've adjusted to the crap factor of it.The story mode has a few interesting missions but is otherwise bloated with minigames and annoying fetch activities that amount to a lot of padding. When I first played it I thought it was an incisive dig at the failure of modern American society to properly give a about anyone or anything except money and in a way it still is. But the other side of that is that its too South Park in its morality no one is safe from ridicule few characters have any redeeming qualities and its messages are so murky that its impossible to determine what you're supposed to take away from it if anything at all save perhaps the importance of loyalty but even that's marred by the fact that the character most focused on it is also a meth addled indiscriminately murderous psychopathic loony. There's a few fun bits The special abilities the character switching Trevor's rampage stages and rare moments of the sort of craziness that I thought made The Ballad of Gay Tony the best entry in the series like the bit with a certain cropduster and cargo plane and the heists are cool but its just not enough.The netcode of Online has seemingly never been improved with long load and connection times frequent drops and service interuptions and even weird situations where when first connecting to a lobby or leaving it after a mission to return to public the screen just goes black with a loading wheel and never finishes essentially forcing a restart or to jerry rig your connection using the task manager. I've never had to do that in any other game. It's embarrassing.The structure of online progression seems to have actually gotten worse. The CEO and Motorcycle Club Import/Export and Gunrunning activities seem like they could be fun but for some completely asinine reason they force you to play in a public lobby at the mercy of one of the worst playerbases I've seen outside of Xbox Live. Even the setup missions for the vaunted Doomsday Heist do this it boggles the mind. Hackers abound as well as trolls griefers s idiots and screaming little kids. Even worse the game now actually encourages other players to engage in the alternately boring depressing or rage inducing pastime of blowing your or your objective up with crazy powerful military vehicles that you can't afford. Or just C4 or homing missiles because skill is a thing right? Right? Guys?Regarding said vehicles the issue of in game money. In the story its almost impossible to get real cash outside of the one time only heists or the in game stock market (stocks? are you ing kidding me?). In Online on the other hand there's tons of ways to get money. But as time has gone on the prices for vehicles weapons and properties have skyrocketed to insane levels locking most players out of the most interesting content unless you grind for cash buy the stupid microtransaction Shark Cards piggyback on a player with more hours (and good luck finding real friends to play this and not the kind of people who genuinely like Trevor think trolling is a legitimate behavior or actually believe that the later Saints Row games are bad for being crazier) or of course hack. Hacks hacks everywhere. It's rampant it's persistent it's annoying and unlike most games it's also incredibly obvious when its happening. I had some guy kick me out of my own apartment and seemingly delete all my cars. Thankfully this condition was only temporary and thats about the only time the game's done me a favor. Even worse the hacking has only increased with time. Its as if Rockstar has done absolutely nothing to try and stop it.As the years go buy I find myself more and more disappointed by so called ""Triple A"" releases. If you want a game to play try any I mentioned above. If you want the real GTA V experience go watch the Achivement Hunter gang or the TheIvaneh on youtube.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-06,0,0,548,False,Recommended,As someone who doesn't really care about the openiv fiasco or having gta4's map in gta5 i'll just go ahead and leave a positive review here. Even in 2017 GTA5 still feels pretty fresh and the online is still very fun in a lot of ways (with the exception of rampant hacking/modding/whateveryouwantocallit and scumbags begging said people for free money in chat). If I had any complaints it's that rockstar didn't do nearly enough to secure the online portion of this game before release leading to the rampant cheating most players are seeing. However if you can see past that you'll have a very entertaining single player game and an online game that can provide countless hours of enjoyment.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-27,0,0,437,False,Recommended,DISCLAIMER I already played this game a lot on the XBOX 360 I only played GTA Online on PC.The campaign is good and the multiplayer is decent. It's fantastic if you've got a group of friends to play the game with but it can be very frustrating because of all the hackers at the moment. R* seems to have a hard time dealing with those #$% &amp but I have faith )I won't talk about the singleplayer since I bet almost all of you know (parts of) the story and because I don't want to spoil anything.Here are my pros and cons + Good story mode+ Good amount of side quests+ Lots and lots and lots of vehicles (cars bicycles motorcycles helicopters boats planes etc.)+ Vehicle customization!+ R* is STILL releasing new content!+ Good variety of weapons+ Daily objectives &amp other missions in GTA Online (they keep you busy and earn you some decent money)+ R* creator! Create your own races etc. and try stuff made by others!+ Mods in singleplayer! Hackers in GTA Online Very Toxic community expect to get shot over and over again for no reason. I am very thankful for Passive Mode! Long loading times (you could call this game loading simulator) Some apartments and cars are VERY expensive It takes a while to earn money especially when you re a CEOs associate NPCs are s in traffic Lester Merryweather and some other people/companies call you every ingame day at the worst moments Cops will hunt you down if you stare at them for too long Sometimes you even get a wanted level when one of their cars runs into you!Overall this game is a must have but please take my cons into consideration!

2016-06-30,0,0,706,False,Recommended,By the time this review is visible to prospective gamers look toward considering buying this game I am confident that anyone who could have bought this game already did based on its reputation alone. Within a sprawling open world Los Santos (a fictional L.A.) you play as three carreer criminals that take you on their personal journey for fortune and other more nefarious callings and have the quality of a Scorsese film (but if I am being a little bit nit picky as much plausibility) indeed I preferred the more intimate and grounded campaign of GTA IV. Multiplayer feels like a seperate entity all on its own where you and your friends can plan and pull off your own heists even though the inclusion of multi transactions does feel unwarranted but from its singleplayer to its multiplayer rockstars pedigree shines throughout giving the gamer quality value and the escapism we've come to expect from their open wold games so I definitely recommend you visit Los Santos when you get the chance.

I did all the checks and resets but it didnt't take. After 3 hours of trying to get it to work and dozens of Reddit pages later I decided to return the game and get my refund. Highly disappointed in Roickstar who is at the fore front of the open world games. I was shocked to notice that this issue has been there since the launch and hasn't been addressed.

But the way how it reacts when I use the mouse it is just horrible(my mouse is good as well so it's not the reason razer deathadder chroma 10.000 dpi).The gameplay is all right in campaign interesting story nice ideas.Multiplayer is something which could not keep me at the computer. I have tried to push myself spend at least 30 40 hours with the multiplayer section but really I just can't see the point. There are many activities that You can do with other people but it was almost impossible to get a working lobby at least not in an hour which is ridiculous. So at the and I have found myself in a big virtual city where I can go around with my car and that's it. Sometimes I get by some really pro gamers who had undestroyable vehicles. After all it would be rightfull for me to ask what is the GTA V multiplayer about??? This game seems to me a sims city and need for speed mix just not my jam.Unfortunately graphics isn't amazing either compared to its systrem requirements. The characters look horrible the skin even your own arm in the FPS view! It looks like plain plastic mate! I think why this graphic is unique is because there are so many objects in this game which takes dozens of time to create that we can not avoid this fact. So it's a good point but You could push this further in the future hopefully.So finally I'd give 5.5/10 for this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-23,0,0,1300,False,Not Recommended,"Where to start with this one. I was looking for something different to get into for online play so I picked this up on sale at half off and while it is a great game there are some incredibly serious flaws with the game that Rockstar simply does not seem to care at all about.The first is the 15+ minute load times that take you nowhere. Try to join a mission with someone spend 5 minutes loading mission launches and some noob quits it... theres another 10m load screen. You finish a mission you get a 10 minute load screen. You fail to join a mission or try to find a new lobby... 10 minute load screen. You launch the game and try to log onto GTA online and thats a good 10 minute load screen. Its unbelievable that such a hugely successful company as Rockstar has such phenomenally servers. The second is the hackers that Rockstar is not doing *ANYTHING* at all about. You cannot join a public lobby without some Chinese or Brazilian player using hacks to grief every single player on the server. Sure you can report these people but considering that you cannot find a multiplayer lobby literally EVER without blatant hackers in it... really sucks the fun out of the online experience. Particularly when you spend 10+ minutes loading a game just to get stuck in a lobby with some small hackers... its not cool at all and considering that by my estimation right now at least 20% of the players online are using hacks... Rockstar needs to get on that and pronto. I have never in my life as a hardcore gamer not even in Diablo2 back in the day seen such rampant hacking on online servers by a AAA game company with absolutely nothing being done about it. Then you have the quality of the players that you group with in random queues... its the worst. If you do not have friends to play this game with online good luck its really not worth it. And all that being said its a real shame because this is one of the better online games I have played in recent years but between the literal endless load times ( you can realistically spend 45 minutes out of an hour just going from load screen to load screen and my pc exceeds the recommended specs by quite a bit ) and the blatant griefing pieces of crap hackers... this game is currently not one I would recommend to anyone. If Rockstar ever gets their crap together and starts cleaning up their act it would be one of the best online experiences out there but as it stands right now its easily one of the most disappointing online gaming experiences I have ever gone through.Well *Update* I managed to get 1000 hours into the game online struggled through its many downfalls and constant hacking trolling human scum never hacked myself as I hate hackers more than anything... and just about to log off for the night looking forward to a new DLC to the game coming this month March 2018 and the game logs me off tells me I am banned for a month and my character is reset. Tried to appeal but they apparently do not allow for appeals despite having a specific ticket request for them. So after 1000 hours of fully legit play nearly all of that online never once cheating accepting cheater money drops or asking for them and got damn good at the game only to find myself suddenly banned with literally no clue as to why.The number of hackers in this game is currently easily at 60% of total players online at any given time the Chinese ones are the absolute worst and considering how little Rockstar is doing about them despite banning legit players apparently they do not even try to hide the fact that they openly hack. You can join a server and say ""any modders here "" (they like to call themselves modders as if what they are doing with their cheating menus is anything other than hacking ) and 20% of the players will openly answer that they are hackers. Yet is ANYTHING being done about it? No not a thing. They have lost a hardcore gaming customer for life will never buy anything Rockstar does ever again. Worst servers and worst amount of hackers ive ever seen in my entire life as a hardcore gamer. Do not buy this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-23,0,0,176,False,Not Recommended,With the take down of OpenIV this game now has nothing what so ever redeemable. Singleplayer was fun but compared to other R* games it does not have any characters of worth a lackluster story it would be a fun sandbox with a few mods oh wait...Multiplayer has been unplayable since day one a worthless grind that makes World of Warcraft fun and even Farmvile feel bloody rewarding in comparsion. The Online is a MMO without the freedom to do anything you want whenever. A MMO that does not want to be a MMO sounds like it's going to fail and it does. The only way you can get equipment is to grind grind in annoying 'mini games' imagine the only way to get money and XP (or in GTAs case it's RP for some stuipid reason?) but you had to play Pokemon with tall grass covering the entire world with a lvl 1 Magicarp against fully evolved lvl 99 Pokemon. Fun fact you can get past this grind with help of the most lovely group of people modders. While some modders do indeed disrupt the game many are actually really fun to play with. How many games can you have a dogfight with someone flying a bus my best experiences in the game are due to modders if you went and played GTA on a console as a lvl 1 you'll be killed by those that grind (an experiance I thought was exclusive to MMOs) a modder can let this lvl 1 experiance all the game truly has to offer. While Red Dead Redemtion you can gain XP find all the high teir weapons in freeroam and minigames were just an offshoot to enjoy. GTA V does not have this you need a modder to enjoy many of these things. But T2 R* whoever simply can't make an enjoyable online experiance. Because of thier ineptitude people like myself require modders to make this lackluster game enjoyable. Besides it's all just to sell a few microtransactions in the end is it not?Because GTA Online is a cesspool of a gaming experiance I guess I'm stuck with singleplayer. Perhaps if I...

For this price you can just buy another copy of the game download cheats and spawn money...And for now the Devs abandoned the Game over RDR2.

2017-09-14,1,1,578,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer is 10/10 it really doesnt get much better than that. But online multiplayer... be prepared to grind for 300 hours just to have a fair fight against others and even when you finally do a modder will just blow you up out of thin air or simply throw you out of your fighter jet as you take off. Really the online is a sewer. People don't play the game they just find what pisses you off most and do that over and over and troll hard as and if you type back to them in chat you can almost physically feel them smile and be pleased with the growth of the cancerous tumor that is the GTA V online community. I guess if you have a modder friend or have mods yourself it can be pretty fun in the right lobby. I have had some fun moments at the skate park with a couple friends on BMX bikes car meets and races are pretty cool and General shenanigans are common. Overall Certainly don't buy for full price $60 after this many years is a little rediculous and don't expect much from online. Singleplayer is golden.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-18,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V a game with endless possibilities a great story awesome multiplayer and just an amazing experience.GTA5 is an open world 3rd/1st Person multiplayer shooter.

Grand theft auto runs well and the gameplay is top notch people seem to get mad at the money grind to afford the new items in the game but I've never really cared much about having to grind for progress especially when there is so much to do and so much fun to be had playing this game alone and with friends or your crew.,Grand Theft Auto V

Its fantastic that Rockstar gives you (technically) free dlc HOWEVER. The prices of items has been so badly inflated by shark cards it hurts. For people who don't want to waste money on them just have to grind so much money just to get one thing never mind all the damn upgrades. At this point in time I'm level 85 and I still have lots more to get and to be honest after a while this game just tires you out. Its one of those games where you take a break from it go back into the game saying ""Wow! Why did I ever quit this game!"" and a few weeks later you'll quit again.

2015-04-15,0,0,453,False,Recommended,"I was super excited for this game so I pre ordered it awhile ago. The game unlocked Monday at 4 00p.m. PST. I was having launcher issues so I logged onto the Rockstar Social Club website and activated my Steam code with my RSC account there. The game GTA V was added to my RSC game library and activated on the RSC account. I then downloaded their GTA V launcher from the RSC page (willing to download a 60+gb game again since Steam was having issues at the time) and I logged onto my RSC account through the GTA V launcher. After logging in to the RSC account through the GTA V launcher/installer it prompted me to enter in my Rockstar Activation Code. ""Odd."" I thought. Why would it ask for the code again when it's the same GTA V code that is linked to this very RSC account? I entered in the code and it says ""Rockstar Activation Code already in use"". I cannot play this $60 I pre ordered because it thinks I'm a pirate. It's a very stupid issue when you think about it. It's basically saying ""This GTA V Rockstar Activation Code is already in use by this account"" and not letting me run/install/register GTA V. EXACTLY thirty one minutes after launch I filed a support ticket with R* support. It took them TWENTY ONE hours to send me a generic response accusing me of not entering in my key correctly. Not only that but they gave me a list of bulletin point items to send in (such as pre order date retailer key RSC account name etc) in a certain format. It was quite apparent that they did not read my original ticket as I had ALL of this information included in the original ticket it just was not formatted exactly how they wanted it to be. I responded THIRTEEN minutes later with a response structured exactly as they want it so they don't have to hurt themselves reading my ticket. I received a response four hours later saying ""We deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. Your case has been escalated to the proper department. Please note cases are addressed in the order they are received. We appreciate your patience.Best regards REDACTED NAMERockstar Support""I have not heard a word from them since then. Their last response was twenty hours ago. You pre order a game for $60 and you expect to get a key that works. There is no other course of action I can take at the moment other than requesting a refund (and I don't WANT to do that but I am beginning to care less and less about the game at this point). If I were to request a refund and then buy the game immediately again I would lose all of my pre order bonuses. A lot of people are having this same issue you'd think they would do some sort of blanket hotfix for such a stupid error (This code is already in use by this account! ZOMG!) but nooooooooooooooo.EDIT April 16th 2015My ticket had not been reviewed over night so I dug up a Rockstar support phone number and called them as soon as they opened. They fixed my issue in eleven minutes total. If anyone else is having this issue I'd highly recommend calling them rather than going through the website. I believe the guy I talked to was Brandon. He was awesome and a huge help. If you happen to be reading this thanks you rock! Game works VERY well on my rig. I won't bother getting into those details here there are many other reviews addressing that sort of thing. Game is a lot of fun etc.November 23rd 2017 Update The game is still awesome. Tons of no cost content has been added since the initial launch. While I am not a fan of the shark cards the post launch support has been phenomenal.November 24th 2018 Update Tons of new content has been added over the years.

2016-05-19,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar has forgotten the people that made them what they are today. With the focus of online while pure profitting off over a half of billion dollars on micro transactions. This company has no intention of listening to many of us that want more story mode content. Online mode is worst than Beruit and doesnt answer to people that love the story line. Something the online content lacks. Im not paying Rockstar a ing dime for a game that already cost $60. This is the price of greed for Rockstar dont give a crap. While they lost me they have another sucker bugging thier parents to fork over money to replace me. I was loyal to Rockstar from day one of this series. This is how they repay the loyatly to us. If you are one thats using money to purchase this online crap you my friend are a damn FOOL. This review might sound im butthurt but Im not I dont see the orginal story mode to give you $60 worth of gameplay.

2017-04-17,0,0,196,False,Not Recommended,I loved this game for awhile but unfortunately modders have figured out ways to deplete your entire fortunes in seconds and Rockstar seemingly has no way to detect or they don't care to. Currently there is no online in this game because odds are good you will run into a modder who will either jack your level up to 8000 and trigger a ban on your account or they will drain millions of dollars by abusing the hospital bill function which protects passive players (normally). If they can get a fix on the modding this is a great game that I would love to play more of but as it stands today the rampant cheating makes online unplayable.

2016-11-23,0,0,2761,False,Not Recommended,"This game took and still takes up a large portion of what could otherwise be called my life. 10/10 would put my real life relationships to the test again.edit June 2017 So I have mixed feelings about what Take2 did in terms of getting rid of mods but regardless I HAVE to overturn my review to negative because I could not in good conscience recommend anyone still buy this game and start from scratch let alone for the price it still has. I'm not saying I would've recommended that anyone take on cheater money to be able to afford stuff in the game before the update but it seems like now not only will people not be able to mod the game offline anymore (which I find atrocious but it doesn't hurt me as an online player very much) new players will (as of now) be expected to pay full price for the game and be met with a plethora of content that they wouldn't be able to afford even if they doubled up their initial expenses by going for the largest shark card option. 8 million get you nowhere in this game and with the latest update Rockstar once again ensured that the moneymaking possibilities will be slow enough that even if GTA Online was free to play (which of course it isn't) at this point it would basically be pay to win (especially for new players) because there's weapon modifications in the game now that give you a major advantage but they take either a huge amount of money (think 4mil) and lots of time to acquire or a humongous amount of money (think 14mil) and lots of clicking on a button.Of course the intention of introducing explosive bullets as a legit part of the game was to take away the huge advantage fighter jets had in the past but besides all the other new weapon improvements this also means it's now very easy for someone who has played this game a bunch to grief players who are just trying to make money which they HAVE to do in public sessions where you are thrown together with others.To reiterate I think the main thing that kept people coming back to the online portion of the game especially after an update was that it was relatively easy to get some illegitimate money to be able to afford the new stuff. Of course that's not in the interest of Rockstar and Take2 to give these ""free"" DLCs out for free. But to crack down on the entirety of the modding community which for the most part hasn't even been about modding GTA Online is like I said atrocious. Rockstar took over 2 years to continually fail at making GTA Online for PC cheater proof. Others can do it but all they could do was send their lawyers and corporate powers after everyone who played a major role in enabling others to modify GTA V (! GTA Online). And even if mods do come back eventually which wouldn't surprise me the argument still remains that GTA Online has been pruposely turned into and kept a money grind which you can only legally ""overcome"" by throwing even more money down the throats of Take2 and Rockstar.Since I assume that hardly anyone would still buy this game for the vanilla offline portion of the game as I said I cannot in good conscience still recommend anyone buy this game anymore.edit November 2018 I barely play this game anymore. I check out major updates once in a while but the overall impression is that this game's online economy barring cheats has always been and will always be broken because obviously those DLCs cost money to be created by the developer. So why would they give them away for free? Yet you have the opportunity to grind your way to enough money to afford stuff and they charge you an extraordinary amount of hard earned money for a few million of in game money that you can't do much with because everything's ludicrously expensive. If that weren't the case or if you got more from such a purchase maybe I would've considered it myself once as well but this way I don't really see much reason to spend more of my time in this what's arguably still the best open world game to date period.",Grand Theft Auto V

However if you do go out of your way to kill people it can turn on you really fast as in my few hours playing the game I have made 4 friends three of which were because someone killed like 2 or 3 people in the lobby and we just decided to go after the person. but overall this is a great game and I cannot wait to see what other DLC is released and what differences there will be with GTA 6,Grand Theft Auto V

Even though the singleplayer mode in this game is amazing the online mode has been destroyed over the years by the greed of Rockstar Games and Take 2 Interactive. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of fun stuff to do online specially if you have friends to tag along but most of the content that has been added over the years is blocked behind paywalls that leave the player two choices Either you grind your life away like this is WoW or you pay for the incredibly overpriced Shark Cards to enjoy the new content. Not to mention that the game is plagued by hackers and griefers that will only make the already tedious task of grinding a living hell.

2017-12-23,0,0,1841,False,Not Recommended,Here's what I think of Grand Theft Auto 5's singleplayer.It's a phenomenal experience. From the streets of Los Santos to the dry arid desert of Sandy Shores to the northern fishing town Paleto Bay the game is incredible throughout. The driving mechanics are a near perfect blend of arcadey and realistic with car performance being realistically simulated but with speed and traction altered to make the cars handle more easily. The radio stations are unique and varied all with incredible music and funny satire. The game world is magnificently detailed no two locations could possibly be mistaken for eachother even out in the wilderness or the desert. The story is fine but it serves as a suitible wrap around the wonderful anarchy that makes GTA's gameplay so fun. The gunplay is fine not more. Overall the singleplayer alone is well worth the $60.Now here is what I think of Grand Theft Auto Online.Like an estranged younger brother GTA Online seeps off of the success of it's cohort borrowing the best mechanics and twisting them into something darker. While the driving shooting and open world from the singleplayer remain the story is replaced by basic missions with menial tasks to complete and worthless rewards. The free open anarchy is replaced by opressive unfair tyranny by the players who have more on the players who have less. In GTAO you're either in freeroam being killed by some b*stard with a fighter jet or an armored truck or a sniper rifle or you're in a mission grinding out cash and xp so you can some day be the one on the other end of the stick with the fighter jet and the armored truck and the sniper rifle. Or you could take a shortcut and purchase your way to the top. The loading times are atrocious ' just loading in to the game is 3 5 minutes or longer and between every single mission there's at least a full minute of loading in or out of freeroam. There is no substance to this game and the only motivation is to have more than other players. That kind of toxicity is what fuels this games' success. So unless you want to be a part of that cycle turn away now.I can't deny it I've spent more than 1500 hours in this game most of which are in online. This cruel system has sucked me in don't let it suck you in too.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-08,0,0,88,False,Recommended,Pretty good game. Some of the things I enjoyed right away throughout my play through is that this game is eye candy. Very nice to look at. Also a bit of fun to explore. Mini games such as towing cars yoga tennis etc are nice feaures but also a bit boring. Past GTAs had vigilante missions owning property gang wars which is disappointing because these were removed from GTA 5. Other than that gameplay is very solid and a step forward from previous GTAs. Overall a very well optimized and good looking game with solid gameplay and exploration. However its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness for the game will eventually make its vast open world a boring sandbox. But for me this game will make me last until Fallout 4 comes out.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-23,1,1,97,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V EDIT After the take 2 pulled this is a no. Why the would they do this to modders?Grand Theft Auto V Is a sandbox action game developed by Rockstar North. Rockstar north have also worked on previous GTA Games such as Grand theft Auto 4 San andreas and more. Grand Theft Auto V Has met critical acclaim since its release being released for PS3 Xbox 360 PC Ps4 and the Xbox One. It also features an online component which has recieved many updates such as the new Executives and other criminals update. Story Mode The Game itself story mode and online has a beautiful dynamic open world with a weather system I just loved driving around Los Santos at day. The world also has many activities to do such as races random events to encounter and easter eggs to find. The game itself also looks beautiful graphically bright and colorful. The map is much bigger then its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV and overall it looks more vibrant.The games A.I is good but not the best when driving someone to a location they will follow no flaws with that enemy A.I also very good if you disable a cop by shooting his knee another cop will bring him into cover a small but fascinating detail. The Wanted system is highly improved making it harder to escape cops and more details added an example is if you weren't in a car or were in a car when wanted you can either enter another car or a new car and you won't be spotted as easily a nice touch. But if your found with a stolen car you will be wanted again again a nice touch. But the wanted A.I has problems a small one sometimes the cops can easily give up when your right around the corner and they're just about to find you they stop. And you can get out of cover and they wont even notice you. Another flaw is that the police can repeatedly crash into objects this hasn't happened to me but I've seen it happen to others. The last A.I Flaw I'll be talking about is traffic A.I. Sometimes cars can switch lanes and switch back into another lane this can screw you over and make you crash which can be frustrating at times.Now the game contains 69 missions and there full of funny characters no doubt. They aren't bland compared to characters from games like Assassins Creed 3. ""You can jerk me off if I get bored I'm joking..you can suck me off."" Trevor. I think that line proves what I said. The game also contains characters from Grand Theft Auto IV a lot of them are minor characters and none of them play major roles in the story. can be a heist character johnny only appears for a few minutes before being slaughtered by Trevor. Minor things like that. The game does not contain characters from games like GTA SA because this takes place in the HD Universe. Grand Theft Auto Online Grand Theft Auto Online is the online component of Grand Theft Auto V and adds many things to the open world of Grand Theft Auto V.You can now purchase different apartments and store vehicles in them and with the new update you can now customize apartments. You can own multiple amounts of properties. Including homes garages apartments and yachts.I really don't have much to say about the properties I can't really think of a flaw that they have.One MAJOR Flaw in Online are hackers. Although theres a less amount of them now some of them still roam the servers waiting to screw you over and give you modded money. It really me off if you see a modder immediately go to a new server.Car Customization and lowriders are amazing. It's so in depth and detailed. Customizing interiors customizing tires its a feature we haven't seen since Grand Theft Auto San andreas. Although lowriders is pretty expensive you need quite a bit of money to customize. It costs 300+k to get your vehicle modify able for lowriders and it costs 10 100 k for the customizations itself not very newbie friendly if you ask me or people that only have a couple hundred k.Heists have been an anticipated feature since launch they're amazing and everything we asked for you can even replay them. But..there also the worst multiplayer experience. People who don't know what they're doing can join in and always screw it up for you that's a big reason why im stuck on Prison break when I host it. So whenever you do a heist past the fleeca job ALWAYS get friends and make sure they're skilled.This still has the same A.I Flaws except it can be a real pain in races your in first place speeding ahead but a car switches lanes and you crash into it and then you get sent back to last place. It can really screw you over hopefully Rockstar can fix it in a future update.Online still has a long way to come but overall its one of the best multiplayer experiences out there but FAR from perfect.Tl dr Both the story mode and online have A.I flaws online needs work and should be more newbie friendly with the updates oh and there should be a way for skilled/decent people to join jobs/missions/heists. Final Verdict Grand Theft Auto V 9/10Grand theft Auto Online 7/10Full game 8/10 This is a must buy just buy it any platform doesnt matter if its on or off sale. It's worth EVERY penny and its one of the most addicting games I have in my steam library so I reccomend buying this.Enjoy the review?

2017-06-24,0,0,1153,False,Not Recommended,"Never before has there been a more storied example of Games Publisher vs. Game Developer than the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Rockstar games has put out several middling to excellent installments in its 20 year history churning out these open world sandbox story driven criminal based games and GTA V is about a 7 out of 10 by comparison to all of the other GTA games. Gone is physics based water enemy stagger movie theater sound effects and a compelling thrilling narrative throughout as was the case in GTA IV. In its place is a larger map. More vehicles. Compelling online play. And a new story gimmick called 'Heists'. Which give the player multiple options crews and equipment loadouts to try and take some of the most sought after scores in San Andreas.Graphics GTA was one of the most visually stunning games to look at of its time...and yet its detailed graphics menu allowed players to play on last gen computers as well. Now the engine and the objects are starting to show their age. Polygonal hard edges distant traffic stand ins (which can't be adjusted) foliage pop in and ugly online player models are the seams in this game's visual cloth. These problems are not the only graphical ones but none of them are significant enough to ruin the experience by itself.Gameplay Mileage always varies in GTA. When choosing what you want to do in this game you're always going to seem like you have a number of different options both in online and offline modes. The story is long and touches a lot on GTA's lorebase a number of memorable times. But when those strings of narrative are woven together to make a cloth the result is pretty mediocre. By contrast in GTA IV and even the game's 2 excellent expansions we saw characters grow and develop over the course of the story changing their views and stances on certain issues. Nico Bellic who starts out as a cagey quiet soldier despite numerous transgressions and setbacks finds it in himself to trust those he loves and makes a new home for himself in Liberty City. This kind of development doesn't happen in GTA V's story mode. That's pretty disappointing. The characters at the end are the same sarcastic gun toting badasses that they are at the beginning. Nothing really changes of importance.Car handling is different. GTA IV's cars were floaty and drifty. Even the most hardcore supers had flex in the suspension when you showed them quick turns in rapid succession. In V all of that has been dumbed down a little. Cars are twitchy and responsive. Some have so much grip that they will not bite back unless you're driving around with your right trigger pressed full down at all times. Not all cars are set up with such leeways but especially in the next gen versions driving is a bit of a cakewalk.Shooting is VERY different. Every time I return to GTA IV I'm floored by how simplistic its shooting system is. Weapons can't be modified and the cover system gets confused very easily. In V it seems they cracked it. Not only is there a 1st person element to shooting which has you looking down the sights of your weapon but the accuracy of all firearms has been ramped substantially. Unfortunately enemy AI still seems especially weak with Rockstar doing more of its ""Quantity over quality"" approach to enemy design. Not once did the AI succeed in tricking me or scaring me to the point where I had to rethink my strategy. Despite a few times with the cover not locking on to the right object it's very serviceable. This reviewer would like to see nuances like (lenient) weapon condition and windage at long range play a factor in future games. Sizeable improvements in AI are also urgently needed.Flying is well done. Especially in helicopters but it's clear Rockstar stuck with its guns and revamped the same chopper system from GTA IV which was good. The aircraft have a good weight to them and the momentum they carry feels realistic. Swimming/boats are well done. Probably the most underrated experience in GTA history if you ask me. At least since Vice City the need for awesome pilotable boats has been certainly needed. The game's only sailboat however cannot be sailed. It's motor only. Online/Expansions are where the game really starts to disappoint. Every one of the game's DLC packs have been free which is excellent but what's not excellent is they've all been for online only which indicate that Take Two's marketing strategy has triumphed over the gamer's desire for more things to do in singleplayer. Online itself has its own independent heist system which is like Payday Lite. The 5 heists have a decent narrative component in which you learn why it is you're doing what you're doing and occasionally see parts of the story mode's backstory. Unfortunately the online lobbies are plagued with some of the worst flagrant examples of cheating and poor matchmaking that I have ever seen in a video game. I have on multiple occasions had all of my character's weapons and ammo drained from my inventory. On all occasions I reported the incident to Rockstar but their policy on griefing is more of a confused shrug than a commitment to do anything about it. You can get killed in passive mode by god choppers. You can try to complete a daily objective for your business only to find out the VIP you're supposed to be defending got killed by a grenade teleported onto his head from a mile away. These are just some minor examples that Rockstar doesn't seem to have a handle on.Sound/Audio GTA V's soundtrack is great except for a few glaring omissions like a lack of an electronic station. Worldwide FM which is the closest thing is often a very confusing mix of tracks that seem like they were just thrown against a wall to see what sticks. Other sounds like those associated with driving and combat sound great. I wish that they'd done a few more engine samples though. Some of them are quite overused. I am so glad they finally decided to update the gunplay sound effects. Many of them from GTA IV were tedious. Especially that police pistol one. You know what I mean.Replay Value This one's tricky. That's going to depend on what you want to do in this game. If you're flexible and want to do everything there's no deeper game on the market for satisfying all of your chaotic sandbox desires. If you just want a driving game there are some competitive racing crews out there but the physics model is just a little too limited and at times buggy to represent a polished racer. Also it's automatic transmission only which will rightly irk some racing game enthusiasts. If you want a shooter there are a lot of compelling reasons to choose GTA V. First person and third person modes are both very satisfying to play with and it's versatile enough to support KB/M and controller setups. Still its weak AI and sometimes annoying bugs with cover mean you should be considering dedicated shooters as well before GTA V. Management/Direction Awful. Appalling. Ghastly. Dreadful. Worse than you're imagining right now. Take 2's ponderous approach to its marketing scheme has been recently underscored by its tonedeafness toward mods. Something that takes GTA V's playability and improves upon what's already there. This is even more glaring because they have failed to fix the obvious problems with cheaters in online mode. It's pretty laughable really. The only logical reason I can figure that they haven't fixed the issue is that they can't be bothered or don't care about the gaming community that they are responsible for. And that makes perfect sense as Take Two continues to ruin everything good about its games in steady slow succession.As it is right now I can't recommend this for 59.99. It's probably worth about 9.99 given how large TTI's profit margin has been so far. If that.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-18,0,0,236,False,Not Recommended,I really don't understand how people and magazine reviews say that this game is awesome because in my opinion after playing since it's release is really I know the graphics are awesome and storyline is great up to a certain point (75% complete) but then if you want to get a 100% complete it is impossible without any guides or walkthroughs online. The map is big the things we have to find are stupid and a waste of time. Who ever made this game where you have to walk 5 miles in a desert needs to be shot! There is not much to do in this game after you complete the story.What would of been nice is if we could set up robberies much the same way as in the story mode. To be able to pick and chose a place to rob to chose the partners to join and transport then the getaway plan and escape route by setting up checkpoints or markers on the map.Also we cannot rob a house in any part of the map. It would be cool to be able to break in someones house to steal a car or to rob cash or jewellery to sell at a pawn shop. The gravity of the game is ridiculous jumps are way over the top and doesn't feel realistic.The police in the game are over the top too. There doesn't seem to be any law and order. They just shoot you for the smallest crime. They also don't have any tactics such as boxing you in or even giving you a ticket or fine for speeding. Sometimes cop cars stop you even if you hit a car gently and ram you. This is stupid!Some of the graphic scenery such as hedges in the city are transparent. You can drive right through them but then at the Los Santos airport with the same type of hedge its as solid as a brick wall. Pathetic!There isn't much you can do with cars either. How about stealing cars and doing them up to sell? And what is the point of that scrap yard. It's useless!I think this game is over rated under developed with thought. It is the worst game I have played. Yes I did enjoy it up to a point only to realise there could be so much more thought into making this game. Either Rockstar ran out of budget or they just focused on the graphics and not the bits in between. I am very disappointed in the development of this game and I recommend to those who wish to purchase this game to wait for a discount on steam. It is not worth the money. Trust me!

They will reply via email adress to tell you to move the modded moneyto your bank account and they will remove the modded money so you wont get banned.There are other ways not to play with a modder. If you see a modder go to another session or quit the gameas fast as you can. or you can go online and search for how to play alone in a lobby. i recommend to play alone andinvite your best friends so you will never get modded money like i did.

2018-04-12,0,0,333,False,Recommended,Okay I know amongst thousands of reviews this won't sway any readers decision much but I'd like to voice my thoughts anyway. The Grand Theft Auto series is an amazing concept filled with many characters and missions that people have loved over the years and this fifth installment is no different. I had this game on PS4 and now again on pc with combined over a thousand hours in it and I can say one thing about the game it has one of the most immersive creative and fun stories I've seen in any game. The freedom of a massive open access map and the ability to do whatever you please is a feeling I've found can only be replicated in very few games. The 3 main characters played by 3 professional actors (whom those characters were visually modelled on) and the authenticity of the stereotypes spread through the virtual Los Angeles are unmatchable by any other game out there. Whilst playing the 100+ hours of story mode in this game you will be able to recognise just where the millions of dollars invested into it went. Now onto the online mode...People give it a lot of flack because rockstar add new 'free' DLC content into the online game however they charge exorbitant amounts of ingame currency for it incentivising players to purchase microtransactions in the form of 'shark cards'. Either you grind for the toys or you pay for the toys basically. People complain about this because they believe it to be price gouging of consumers to further their already huge profits on the game. My problem with the consumers here is Rockstar do not owe us anything. They designed and built an amazing game that nears 100 million copies sold which is a number I'd expect for a game like this. Game developers will most likely have microtransactions and incentivise you to purchase them regardless of the game but for them it's okay because they don't have as huge profit margins? I don't follow. Here on PC in regards to online we have even less to complain about because we arent paying for an online service like the console players and therefore rockstar again owe us nothing. I'm no rockstar shill and I don't have any leniency toward any particular game. At the end of the day what you pay your $60 bucks for (or less because of frequent sales on this game) is for the story mode online is a fun social add on that most people would just use to mess around with friends and if you explore some of the business opportunities you can add hundreds of hours to your time in this game.Thanks for taking your time to read this review and just know that I really do believe that this game is worth paying full price for. Many of the reviews you read on here are pretty negative about online but I think if you give it a go and mess around you can make up your own mind on it. D,Grand Theft Auto V

Not to mention this time they added First Person View which brings players a brand new experience for GTA Universe.What's even more is the game has RPG mechanism yes you have 3 playable characters in Single Player each of them has their own stats and special abilities that you can spend time training up and trust me it's all worth itHowever I must say the game is somewhat more non logical than GTA IV you'll see them as you play through hell some road signs even just make driving more annoying and dangerous since NPCs don't obey road rules as well. So yes expect a lot of car crash in that case.Also spoiler alert I think the game should only give you option C in the end since I feel A and B are kind of just ""Dog luck"" that your contractors decided not to betray you like Dimitri in GTA IV. And trust me C is the only option you should pick IF YOU WANT TO GET THE GAME TO 100%.After you finished the story it's like ""That's it well done you finished the story mode."" The emptiness of GTA V is unaccpetable! It's very DONE after you finished everything nothing else to do other than spending your end game cash to screw around the city or hangout with some characters for some conversations to understand their backgrounds deeper.Alright that's enough for a Story mode what about Online mode?Well in short GTA Online is a mess and trash that RockStar tries so hard to wipe off the poop stains and smelly odors of it.Bad servers and modders that ruin game experience that's how and why GTA Online sucks. Also Social Club constantly has issues from troubleshooting to Online character data corruption. GUESS WHO CAN FIX THIS? Players themselves. That's right RockStar doesn't care about you if you have problem BEST JUST BUY ANOTHER GAME PROBLEM SOLVED EVERYONE'S HAPPY. YAY.Yea I know you can play with your friends messing around just like how Vanoss did with his friends in a closed friend session. But again if you want to mess around you still have to grind money to get toys that you want to play with.Everything you're doing in Online is ""Grinding money"". Everything you're doing every DLC you're playing those are going to cost you weeks or months just to buy 1 property that can make money. But sorry if you want to do business you'll have to go to pub sessions which most of time you would just get blown up out of nowhere even inside your safe houses.Rockstar is now officially a rich company that still cannot provide a stable server and a working Anti cheat systems like VAC or banning cheaters like Blizzard did to OverWatch cheaters. You want to know where the earned money goes? It goes to lawyers mostly to fight off law suits from idiots. xD Hell speaking of servers THEY GOT HACKED THREE TIMES..I'll be honest now YOU ONLY BUY THIS GAME WHEN IT'S ON DISCOUNT the amount of money doesn't equal to the service I have gotten so far.Here's Amon Hertz' saying ""Why pay for crappy services when you can look after yourself?""That's right I am talking about FiveM and then snowflake feeling from RockStar and Take Two ""AAAAAH I AM GONNA BAN YA ALL"" is just pathetic. That's right players make their own servers to get rid of modders with admins regulating them and RockStar is like ""Nope you must use mine or get banned"". Tell me isn't this stupid?OVERALL I thumbs up for the... no I don't actually I am not satisfied with Single Player it's too short and less interactive.And don't tell me ""Buying business and do resupply stuff"" in Single Player is fun.No it's not it's bunch of annoying chores with little reward in return.",Grand Theft Auto V

My mates and I were doing this challenge which basically consists in going through all the Heists without dying. We already did this same challenge but it was for a different set of Heists. Our progress kept being RESTARTED randomly. When that happens you have to begin the Heists again. GTA Online is full of flaws it's not uncommon to be playing with your team and then be moved to another session. Besides the first 2 times this bug happened(we have no idea what caused it) last try I was moved to another session and then *your progress has been restarted*. I got in touch with Rockstar Support and they kinda said ""that's it"". Look it up online you can find a great number of cases like mine. This is GTA V.

2016-01-19,0,0,131,False,Recommended,"GTAV Is a great game. You got 3 characters with different stories and their own subcast of not very important characters. A wide variety of vehicles and weaponry to use at your disposal A very large map consisting of a major city and beautiful countryside Lots of side activities for that casual gamer in you10/10 Would recommendGTA Online needs improvements. My minor complaint being you can't customize the bus but the major complaint is Hackers (or if you want to be technical about it cheaters script kitties Trainer users). Back in the GTA IV days where virtual cash meant nothing and you just did whatever you wanted Rockstar had a simple approach to players who cheated Put them in a server with a bunch of other cheaters. Problem solved. GTAV however because of the microtransactions introduction they can't exactly do that same thing. Now they're actually banning people. Problem is whatever anti cheat measures they are using don't seem to be effective as I still find myself randomly combusting in my own apartment as soon as I connect online about 60% of the time. In addition to the previous statement there are a few ""generous"" hackers that like to drop money for other players. Apparently picking up said money may get your own account banned regardless if you hack or not. Honestly who wouldn't pass up free money? Your only solution to 100% avoid hackers is essentially to host private sessions with only friends (that you know wouldn't cheat) which pretty much kills the fun of an anonymous online experience.4/10 Rockstar needs to get online priorities straight.I would highly recommend this game if priced at $32 or lower.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-31,0,0,137,False,Recommended,I'll break this into two brief summaries. One for Singleplayer GTAV and for Rockstar's GTA Online.GTA V Singleplayer It's GTA as you know. The physics have been dialed down a bit so don't expect to be launched out of your car but you'll also be seeing insane car physics. Shooting and driving both feel a bit more fine tuned. Driving in itself is a bit messier so it requires some more reaction timing than GTA IV did. The plot is broken into three characters and progressing through one story mission for one character may mean missing the story mission of the other two's perspective giving replayability some reasoning. The tone of the game is much more campy and goofy. About the same goofiness as Saints Row II I'd say. Guns are fun and Rockstar keeps adding new guns and cars to Singleplayer to keep it fresh. TL DR Fun chaos it's what you'll expect from a GTA game. Few downsides with the gameplay physics and plot but would reccomend if you liked GTA IV.GTA Online Now my experience with Online is my own so take this with a grain of salt. I personally have enjoed Online since launch day on consoles even with how buggy it was. I will give this It can be REALLY hard to navigate if the servers are having a bad day. Now it used to be constant disconnects 24/7 but these days it seems the worst is a once in a while boot from a mission. Everything plays like GTA Singleplayer but with the added exception that Rockstar's content is through the roof. There has yet to be paid DLC in this game and the DLC there is has beeng increasing in quality each time and there's so many ways to earn money that it's hard to get bored. A lot of people may be salty about how they're not getting millions quickly but I personally enjoy playing the events and modes the Online offers even if it isn't dolling out a lot of cash.The pros of Online are a lot of content to do with a lot of people but at the con of having some toxic people for sure. Though with the ability to find a new lobby quickly coming across a hacker and leaving is as easy as 5 seconds in the pause menu. Playing alone or with friends Rockstar is getting closer to balancing the two ways to play. My personal advice for someone thinking about buying this game off this review is this Buy it on your own accord. Online is made to play as you feel whetehr you want to just roam and crash a car for hours or play Heists missions stunt races golfing becoming a Beast and murdering the Free Roam lobby there's a good amount to do.TL DR Good game would reccomend for content. Cons are Toxic community at times buggy as well but steadily increasing in quality. 8/10 overall.,Grand Theft Auto V

True the community didn't change because majority of people playing are total But the addition of all those wonderful missions and cars makes up for it. Back in the day grinding was like masturbating with sandpaper and now that heists are in place it's a walk in the park. People who whine about bans fail to see that Rockstar really want's to get rid of hackers and modders and there will be mistakes done but if you try hard enough then you will surely get your character back.

2018-01-30,1,1,156,False,Recommended,Hello I like Grab That auto 5.2 for many reasons. One reason is the gameplay. You get to buy a soda drive a car into bush so strong that he can rival jeb bush. Then by mistake crash into a police officer and then get 5 stars and die. Great grampaplay. I also like the grabthiccs. While not as good as a legendary game ROBLOX. However it still is great because it includes great features like dogs and soda trucks to enhance the gamephics. Now I could dive more into statistics however I think to describe gramp fart auto 5 is imagine you are looking out in the distance in your new car you see a man in a chicken suit fighting a man in a anime costume. Then all of a sudden your have a stripper at your lap giving you a lap dance. Then you explode. OK let's talk about the characters. Frankie is a black guy who makes a rap song and everyone calls it trash so he gets 5 stars and dies. MIKEY a family man hits his tennis coach with a racket. However the tennis coach uses a reverse card and he dies. Fianlly Travis is a man who becomes a chicken and jumps off the roof. So I love this game I like this game a lot you should play it so I give it a 5 chicken suits/ 4 soda. Just a solid game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-25,0,0,575,False,Recommended,"This game has become a cooperative game. If you don't have friends that are eager to grind for money with you or you dont have a friend with everything already allowing you to just mess around then I wouldn't suggest getting this game anymore. The only reason I still play this game is because I went out of my way to grind out 270 million to mess with allowing me to just willy nilly buy anything I want and see how it works. yes I've purchased a few million but that was when I was just starting. I would honestly consider finding a mate who wants to help you out or join in on the fun with you. Or if you are some lucky rich dingus then well... buy a gazillion dollars if you want but it''l be a huge waste the moment you realise the game is in it's end phase filled with modders and soon to be replaced in the next two years by the newest version of the game.Buy this game on sale. please don't pay full price for it or you will be deeply dissatisfied.now for singleplayer that's a whole different story. if your goal in getting the game is only singleplayer then holy you found a gold mine. there is so much t to do in singleplayer through all these years that if that's all your here for then $60 is a great price for yah. (still get it on sale if you can) There are tons of single player achievemnts most people havent even gotten because of the difficulty behind getting them. there's also that oh so sweet ""100% completion"" achievement that like no one has so I would erdge you to go for that if you wanna be seen as the last person to 100% gta v before GTA VI or what ever the it'll be called comes out.Bottom line is its a great singleplayer game for soloing. multiplayer is only good if you have 2 or more friends to grind with unless someone already has all the in the game. get it if its on sale if those apply to you and enjoy. if non of them apply to you then please don't waste your time or money by getting the game on sale or full price immediately joining multiplayer then begging modders for money because it makes you look like a 5 year old that can't find mommy's wallet. seriously to all who do this STOP.thanks for slightly enjoying my words.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-13,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,Oke first of all the SP is great! Had alot of fun with it! But GTA 5 Online is terrible...GTA 5 Online is serieusly SH*T! You can do alot but that loading time....searching for rooms takes ages....most of my time goes into the loadingscreens (which is SO annoying after 15 times). Races are taking less time then looking for a party. Even playing with friends is almost impossible! For example if you go together playing a heist and some guy leaves... the entire team splitsup into an other server...so we need to join his ''world'' again which take AGES....So my conclusion is that I would not recommend this game until they fixed those loadingscreens in GTA 5 Online. They need to make it more practical. IF that doesnt happen you'd better download the game and just play the Single player version. Its not worth the money if you wait 80% of the entire time to play online if you have a Monster pc with great internetconnection.,Grand Theft Auto V

I literally got nuked everytime I respawned so me and other online players all banned the same guy at the same time. This game is a must have if you want the story.

2018-07-23,0,0,1057,False,Not Recommended,The story in Grand Theft Auto 5 is fairly good. For the recent price drop from $60 USD to $30 USD I'd be more willing now to recommend this game to others than before. For the story only of course. OnlineI cannot in good concious recommend this game for those buying it for online play. It's rife with script kitties modders and hackers. Granted that some won't mess with you but most will and usually try to get you banned and Rockstar won't care about what circumstances you found yourself in. Trust me reporting these people won't do anything even provided with video evidence of a script kittie/modder I was given a response a little like this Step 1 assure we're committed to keeping the service free of modders STep 2 issue generic step by step process to report people in game Step 3 close ticket and forget about it.Given some hilarity and fun can be had with people on the multiplayer side but at this point I cannot recommend GTA5 for anyone looking at it for online. Half the decent money making methods are locked to public servers which means high risk of modders and script kitties these days. So you'll either be dealing with people usually out to ban you or keeping to invite only orclosed friend servers. Again the story is fairly decent. I'd rate it four out of five stars. For the new $30 USD price tag I'd say wait for a sale before buying grab it a bit cheaper for the story. Unless you have friends stay out of online or out of public servers. Never know when millions will start dropping on you then find yourself banned. Final DecisionAs soon as I see a change in how Rockstar is handling the online services and especially how they accept reports of hackers modders and script kitties spawning money cleaering peoples in game money so on and so forth I'll change this review to be better favorable instead of recommending only half the game.Would recommend Story Mode won't recommend Online Mode. Overall wouldn't recommend.,Grand Theft Auto V

Multiplayer is actually pretty great! (Besides all the hackers of course) all in all i would give GTA V a 6/10 and multiplayer a 8/10. Im glad i picked up the game at 40% off though.

2015-04-24,0,0,68,False,Recommended,After a fleshed out play of ONLINE ONLY I decided I would give a review of this game because I felt I had enough of an opinion where I could. Again this is for online only I really had no interest in playing the storyline to be honest I might get around to it some day.The game play I find to be very immersive something I'm sure many of you would agree with. Whether you just want to play passively (the passive mode is probably the best thing they could have possibly added to this game believe me when I say if I had to worry about getting blow to bits 24/7 I would not enjoy myself very much) and maybe run on the beach go play some tennis or golf or go and blow up the next half of the city with your friends. And that's just free play. With heists and missions added in for obtaining income I really felt that there was a lot of content and I never really found myself getting bored playing at least not yet. The heists are always exciting to me personally and as long as you have friends to play with you'll almost always have a good time. Now a few cons to point out It would be nice if you could customize your apartments not to say they don't look nice (depending on the ones you buy) but being able to add your own content to it would make having one much more personal especially for someone who may value the role playing aspect of the game Load times/lag can be kinda but this is more or less probably due to my own computer and it's inability to properly run the game even on full screen Character aesthetics are really lacking. I mean honestly for a game that takes so much pride in it's detail I kind of expected more out of this particular part of the game. However this doesn't really effect game play and some people might not even care that much about their characters appearance. It'd be nice to see more clothes/hair/etc added in the future This going along with the apartments it'd be nice to see what they look like inside before just purchasing one The game can sometimes be very crashy. Now this is not something I personally experience a lot if even at all (usually happens after trying to leave a heist for me) but a lot of my friends I play with do. Now if this is internet issues computer issues server issues? I don't really know. I just know it can be kind of annoying at times. I feel like the lack of restaurants/clubs/other buildings to go into is kind of a let down. There are very few places you can go into other than stores and the single strip club on the map. It'd be cool if there was just a dancing action It'd also be cool to see male prostitutes but that miiiiight just be me... I'd be nice if there were more car options that weren't sports cars. Some of the little details that were in single player (like the flip flops flopping) are not in online this I'm not gonna lie was a little disappointing for me haha I like the small things.Main Pros Doesn't use Windows Live Really a beautifully made game the environment is gorgeous I feel the driving in this game is significantly better than past games whether that is true or not I don't know. I mean it is a new game so I'd think it would be. Basically the things listed above the cons.Overall I'd give the game probably a 9/10 It's a really great game that's fun with friends when it comes to screwing around however I do feel like other aspects of the game need to be polished.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-25,0,0,23,False,Recommended,Excellent scipt writing and open world. 10/10. The story is decent enough and diologue feels very organic. It improves upon every aspect of GTA lV. Game takes place in the same city as San Andreas you can even revisit Groove Street.There is a ridiculous amount of side content that will keep you busy for dozens of hours. If you are a completionist then 100%'ing this will be no small feat and chances are you will enjoy a large majority of it.So the only real negatives I have are that Rockstar gave the middle finger to single player and focused all their attention on Online. So once the game is over then thats it. No DLC or anything for those wanting more.Speaking of online it has a lot of pros and cons and it is a GRIND fest like world of warcraft has nothing on this. You will need hundreds of millions to get anywhere and no that is not hyperbole. This is in an effort to sell shark cards. Which are overpriced for what you get. Do not buy these for any reason.

The ones doing the heists cant even do the heist right. I literally just quit the game because we had the whole first mission of the prison break secured all the vagos dead plane up in the air and some how someone mystically died. They want to restart we do within the first 5 min we lost again and again and again I've lost more money trying to do the set ups then the Heist is actually worth. Best part is all the high level players think they are king they love to make fun of everyone lower then them when they lose the mission for you. Example Just played a hesit Final i get on the bus to go into the prison because i am the prisoner. Before we even get to more the being the Prison Guard blows up my car for ""Funsies"" as he calls it we lose the Heist. We restart we do everything right right before we leave the prison i hop into the truck as driver because i dont trust him to drive he glitches and throws me out of the car. I say ""Are you serious?"" he starts running me over telling me to get in all the while i have another person BMing saying that im b****ing when i have a right to because that is just blaitent disrespect. The whole community is garbage all they want to do is run around in their armored cars killing people saying they are SOOOOOOOO much better then everyone else. I cant even gain lvls anymore because no one can do any of the heist missions correctly there are no normal game missions like Deathmatch or even missions there are just Heists run by people who dont know how to play the game. I have to repeat the same mission 15 times to even get to the end where we might have a chance at success. Story mode Fantastic I love Grand Theft Auto it has been one of my favorite series since i was a kid.

2016-08-28,1,2,120,False,Not Recommended,"All in all I can't recommend GTA V. The bad outweighs the good and a lot of the time I felt frustrated by the design and limitations. Ok price would be 15 euros no more.The bad Bad NPC AI The civilians suffer from bouts of psychotic rage for no reason and the cops are teleporting telepaths occasionally equipped with X ray vision. Commonly an NPC attacks you for standing near them you beat him in fist fight and 8 cars worth of cops storm your location like you have an excess of free baseball tickets to their favourite match. When they arrive they'll start shooting like you were Hitler reborn. Drive away and soon there'll be a full on manhunt with sniper helicopters.Badly optimized With GTX 970 and compared to e.g. Mad Max the game looks nowhere near as good yet constantly stutters in FPS has shadow glitches and uses VRAM like a manic graphics designer. Occasionally FPS also drops to the single digits at which point quit &amp restart is the only option. Getting to the main menu and loading the game lasts about as long as the last ice age. Buildings are props You can't enter most of the buildings. Many of them are stores but nothing can be bought from them.Disappearing vehicles Each of the main characters has a signature vehicle which is pre chosen for you and will basically be the only vehicle you can consistently modify and find at your home. Other vehicles can be stolen but good luck in them not despawning if they get out of your FOV. Often they despawn if you so much as get out of the vehicle to fart. When they do all of the customizations you put in and paid for are gone. Sometimes you can find them at a ""rebound"" place but it's not near your homes and getting there every single time is a chore. You can buy garages which hold a maximum of 4 cars but if the vehicle despawns it won't be found in the garage either. Inconsistent All the main characters supposedly kill without remorse and 2/3 have anger and revenge issues. Yet they just accept it when they get treated like servants and pushovers over and over again.Limited When you get that money you won't be using it that much. There are no new houses to build you can't build new appliances for your existing ones or decorate them in any way. No upgrading your HiFi sets no new TVs nothing. City properties are not for sale except at some pre chosen places. For example only one car customization place can be bought and you won't be using it much as it's in the middle of nowhere. There's a fairly big selection of guns which however are pretty similar in action. E.g. I've now unlocked three assault rifles in which the only difference is some stats and sound. Specialized bullets are not available and cannot be bought. Very few haircuts / beards are available. Cars also you can buy but why the hell would you buy cars in Grand _Theft_ Auto? Then there's also tattoos which pretty much look the same and some ordinary clothes. Car customization is really the only fun thing to put money to and even there you'll be wondering why you can't customize things such as benches. In addition many vehicles such as ambulances or tanks cannot be customized at all so you won't be driving that pink camo tank around. You also can't install turrets rams or anything like that to the vehicles.Money via the stock market Basically the only way to really make money in the game is the stock market. And this involves load save scumming hundreds of times to set the prices. 95% of the missions have no reward at all.Obnoxious random encounters On the way to main missions you encounter things such as purse robberies and people asking for chaffeurs. These cannot be turned off and can have problems respawning if you don't do them right then. It's like back in Skyrim when all you want is to get to the town to sell some furs and an army of priests and talking dogs forces their way to you needing help _now_.Realistic grimdark tamagochi design decisions All character stats drop with time if they're not used. Be ready to upkeep 3 triathlonista tennisplayers who like to drive against the traffic frequent the shooting range and sneak around the neighbourhood. Body armour is single use so you can buy it over and over again.Self conflicting design 95% of the missions offer no reward whatsoever even though the principal motive of the main characters is supposedly to get money. You'll be asking yourself why am I doing these things for these people? With many missions the characters have such diabolus ex machina style bad luck that it seems the designers are trolling you. Combined with the characters just accepting it even though they are supposedly hardened psychotic money hungry criminal tough guys it really leads to problems with suspension of disbelief.Sexist No female main characters three male main characters.Unimaginative The tattoos you can buy are all very unimaginative with the only tongue in cheek one being a single small smiley face. No coloured tattoos. Clothing selection is equally unimaginative only ordinary clothes are available. You won't be buying any outrageous leather skinsuits here. You can buy eyeglasses but they all look hipsteresque and there are no dark sunglasses. For vehicles no textured paintjobs such as Hello Kitty liveries are available.The good The character of Trevor made me laugh. He was also the only really empowering main character in the whole game. Of the other main characters Michael likes to wallow in constant self pity and Franklin is basically a greedy jerk who keeps belittling and berating his friends while never arranging any work himself and never does anything for his aunt who has given him a place to live. Car chases can feel intense.Customizing cars is fun.I had fun with some of the main missions.Some of the critical humor such as with Fabien the yogi and Michael's son Jimmy is pretty funny.You can fix some of the problems such as disappearing cars via modding.

Everything was good I was in my own invite only session but today when I logged in I was banned again this time for a month.

This is an old issue as well dating back 4 years.TL DRStupid toxic community and most don't speak english. Don't play unless you have 3 other friends. Heists are impossible if you aren't playing with friends. Rockstar removed many jobs and things that used to be profitable to make money. Weapon balancing is broken.

I stutter every once and a while and on occassion freeze (not completely alt tabbing is enough to fix it) but c'mon I know a guy who gets 60fps 1080p playing this game using intel integrated graphics! If THAT ain't optimization at its finest then WTF is?!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-27,0,0,350,False,Recommended,Well... it's a great game. It's perfect in every way... however yes HOWEVER if you have a pc like mine or lower than mine DONT GET IT UNTIL YOU GET A BETTER ONE. My specs RAM 4GBGraphics card AMD Radeon HD 7310 GraphicsIn other words look at the recommended specs not the minimum specs. If you have the recommended specs or higher GET THIS GAME. If you have lower than the recommended specs DONT BUY IT. I run a pc booster and I stil get about 10 15 fps... And it wont let me get past the prologue mission because when you get to the getaway car it freezes at the loading screen for me. Don't get me wrong though if your pc can handle it GET IT.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-29,0,0,153,False,Recommended,You could play this game forever and never get bored. After I beat the main story I was just running around punching people in the face for my strength to rise I kept doing it for a hours until I punched the wrong person and got chased by a gang of chicos. Before I ended up dying I decided to switch to Trevor . bad move he had a wanted level of 4 and was in a high speed chase at the time. I decided to say screw it and got out of the car and went Rambo on the cops chasing me I had a grenade launcher so it was pretty easy to clean them up. After that I hid an underpass tunnel and waited for the cops to stop looking since my health was low. When they finally did I left to go steal a car . and was hit by one instead. Trevor died.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-23,0,0,903,False,Recommended,I really like this game and I appreciate all the effort Rockstar put into this game to create one of the best games ever made however there are lots of negatives to be pointed out.I don't play the story mode much I'm particulary into the multiplayer side which is very enjoyable with so many things to do that actually you ll never get bored. Needless to say I would've expected Rockstar would do something regarding hackers who ruined the free sessions. This is a major problem that was meant to be fixed however lately I noticed the hackers decreased considerably in the lost couple of months that's due to rockstar doing their job. I appreciate all the free DLC's which kept this game going for the last 4 years . I would rate the graphics 9/10 especially if you play on 4K monitor the image quality is quite stunning. All in all a great game with tons of things to do that will always keep you occupied.,Grand Theft Auto V

At LEAST 10 mins and after at LEAST 15 crashes that time adds up. Not to mention the time it took to go through the charater creation 6 times (my first area of proplems crash wise). And the intro to online is not short either I had to watch through that at least 5 times as well. At most I played an hour of story mode and in my refund reqeust I said all this still rejected. I'm not even sure why it's not like steam loses any money. Oh I allmost forgot when GTA crashes the game technically stays open in a little window asking you to restart. I was unaware of this and added up about 20 mins while I search the internet for crash solutions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-04,1,1,274,False,Recommended,Price/quality Free2Play Not worth the price Wait for sale Worth the price*My Notes The insane ammount of hours you can put into this game on both Online and Singleplayer is... insane. ESPECIALLY by the time this review is out the game is on Summer Sale which means its 67% Off of its original price tag. Theres absolutely no reason for you to not have this game in your library. System Requirements Bare Minimum Minimum Mid End High End*My Notes Your average PC will easly handle this game. There is a high chance you will experience some annoying input lags if your CPU isnt that powerful but it doesnt stop you from experiencing the lovely Single Player of GTA5. Game Length 4 HOURS?!!?!?! Short ( 5 7 hours ) Average ( 8 11 hours ) Long ( 12+ hours) Extremly Long ( 20+ hours )*My Notes Without modding the game will extend 20 hours easly with all of its side activities missions and other mini activities. GTA Online expands it even futher. Online takes every activity from the Single Player and adds its own small story. If you got some friends to play Online with you will squeeze a ton of days from just Online itself. Hell the game is worth its sale price just for Online as long as you have friends to play with. Difficulty and Playerbase Easy (Pure Casual) Medium (Casual) Hard (Semi Hardcore) Extremly Hard (Harcore)*My Notes Meanwhile the Singleplayer is quite casual and lacks challange The Online makes it up for it with its challange options. Making a small mistake costs your life or the challange you are after on. After you got used to it it becomes quite easy aswell but never as much easy as the Single Player. Story It doesn't have a story Horrible Painfully Average Average Good Fantastic Masterpiece*My Notes The story is quite good sadly it isnt as good as the most GTA games becouse the game focuses on multiple characters insead of one but we get to see variations of diffrent personalities and we get to play as them. Trevor is the hilarious maniac that represents the actual GTA playerbase Michael is your typical Dad that cares about his family but just couldnt show his love as the only thing he knows is killing and planning heists meanwhile Franklin is your young boi from the hood and the most intellegent of the trio all he wants is the get that sweet heist money and have an easy life but ofcourse as soon as an IRL Trevor gets their hand on Franklin he doesnt really get to take a break from killing. I have insanely oversimplified the story here but this is something you have to experience yourself insead of reading here. Performance Optimization Horrible Bad Good Enough Perfect*My Notes The game might have issues on the older CPU's especially if theres a bottleneck issue. As long as you have an average mid end PC you will be just fine. Graphic Quality Horrible Painfully Average Average Good Fantastic Masterpiece*My Notes The graphics quality is just fantastic and its well optimized at higher graphics. The game even looks cool after all these years even better than some of the recent AAA games. Installing graphical mods pushes the graphics to the Masterpiece zone easly surpassing games made with Frostbite Engine if I have to give it an example. Some graphic mods pushes it even too far you just cannot tell the diffrence between the real and the mod. But again we are talking about the base GTA5 here. Without mods Fantastic With mods Masterpiece+. Masterpiece Plus is a rating I would only give it to something that is so close to realism you cant even tell the diffrence. Sound Effect Quality Horrible Painfully Average Average Good Fantastic Masterpiece*My Notes Guns cars radio ambience and such all feels fantastic. However there is a weird issue with voice acting of Franklin... For some reason it feels like hes talking over a microphone. I really really cant put my finger on it. It just feels like its been pre precorded (duh). Soundtrack Quality It doesnt have soundtracks Horrible Painfully Average Average Good Fantastic Masterpiece*My Notes Meanwhile the Radio feels slightly underwhelming when compared to the other games in the series Rockstar finally decided to push their own soundtracks with missions and other activities. Those soundtracks are in the Masterpiece zone by themselves especially the bank heist in the Online. Sadly Radio slightly disappointed me so the rating will be balanced to Fantastic category as you will be listening to the radio most of the time. Player Rewarding Horrible Rewarding Barerly Rewarding Rewarding*My Notes I would say the singleplayer is overrewarding the player with not much challange to offer meanwhile the online is rewarding enough to keep you on the grind. Lets say the singleplayer is ment to be sandbox and does everything to reward you meanwhile Online wants you to grind to achieve stuff that can be easly achievable in single player. I would say the Online is rewarding enough to keep you in grind. Some activities are extremly bad reward wise but the heists are the true endgame content. Microtransactions It doesn't have it Pay2Win Pay2Skip (Progress Faster) Cosmetics Only*My Notes The microtransactions are the ultimate getaway for skipping content and achieving the item you want. You will basicaly paying real money to buy GTA money which is used to buy EVERYTHING. Bugs Literally unplayable Unacceptable extreme ammount of bugs Playable but extremly annoying. Acceptable Crystal Clean*My Notes In its current state I did not found any bug that affected my game experience in any shape. Ofcourse like every game that is ever existed there must be a bug here and there lying around which I couldnt find. Final Verdict Worth it. As you probably heard the game sold hundereds of millions already. The game used to have a Very Positive score before the publisher's up. The mixed rating is mostly coming from people that was boycotting the actions of the publisher which has been resolved. You MUST experience this lovechild of Rockstar both in singleplayer and the online. Force your friends to buy it and play online with them. You will not regret it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-12-14,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,Well where do I start then? When I first played GTA V back in 2014 on the PS3 things could not have been better. I and 4 other friends would login continuously and play together rolling around as a crew and playing missions together for endless hours of fun. Fast forward to me 2 weeks ago re buying the game on PC and my heart honestly sank when I started again. I found that Rockstar had introduced game breaking vehicles like the Opressor MKII which no matter where I went or what I did always seemed to kill me and could not be countered seemingly at all. It seems as though the F2P mechanics of pay now or grind forever are instilled in almost every facet now with NPC's that seem to be invincible with laser accuracy constant harrassing phone calls with random agents telling you buy some multi million dollar facility or bunker or maybe its the fact that this game still has a problem with hackers and griefers. Seems like Rockstar took everything that was pure and cool about this game and just sliced it up into small chunks ate it then sharted it all over the community. A huge disappointment to a fan who has been playing since GTA I.,Grand Theft Auto V

Infact about 80% of my playtime has just been scrrewing around with various mods. Do I reccommend this game? Yes.

2018-11-04,1,1,74,False,Not Recommended,BUY IT FOR THE SINGLE PLAYERTHERE'S NO HOPE FOR THE MULTIPLAYER (Except you are rich and doesn't mind spending additional hundreds of dollar real life money to buy the online fun or you have modded account or you are brave enough in risking buying money from modder)If you want to experience the best single player of GTA buy it! it is a great single player game!!!!If you buy it for the GTA Online Don't! It is a grinding game more grindy than any MMO you'd ever seen more grindy than peter grinding his gear. Except you just want to goof around WITH FRIENDS and not care about cool car cool tank cool plane. It's okay... I onced grind through CEO mission like for 4 hours then the enemy chopper AI suddenly shot few rockets that all hit my plane while delivering the package and that's it I've lost my 4 real life hours and got nothing. The other time I use heist to make money heist need 4 people to be started (well most of it some only 2 or less) you play solo you run GTA online loading for 10 minutes. Then you search for people in a lobby for a whole 15 minutes. You found them! yay!!! time to play!!! nope loading again for 5 minutes. The load finished! yay! time to play! nope 1 people disconnected you get out of the heist loading for 5 minutes back to lobby and finding people AGAIN for a 5 minutes. This time no one have connection issue yay!!! so you play the heist on the road from the starting point to the heist area one of your heist member got accident and die heist failed got into scoreboard 4 people pick retry &gt loading again 5 minute. This time you got to the heist area with the team!!! the heist starting police shooting one of your heist member died heist failed &gt scoreboard &gt 3 people pick retry &gt 1 people left loading again for 5 minutes to get into the lobby and search for heist member AGAIN! I've experienced 2 hours on this hell loading and failing without having fun in the heist!There's a mini game that you can use to grind well used to be... It was able to play 1 map again and again to grind level then it was patched! you can't play the same map over and over again! You need to change to random map or map of your choice the problem is the loading time! If you grind on the same map you need little loading time just retry loading for 10 seconds and you go. When you change map you have 10 minutes loading time.The devs are devil they want you to have the hardest time grinding money and want you to spend your cash on their shark cards! If the grind is not fun enough at least make it more accessible for us who doesn't want to spend more money like the ability to respawn in heist many times (you only given 2 slot of respawn I think). Resolve loading issue keep the map and scenario in RAM and keep the people in the server when people are disconnected. There is many things they can do! but they won't for the money...The game is unforgiving in making moneys you waste time and in the end if the enemy AI got lucky your time is gone. It is easier if you have a friend with you but you can't share money to people in this game! It's waste of time for them to help you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-03,0,0,208,False,Not Recommended,With Online Mode being pretty boring as it is another story mode with heartless people who love to destroy your 1 million dollar car the game pretty much needs to have mods to make it more fun. But with the constant updates that add more and more cars that cost way more than a beginner can afford mods keep having to update constantly and that makes people who have mods wait for at most a month or 2. The Story is VERY boring and it is much too easy to get banned in Online mode. I like the game but after just having 130 hours I have gotten very bored of the game and it is pretty pointless to buy the game if you want to play for a long time. I can see how people can like this game and get addicted but I just don't see it happening to me. I would not reccomend this game anyone at any time.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-02,1,1,268,False,Recommended,"Five years later and its still a masterpiecePros Graphically not only hold up after all this time but is still stunning GTA Online is an online RPG but traded the magic for guns the strange creatures for interesting NPCs and the mounts for cars. Its quite an interesting mix of two completely different worlds that will keep you hooked Plenty of fun to just drive around and kill people Hours upon hours of campaign missions as 3 different playable characters Thousands of activities after the campaign is over including yoga golf tennis skydiving and more! Dozens of free DLCs and tons of added content over the yearsCons GTA Online is INSANELY grindy if you want the fun stuff Microtransaction prices are VERY VERY bad (the economy was ruined after the PC and next gen versions came out. The physical shark cards sold in stores clearly print how much GTA$ youll recieve so they cant really even fix this. A $100 REAL LIFE DOLLARS shark card will get you $8million in GTA$. What will that get you? 2 cars OR a plane OR a couple businesses. Yeah not really worth it since working hard will get you $8million in less than a full day of playing) GTA Online has occasional trouble with hackers. They can be slow to respond to problems but are generally pretty good about patching exploits people use. All in all I would give this non intrusive but easily bypassed security a 3/10.Final Notes If you are only in it for the single player theres hundreds of hours of content in that alone. This game not only offered 3 completely different but strangely close friends as full playable and switchable on the fly but put them in a large and diverse city rife with crime. You take the shoes of either Franklin Michael or Trevor. Franklin is a ghetto bound black male trying to find his way to a better place than a life of slums and petty crime. Michael a comfy and wealthy father figure to a family that hates him with every fiber of his being. His son is addicted to video games and doesnt leave the house. His daughter is sleeping with anyone that can get her even a sliver of fame. And worse yet his wife is sleeping with everyone but him! Michael just wants a family who loves him and to keep living his cozy life. Trevor is the madman of the game. With his addiction to drugs his dirty looks and his murderous and uncontrollable rage that he feels at all times can and does get him into a lot of trouble. Follow this gang of misfits as they band together and try to work their way to the big score the heist that will give them all the money they could ever need. Will Franklin get out of the ghetto? Will Michael save his broken family? Will Trevor... do... idk. Find out in this incredibly long but not stretched out campaign.GTA Online is a partially burned Picasso. You can still see its value its beauty and its potential but its damaged and likely beyond repair. If you can put up with broken pricing models cheaters griefers grinding traffic thats programmed to go out of their way to hit you when you are on specific missions where damaging the vehicle is detrimental and other shady crap the online is still quite fun. While the game offers private sessions for just you and your friends to play every single business and business activity is locked away unless you play in public sessions. There are glitches you can use (some of which are completely unpatchable and will last forever) that allow you to play in ""public"" sessions but nobody can connect to you but your friends. This unlocks the full online mode to you but without the hackers and griefers. This SUBSTANTIALLY increases the value of the game and honestly as easy as it is to do the glitch I am surprised Rockstar hasnt given in and just allowed all modes and businesses even in private lobbies.A beautiful and perfect masterpiece of visuals and storytelling with an incredibly broken but still fun online component 10/10",Grand Theft Auto V

It's been a while since I installed and played GTA V online I left last time due to individuals who use various cheats for example god mode. I decided to install and log on hoping if it has calmed down and attempted various missions like the pistol and hatchet challenges I was hunting down my first bounty for the challenge when approached by two players. One got out of his car and tried to shoot I was able to run him over countless times even blowing up the vehicals on him he was still alive and dropped me once he got up. It's not worth the hassle and I hope in future GTA titles the ability to have a private server for your friends.

2018-10-25,0,0,717,False,Recommended,If you want to purely play GTA V for the singleplayer buy it it's a must in this case however if you're going for the multiplayer don't expect amazing gameplay. I've spent hours amongst hours 'grinding' for my money and I don't think it was worth it. It gets boring. After grinding endlessly you buy your overpriced vehicle that is no match for those tryhard/modder users who will kill you if you are or aren't selling your product it gets fustrating. The grinding part is pretty fun if you just do missions and heists etc but if you buy businesses and sell it gets repetitive. After you have everything you want then what? You quit and you get bored real fast you feel like all those hours were wasted. If you don't mind a game that's about grinding and getting killed occasionally then this is the game for you. Buy for singleplayer don't expect much from multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

They even got into this world as a result of their fathers cheating on their mothers. So their whole world is cheating. From now on I will stick to the single player games.

Bringing it to PC was a great move because of mods and just the community support overall. The game is beautiful and just fun to play especially online with a bunch of friends or random people. The story in singleplayer is a mayor improvement from Grand Theft Auto IV just because this time you have three characters instead of one and they're all working together. Also the optimization is pretty good and knowing Rockstar saying this really means a lot. This game is a must buy!Should you play this game? Yes!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-14,0,0,109,False,Recommended,Not gonna bother on the single player experience as its the same for everyone as for the online part I'll try to share as much as I can. The online part of GTA is loads of fun just you doing your thing until some bastard in a hydra blows you up. But I can't say much as that's part of the online experience. After hours of grinding you're gonna get bored real fast everything in the online version costs so much money! Even after doing 1 heist you still won't have enough cash to buy literally anything! Its a total grindfest and it gets stale real quick. If you're planning to buy GTA for the online content be prepared to grind for hours just to get one car or a house we can't really blame rockstar on this as every DLC they give us is free and they're still providing us with new content for a 3 year old game. So I guess if your not into grinding you'll have to buy the sharkcards or hire a modder and probably get banned. That's basically Gta5 online. I'll give a 7/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-28,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,TLDR Singleplayer is basically the same gameplay as gta4. If this is your first GTA game I reccomend playing GTA 4 instead. If it's not your first game and you loved GTA 4 and want something more this game's single player is just fine for that.Some Cutscenes are unskippable.GTA V Online is bad . Details on why below h2 Bad Parts of GTA V Online /h2 It's a dumpster fire of obscenely long load times even on an SSD with 32gb of ram and with a 1080ti gfx card and an easily identifable attempt by Rockstar to shamelessly milk cash from one title by capitalizing as hard as they can on microtransactions. For example at time of writing the DLC for this game only applies to online gameplay. Even if you can tolerate the absolutely horrendous load times The missions you play are not what I'd call fun but i didn't play very many of them because I just got sick of dealing with the obscene load times. There is next to nothing to do in openworld except for steal and sell cars (which has a 45 minute cooldown) and rob stores which is fun but the stores are very spaced out and only give 1 2k. (1 2k is basically nothing). So to actually progress you basically are forced to tolerate the load times. Which further slows down progression and part of me wonders if Rockstar has intentionally left the systems in this state to make people buy their microtransactions.How are the missions? Pretty mediocre sprinkle every single round with 1 3 minutes of load time for 15 35 minutes and a really mediocre payout per mission 12 50k on avg unless you're doing highend stuff with a group at higher levels have fun grinding to get there.All Cutscenes are unskippable unless everyone has watched it so tie that into the loadtime intermittently too.I guess my point is that you can probably enjoy GTA V online but unless you really really enjoy loading screens or are willing to spend extra money on Shark cards you're probably gonna have a bad time trying to find out how to enjoy gta v online.P.S. Open world pvp is pretty mediocre because it's almost always whoever brought a helicopter wins. The attack helicopter everyone uses costs 1.75 million iirc. If you bought the game for something like fun open world pvp which is what i bought it for have fun grinding to get one and if you try to pvp before that have fun dying to helicopters out of nowhere. h2 Other stuff /h2 I didn't like the car physics didn't feel good or fun to drift or like there was driving skill involved. There are custom servers though that you have to access through a 3rd party client which are fun and oddly enough don't have huge load times to get onto.GTA5 online 2.5/10GTA5 singleplayer 6/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-04,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,I'd not write reviews often since I have this game I want to let people know that GTA V is good for the multiplayer I don't think the story is relevent since they promote the online more than the story itself since GTA V are starting to become more of an MMO than a signle player game.I would say that this game forces you to make micro transactions in order to get new items since you have to grind about a week or two in order to obtain these new content items cars boats helicopters planes arpartments and even weapons I would say that the game lacks in online single player heists and other missions that players tend to play online to sometimes do solo mainly for completion so far I would give this game a 6/10 due to lack of single player since its too focused on multiplayer missions that people have to wait around for then become disappointed in when one person leaves.So please Rockstar or anyone who works for Rockstart just add in more AI so when people leave during a mission the AI takes over and assists in the mission or heist rather than the whole spit rinse and repeat nonsense that winds up people and makes them waste their time.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-31,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,"Trying to write a review based on objectivity and not on personal preferences.i am not recommending this game and here is why pros first of all the story mode (offline mode so to say) is from a story point of view very good and interesting. the characters are well written. a lot of dark jokes and biting bitterness. graphics look decent even on an average pc there really is a lot of content in the game from tennis over car racing to heists. just a lot to check out.cons controls are sometimes a real horror. make only a tiny press on the button and your char makes a jump forward like he is on cocaine and has therefore too much energy. again controls. just not made intuitive. wanna get the lights on your car on whats your first guess? ""L"" for light? Or ""E"" the usual interaction/action button in most games? Nah screw it its ""H"". Of course you can change that in the options but trust me the moment you are expected to do sometzhing on a mission you have never done before you will press your whole keyboard to find the right button. another example? ""M"" is usually MAP.... here its a small menu the map itself hides behind ESCAPE... wtf any online server with population is a deathmatch zone. not a problem the devs are solely to blame for but if you are new to the game be ready to come online and be killed after several seconds to minutes usually by some sort of rocket from the middle of nowhere. playing online with your friends on an empty server makes fun so get some friends playing with you. game can be very frustrating when objectives are unclear. prepare to restart missions a lot. the AI driving cars on the street are sometimes soo damn stupid as mentioned by many others cheating seems to be still very popular in this game.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-24,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Are you only interested in the single player? Go ahead GTA V feels like a worthy improvement over its predecessor for most of the time.Do you want to play with other people? Halt! Don't expect that you are going to play a game that had an initial cost. This territory of the game follows a free to play scheme. It's astonishing to see Rockstar &amp Take Two get away with such a heavy microtransaction based system. If you fall into their trap you would only be supporting their shady behavior to expand in the next installments.It's not like this is a cooperative online game either. No. There is hardly any collaboration between strangers. All everyone does is mindlessly kill and bully each other on free roam mode. Missions are not great either. Granted the gameplay feels awesome. But the implementation of a leaderboard system in which only the winner gets the spotlight ruins the feeling of accomplishment if you don't finish on the front. Oh and let's not forget about the half of your time that was spent on the loading screen.I rarely feel like I made a mistake by purchasing a game.

2015-11-27,0,0,1825,False,Recommended,"This game has some issues but it's a decent product. The single player mode is a slight departure from previous games as there are three protagonists this time around. Each is unlocked as the story progresses and some missions may limit the character you can play as. There's Franklin the ""young hustler"" a repo man for a scam business. His special ability is slowed time and increased traction while driving. Michael the retired bank robber who is stuck in a loveless family despite having more money than he would ever need. His special ability is slowed time while on foot AKA ""bullet time"". Lastly Trevor the angry meth head who is loyal and surprisingly kind to those he likes. His special ability is decreased damage taken and increased damage output while on foot. The story itself isn't amazing but it works very well especially the first time you play through the game.There are a number of glitches that can occur such as collectibles and side mission givers not spawning guns disappearing and the occasional physics glitch. If you are going for 100% completion I advise you to prioritise collecting the letter scraps and doing the ""Strangers and Freaks"" missions as soon as they appear.On to GTA Online Unless you have friends you may not even want to play the online mode. It is a grindfest but having fun with people you know can make it a very enjoyable experience. Try to find a crew and practice playing SP before jumping to online.Guns clothes some cars and hair / makeup all unlock as your level increseases (you must still purchase the items you want they are just locked to certain levels). The XP is called ""RP"" in GTA O and you get this from losing wanted levels completing game modes (including survivals contact missions and heists the only co operative game modes) participating in free roam events and other options I can't think of right now. Level 135 is the last level to unlock anything for your character (135 unlocks a 10th slot in your inventory for body armor to be held in). Level 120 unlocks the last gun (the minigun) and the last clothes (character's sex determines what clothes are available to you).There is a large problem with script injectors and menu users in GTA O especially in free roam the lobby system where up to 30 players can be in one session with full access to Los Santos. The problem arises from GTA O being a peer to peer connection system there are no servers save for the Rockstar character data server which saves your progress online occasionally. This issue can be mitigated by playing with your crew in closed crew sessions and leaving public sessions when evidence of scriptors becomes apparent.All in all I have spent far too long playing this game and most people looking at the store page for it would likely enjoy it as well. Though it has issues GTA V is a fun game especially online with friends and crews.8/10",Grand Theft Auto V

Not one single word in reply i got from that even though he happily sent other people information. So making another ticket gave me a autoresponse. 3rd ticket i managed to get a actual person to reply to in which he had pasted the auto response bots reply which basically says ""yeah we honestly do not care the least now go yourself kind regards random employee 1""This is the worst piece of crap customer service i have experienced in my 30 years of gaming and i've dealt with EA. I wont recommend this to anyone sure the single player is nice but the online crap with modders and whatnot running rampant that arent being banned (yeah most of them arent banned) then the legit players get randomly banned cause it's fun for rockstar yeah sorry this is the last title i buy and i dont care if it doesnt make an impact on you but i've bought pretty much all the games you've released up to this point.

There is some truth to hackers/modders/try hards that will occasionaly wreck the experience but that's what 'Online &gt Find new session' was made for. Solo online play is also pretty rough MUCH better with friends but I have been able to do solo have a good time and make good progress.

2019-01-05,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,If you don't bother about Online stuff then this is a positive review. Singleplayer is an amazing experience.GTA Online is one of the buggiest and crappiest excuses for a game. Loading times are horrendous for both entering the game and loading a mission things are glitchy and the game is overall unstable.As for the gameplay itself it also sucks it's glitchy and laggy and overall experience is not something that I would consider Grand Theft Auto. There are people with endgame gear flying around with motorcycles that have homing missile cannon and are nearly impossible to kill with starter gear.There is also a space pistol which sends vehicles flying and ragdolls people. This is not something that should appear in Grand Theft Auto as anything else but a singleplayer easter egg weapon.Missions are extremly annoying to play as they often require more than one or two players which means if you're playing solo or with a friend you would be joined by at least 2 more people which often do not speak English or just won't bother to communicate. If any of the players leave mission will automatically end and be classified as a faliure which means you have to start the whole process again.Talking about annoying stuff there are the phone calls which are basically asking me every two to three minutes to buy a property I as a new player do not have a fraction of the required money. Or they would bother you about a dumb event thats currently going on in the community. This wouldnt be much of a problem if they werent so damn frequent and repetitive. You can't even decline the call and the best part they can appear during combat with other players and prevent you from doing certain actions.NO Tony! I do not care about your nightclubs shut the up already.Even after that he sends me a damned text REMINDING me of the phone call we had earlier.The worst part is the highly toxic community where stronger players will mercilessly attack players who even if skilled enough cannot counter their gear. Regardles of that players you randomly encounter in the world doing their own thing would often greet you with a headshot which has also made me do the same thing in fear of getting killed.Sadly even after all that I'm still hooked on the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-16,0,0,1495,False,Recommended,Wow I just noticed I am nearing 800 hours in GTAV. I think that calls for a summerized review. Okay I am sure I am going to take heat here for going against the current trend of negative reviews for this game. That is okay I love speaking my mind I can handle any criticizm that anyone has. To be frank no one of us is right or wrong in our reviews. A review or critique is just a matter of opinion anyways and I am just sharing mine. I respect everyone else's since freedom of speech and personal expression should be a right for every human.Okay having nearly 800 hours played here I have to definitely recommend GTAV for anyone who is a fan of the series and somehow has not bought it yet or if you are a fan of sandbox/multiplayer games in general. I don't work for Rockstar and am not a fan boy I happen to have over 30 years of experience as a gamer. I have had the blessing of watching the birth of the gaming industry and watch it become what it is today. I know there is a lot of anger right now toward Take Two and Rockstar over their new stance on modding. My review is based only on the vanilla game. I have never used a mod in the game and I have nothing at all against modding in a single player offline setting. Now the single player mode while good to me the story in no way compares to the depth of GTAIV. I like all of the characters especially Tevor but not receiving any additional DLC for the story mode like in the previous games leaves me wanting more.Now where GTAV falters a bit in the story mode the online mode more than makes up for it. I am fortunate to have a vast number of good and trustworthy friends to play with in online mode and let me tell you there is no online game on any platform that gives you the play variety of GTAV online. You can race in a huge variety of vehicles environments and modes. Do you like shooting? There is such a huge variety of modes where you can team up with your friends or go in an all out deathmatch it will make your head spin. Oh man I am just getting started! You even have tennis and golf. While simplistic and not perfect these modes are also a blast to play with friends. The quailty while not perfect definitely is better than a mediocre stand alone golf/tennis game. Want more? Go play some darts run some CEO missions Call some friends to do a challenging prision break heist! There are hours and hours upon missions and events in free mode there is not enough room here to list them all. Suffice to say there should be something for everyone here. I know I know a lot of the nice things are expensive in GTAV. I like that. In real life you have to work hard to earn things like that nice home or a nice new car. Things earned though effort bring about appreciation and satisfaction. I know this is just a game but too often now days people look for the easy way out...say money drops on everyone in the session. The modding online was getting to be so ridiclous you could spawn in a public session and get modded instantly. Modding people that don't want it is wrong and unfair not to mention cheating in a PvP environment gives you a fake sense of satisfaction if you ''win.'' They may have went a bit far when they banned mods in the offline mode but something had to be done to restore the original playing experience the game was intended to provide online. That is final thought on GTAV. Knowing every weekend I get to do 100's of different events with my friends makes me feel satisfied I bought this game. It is a must buy but wait for a sale. The price of $59.99 USD is way to high for a 2+ year old game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-19,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,"Minions are probably the greatist thing to happen in recent human history. It just shows how far 3D animation and computer technology has come and how we spent all these years developing algorithms and processors to fully render a lil chicken nugget guy's huge lardy lumps complete with a photorealistic brownish yellow inbetween those luscious cheeks. 3D technology has allowed humans to realistically jiggle big fat yellow fartknockers right in the theater with the 3D glasses. I saw this film in the theater and I just couldn't help but cry at the hyperrealistic s which clenched and pulsate right in your face. I've been buying minion toys nonstop since that changing moment of my life. I am now a Minionist with over 2000 reposted minion pictures across each of my social media accounts and 500 minion toys under my (literal) belt. I just can't get enough at those fat muffintops bulging out those tight overalls before ballooning out as the minion's pants drop while they say ""Bottom!"" violently rumbling as they unleash torrents of rapid fire fart flashes coated so much with particles it actually colors the otherwise invisible gas clouds. And my favorite is when they spread their cheeks wide open and you can see all the hairs sticking out their (look at their heads for an idea).

2017-12-14,0,0,64,False,Not Recommended,"So I've played GTA Online on the PS4 and now on the PC on a very high end system. The game itself is pretty fun whenever you're allowed to play it. However the loading screens are still horrendous and it literally takes their matchmaking system 30 seconds to a minute and sometimes more to figure out who is around the same level and who they should set you up with. So basically 50% of the time you spend in GTA 0 is sitting staring at the clouds nothing else just clouds and I'm so sick of it. Every other game on the planet can update their matchmaking algorithms and network code to lower the amount of time it takes to find a game down to 10 seconds or less. You guys need to do something to fix this because I won't play it again until you do. Get someone to look at your databases and or reprogram the fackin algorithm to speed the matchmaker up. It's been like this for years now and you'll take our money but not even provide a decent service in return? Oh and on top of that once you've been matched you're going to also get the ""network error"" half of the time on that as well dropping you out of the match you waited so long for. Fix your fckin code or get someone who knows about databases to streamline them for you.",Grand Theft Auto V

However the online is slighly flawed. The addition of new veicles and buisnesses is a good way to keep players interested. However there are quite a few factors that are seriously limiting them. For example Some players only join you MC clubs to troll you or simply dont understand what to do when their sitting a level 120.

GTA online will be more fun if you have friends to play with but the singleplayer is worth the asking price alone.,Grand Theft Auto V

Spend too many hours staring at wikis and tech sites figuring out how to get it to run right. AMD already announced if you have an RX 400 series card don't even use this games msaa causing too many issues. Oh yeah Online is cheater infested as always. If you get this don't buy it for $60 check out those ""other stores""Update 6/18/2017 You killed the community that has kept your games alive since 2001 and even made an online component before you ever did. This is not how a company should treat its fans fans who have even gained real life jobs in game development from testing and practicing safe singleplayer modding in your games. I am highly dissapointed in Take Two Interactive and their CEO Strauss Zelnick. As for Rockstar I know they make the calls not you I just hope at some point Zelnick steps down and somehow this can all be fixed. Probably won't be for years seeing as how much money he has made and even insisted he isn't making as much as he could in an interview. So saddened to see a community that has bonded together since the late 90's fall apart like this. Update 3/19/2017 THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN CORRECTLY FOR ANYONE 8/10 TIMES. YOU WILL FREEZE STUTTER AND SEE THE WHOLE WORLD GO INVISIBLE. DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED.Update 12/30/2016 If you are an I5 processor user this game will have massive compatibility issues for you. It won't be unplayable but you will have to drop down to the lowest settings to run it smooth. Wait for a update fix before buying if you are an I5 user.Also there is a new mod menu that is spreading like crazy as the creator made it publicly usable don't know why. Thats why the false claims of ""Rockstar banned me and I did nothing."" are all over the place. So be warned that GTAO is currently modder infested.ORIGINAL REVIEW Odds are you already played this on console. If you liked it then you'll like it now with better graphics and actually above 25fps online. Just watch out for modders most want to mess with u or kill the whole lobby repeatedly with your name attached and get you vote kicked out the lobby. Other than that its a great game. HOWEVER the last update messed up optimization for a lot of people I'm getting way more frame drops and stuttering setting the game to high or realtime priority in task manager did help some but issues still arise.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-14,1,1,139,False,Not Recommended,"This is all assuming you manage to launch the game of course. This is a good game that you should get on console not this horrid PC versionPros First Person Got to take part in the greatest heist of all. Rockstar taking my money.Cons Cutscenes don't trigger in first person causing the game to enter an endless loop untill you reload your game. When I met Simmeon for the first time he just outstretches his arms for a hug and thats it. The game shutdowns as I can't give him a hug or interact with anything in the game. #Left a Brother hanging The game lags when moving at high or medium speeds. Go above 50 miles per hour and the game will lag untill you find yourself in the middle of the street thrown from your vehicle and about to be run over by cop car. I had to run in DirectX 10 just to play and even that lagged. Its fine if you want a walking simulator though or don't drive vehicles of any kind. Online Tutorial. Not a tutorial. It just makes you join a race match which doesn't matter if you win lose stop the car to take a or crash the vehicle. Doesn't tell you any controls or features and makes you sit through very long cutscenes that of course glitch out and enter an endless loop. So you try and make a new character but the game instanly crashes when you press edit character. ""Do you want some cheese."" Lamar enters his car and drives away then comes back to ask over and over. Before asking that however he claims some people are just too clingy.

2017-06-22,0,0,137,False,Not Recommended,Im actually hella upset at Rockstar for this game. Its so terribly optimised. My PS4 runs it and its like a solid 30 maybe. I run it on 720p lowest settings on PC and its a jittery framey mess seemingly at random. Then dont even get me started on those new gunrunning vehicles. I was murdered for a solid 2 hours by a group of 3 each with their own APC. I was trying to play with friends to leaving was not an option and nobody likes to be forced out of a lobby by idiots anyways. I wasn't gonna let anyone force me into passive mode so I stayed strong and tried to fight them off. It didn't work. They have infinite rockets they are rocket proof and make anyone who drives one a Harbinger of death. Unfair advantage for anyone who is a modder. They become god when they get an APC. Honestly I want my money back. But we know thats not gonna happen.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-08,0,0,2133,False,Recommended,"Greatest game I have played to date well over 500 hours now and I still can not wait to get back to it after work!Had to edit this as it does not do the game justice.I guess I made it short and quick so I could get back to it but really this game is the ultimate.Since originally writting the review I have flirted with a few other games and even had a Minecraft relapse and yet I keep coming back to GTA V I have clocked nearly an extra 1000 hours on this game since originally posting and forsee many more being spent.So why is this game so good?Its perpetually groundbreaking.There are no other games out there to my knowledge that have the immersion as GTA V sometimes it feels that your living more in San Andreas than in real life the things you can do in this game seem never ending and just when you have spent ridiculous ammounts of time on this game Rockstar release more content and not just crappy free DLC Actual content that gets you excited! Whenever something new is coming out teasers are found on the net that get you so excited that you cant wait to play the game again it keeps recreating that wow moment that makes you go ""Man I want to play that game!!""C'mon man is it really that good?YESS!! When ever you log on you could be on your way to any number of adventures what happens once you log on is totally up to you you could be a racer hanging out at Car Meets and go around doing up mad cars and racing them placing high stakes bets on yourself to win. You could be an explorer and let me tell you there are plenty of places to explore and not all of them are easy to find get to I still see new things in this game I have not seen before. You could be a merc a boss an angel or a prick the options only end with you chances are if you can think of it you can do it in this game.Surely it has some bad points?Well nothing is perfect thats human. GTA does have some issues from time to time however they are kind of like a prickle in your toe at a carnival with free rides.. it's annoying and even hurts a bit but at the time the only thing on your mind is playing more.There have been issues with hackers in this game there are funny glitches sometimes drop outs here and there loading can take a bit of time. However to be fair Rockstar have not sat back on this and have done alot of work on this since release. There are now fewer hackers than I have ever seen glitches seem to be less and the game just feel polished. As long as your not going to try and run this HUGE game on a potato PC I think you will love it.Advice Get amongst it dont be shy make alot of new friends dont hold back and listen to the vet's as they may show you some very cool stuff.",Grand Theft Auto V

The level of detail is truly immense the missions are fun graphics marvelous and everything else about this game is well made.The online game is a bit of an add on to the game which comes for FREE. It has it's problems with being internet based loading and getting kicked out of sessions just as you were about to make bank and instead lose some because you had invested your money and time into the mission.

2017-11-16,0,0,420,False,Recommended,Do i really need to tell you how awesome this game is! The single player is one of the best in gaming history. The aspect of switching between 3 different main characters is almost completely seamless and works with the story. The online is still getting occasional updates patches and addons and this is 2017! The downside to online is that it doesn t take long for modders to take hold. Rockstar does what they can to deter this i suppose but it does nothing in the way of jumping into a session to already be on fire have someone spawn multiple aircrafts right in the center of town to attempt to crash everyone s game or the most annoying god mode flying motorcycles. That s just to name a few. Because of players like this it makes the online almost intolerable at times. I do not fault the developers for this but if you intend to play online be aware of the highly probable chance of you running into one of these modders. Outside of modders the online is literally everything i could imagine an online GTA being. The implementation of ceo biker bunker hangar etc missions make staying in the main session fun! There are options for instance missions races etc as well. There s practically something for everyone!Overall this game gets an overwhelming positive rating however i wish they could do more to deter modders for the online community.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-10-25,0,0,1912,False,Not Recommended,I have been a huge fan of GTA for years so much so that Vice City is up there with my favorite games of all time. However GTA V may have cured me of that. As far as story mode goes it's okay. Honestly I just never really got into it like I have with previous titles. The clunky three protagonist storyline didn't help matters either as I quite honestly do not like Franklin Michael or Trevor.Now the elephant in the room... Grand Theft Auto Online. Just... what a complete and utter mess. Two major problems exist griefers and modders. It has gotten to a point where unless you have a really decent crew and are armed to the teeth you cannot even hope to get anything done. I attempted to do the same resupply for the same bunker 6 times in 6 different lobbies. Every time I was either immediately blow out of the sky by a griefer camping my bunker or just randomly exploded thanks to the rampant modding problem. GTA Online just isn't fun to play anymore and has basically become a playground for trolls and script kiddies with R* doing absolutely NOTHING to solve the problem. For this insult (and the fact that I was suckered into paying for the game TWICE when it released on the next gen consoles) I will never forgive R* and find it highly unlikely that I will support any of their games in the future.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-12,0,0,495,False,Not Recommended,First of all I like single player. Its just perfect. Very well optimised and graphics are exquisite. However GTA Online has been built basically into same game as single player which causes issues. It doesnt support mods because every time I try install mods game replaces them to original files. There are ways to install successfully mods but it takes so much time and space in my hard drive. And thats not all you need to log in Social Club at least every second time when you play so your game would be scanned again.All of these plus awful antihack system because Rockstar didnt make GTA Online as independent game. Don get me wrong I'm still grateful that Rockstar made PC version. But I'm not happy how at the same time they abuse mods and they don't do a thing in GTA Online's antihack.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-10-26,0,0,421,False,Recommended,I think the best way to describe GTA V is story mode purists 12 year old nihilists in GTA Online and people who complain about Shark Cards because they can't afford to buy them and don't want to put the time into the game but other than that it's a solid game with a somewhat solid (?) community too. It's fairly well optimized for (almost) any PC although you might have to mess with the settings a wee bit. It may seem like a bit of a grind to begin with but once you get into the routine it becomes a very enjoyable experience. Whether you want to become a CEO and dominate other businesses or you want to walk around in boxers air thrusting civilians you can find it in this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-01,0,0,2118,False,Recommended,"After playing this game for many years I still find enjoyment out of turning GTA on and seeing what's going on in the Online world of GTA. Their company has been at battle against certain aspects of the community (aka modders) for a while. This has caused them to ""fight back"" by sending a letter to OpenIV developers to cease and desist. This caused major backlash within the community forcing Rockstar to take back their cease and desist order and modify it to appease those who use modding for creative purposes. They aim to get rid of the modders who play the game and ruin the experience of others. From my perspective this is fine business practice and shows that they listen to their player base. Rockstar isn't perfect the grind in multiplayer is quite unfair to the guy/gal who doesn't like to spend a bunch of time/money on the game to get all the cool stuff. Is the grind the fault of Rockstar pricing everything too high? Or is it because modders flooded the in game economy with so much money there is inflation?

2017-06-19,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,I don't install mods that are useless. But to make the game more immersive as a developer it's important for me to understand how certain textures and models are made and OpenIV has definitely helped me understand how a big game like Grand Theft Auto V works. Not to mention that the way that I've modded the game shows potential on what future Grand Theft Auto titles might look like. Not only that but it shows how other games might look in the future too. The mods that I use are Redux via Josh Romito and several others for real logos and billboards. It also has a VR mod to give me better exploration and to help me with my pre planning for my photography and videography projects I do when in L.A. I simply use it as a part of my workflow and not to slander anyone when online.So you can kinda see my point. Rockstar and Take Two should understand that developers like us are trying to shape the future. Not with something like Ironman flying around or silly car mods with jet wings but to see how real can we get it without losing the aesthetics of the game. I have spent over $300AUD on all three PS3 PS4 and PC and all I ever wanted was to see more and more detail and modding is the only way to do that. It's not a back latch but I only ever play single player and I find it a little unfair since I'm using the modding for research purposes.If I have to be honest here my teacher has modded the early GTA titles and because of that he is pretty successful and that might have actually started his interest in creating models etc. He's worked on several games including his own. So I honestly don't see anything wrong with modding when it comes down to that. If it helps you understand certain things then it shouldn't be taken down especially if you are aspiring to be good at modeling.,Grand Theft Auto V

But as with most of the other negative reviews currently going up I cannot support something that is pushing microtransactions in a FULL PRICED GAME. Banning the modding which is only supported in single player is not the right way to stop hackers in online gameplay. How about you fix the economy in online Take Two/Rockstar to support and reward gameplay and not have players needing to sink 100s of hours just to buy 1 of the latest cars or thow $20 more at a title that you have already PAID FOR to get a minor amount of in game cash. $1 000 000 doesn't mean anything in this game where a set of pants costs $20K.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-14,0,0,356,False,Not Recommended,Trash the campaign is good. But the online is ed. They don't have centralized servers so when other players mod you could be included in the fun. But the downside is that if you're flagged for being a modder they will reappriate er take your hard earned in game cash. Had them take more than 1.5 million from me more than once due to someone modding in a server I was on ages ago. So as they're clearly hellbent on these micro transactions I'm out Golden Eye source is free and plenty more fun seeing a free game is the exact opposite as a developer who steals your experiance points aka in game cash. Love tiny racers but I must've grinded over 60 hours between the weeks before and after July 4th and now I have 50k after R* ahem lost any record of them already adjusting my in game cash. Like I said all I grinded 60+ hours for that ing helicopter with two miniguns and I'm clearly never going to get it unless I buy the game from them again I mean purchase their shark cards. So have fun with your cash but I bought a copy for a friend when it was on sale around christmas and they banned him after creating his character and playing around 1 hour. He already had it for his PS4 but of course I had to waste my money and my time trying to provide a way for him to play online with me. ing figures I'd get ripped off from a studio infamous for titles such as GTA.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-05,0,0,148,False,Recommended,This game is probably my favorite game ever. The single player is a long well written and fun campaign with some awesome moments. The multiplayer while there are many hackers is also incredibly fun if you have friends to play with. The multiplayer heists are well designed and have immense replayability. My only complaint with the multiplayer is that many cars and outfits are fairly expensive. Overall I would rate this game a 9.5/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-09,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,If you are purchasing this game on pc/mac for the sole purpose of modding DON'T. You will get banned from GTA Online even if you don't go into online mode. I hadn't even tried to go online after a couple of days of modding and when I tried to go online (yes even after I uninstalled all of my mods.) I couldn't because I used mods in storymode.,Grand Theft Auto V
