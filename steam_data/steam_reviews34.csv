2017-12-21,0,0,257,False,Recommended,Never written a steam review before but I feel I have to after all the Negative reviews here. TL DR at the end. Some reviews complain about hords of Chinese hackers on Games which i've seen videos of but have not seen any in my own playtime (EU servers). Some complain about a 'myrad of technical issues' but do not elaborate beyond it taking up ALOT of RAM and VRAM which may be true since with 16gigs ram iv'e no issues. Rubberbanding has never happened except for the time the entire house had internet because my country has a data cable from the 1970s or something and hackers are nowhere as prevalant as some people say. Not encountered any blatant hacking yet and the inclusion of the Death Cam is a great help in finding hackers especially with aim wall and recoil hacks.IMHO this is an incredibly fun game to play transitioning from relaxed looting to suddenly tense and almost panicky moments as another player/squad find you or you realize the blue circle is closing in on you and youy have no car. Playing with friends is an absolute blast especially if you all have a similar sense of humor as after every gunfight or funny mishap while driving you can all make a few good jokes about it.TL DR Extremely fun game to play alone or with friends with funny calm and tense moments all over. It is also one of the few games I've played where I do not feel crushing dissapointment when I don't win as long as YOU think you did well you have fun.Loads of fun bring friends and enjoy the massacres.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,819,False,Not Recommended,Overall it's a challenging yet fun game but the hackers with aim and esp cheats (especially Chinese players) have been a plague since beta and Chinese (yes I am being redundant) players amassing in North American servers cause severe lag and rubber banding. If the devs would proactively work on getting rid of the hackers and limit people in their global regions to the servers setup for their specific geographic location to get rid of the plague on North American servers it would be a fantastic game. If you are going to play you will at least need a CPU with a minimum clock speed of at least 3.5 GHz (AMD Ryzen CPU's work great although I do have a friend who plays the game successfully using a AMD Phenom CPU) and a good mid range graphics card (minimum of GTX 1060 or AMD RX 480) if you want to play on anything but potato settings and get frame rates above 60 FPS. I can't and won't recommend the game until the aforementioned issues are addressed and taken care of!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-04,0,0,119,True,Not Recommended,"This game is seriously a mixed bag. Sometimes it's really fun and other times the most frustrating piece of crap out there. When it works fine it's fun and enjoyable to play. However the times the game runs well is very rare. Almost every game I play there is massive server lag. While driving my friends and I will hit invisible walls get shot through walls and supply box crates and have even been killed a couple times by people driving cars through entire buildings. All of these issues have been around since the start of the game and none of the devs have done ANYTHING to try and fix their terrible servers. Because of these reasons alone I cannot recommend the game to anyone. Pros Really well crafted ""king of the hill"" gameplay mechanics High skill cap that rewards good players for playing well High strategic requirements forcing you to think on your feetCons VERY poor optimization (I have a 1070 and 1700x with low settings except for view distance and only get a max of 90fps with many frame drops and only utilization of 3 of my 8 cores/ 16 threads) Terrible server quality Main menu doesn't even work properly (have to refresh page to ready up every time a teammate joins) Numerous glitches I understand this game is te ally early access but the devs have hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal and they seem to be focusing more on adding a new map instead of improving performance with optimizations and better servers.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is a fun game and an ever changing experience but there are serious issues with performance and cheating. 1.0 just came out and it now feels worse then it was when it was in early access. Major rubber banding doors won't open plane randomly ejects you and cheating is still a problem.

2017-12-02,0,0,1507,True,Recommended,You'll hear complaints about desync lag or poor netcode. But the positives outweigh the negatives. This is early access after all. PUBG is unique. Even after five hundred hours and thousands of matches I still get an adrenaline rush in top ten situations. Every match is different and has memorable events.

I have also gotten 4 people so far to start playing as well and only 1 guy had issues because doesnt have a computer strong enough to support it. All of these claims of crashing every hour and being unplayable and lagging probably dont have decent computers either.

2017-06-02,0,0,280,True,Recommended,If you have a decent computer that is just over minimum specs but still want to lag want to hear white kids say the N word more time than you can count run for 20 minutes to avoid the circle just to be shot by a camper because you lagged and your shots didn't count or want to develop high blood pressure? Then this game is for you!I have never enjoyed or hated a game more in my life. PUBG is a fantastic game at its core and the DEVs have done an amazing job updating the game. There are high promises that I look forward to them fulfilling hopefully. I have slightly over 150 hours into the game and feel at this point I can provide an honest review.Pros Community. I know what I said earlier but it s true. I have never played a game where three random people fight so hard and communicate toward a common goal. Yes you will have dumb children screaming in your ear as your plane loads (it will hurt). But overall I have yet to have a team that didn t try to help for a win.Gameplay. It s what you make of it. If you want to play slow and methodical as you slowly loot buildings and scraps left behind you can. Or run and gun the second you have a pistol and build your arsenal from the corpses of your enemies. It s up to you. Obviously one is harder than the other but both are equally satisfying.Matches. For the most part I have yet to wait more than a minute or two for a lobby to load and have us all loaded into that sardine can of a plane.Weapons/Balance. At the moment the guns feel different enough to warrant actually picking. Shotguns for once in a video game are useful and frankly amazing in the right circumstances. Tweaking is being done for balance and accuracy which is to be excepted of an early access. Cons Connection/Performance. My specs are an i5 8GB RAM and 2GB video card with a 100MBps internet connection. I know get a better PC . But bare minimums exist for a reason and I will be the first to tell you the listed specs aren t accurate. Prepare to be shot after peaking behind a while due to desync issues and for the lower end computers to freeze or stutter as you enter through a building. Matches. Some games can last upwards of 35+ minutes so be prepared to invest into a game. For any older gamers with kids this is not something you can pick up quickly for a match or two and jump off. Due to the circle in the game without a vehicle it will become a running simulator. There is nothing more frustrating than fighting the circle and be shot by someone camping a window.For anyone who is running lower end PCs I recommend you wait a little longer for them to optimize the game. Otherwise it s a definite purchase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-16,0,0,277,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS a fun and a laggy way to entertain playersI was sceptical if this game would make some popularity at all because many other games had battle royale modes. Turned out I was very very wrong. And I also understood why because of it's simpicity (perhaps) in game mode style. You loot find some weapons and go kill everyone till the very last one. Gamemode itself is pleasant enjoyable. I like the idea of 100 people dropped from a plane on an island to slaughter.But there is a very big downside to all of this......and it is the way how this game has been built. Currently as of 16/11/2017 this game is in Early Access probably not far away from full release with a new map and (weapons?). Devs do (maybe) try to fix the problems with this game. The biggest issue I can adress right now is it's performance. I have a PC setup with GTX970 4 gen i5 8GB of RAM. Somehow when I land near houses they still seem not loaded properly. Tried various fixes including setting the game to lowest possible but nothing would work. So while you are running around that house you want to loot quickly because an enemy landed nearby and is willing quickly to deal with you there is nothing I can possibly do. FPS is fine but not the *unloaded textures cmon. And that's how often I get killed in very first few moments. Probably the record has been 3 minutes of no housing. And also lately hackers seem to get into matches often. BattleEye? Meh. More? De syncs optimization probably coding also...not satisfying at all.Overall I can say that PUBG is an engaging experience to try out but to fully enjoy this game you need a strong PC setup. That does not deny the hackers though. I am giving currently a negative review on this game until devs improve the problems with performance and hackers. I am going to play it nevertheless because as I said the game is fun and giving some adrenalin. Hopefully in future I can change from negative to positive.... UPDATE 22.12.2017They bloody fixed the performance. No idea about the hackers tho. I can recommend this game cuz it will run on toasters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-22,0,0,86,False,Recommended,After playing 70 hours of PUBG I think it's safe to say that I have some skill in the game. I am no where near being above average in terms of skill but I enjoy it nonetheless. My only problem with the game is servers and the rubberbanding issues. In my opinion BlueHole should focus on improving the games server issues in order to provide a more enjoyable experience to the games players.Another issue that some people have with PUBG is the games optimization issues. Personally I don't have a proble here as I play on low settings to make targets easier to see at a distance. I can run the game on ultra settings with a high FPS bnut this is not my preference.I think that with the latest update BlueHole has bougfht some time in order to focus on these issuen. The gunplay and vehicle seem fine for now even though many people would disagree with that. There is no need for any new content as of yet.Also I feel that a skill based match making system may be in order.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-22,0,0,307,False,Recommended,With the game being officially released I feel confident recommending this game. There are plenty of ways to find out what this game is so I'm not going to bother reviewing it in depth. The important points for me are as follows 1) The game is much better optimized now. For reference I have a gtx 1050ti and can get 60+ fps most of the time. The loading area and plane are the exceptions still but this doesn't affect gameplay.2) The new map is great.3) The replay system allows you to watch whole matches from other peoples pov so you can learn how to get better.4) It's still fun after 100 hours and I plan on playing much more. Whether with friends random people or on your own this game caters to everyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's still a little buggy in some places physics for example but it's probably going to be ironed out soon and not game breaking (and is actually hilarious at times). It also has a pretty fair price for being a multiplayer only game.I shrug off the occassional cheaters once in a while because getting rid of cheaters 100% is impossible anyway and because of how quickly you can get back into the action anyway.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,583,False,Not Recommended,I've played some hours in this game and still do but I'll give my honest opinion to NOT BUY it in it's current state (1.0)Over the past few months before the vaulting I experienced that they where optimizing the game less lagg cheaters getting quick bans etc. The new map gave me more gameplay problems than previous updates fixed. Rubber banding is hot atm. Orginal map gives a ton of rubber banding that it didn't had before (to high setting to detect cheaters?) FPS drops at more places than before.I'm not running the game on a potato PC. If I can run ARK SURVAVAL EVOLVED on Ultimate settings with 60 fps than this game with medium to low setting should do just fine. But since the launch update not anymore.So keep it in your wishlist but don't buy it for the 30 euro/dollar they're asking now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,43,False,Recommended,I have had this game for some time and as much fun as it is to play it has just as many technical issues. Rubber Band Man the song by T.I. written in 2003 was dedicated to Brendan Greenes' future creation of PUBG. The game is extremely buggy even with its 1.0 release and reminds me of what you would get when you try to combine a tactical shooter like Ghost Recon Wildlands with a Bethesda standard buggy unfixed open world game. Although i believe Kotaku Official review of this game describe exactly how I feel about it the most it is a perfect disaster of a game. For some reason despite all of the bugs the appeal of the gameplay completely revolves around its Battle Royale/Tactical Shooter game type. Other developers out there....Cough.....Cough.....Ubisoft.....Could take a game like Ghost Recon Wildlands create their own Battle Royale mode and easily make a game that is more polished. For 30 bucks this game isn't so bad unless you are playing on Xbox One at the moment. Definitely will put out a buyer beware notice to those that are more picky than I about the current state of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The feeling when you win the firefight against all odds. When you get the win your heart is racing that final zone is intense your hands shake you can taste the victory.

It's a good game a popular game but even with all that has major issues that make it unplayable like rubberbanding registration issues clunky mechanics and graphical optimization issues. With that in mind I thought all of this could be bypassed and still enjoy the game but I (personally) didn't it's just not my cup of tea. So if you came here and read this ask these questions before buying this do I have a good gaming enviroment that overcomes the technicall issues that the game has at it's current state? and do i have the patience to run for huge amounts of time with the uncertanty that I might kill or get killed? if so buy it if don't get other game for the same pricePS.

2017-07-27,0,0,312,True,Not Recommended,They are now adding microtransactions. They promised from the very beginning they would not add them until the game was done. Looks like another H1Z1.So far a great game. They do need to change the system requirements. The game is not optimized right now. There will be issues since it is in alpha. I would recommend a gtx 1050 and at least an i5 processor. Even with a gtx 1070 and an i7 6700k I only peak at 120fps. I mainly stay around 70 to 80 fps. They should work on fixing these small issues before adding more crates. I just hope this does not turn into H1Z1. If you have a computer that does not have some of the best hardware out to date right now dont even bother buying this game. The fps is getting worse by the patch. This is another Daybreak company at this point of time. If they do not start to focus on the FPS side of this game the game will start to fail. Who wants to play a $30 with a ton of FPS drop. This might be an alpha game but if they contunie to microtransation then they have no excuss to push updates every other day to help improve the state of the game. They have the income to do whatever they want with this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Most people (usually h1z1 fanboys) like to point these things out and I could sit here and tell you everything that is wrong with h1z1 but I rather talk about this game. This game is amazing it's one of the few games out there that you can play by yourself and still have fun. Playing this game with a bunch of mates who arn't actually looking for a reason to hate it is amazing. The friends I play with most frequently do not have this game and it is a shame but ive met so many people through playing this game solo so it doesn't even really matter. You have the option to solo que by yourself into a squad game which is fun but also randomly queing with people who you dont know but share the same love of the game that you do is amazing. Despite the ""China number one and you mother"" pregame lobby this game is not full of toxic players (10/10 for the community alone) the that this game isnt makes the game every thing it is. The amount of intense gunfights and funny moments makes this game one of the best games out there right now. This game doesnt even have skins! WHAT'S THAT?!?!?

So you regularly face cheaters with less ping/rubberbanding and when you do end up getting good loot and murking some fools your kill cam will show you clearly behind cover while your killer shoots to your side and gets a headshot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-02,0,0,332,True,Recommended,"Tons of fun. However there are quite a few things you can do in the game that aren't readily apparent. Be sure to look at the controles and look up some tips online about how to play. That said there are still quite a few bugs in the game. Have gotten stuck inside a door and could not open it again to get out. Exited a car next to a barrier and it put me in mid air between the car and barrier and would not let me move. It eventually killed me by ""falling"". I'm looking forward to a first person only mode.Edit 9/27/17 Most of the bugs and glitches are now fixed. The game still has some performance issues but it has come a long way from where it once was. I'm still really enjoying the game. The new foggy weather mode is great as are the new weapons that keep being added to the game. The developer keeps making the game more stable and adding new and welcome features. I love first person mode and look forward to the new maps being released.Other reviewers have mentioned being banned for stream sniping. I personally have not experienced any of these bans. The chat on the plane and in the pre game hub area is as toxic as ever. I do my best to try to start friendly conversations by saying hi and wishing others well but that is usually met by someone saying ""shut the F*** up"" or someone shouting racial slers over and over again. I'd like the option to be able to open a menu to see who's talking and just mute that person.

Every game is different which makes it all the more interesting and satisfying when I make No. 1. Do be warned that luck plays a part of the game. Sometimes it is just isn't on your side and you end your round soon enough. No doubt the game has glitches and issues here and there server is unstable from time to time it requires more optimization for lower spec hardware but I'm hoping that the Devs will fix it as the time come goes on.Follow Feb 23rd 2018Too much cheaters ruining the game experience.

2017-09-29,0,0,319,True,Not Recommended,To start off I know this game is in early access and I aware that most of my complaints against this game will be resloved(or I hope they will be) I have been playing since April or so and I have seen some awesome improvments on the games quality and balance. Right around the start of the Gamescom tournament this game was running very well when I pressed F to open a door or get into a car it was as smooth as butter with an FPS of 50 60. I was excited to see such a great improvment to a game I thourghly love and the smoothness made it very enjoyable. This also showed me the devs commitment to improving the game for the better. With that said this last week or two the game has been a nightmare. The server lag is disgusting for a game that just reported a net worth of 4 BILLION dollars. My frame rate is still decent so I know the optimization if we can call that has not changed much so it has to be a server issue. It seems like the game has regressed to what it was when it was first released which is insane considering how much money bulehole or as others say buleballs is bringing in. That is my back story If you want this game get it its fun but it is not worth 30bucks its worth 5 10 bucks tops in its current state. The loot drops are terrible you can clear a large building at the start of the game looking for something as simple as a pistol and not find one. Grinding for BP points is crap and the item box rate of dropping anything worth vaule is also crap. Playing since near the beginning and still have not recieved gloves or a coat. 200 + hours into a game should be worth something more than pretty lame aperal. My game defaults to the AS server I am in NA so that is super annoying and can't be that hard to fix. This review is to remind the devs that they have a responsibility to their consumers to make progress on their game and not to back peddle once they have made mass profits off of a tournament and purchased crate systems. I know most of that money went to charity but I also know you guys are not going home hungry. Improving server lag would be enough to get you guys a thumbs up but I still think the balance in the game is atrocious at best when it comes to wepon drops and vehicle drops. I mean come on I am only asking that you at least improve the rate at which I can find a single wepon to defend my self at the start of a match. As a potential buyer of this game wait until either you can get it for free as a gift or until it hits steam sale.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-03,0,0,171,True,Not Recommended,I didn't want to give this game a bad review but THE CHEATING AND HACKING IS GAME BREAKING!!! It's so bad that it almost out weighs any good quality I can think of. I encounter cheaters/hackers at least 1 out of every 3 games. It might not seem that bad but when you spend 30 minutes playing a match have a decent chance at winning and there are 10 15 people left the last thing you want is to get domed by one shot to the head with a Kar98k from some dude sitting on a hill 3KM away the second you run out from behind a wall or hill.It's such an easy fix ban the cheating players from playing it. Forever. Make them buy a new account just like CS GO if they want to play again. Or something. All I know is I haven't encountered cheating in any other FPS like I have this one. Sorry Bluehole. Fix the cheating and I'll give it a good review.Also the general server connection is sub par. Net code sucks and latency can sometimes screw you. I'll run around a corner and then die my body lying where I was before I ran around the corner. Sometimes I'll pick up an item about 5 or 6 times before it goes in my inventory. It's noticeably worse when the game first starts but gets much better as it goes.In general it's fun and has a lot of potential. However the problems are still there. The cheating/hacking in particular is what made me give it a thumbs down.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game seems to run more poorly after each update I can only assume the coding is like your sisters closet and did I mention if you use a ingame feature and pass someone who is live streaming that you will get banned. I died in a game and my friend was looking to get killed honking a car horn died and then what do you know days later he can't play the game.TLDR Devs can't take criticism Devs censor anything they don't like with a ban Game runs more and more like dog br&gt If you aren't recording yourself 100% of the time playing the game your chances of getting banned are still the same but you can appeal it through a lingo of 3rd party sites Streamers essentially decide if you get banned or not Great start to a good game turned into a show.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There 2 main issue that need to be dealt with. 1st is that there are simply way too many Chinese playing in the NA server and it is annoying since most of them are not friendly and you simply can not communicate with them. Yes even they realized that I am a Chinese myself. Surprise! 2nd is there are a lot of hackers and apparently Blue Hole (who made this game) have not yet found any nice solution. Until they found a way to deal with this kind of outrageous behavior that runinning this game I will keep advising everyone not buying this game. Just save your money do not waste on this game like me.12/23 UpdateMore fun with the 1.0 coming out. Less hackers for sure. Still too many Chinese.

I tolerate now since I'll play with my friend who kindly bought this for me but with the lag glitchy bugs (one being I take damage for some reason when i parachute down) and repetitive gameplay it makes it hard to play. For example in the division's take on the gamemode they have things like thirst hunger cold etc. PUBG doesn't need to have those specific gameplay elements but it should be more than a running sometimes shooting sometimes driving and sometimes looting simulator.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-04,0,0,125,False,Recommended,This game is great it contains everything a battle royale game needs. You can decide to land in popular areas to fight to the death or just land in rural areas and get your loot safely. It also has two maps which are very different a europian map with alot of cover and vast areas. And then there is the desert map which is mostly mountainous and has hardly any trees this map is not a favourite but will do fine if your computers FPS is bad on the Russian map. I think that they should add map pick instead of going into the desert map continuously hoping you get the old map. The main downfalls of this game are FPS Issues and rubber banding which i dont really see that much on EU servers but can still be frustrating and finally hackers. As i have not experienced any yet i don't really have an issue but i have heard it is mostly Chinease players joining EU and US games. This can be revoked quite easily if they add REGION LOCKING.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-27,0,0,410,True,Not Recommended,"The concept is great. The gunplay is pretty good. The actual gameplay? Naaaah.The circle which you are supposed to reach does not take into account any variables at all like loot distribution plane path vehicle spawns or geography. This means that you all too often find yourself at the opposite side of the map without a vehicle or a gun having to run for miles just to get to the safe zone only to be absolutely overrun by people who got lucky and found everything they needed in the first building they entered in the middle of the zone.The random elements are far too many and far too distracting to call this game ""good"". It has redeeming qualities such as the fantastic gunplay with weapon attachments and handling but the core mechanics need a lot of polishing for this to be a game that people keep coming back to without feeling like they got screwed by no fault of their own.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

While some bugs havent been fixed and are still a problem people choose to ignore the issues that have been fixed. I feel like the PUBG fan base has a negative feel for the game now and nothing PUBG does can satisfy them. They always have somthing to complain about even if PUBG pulls out a great patch fixing many issuses there are allways people screaming in the comments about somthing that hasent been fixed. PUBG wasnt the best on launch but recently they have really been improving it and the game is moving in the right direction. All in all PUBG is a great game and while there are issues they are being fixed and the game is in a much better state than it was at launch and continues to get better with every patch.

2017-03-23,0,0,184,True,Recommended,So a bunch of my friends bought this game because we really like playing H1Z1 King of the Kill but we realied tht game was glitchy. My other friend showed us the trailer to this game and it looked really fun so we bought it. When i got in I wasn't expecting much but I had a lot of fun although the game is not prefect.Pros 1. The gameplay and the controls are pretty good. 2. The map is a lot bigger than KotK 3. The weapon costumization is really fun and it really feels like a challenge to get things without dying 4. Guns do not feel like peashooters 5. SpectatingCons 1. The game has a lot of glitches although I get it that it is an early access game that just came out 2. Things like backpacks can be really hard to find but I assume that the game is supposed to be like that 3. The price is a little expensive Other than those two cons the game is really good. It is a better alternative for KotK.Although I would not buy this game though if you do not have friends to play it with. Another thing i would buy this if it was on sale and not at full price because $30 is a lot. That is really all I have to say on the game. I rate 7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-23,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,Issue #1 Load/Render time. Buildings don't render even though my computer meets the max requirements and I run on Very low graphics.Why is this a problem? The very beginning of the game is a trying moment when you're un equipped. Often I must stand outside the buildings I land at for 2 minutes before they render. Giving people time to get weapons and shoot me and the barrier to close in on me. It also makes aiming jumpping because of lag.Issue #2 Fault default server. I want to automatically match with americans because I'm america. Why am I matching with asians by default?Why is this a problem? Because I speak English. Because it lags more when the server is meant to be across the world.Issue #3 I can't cancel a match make.Why is this a problem? Mostly because of Issue #2. Because I manually have to change the server EVERY GAME I often forget and can't change that if I press 'play' and then remember.Issue #4 Lots of items 0 customization. I guess this is more of a suggestion.. Make more of the cosmetics free. Or make it where you can buy them with in game currency without random selection.Why is this a problem? I like customization. I like having achievements and reasons to continue playing outside of (&amp as well as) gameplay. I hate random number games. I hate grindy games. I hate that I've opened 6 crates and got stuff I will NEVER use because the default clothes are better. and I hate that I went with a default look just so I can immerse myself in game play and then find out I have to pay to change it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-08,0,0,579,False,Recommended,300+ hours played since release gone through the numerous updates. I'll UPDATE THE REVIEW AS THE GAME UPDATES JUST SCROLL DOWN As I edit this 1.0 DROPPED finally &amp boy has the game taken a much much better turn for the better. The new map is wide open big and in a desert yet you almost never have to worry about not not being in the zone as the map is filled with a great amount of vehicles and the new additions are nice. It is done really well and i'm glad to have had so much enjoyment playing the game in the last two days since the offical release. Now as early as I am editing this the game still suffers from early game dsync when you first land in the desert map it's not unplayable but noticeable when you try to open a door and it won't and such but goes away fairly quickly. In addition to the new map we get 4 new guns 2 on the original map and 3 on the desert map (i believe sorry if i am wrong). The car physics/mechanics got a change and it makes driving feel much more smoother and comfortable to the player. The game got a good amount of optimization and it runs really well but still not as good as it could given my RX980 i'm still running the game at about 70 80 on very low to low. The gun play feels a lot smoother &amp crisp I have so far no complaints on how the guns feel and / or shoot. I think the new scopes are a great addition and removing the 8x on the m16 was a smart move.The new UI is cleaner but is kinda weird to get used too and for the leaderboard it appears to not give you all the options to check your stats if you wanna see DUO FPP you can only see duo TPP unless you are searching for duo fpp then i believe it gives you the option to look at it? It is kinda weird at times.In the time that i have played the devs seemed to have tried to tackle the boring quiet mid game phase and it works out unless you are a being a mouse and off alone trying to avoid everything. The blue zone damage got a buff and i would say it's almost perfect almost some slight tweaking but the way they have adjusted makes you almost not wanna be in the blue because of how quick it can dwindle your life.If I missed anything I will be sure to update the review. As of right now on 12/22/2017 The game is very playable comfortably and very enjoyable especially with friends. The optimization is what it needed and got. Still there are a lot of bugs I have run into especially when doing squads having to reboot the game or lobby for unknown reasons just to be able to play another round which doesn't take long but is a minor inconvience. At the current state I can proudly say I can turn this game from a not recommended to a recommended game but it is still not out of the wordworks as it has a long road ahead of it and still needs a lot of work and polishing but the game is headed in the right direction as of right now. I feel confident to say you can put your money into this game and within a couple of hours have some enjoyable moments if playing with friends. I still would maybe tell someone to wait on a possible sale but being how fresh and popular this game is that would be a while but I highly recommend this game if you have a friend or three and like battle royale games to pick it up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR The circle and big city map design encourages people to fight like a Call of Duty and over half the server is dead within the first 2 minutes of these 30 minute matches further making the already boring mid game worse.I've won 4 games (two on both maps) and I regularly get at least one kill per match so don't get me wrong the game is fun but needs to be improved way more. Current game meta ruins the game and it is completely influenced by the two biggest features in the game the circle and overall map design. Pay attention to the player count in your next few solos ever notice how half the server will die before the first circle closes in (or before it even starts to close in)?The circle hasn't changed since it was released in Early Access and even then people complained about how boring the mid game was. The issue is that the game had so many more problems back then and now when the developers officially smoothed out optimization and vaulting people just completely forgot about gameplay inconsistencies. Since people just accept the circle as it is everyone drops into major cities fooling themselves with that ""High Risk High Reward"" nonsense and instead are going to those cities actually wanting a intense gunfight. Fighting like it's a Call of Duty or Battlefield game players literally can't stay alive longer than 2 minutes ruining the experience for those who want to play the game as intended as a survival experience. The game is advertised as a 100 player free for all but in reality you're lucky to have 50 players by the time you grabbed enough equipment to really have the game begin. With this low player count you'll have trouble finding people until the 3rd circle closes thats 17 minutes of boring looting. Also the only people alive after these 17 minutes are the sweaty try hards that mastered the bullet drop for all the guns so don't fight anyone at a distance or they'll quick peek headshot you while you are shooting tens of bullets at them.And that brings me to the other point the map(s). I have no problem with down time I played over 2000 hours of Fallout New Vegas on hardcore(No Fast Travel) before I finally built a PC I can handle a little walking simulation. But when the maps are designed as they are it further amplifies the problem the circle is giving the gameplay. Loot spawns in more tightly packed areas of course are going to provide more incentive to go to larger cities (creating the whole ""High Risk High Reward"" philosophy). However since half the server plays the game as a parachuting simulator rather than a Battle Royale survival game the maps grow empty fast. Whenever I drop into a smaller town to avoid being mowed down by a Shroud Prodigy too much of the game is me running between towns searching for loot I get too used to not finding players that I don't expect to be shot which is the complete opposite of what this game should be. And when I do drop into a populated area the store bought asset buildings still have the problem of having one route through the house meaning that people camp in the houses and hold the only corner like its Counter Strike. At least in CS there are multiple routes and better utility to level the playing field but here we have players choosing to wait multiple minutes so they can play a easy game of wack a mole rather than having a shoot out. The maps could be made to encourage more player diversity early game lettting more players survive throughout the match.""Winning doesn't entertain me Killing does"" Shroud 2017After watching the interview podcast H3H3 had with PlayerUnknown I doubt this will be solved. Sure he talked about changing the circle to where players have a chance to catch up to the white circle when it spawns too far away from them. Unfortunately he talked about the ability to camp out the game like its a revolutionary feature that I don't think he will change the game for the better. I feel like he won't improve the mid game to blend together the chaotic early game with the strategic end game. mid game (which is the vast majority of every match) will continue to be a boring walking simulator where you sometimes feel like the only person on the server.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,120,True,Recommended,This game is utterly broken in its current state. You can tell when you're near someone because your connection will start lagging to Due to this nearly every encounter I've had has led to my anger and death. For instance someone walks into a room I'm guarding. I blast them with a shotgun at point blank range they teleport to the other side of the room rotate like they're on a pivot and aggressively aim at me before I die having never lost any health only to hear the bullet sound effect AFTER I die.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,325,True,Recommended,While this game is still in Early Access I would like to review this. Basically the game is fun but has some flaws that the Devs have acknowledged.The Devs have set up a schedule though to fix it. Unfortunately though one of the main problems I have are my teammates. Basically they are trash and I can only reliably win in solo and DUO. Please allow me to have better teammates. But other than that the game is fun! I would love to see more weapon types and some balance changes to sub machine guns. Scopes can be really hit or miss in main weapon spawn areas but other than that shotguns are fun submachine guns have their place and assault rifles and snipers are good up until the last circle. Killing people is also really satisfying but keep up the updates and I ll continue to play just maybe with better people now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,20,True,Recommended,I haven't played H1Z1 but from what I've seen through hours of research is that its a fun game but the devs do not care. This is a good alternative for H1Z1 because its very similar but the devs actually care enough to fix game breaking bugs that people exploit. Its highly addictive to play but there are some cons to this gameCons Houses sometimes don't fully load and its impossible to get inside for the loot. Sometimes while loading you get put on the planeand you dont load until you're ejected off the plane. Laggy at timesPros In depth gun stats Decent graphics Great map Devs fix game breaking bugs (like the one where people would hide in buggy rocks and other terrain) Intense atmosphereTL DRGreat game needs more developement but its really fun to play alone or with friends.

2018-03-03,0,0,1278,False,Not Recommended,Rating 3/10Of course this is an actual review so please understand the rating is a personal opinion and I will explain the reasoning behind the low rating as well as rating from 0 10.Initially as of right now I'm currently on 901 hours in game I had left a great review when I had first bought the game and reached my 100th hour. However after a short amount of time and a minor upgrade (From I5 to AMD with increase of RAM and CPU) I started running into a few issues which seem to never get patched.First lets start with the common bug AMD Processors If you're running an AMD you probably know what issue i'm talking about Yes the requiring to ALWAYS change your affinity during game or upon launch up this has been a known issue for me personally about 4 months now however i've heard others have had this issue for longer only person I know personally who has this issue was my older brother whom I game with Of course my older brother has the better computer as he upgrades as often as possible. However even he consistently crashed day after day after day of attempting to play PUBG because of the affinity bug until finding out about the supposed fix to the problem.Second The Fix PUBG button wow did they really put a fake FIX button? I'd personally love to send Bluefoal all the issues with the game however they seem to run away everytime we have a complaint about the game and why of all things name it FIX PUBG but then have it link us to a website with them 'stating' what they'll do to fix pubg when clearly on the website it has nothing we're looking for to be fixed on the list.Faster &amp Smarter match making Bluefoal are you ing stupid? We wanted region lock cause you allow players with excessively high ping to play in a country they don't live in then we either have to deal with the fact we got shot from an invisible player teleporting around or a language not native to NA.Third Event mode TPP optimization 3 times I went into event mode forced as TPP with my friend I encountered this bug If you swap to FPP while on the ground and end up dying FPP you'll respawn in FPP and be unable to move your character until swapping back to TPP or dropping on the ground.Fourth Anti cheat now this is where the jokes really begin idk how many times i've seen cheaters but man let me tell you this will never stop as of today there was a new cheat going around where players are allowed to swap from FPP to TPP during a FPP Squad match. Previously my teamate today was using it I confirmed it by watching him camera peek players while on a FPP server after reporting I went for a new match me and my squad made it to last 5 where suddenly the last player was tilt peeking and instantly sniping everyone in my team I made sure to test the player and see if he was TPP cheating I pretended to poke out but only tilted enough to have my full body behind the wall however when i had tilted without actually peeking out he started to spray directly at me each time i attempted to peek he shot directly at my head (aware it was my head because whenever i rotated to the opposite side there were bullet holes all in the same spot never straying from where i was standing).After dying to him and spectating him I noticed he was on TPP as well.Personally if you have friends to play this game with it's fun lots of action and very extensive mechanics to allow many types of playstyles however if you're a solo player or play games often alone paying for this game will only make you regret wasting your money as the community is extremely toxic and null of common sense when working as a team (You'll find players reeeeeeing in voice chat or players who are in discord unwilling to work with the rest of the squad)I enjoy playing this game however as of late this game has just been getting worse and worse and likewise with the community as I've seen more hackers and more players who aren't capable of speaking english or just start talking to teamates then kill them.As for the reasoning behind 3/10I gave it 1 point for mechanics 1 point for realism and 1 point for content as for the rest of the points this game misses is Community 1 Bluehole's lack of affection for their community 1 Server lag 1 No region lock/Max acceptable ping 1 Long term bugs not being patched 1 Adding content and creating more bugs instead of resolving previous bugs 2.As I said before I initially gave this game a better review as I was on I5 and didn't care so much for in game bugs however after switching to an amd and constantly having to deal with the Affinity bug finding more bugs during my games or hackers makes it all the more stressful to even bother with this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-19,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,I changed this Review to positive after seeing satisfying performance improvement.But I change it back to Negative because Menu suddently decided not to load.After finishing a match I got back to menu and I can see the car area with blurry background and no menu buttons waitted some time no results. Restarted game same result. Such things are unacceptable for a 2018 game and I withdraw my positive review. The Main Menu lags more than in game. Just pathetic.I was playing this game on one of my friend's account a few months ago. I had so much fun back then. Now that I bought it myself it changed so much and for some reason I can't have the same experience. Although the performance is much better so I slowly start to enjoy the game as much as I did back then.The gameplay is so much fun the guns are fun to use and all I like those aspects. Now it somehow can't be so much fun anymore. IDK maybe I lost my skill and I just suck xd.A thing about music the most recent music is so obviously a rip off of the Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare Main Theme... and the previous one was also an obvious rip off of Battlefield 1 Main Theme... please be original with music a good memorable and ORIGINAL theme is key on making a game feel epic when you launch it. Although the BF1 like one is just fine.Finally i hate loot boxes culture so bad it just makes me see a game less seriously when I see it. It also gives me the impression that the game thinks I am stupid that I will spent money on cosmetics on some pixels...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,182,True,Recommended,Before purchasing this game I used to think it was a bad game that had no potential and would die out very soon. However from the consistent asking of my friends to buy it I decided to purchase a copy. Due to my poor experience with that piece of H1Z1 I expected nothing much and intended to refund the game after an hour. Within the first hour I was hooked. I wanted to write a review then but I didn't feel like I had enough experience. I can safely say now though this game is worth the money. It's a fun game with friends and competitive at the same time. The game looks beautiful and the community is growing. However these come with issues. The amazing graphics puts a lot of people at a disadvantage. Most people can't purchase a PC powerful enough to play this game. I run it with everything set to max and get an avg of around 100 fps but that's me. I own a very powerful computer. I've got a friend with a high end PC at around 800 who struggles to run this game on medium with some settings on low. Although there are a lot of problems with this game It's only in early access and I can't blame it for being bad. If the game hasn't improved the issues in it by this time next year it will only be another DayZ. Otherwise this game has some serious potential. Highly reccommend as long as your PC is powerful!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is a good map which has way more variaity in landscapes and tactics than Erangel. If you want to play a dull boring shooter in which you play basically on one small map play CS GO.

2017-11-26,0,0,1024,True,Recommended,Eventually GOTY at this point in time. It hasn't been announced yet but almost for sure it will be.That being said let's really talk about the game. Fun unique in its own way huge map and lots and lots of different locations to be fighting against other people.I can also say that the game feels slow buggy and from to to time boring and to me it doesn't matter if it is an Early Access or not besides its a nomenee for GOTY so it should be looked at as a released game (not finished) which makes it a buggy mess and still not safe from the hacking community.What we need to be looking for is the effort that they are making to make this game as the view they had for it at the start and we can really see them pushing harder and harder to put new content out there. Props to them for that.Hopefully we will have modded content in the near future and hopefully they will fix the game in time.For now I can still recommend this game to anyone that likes BR games or wants to try it.I'd give it a 7/10 for now depending on their approach to it in the next couple months.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's free the crates can be unlocked simply by playing and earning points. Haven't run into hackers yet. Servers need some work (There is no OC server at the moment so bug the devs about it) Even though I have to play on AS servers at the moment the ping is barely noticeable. No standing around for a minute before the game starts maybe 30 seconds to find a game. You can snowboard zip line and hang glide. The whole game has a kind of realistic and interesting implied story. The weapons system is intuitive with most attachments being automatically managed if you ever swap a weapon of the same class the attachments will automatically be removed and placed on the new weapon. The game has hitmarkers and more visible rounds giving it a bias toward action there is still stealthy elements to the game but even though there is less people in each server I get into more fights. The game is god damned beautiful and doesn't have color puke graphics so you can actully see players.GO AND PLAY RING OF ELYSIUM!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,1883,False,Recommended,Edit as of 9/23/2018. Game is great now. Developers have finally picked up the ing ball and have made some great changes. New vehicles new weapons new map with another coming soon some great quality of life changes. Amazing FPS with a 7700k/1080 on video settings geared for FPS over quality (without losing sharpness or resolution though) I generally stay above 170 FPS at 1440p. Hackers are always a thing but its just about 1/20 games to see a hacker that I'm fully confident is hacking either by blatant ESP or aimbot. Hacking is largely overblown. Region lock is soon to added into the game and map selection is coming back which will both be absolutely amazing. Buy it and don't listen to the naysayers the competition to PUBG sucks. Blackout sucks BF5 ain't out yet but will likely be just as arcadely ROE is unoptimized with smaller games and too arcadey ION is dead and Fortnite is a good game but just appeals to a wildly different audience. PUBG is the best on the realism best on the tension best on the graphics (until BF5 comes out) and best on the gunplay. Cannot beat it and I know I will probably be playing it for the next two years. Edit as of 11/24/2017. I win roughly about 30% of my games and have 4+KDR. Hacking is an overblown issue. Especially in the later hours. In the morning times though expect 1/5 games to have a hacker in it. Probably worse in non FPP servers. What is a issue though is the horrible tickrate and the foreigners flooding NA servers to an absurd degree. The developers could add a region lock dependant on who the party leader is. This would fix horrible issues of landing lethal shots but then dying .5 seconds after. Dying once your in cover. Dying immediately before you client even receives info that you've been shot. This singular aspect of the game is beginning to eclipse all of the pros. Before on game launch it was fantastic. Its been going downhill and because the developers haven't implemented this single easy fix to these problems and it has made me lose absolutely all respect for them. I would guess 50% of players on NA servers are Asian. Worse in the morning. Better in the evening. Its mostly unplayable unless you play in the later hours. Such an easy fix and they just won't implement it. If you are thinking about buying this just look at the discussions from 8am 2pm EST. It will give you a highlight what to experience on NA servers. Edit as of 8/25/2017. The game has been out for 5 months. Within the first month of ownership Bluehole (The developers) managed to do what Bohemia took years to do with Arma 3. Within the major cities of the game due to the amount of objects players were experiencing low FPS (30s 40s. Within the first monthly patch that FPS went from low 40s for me to 90 120 FPS. This was a major thumbs up in my opinion. In the five month period we have seen one new vehicle introduced and one variation of that vehicle. There has been several gameplay changes but nothing so huge as to change the core gameplay. There has been four new weapons introduced. Vaulting is on the horizon which will change the meta largely as well. Most importantly First Person Only servers have been introduced. I cannot talk this one up enough as it makes the game much more intense and thrilling having to risk yourself to gather intel. This servers are just as if not more populated than the third person ones. Hard to say since queuing into either one is instant. There has also been paid crates introduced. The developers broke their promise on this because they stated they would not introduce such things during EA. Principally this is wrong. However I do not care and still enjoy the game to the same amount as before. More even to tell the truth. Every round played rewards the player with x BP points depending on how well they did. The released three crates one of which required a key to open. You could then purchase the crates with the BP (that can not be gotten any other way besides playing). Some people decided to open crates both free and paid. I sold them instead on the Steam Market. I have made over $40 selling crates on Steam Market. I also opened 3 crates. Out of the three I got a shirt that was worth $5 some trash item and a jacket that is currently selling for $17. With those items as well I have made over $60. That is double the price of the game for items that do nothing for you in the game and many of which you will find on dead people or in buildins. So while I think crates is principally wrong I don't care. I love them even. I recommend the game ever more than before. Thankfully as well when I bought it the player base was at 30k. It peaked yesterday at 715k. That is absurd growth and I'm wondering when it will peak. Here is my market historyhttps //imgur.com/a/paQtGOld review posted 3/23/2017Very polished concept as compared to H1Z1 Battle Royale mod and other competitors. I would easily say this is the best. I'm writing this review on launch day. So far during this launch I can say these facts and I have never been able to say them before During the entire duration of gameplay (roughly4 5 hours) neither I nor did either of my two friends I was playing with experience a game crash or any bug whatsoever. The game ran smooth for all of us I generally got 80 90 fps on all ultra 1440p with a 6700 at 4.6ghz and a 1080. Game looks decent nothing exceptional but nothing inhibiting. Gunplay is really where it shines though. Gun handling is fantastic guns feel like they have weight and impact. Accurate amount of recoil and definitely rewards well placed shots. Initially I was concerned about third person as I am primarily a First person only player in such games as I hate people just sitting behind walls or explotive things in Arma 3. There isn't any first person in this but the camera does a well enough job that it prevents explotation. Not perfectly mind you its just close enough that people cannot pan it over a 12 foot wall or peek through buildings (like in Arma). If they had a bit more variety in terms of weapons and clothing then I would say they should have just launched the game outright instead of bothering with EA nonsensse. As a sidenote thankfully there isn't any ridiculous looking COD yellow tiger stripe nonsense that I was seeing in H1Z1 streams.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-24,0,0,537,False,Recommended,Hi So let's write a review about this game.It's a fun game. Easy to understand how to play. You should definitely play it with your friends and if not there are plenty of Discord servers where people are looking for a person to team up with.Compatibility My PC has no trouble running it I have a R5 1600x 16gb ddr4 installed on an ssd and run with a GTX 680 (cost me about 80 ). You really don't need a newer card the older ones work as good as the new. If you can get a GTX 780 or higher. (Please look up any GPU for example GTX1050 GTX680 the 680 has better performance. Look up some information about graphic cards.The game itself runs smoothly if I may say so even beter than the early days in which early access was released. In the early days there weren't even Test servers (so that's really a good feature).I love the maps they're different and soon they'll make the mapchoice 50/50. I presume they'll add more maps in the future with more items. The lead developer said that the game will be updated frequently with more features throughout its existence.I love the killcam in this game I hope they add some sort of camera rotation in the killcam.I love the ability to choose whether to go First Person or Third Person mode along with the squad or solo or duo option. Also selecting what region you want to play in is a sweet +.The few problems/issues right now as of 25/12/2017 Early game 1 2 minutes rubberbanding (an issue that is caused by probably too many players pressing F to pick up items early game the gameserver gets overflowed basically). High latency players (soon there will be a region lock so this issue will be resolved). Hackers as you all may know any game that has a high player count a fixed percentage is always going to be hackers. (Anti Cheat is doing its job pretty good even better than CSGO if you ask me.) Some physics vehicles tend to be a bit buggy if rammed into eachother also player characters that tend to bug from something invisible like a wall or a hole. (Sometimes this occurs when the GPU is not loading the textures properly).These aforementioned problems/issues will surely be fixed in time. As this game has just been released. Just like many other games release it needs time to settle and grow on.A big thumbs up from me. This is a game that has changed gaming if u ask me. It's a trendsetter and we should accept and acknowledge it's existence. Not many game developers listen to their players (I'm looking at EA Battlefront here). And to this day they're still listening you can check it on Reddit for example have a look on the official Reddit page of PUBG https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/So if you have read any negative reviews and now read mine try the game I can assure you it's fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bad connectivity to all servers infact I'm in South East Asia and playing in Asia or even NA server seems a tad bit better. But still not playable when you are rubberbanding around.3. Serious crashing it bugged out so bad that I had my whole screen turned black and graphics went bonkers even in windows!4. The game controls feels sluggish after playing Fortnite theres a good comparison on how a 3rd person view should be.This game has sucked tons of cash through it's early access...this shouldn't be the case but many people made a hype and paid them anyways nonetheless how did it get off its beta stage with such bad quality graphics and unoptimized servers and graphics????,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Someone is going to be better than you but as soon as you grind and keep getting comfortable with the game you will grow to love this game. (2) You will not get bored of this game. People say this game is only fun with friends. Although having friends can lead to a more fun experience having friends does not matter. about 40 hours of the game i've played (i have 50 at this time and plan to exceed that) are playing solo and I haven't found a dull moment yet. (3) Remember when you were a kid and you played minecraft? IF you have ever played the gamemode ""Survival Games"" on minecraft and enjoyed it this is very similar. (just better everything pretty much). (4) you like raging? In a solo game I survived the until there were only 2 players left. Me and someone else.

2017-11-03,0,0,794,False,Not Recommended,Since another patch. Game has now decided that it would like to tinker with things that are not broken rather then work on fixing things that matter.After some Patching. They have now balanced it where you get a good balance between the two maps. Hit box's continue to be a issue but until they come up with a system where they place you in server based on ping they will always have issues. Part 2 of the hit box issue is that it depends on client side what this means is that you might get shot all the while on your screen you are safe behind a tree or wall etc etc. So until they find a nice balance between these they will always struggle on this front. However with the ammount of cheaters I see daily I can no longer recommend this game. It is disgusting how blantant the cheats are and you have no clue if your report has even done anything. The reward is to survive and having cheaters take that away all the time makes it a pointless waste of time. Hacking is was and will continue to be a problem with this game. As they come out with anti cheat measures the cheaters in turn come up with new ones. Problem with cheating in this game the whole premise is to survive and in 1 swift second a hacker will ruin this for anyone that come into his path. We have come into servers with hackers taking bots around to farm the in game currency. They then go on to sell the items they farm and if they get banned they have made more then enough to just buy another copy wash rinse repeat. Some solutions to this would be having the bans go hardware rather then client as it would be more costly to replace computer parts. They could also make a server for cheaters and once guilty lock them in there and let them play with each other.Overall with the hours I have put in you can see that I enjoy the game it's addictive to chase the dinner but be warned if you have a temper move the expensive stuff away.Since Full Launch.I miss School!Full launch Review.They have taken strides in dealing with hackers but you at times still find the odd one.

It may be fun with friends but alone unless you're extremely competitive and take advantage of exploits and cheap tactics you'll not have fun. Connection is iffy hit reg is terrible (for various reasons). You could blast someone with a shotgun point blank and kill them then do the same to someone else several times and they will just look at you jump at you and punch you in the head and kill you instantly. Pretty dumb for a game that is supposed to be semi realistic.Though it's an early access game it feels so far from finished and polished considering the game is ""promised"" to be out in the next 3 months. This game infinitely lacks polish. Sound design is pretty terrible considering how important it is ""supposed"" to be. Compared to a game that also focuses on sound Rainbow Six Siege Battlegrounds falls flat. Sound clips sound so generic and sampled. Hopefully it improves but I'm staying away until full release.Also it crashes occasionally but not too bad.UPDATE FOR FULL RELEASE Just installed the game again to give it another go considering it is ""out"" now. Game still runs like butt stuff looks like crap on max settings (GTX 1080 R5 1600 16gb 3000mhz) and of course is full of BS moments. Wish i could've gotten my money back and not played for over the 2 hours mark hoping it would have gotten better.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

DO NOT BUY!!!(30 Jan 2018 10 56am)There are too many cheaters in this game it is not a game worth playing and definitely not buying.It's funny for the first couple of times you get to see cheaters they headshot you and your friends at rediculous positions run faster than cars etc... But after those ""couple of times"" it just becomes bland. Really bland. A here we go again kind of bland.You should come back and buy this game when those cheaters actually get banned and they stop getting top scores on the leader boards. Until then not worth buying or playing or doing anything with this game.I used to have a very positive review for this game which I will post below.(6 Nov 2017 4 42pm)Definitely worth buying.I agree that the lag is intense with this game and I also agree that the sound control is pretty terrible at the moment and you'd have to blow your ears out from airplanes vehicles and gunshots if you want to hear any enemy footsteps.So it probably doesn't suit people who care about their kill/death ratios.With that being said whether you play this game for victory or for laughter the amount of fun you can have with this game with a couple of friends is simply put amazing and nothing like before. Personally the purchase was worth every dollar.To sum things up if you have friends who already play this game already or if you have friends who are willing to purchase this game with you go on ahead as you and your friends will most likely not regret it. If you are a lone wolf type who wants to play competitively go and make some friends first and then you should come back and have a go at this awesome game.(19 Jun 2017 2 25pm)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One of the worst aspects of the game is that it contains loot boxes which contain useless cosmetic items so are of no interest to me.

The people in game are toxic and many are hackers too. Don't get this game unless you have a good gaming PC and a good nVIDIA graphics card that they want. I mean CSGO recommended a graphics card I didn't have but I still get 60 fps or over but this game isn't like that.Overall I would get it again if I get a better nVIDIA graphics card which is my B for not having one.

With new maps and weapons being added regularily this is a game that promises to be loved by everyone who enjoys first and third person shooters alike for years to come. My ony notable dislike/disagreement Is the date of the official release. I feel that the game needs at least another 6 months of testing and tweaking.

2017-08-12,0,0,138,True,Recommended,REAL REVIEWFun game i usually play it to past time between other games. Its a great way to keep things interesting. Now im no pro player by any means i dont play alot of shooters and i have yet to win a game but ive come oh so close at least 3 times. so with that said lemme give you what its like.FUN the game is fun to play by yourself but joining a twitch party or even playing with your friends further the entertainment and can provide some good laughs or just good times in general.COMPETITIVE Weather its the coins your after the bragging rights or that number one spot this game STAYS competitive. Well its obvious with 100 people on the map at once but you get the point.COMMUNITY Turn down your mics in the lobby cause kids screaming in your ears and loud people crowd the starting lobby. But somehow I've been blessed with nothing but chill decent teammates which most had mic's which helped and made things kinda fun. Also there is a HUGE following of this game now so hardly any wait times now.GROWTH With the future content thats in store as this game makes its way to xbox this game just looks more and more exciting with a new map and possible cross platform gaming incomming. This game looks and feels like it has a lot to offer in the future and will only get better with time.Now with the goods there are bads most people fail to realize that this is an EARLY ACCESS GAME which means all the bugs and unwanted crashes are gonna happen. But the only problems ive ever had with this game was server crowding one day and the wall glitch but I dropped out of that game in a heartbeat. But other than that i cant really complainOh and the issue with the in game cash shop not a problem. Clothes dont affect anything........But all in all for an early access game this is awesome!! Better than H1ZI love playing this game weather i have friends to play with or just solo'n up by myself.THIS IS ONE AWESOME GAME I RECOMMEND IT!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-14,0,0,333,True,Not Recommended,This game is a horrible mess and as the time of writing its getting worse and hacking has become a problem i would suspect there is at least one person using esp in every game now 1 % is pretty realistic. The core game is always going to suffer from desync and lag regardless of what they try and do anyone who knows this engine will understand that so either they rewrite the entire game or accept that they never knew it would be this succesful and now they have a huge mess on thier hands. The time to die is horrific spend 30 minutes carefully looting and hting just to get 2 tapped from some unseen enemy. Its massively unsatisfying but strangely addictive. Until they fix this time to die issue its just not worth playing. The game rewards camping and hiding not exploring and hunting which is wrong. Overall its one of the most frustrating games i have ever played and even with all teh hours i have put in i am hovering over the uninstall. Personally i would suggest saving youur money until they at least attempt to fix the game and stop focussing on releasing to xbbox and all the terrible marketing crap they are in to now. so sad to see money becoming the dominant driver in everything i think alot of people thought playerunknown would have more integrity,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Playing with in a duo or squad makes it even more fun (and easier to survive) especially when your giving tactics or screamming down the mike calling enermy positions. )However I do hope they add more to the game such as different maps more weapons and maybe even (as a thought) 50vs50 big team battles. That would be insane!!! p",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-14,0,0,31,True,Not Recommended,I debated with myself for a long time wether I was going to purchase PUBG and reluctantly I finally did. As much as I wanted to like this game I can't bring myself to do it no matter how many rounds I play. The feeling of this game is super sluggish clunky whatever you want to call it. I even bumped my graphics down from ultra ro high from high to medium and I get the same laggish feeling. I run a high end PC and still get regular fps drops after attempting every work around solution. The game is just poorly optimized.Man the pregame period where you're in an aircraft carrier waiting to deploy... never have I experienced something so toxic. Although the game may top H1Z1 the community does not pure mic spam and just plain ear After a couple times it got to the point where I just removed my damn headset until I deployed.I wish I could recommend this game but I can't bring myself to do it. At the stage it's currently in it's wiser just to save your money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-14,0,0,65,True,Recommended,"Simply put the best battle royale game out there right now. Unfortunately since so many games have abused the ""Early Acess"" tag. Everyone thinks this game is going to follow the standard all these other games have set. Which is either no to minimal patching and support. But let me tell you they have in no way been like that. They have been on target with everything they have been saying they are going to do. It will only get better and smoother from here. Do i think their minimum settings to run the game are low? DefinitelyI used to have a 2nd or 3rd gen I5 with a radeon R9 380. I was struggling to get 20 to 25 fps. Now that i just upggraded my motherboard and new i7 it runs much smoother with 40 50 fps but there is in no way an i3 can run this game. With the i5 i was getting massive stutters in gun fights or areas with lots of movement. The r9 380 isnt a terrible card either so it shouldnt be this tough to get 60fps. If you ran the minimum system requirements it would be unplayable. That is my only negative but i hope they aim to get that mimimum requirement playable as i have said it is in Early Access and they are still working on smoothing out the game. I just wish they would 100% focus on optimizing the game vs putting in new content. But i understand they have to keep their player base engaged by adding new stuff when they can.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The engine does its job but there are no systems implemented that really go very deep technically speaking. Given that and the facts it is in beta at the time of this review this game is absolutely thrilling. It is a blank page in which players create some of the best experiences availabe in gaming.

They definitely have to work on improving server performance and gameplay but their number 1 priority should be combatting the amount of hacking. The game is unplayable in its current state and it wasn't full release ready either. Sadly Bluehole only cares about money at this point which they will continue to make from a cut of the microtransactions to cheaters being able to rebuy cd keys and do it all over.

My biggest frustration is that the controls and actions feel really sluggish just like DayZ. But once you get used to it it isn't awful. Overall the game is really fun. The fighting is deadly and tense. If you're looking for run n gun though look elsewhere. Sometimes you'll go most of a game without seeing anyone. Part of the fun is seeing no one cautiously looting and wondering if you're about to walk into a trap. Haven't encountered any hackers yet. From what I heard they're all in third person mode.

Then you have to disconnect in order to hopefully rejoin and not get merc'd.I will say it is still enjoyable when you don't run into problems like that.Moments are intense and remind me of some of the clutch times I used to have in Counter Strike.I have yet to run into any cheaters in this game but I have started playing after this came out on Xbox One.Be thankful you don't have the Xbox One version.

2017-12-19,0,0,150,True,Recommended,The idea of the game is great. I was quite intrigate by this type of game but I also liked it.The downside untill now is that the game is unplaybale because of the framerate drop which is terrible and makes gaming awful and... impossible after all. It's not a HW issue but more a SW. My PC will play WWII at medium high settings at a stable framerate. But this UPB although it has a pretty low leveled graphic interface it's framing and it gets me crazy. I tried lots of solutions that other users on the internet recommended but nothing changed.The low framerate dropdown ussualy happens when there is another player arround. I thought it's my internet connection. It proved it isn't.I hope it will be improved and become reasonably playable.I recommend it but pay for it only if you are sure from existing players that this issue has been solved.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,890,False,Recommended,Short Review The combat is great and more realistic than other games in it's genre. It has a large set of bugs that get more and more fixed every day. The amount of weapons more realistic and gritty feel to it and customization keep me coming back as opposed to its competitors. It's a great way to make sure you never see friends or family again.Long Review I am a very active player of PUBG I play it almost every other day and if not that much at least make sure to log in once a week. I have seen every corner that this game has to offer. So when I say this I say it with full confidence. This game is for the most part realistic gritty and intense. It does something that it's competitors in the same field and genre haven't been able to master yet. While PUBG itself is no master of its craft it is still great. I have found so much fun and haven't felt this contected to a game and my friends while playing a game since the days of Halo 1 and Halo 2 online. I would recommend PUBG. It is a great game. While I'm sure my reviews will get buried among the millions of others just know it's worth it. The game is hard to learn harder to master. You will fight hackers cheaters and flying magic killing cars. But in the end you can find that on any FPS game in the market (Maybe not the cars) the difference is this one keeps me coming back after that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In September it broke steam's record for most online concurrent players which belonged to dota 2 (1.3 million) it's been 3 months since that record was broken and today PUBG is averaging 2.7 to 2.9 million players.Many people may complain about performance but they surely don't even have a decent computer the latest test server update which introduces a lot of new weapons vehicles and a map also features a HUGE performance patch Blue Hole Studios promised and delivered a great game with regular updates.There's no complaints about it right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However though of 02/06/2017 i highly recomend this to anyone who wants a good PVP battleroyal large scale shooter. UPDATE 27/01/18 Its now fully released and its awful for a fully released game. Hackers everywhere. Game breaking glitches every over game. New map is trash and you can't even play the old map by choice its by chance. FIX YOUR BLUEHOLE.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Rather than list all it's shortcomings I'll just detail my first match I spent my first five minutes trying to connect to a game lobby. After it finally refused my connection I spent my next five minutes joining another.I spawned inside a plane which then froze in place for several minutes before vanishing leaving me falling from the sky at the edge of the map. I spent the next 3 minutes bumping into invisible buildings trying to get to the items inside. I found a jeep when the buildings eventually started appearing and proceeded to drive it for a full 30 seconds before it fell through the apparent ghost bridge I was driving it over and sank into the river. I got out of the river and spent 2 minutes standing there while the game continued to load things in long enough for the wall to overtake me.

It s fun popular and you can customize your clothing and appearance. Although this game may look fun at first here are some pros and cons for you before you buy this game.Pros Somewhat addicting Ability to switch between 1st/3rd person beautiful graphics realistic with bullet drop and long range combat (You can snipe people from long ranges) One of the most realistic gameplays satisfying shots and kills cars and trucks great game to play for youtubers and streamersCons Can get boring after playing for awhile cosmetics aren t that fun there s really no goal to achieve while playing (aside from achievements stats and cosmetics) although cosmetics is something you can aim for when playing PUBG s cosmetics are boring to an extent and there s not much fun in themOverall I would totally buy this game and suggest if however this game is (in my opinion) a mini game in a sense. This game is pretty fun overall however if they should add anything they should focus on new cosmetics that you can aim for and other things. Because right now it s pretty boring after playing for an extensive period of time it can get boring not because aiming for cosmetics is boring but the cosmetics they have to offer isn t that... entertaining. I think this game should be a bit cheaper but the detail on it is insane.

2017-06-07,0,0,298,True,Recommended,I honestly did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I do. Its extremely fun when playing with friends and not too bad when playing solo. The best bet to get some enjoyment out of this game is to find a friend or two and hit up duo servers or squad servers and just have a blast sucking or winning. Either way you'll slowly be sucked in to the competitive vibe and tense moments as the matches zero in on the last few people. Needless to say I'm having the time of my life for the first time in a while. I have had the game for about a month and put close to 75 hours and that number could be much higher if it wasn't for finals. See you guys on the Battlegrounds!9.0/10Pros Fun with friends graphics aren't too bad and is surprisingly easy to run developer response has been great tense and competitive. If you get killed you just pop into a new lobby right away almost no wait times.Cons Can be glitchy and laggy at times sometimes this bites you in the butt. On a side note Random loot spawns can be both a blessing and a curse if you have to spend a long time time trying to find stuff. Its kind of a neutral fact that you may or may not like.

2018-02-22,0,0,143,False,Recommended,"The game is an addictive game yeah. It is decent yeah. But there are a many things I absolutely dislike about this game. Here are a few 1.) When I shoot a player it's very difficult to see if you hit them or not even when I have ""blue blood"" enabled it's still very difficult to see when you hit your target. It'd be amazing to see hit indicators in game.2.) The movement is just weird.. When you move your character and stop moving your character still proceeds to move for an additional mili second or so which makes it difficult to stand still when you need to.3.) It's hard to tell where you are getting shot from at a far distance.4.) The loot on the Battle Royale maps is very difficult to get except for on the Mini Royale mode. 5.) It's very difficult to land where you want to land and there's times where you're gliding for 10 seconds extra eventhough you are already on the ground.Other than those few issues the game is pretty good to an extent.. Another thing which I'm sure people who have a weak PC would love is for the minimul system requirements and the overall performance to be slightly improved without their systems overheating or causing their weak GPU's or CPU's to thermal throttle and lack performance.

(I dont care for cosmetic crates)Youre not always killed as soon as you land which is good although the world can seem rather quiet and desolate until youre shot suddenly Ive been lucky so far and havn't had problems with cheaters.The guns are quite nice but I would like some more.BUT the graphics are quite dated (Kinda looks like ARMA 2 graphics I guess it shares a similar engine?) Despite these bad visuals it doesnt run smoothly which really lets it down for me Ive tried it on various settings but its still stuttery so frantic gunfights are often frustrating and looking in the distance is just vile. Its just not a smooth game at the moment.Overall its a fun concept at an OK price (I got it for 18 which I think its worth in its current state) but its just too clunky to say any more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-09,0,0,127,True,Recommended,"INTRODUCTION What could I tell you about this game? Well for starters if you really like realism then you should totally get this game. It's a lot better to play with a friend or a group of friends so if you don't have any friends then you're out of luck. To put this simply you must be the smarter player. However there are a lot of dumb players who end up winning somehow by luck and not skill. ENVIRONMENT Oh you wanted to know about the environment huh? What do you expect? You'll hear gunshots from everywhere people hiding behind trees and going prone in foliage and if it rains you'll have a hard time driving that dune buggy. The environment in this game is actually fairly decent and is great for cover. One thing to note if you drive a car going 5 miles an hour into a tree then your health will deplete a little. COMMUNITY Lol it's worse than the CS GO community. There's either a twelve year old yelling the n word out loud or a random dude screaming ""ALLAHU AKBAR"" at 2 in the morning. In this community it's either kill or be killed (literally). Players define you by your skill and will crap talk you every chance they get if they die to your ghost bullets. EXPERIENCES In only a mere 13 hours of playing this (as of right now) I have made it first place only once. I was on top of the church in Polinchki and had the kar98k with an 8x scope. I would sit on top of the church and snipe down everyone until it came down to the final two (note that I had around 14 or 15 kills at this time) and I saw the top of this man's head behind a rock and sniped him luckily with my remaining mag. This experience was heart throbbing. My last experience I'd like to share is when my friend and I went into the flooded city and a boy who sounded about 12 or 13 had started calling for help he was stuck on the roof and if he jumped fatal death. So as being a good player I decided to calm him down and start talking to him and asking where he was from because he had a polish accent. His name was John. As John was stuck on the roof we went on a rescue mission to try and get him to safety all that ended when we got shot as soon as we were getting John and watched as John's head was filled with a dozen AKM bullets. CONCLUSION All being said this game is really fun and like I previously stated better with friends. The environment is healthy and could use a bit of patching up here and there and maybe not reuse old buildings? There is constantly new things rolling into the updates every single month and it's hard to get bored of this game. What do I rate it? 10/10 Johns. This game is a fun experience and if you love survival games you'll love this one. And not only that it's listed at a fair price with all the content you receive. John would sacrfice himself for you. Just think of that.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-02,0,0,190,True,Not Recommended,This is an edited review. The game is still bad however it has improved from total crap to a bugged out mess. The measures Bluehole have taken recently to improve the cheating situation is a good start. There have also been several UI improvements that are also nice. However all of this is not the main reason that the game is still not recommended by me. The game still needs HUGE optimizations for this game to be any kind of reasonable at early game. Battlegrounds also needs to give bug fixing some love.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-27,0,0,103,True,Recommended,Well this is a great game if you're already experienced with PC shooters. This is a bit of a problem for me because I've mostly played shooters on Xbox the game's also not very well optimised I hear though it mostly works well for me. In the unreal engine there are blocks that stop the engine rendering through materials this game could benefit from that as I experienced some lag in a house (which is a big deal when you've got a guy with a shotgun hunting you) D I'm used to fast paced shooters this can be a lot slower at times though there's a lot more strategy involved. Yes I would recommend this game and will extend this review later.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you want a polished game worthy of your time and of the money it earned on early access.. well.. wait a while. They'll either fix this or something better will come around. I really liked this game at first but it has already lost its potential because of all the server issues it has. I mean who cares that ""the servers are too busy"" for you to actually play a game you've paid for here's some crates to waste more money on. Nevermind the lag or the chinese hackers ripping you apart with a bloody scar from the other side of the map through several walls while you drive at 100 kmph get a new pair of cheap blue jeans to make you feel better. Also the netcode and the server refresh rate are so bad you can literally shotgun somebody 2 times in the face and they won't die. Who cares let's add a poorly designed map so people have to exit to the lobby every single time they get to play on it. Sad.

2017-10-20,0,0,667,False,Not Recommended,Updated (18MAY2018) This is the 4th time I have edited my review the game has had its up and downs. Current status? Good. Cant I recomend it? Meh.. game is good but the little issues and lack of region and ping lock can make gameplay unfun. As of the writing of this I am again in the top 1k(190th) place for TPP Solo NA. I have enjoyed the game very much. That being said the wave of hackers since last November(2017) still happens. While they have take some steps to ban hackers(they have banned millions) the issues still remain when you have 5 10% of your matches having cheaters another group playing with high ping/lag it can make some matches very bad. The de sync still continues to this day meaning you can get killed after a 0.5 seconds behind cover in games. If they would just region and ping lock the ing game it would solve so many headaches. but when 75% of your playerbase is Chinese you cater to that crowd I guess and it is what they have continued to do. Updates are always during NA primetime(every single week on a random weekday for 3+ hours) Chinese infest the North American Servers causing lag and unfun experience Chinese spam ads for cheats and porn in the server lobbies. No region lock and a halfass pinglock that I dont think anyone believes works Cheating still happening after 8 months of constant issues.(it was so bad in Jan the company had to publically admit it) In game currency has been regulated to almost worthless as all new equipment constantly required real world cash to buy keys to unlock crates. Map development has been slow and not very transparent... next map? The winter map they teased 6 months ago? who the knows... could be next week or next year... Games future seems bleek... lack of innovation seems to regin supreme. North American Player base has been shrinking fast and may be dead by DEC unless things change and they stop catering to only Asia. The game is now easily 3rd and well behind DOTA and CS againduring NA primetime... it wont belong before its 4th... 5th. and then gone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-19,0,0,544,False,Recommended,The game itself is very fun however it is difficult to master. It is extremely competitive and therefore there are also many people who chose to hide throughout the game which can sometimes be annoying but it is part of the game. Once you understand the way people play and their tendencies you can take advantage of their situation by for example nading a house which they are inside of. The final 20 is usually very intense especially in Miramar where there is very little cover. Luckily the game provides three different maps Sanhok Miramar and Erangel. All three are different with Miramar and Erangel being large and spaced out while Sanhok being smaller and the games being faster. In order to be good you have to learn how to play on each map. One of the things the game could use is offline mode or the option to have a shooting range to practice such as in CS GO. I wish I could practice using different weapons as I know that would improve my gameplay a lot. I also wish the queue time would be shorter as a couple weeks ago it was great and has since became quite horrible. Overall I would give this game a solid 7/10 as it is very fun and time consuming however the terrible server waiting time and the lack of practice facilities is something that makes this game hard to commit to.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-19,0,0,884,False,Recommended,TL DR I started playing in February have 500 hours in so far and I still love it. The purchase has definitely payed off as I've had tons of fun playing with friends and I can only recommend it.Now here's the long one.There has been an on going negative reviews campaign going on for a while you can find that from Reddit from example.To me this is unjustified. Yes the game has had it's bugs most are gone by now and they've lately improved graphics performance too. Now they're working on desync issues and netcode optimizations according to the FIXPUBG campaign they launched.For me there have been many games with zero issues where everything ran smoothly and responsively. There have been games where the experience was less enjoyable too but an online multiplayer game with 100 people depends on so many factors that I think it's unfair to downvote it to hell for that. The backend is being worked on and so far it's been getting noticeably better so I don't see a reason why that wouldn't continue.On the other hand there are people saying it's a dead game with no new content or something along those lines. The reality is that in the past 2 3 months they put out a whole new map (Sanhok rocks btw!) three new guns two new vehicles and a ton of skins that were obtainable for free (either via Twitch Prime or during the PGI tournament).In the end it is just a game. And a bloody entertaining and addictive one too. I recommend and intend to keep on playing.It is still by far number one on Steam too. All those negative reviewers _are_ actually playing so there's a hint there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In early access it was easy for me to forgive a lot of the bugs and FPS issues (particularly because I had a op back then as well). However in September of last year I purchased a high end gaming laptop. Specs are as follows GPU Nvidia GTX 1060 (4GB VRAM)CPU Intel Quad core i7 7700k 2.8ghzRAM 8GBNOTE This rig is capable of running VR at a stable 60FPS when not locked at 30 i.e Fallout 4 SkyrimIn its current full retail release this game is straight garbage. Allow me to explain. Many of the FPS issues and lag problems still occur. For instance whenever I take damage my game will freeze from anywhere between 0.5 2 seconds (I am not kidding and have recorded gameplay when this happens) despite having the beefy above specs which ultimately results in my death. Additionally occassionally aiming down sights causes a freeze of 0.5 1 second which actually caused me to lose the drop on someone and get killed in a match I just finished. Texture loading is still unoptimized as again despite the rig I have FPS drops still occur even after having been on the ground for a couple minutes.tl drI have a beefy rig and this unoptimized pile of garbage game still runs like,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-07,0,0,143,True,Recommended,"Game Title Should Be ""Crawl Hide Shoot""Feel Great immersion you feel like an ant in the map but not so much you have to run for an hour. Gun battles are intense but will leave you scratching your head at times. Sounds need to be tweaked can't tell if slow walk can or can't be heard by others you'd think there'd be stealth in a game if you go slow?? Doesn't seem to be. Also swapping weapon sound makes me think someone is near me everytime!I have only played solo but team play would be interesting and another level of fun. Be prepare to be camped ALOT but there in lies the strategy be prepared to get where you need to be. Plan your journey keep cover and learn when fast and loud beats subtlety...Much time will be spent spawning and dieing at about 30 to 40 players left but then you'll have some luck and live till the top 10 and your adrenaline will almost make you yourself. Never fear when death takes you it's only another 2 minutes wait till your parachuting again towards doom.Technical I've read people saying the game needs tweaking sure. But it runs ok for me and seemingly a lot of other players. I'd like to see the FOV and sounds looked into. It just doesn't sit right. FOV needs to be adjustable (aparently it'll come soon) and they need to off or change the gun swap sound and make you ""silent"" when going walk/crouch. Note If you see a person run into a house and leave a door open you *should* be able to sneak in behind them and use that to your advantage...aparently not in this game...Only other technical gripe is hacks. I've seen a few 'odd' things. A few instances of ""you can't have know I was there""...but they still ""counter camped"" my position while I new they were waiting for me. Had a guy with an UZI shoot me through a doorway (I was waiting for him to come out after trailing him) I unloaded with my AK even though he only briefly swept a quater of his body size) into the opening and back again (without knowing I would be there) they managed to get off enough rounds to down me. I did no damage with the ak crouched and scoped aiming at doorway.Please explain... * *Overall Fun Hide and Seek Shooter. Don't expect super accurate responses.

2017-12-13,0,0,663,True,Recommended,Well where to begin...This game is an absolute gem. You'll read all these reviews about how its unoptimized and buggy and while that is true its part of the fun of it. Watching your teammate drive a bike into a doorway only bug into the wall and blow up is pretty hilarious. It's not like it happens every game you play so that's why its easy to take it so light heartedly.And to further discredit all of these negative reviews about optimization the new patch on the test servers right introduces some immense optimization changes. I play on a potato of a laptop and with this latest patch it runs quite smoothly. As for game mechanics I give them a 6/10 rating. The map is big enough for each game to be different. Though its the same map so you can memorize it like a Call of Duty map. But wait!!! NOW THERES TWO MAPS!!! And the second map is amazing. Gun play used to feel a little loose in previous patches but it has been slowly refined and is fairly close to a Battlefield 4 feel right now. Bluehole is definitely improving their game.Now on to the premise of the game survival. From the moment you drop in it feels like a constant fight for survival. At the initial drop you are in a rush to find a powerful gun. Afterwards you are in a rush to find transportation. And after that comes some incredibly intense firefights. These battles will truly test your ability to aim plan and execute. Playing with squads is also a completely different dynamic than playing solo which I love. By yourself its all about stealth. Shoot only when the kill is ensured. In squads you tend to be a lot more visible to enemies due to there being 4 of you but you have 3 other people to watch your back so you can afford to take pot shots with your kar98k.The challenge of this game is one of the most endearing qualities. Its a true test of skill against 99 other players. Winning a round feel so much better than having a 2.0 k/d in call of duty.tl dr 6/10 Game Stability Bugs are funny take them lightheartedly and have a luagh. Optimization is getting better.6/10 Game Mechanics While the gun play is getting to a point I like it the blue zone moves too fast and you end up in a running simulator if you drop at the edge of the map8/10 Gameplay intense games juicy headshots and fat lootz.Overall 7/10 worth a buy (if Xbox goes smoothly look at that too),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-28,0,0,75,False,Recommended,Ok where to start... Being new to this battle royale genre of gaming I learnt a lesson very quickly. You will die and die and die over and over. There is no secret to this game it comes down to mostly luck and some form of skill. Some games I manage to get to the top 4 or 10 and then I dont come close to it for days. The challenges in this game are finding loot quickly moving cleverly and having good reflexes. The next big challenge is choosing a place to land some places that had good loot before are not going have the same loot next time around so it's a guessing game that can either benefit you or be to your detriment hence why I say this game is mostly about luck. The next challenge is the aiming and zeroing its really hard to master and when you are only getting a few minutes of gamelpay each round it's hard to get the playtime in to master the aiming so you are just left playing over and over hoping you get the right shot the right distance and you have the right gun or scope. The final thing is this is the only game ive played where I have to turn my settings down to gain a competitve advantage my rig can run this game on ultra but im stuck having to turn most settings to low due to rendering mechanics of the game. In conclusion if you are a big FPS fan then this will be great if you dont have a beefy graphics card or pc then this is for you however if you are not really into FPS games and have good pc then stay away or wait for a special.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-05,0,0,527,False,Not Recommended,I am pretty fond of this game when you can get a game. Matchmaking never seems to happen now. Wait 15 minutes (when it says expected wait 13 seconds) then abandon it and go play something that works.The idea of this game is great and I like the 'realistic' map style but it feels a long way from a AAA title. More like a one person game remake. Maps can get boring you tend to land in the same areas after a while.Missing lots of features like a test range or sandbox mode. Really hard to get better because you run more than shoot. Number of people logged on would help dont wait if there are too few.I like the new smaller map the blue zone is too punishing on the big maps. I die to that more than to the enemy. Seems like quire a few hackers sometimes hard to say You can die real fast to someone you never saw. I do like the death cam where you can see from the other persons point of view.I will only continue to play if the matchmaking improves and I would phttps //store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/#robably give a positive review if that was fixed.

2018-01-26,0,0,331,False,Not Recommended,"For right now I cannot recommend this game. It's a fully released game but it still feels like the Early Access it was a year ago just with better optimization. My 970 can finally get 80 FPS average after the 1.0 update but the graphics are still lacking. Way far away stuff are buggy. A texture will load then go away at a fast rate. I get these weird lines on the shorline. Stuff is fuzzy sometimes depending on my location. I can't see players all the time when they are far away. Sometimes I completely miss them when they are in front of me! Maybe I need glasses I don't know I already need them for my near side eyes. Game crashes every so once in a while but at least you can join back if you are in a safe spot. Killing people is the major problem though. I can unload half or even a full clip into someone and hit the majority of those shot but they dont go down. And if they do go down but they are in a group it takes another half of my clip to finish him. But when someone shoots at me it takes a few shots and I'm toast. Who knows maybe I just suck. But something does not feal right. My guess is the high latency issues with players in the lobby. You have people all the way in Fuqing China (It's a realy place) that are in any server they can get to. Everytime I go in a NA server half to pretty much every god damn person is Fuqing asian. A simple region lock would fix this issue. I do not think this game should have been released so soon. I would be happy if it were still in it's early access stage because it is a great game. But once you put it in fully released stage this game is terrible. If this game never had a early access program and released it the way it was I would have refunded my money. The devs should work more closely on the main issues before doing anything else...like loot crates. I do play this game a lot but mainly with friends cause they distract me from the issues I have with it.Edit (7/11/18) It's been a while since I wrote my review (over 6 months) and I think it's time for an update. It seems like every step forward the devs make is really just four steps back for the game. The UI is lookin good I'll give them that but why change somethings thats working right now? Why not change the mass desync on the servers that happen almost everygame instead thats been a problem for almost a year now. (I believe I had desync issues way before it became prevelant with other people). Some decisions the devs make don't make sense when trying to create a good game that PUBG can potentially be. Optimization is still terrible. When I said I can get a smooth 80 fps that has now changed. I had to lower my graphics settings to keep a constant fps. I get around 60 fps now and it still get dips to 30 which affects my gameplay and messes with me when I am in a hot area. But let me go back to ""the devs are making decisions that don't make sense."" In a view to make the game better this is true. However if you look at the root of all evil it becomes very clear. Bluehole is just in it for the money. Can't blame them I guess but it is starting to feel like a disgrace to the video game community. All these loot crates season passes buy level ups buy this buy that feels like a kick in the face to me as a consumer. Why would I pay more for a product that is not even fixed? I mean I payed $30 for this game thats a good price but thats when it was alpha stage. Which even though it has been out for 6 months still feels like the alpha that I was playing last year. Just with more features added into it. I would rather play fortnite which I have been because its free to play looks and plays great. Yes FN is cartoony smaller and the such but they are doing it right. They add different events every season they don't have game breaking bugs and they seem to care about their customers. Now I am not all against PUBG and I am not a FN fanboy. I used to love PUBG. However they are not taking the right steps to make this a good game. I don't like cartoony bs in a game. I like realistic shooters with great graphics. PUBG would be amazing if the devs would not constantly think about how they can get their pockets bigger. I would think making a flawless game that makes people come back to it would make hand over fist in cash over a game that is half and made for people to buy loot boxes. I play FN right now because I love the battle royal concept and I don't feel like the game is getting in the way of my skill (if I even have any) and fun. I would still not recommend this game at it's current state. Wait till CoD or BF5 comes out with a superior battle royale mode. The devs will start sh*tting their pants then when they realize they don't have the niche market of a realistic battle royale shooter. Hopefully it will be better then if not just get some other game. Not this one please save your money.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PUBG and BlueHole need to get there companies together before I ever consider playing again. They really seem to be money hungry and don't really care for player/audience feedback.

2017-10-27,0,0,368,False,Recommended,Premise MARKET BAD Don't buy this game if the reason you want buy it is for marketable items at start it was good because before it rewards players with marketable items after little months the devs of this game decide to kill the marketable items by stop the items to be marketable and they start to put virtual items on sale for dollars inside the game menu so in fact the game kick the of the community that support it for tradable items.They also start to give virtual items for free in exchange of hours of play all this changes so make then the virtual items lose value in the steam market (no one buy item in the market if can have it for free....)before the virtual items of this game can have value 300 rub 50 rub but after devs make these changes the value low to 0 10 rub also the game start then make some items cant be tradable.So all this changes kill the marketable economy of this game (that is the only reason why i buy it before)i totally agree game want fight cheaters i don't like it too and never use iti totally agree game want remove trade items from one user to another im ok whit thisBut i Disagree all the other bad things that the game change after make the tradable itemsnot be tradable in the market or lose value by put free items by play by put sell items for dollars etc they kill the virtual items pubg market tradable.Waiting for ARTIFACT game from valve that for sure will not go to delude me about the market tradable items.CHEATERS This game is always full of cheaters that automatic see you automatic aim you and automatic kill you also if they is inside a room house and you is fast drive a car far far they know where is you and wait then autoaim and lill you this is really frustrating devs always say they fix but is not true i always find a lot and make i lose want to play this game.GAME This said the game as for multiplayer gameplay is beautiful and i like it so i will give a positive vote but i'm really disappoint and hurt about how the devs kill the market value of the items with theyr new skin/item monetizing and not marketable items.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v ouzGCY4H7uwp.s.

Then after almost a full year of asking for help on forums with the dev and BattlEye I never got an answer other than the dev and BE pointing the finger at each other. BattlEye assured me the ban was not from them and the proof is in the pudding... I played Ark A LOT.... if BE was going to find anything bad... it would have found it while I was playing Ark both immediatley before and after getting this pointless ban.Then on Apr 25 this year I was banned again..... uh... my first ban was never reversed and I did not even have the game installed..... Then they added a third ban on Apr 28..... How exactly can they keep banning someone who does not even have the game installed?Oddly it still only shows as one game ban on my record but still makes ZERO sense... I went to the steam community to seek help and was greeted with masses of hate and being called a cheater.... pretty funny because my ban does not say I was banned for cheating... I have asked the dev if perhaps my username was an issue but no response...I would like to give this game a fair review but again.... they have banned me for NO reason.... not helped me resolve the issue... and apparently I am not the only one who has been treated this way.Just tonight I sent BlueHole another request to review my ban...... hopefully they actually provide me with some details for my ban.... but I seriously doubt it... I will be honest.... after receiving my second ban I started looking into the banhammer issue and apparently the dev is on a banning rampage. I surely hope they fix this as I cannot get a refund and I am barred from accessing content in which I payed money for. 0.4 hours of playtime and most of it staring at a ""you are banned from Steam"" message......Do not recommend at this time.Perhaps if my ban is lifted and I can actually play the game a few times I can change my mind.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm not going to go in vast details as others have already done much better than I could and this is my personal review anyway.The only credit I can give is for coming up with an interesting concept for the Battleground genre but when it comes to supporting and building upon that concept over the years? The PUBG Corporation or Bluehole have proven incapable of doing that.This game company as also taken legal actions that question their very integrity toward game development and in my opinion have crossed the line from defending their game against clones into trying to appropriate themselves the very concept of Battle Royale. Not only are these actions motivated by greed for profit as their competitor are performing better on all points listed in my first paragraph they seriously threaten to limit the artistic expression and interesting new possibility that emerging developpers can create in the future if their vile lawsuit succeeds.

Sadly the game has been out for 7 months now and It's still just as completely laggy and un optimized as the day it was released for early access. It's truly sad that a game with success like this is going to get away with terrible business practices such as micro transactions and just being lazy when it comes to working on the game. You would think with the success of the game bluehole would be constantly working on new content such as new maps fixing their servers or atleast making it to where a normal person can run the game above 20 fps. But instead all they seem to have added is a few vehicles and weapons here and there and truthfully this game feels the exact same as the day it was released. Truly sad Bluehole.

2018-06-21,0,0,1825,False,Recommended,tired of game companies limiting your gaming experience? then this is the game to buy to tell them that you will not put up with their crap. 64 max player count for the last decade and this formerly small company gives us a 100 player count game. Not only that they gave us maps that are so much larger than those in games that only support a maximum of 64 players. This game made me realized how little competition there were in the gaming industry. Well competition has finally arrived and it's apparent that other companies are trying their best to kill this game and company. The issues with the games are there but are due to the fact that this is a 100 player fps style game being implemented on a mmo size map with player having the ability to move very fast via driving or flying. No game engine can truly support this well so pubg corp is pushing the unreal engine to it's limit. Until there's a breakthrough regarding network technology and a dramatic increase in the minimum requirement for pc's this may be the limit as to what can be done in a 100 player battle royal type game. If you've been playing fps style games for the last decade it's time to try something new. This feels nothing like a fps game in that you have to actually play tactically. Positioning and planning will carry you to the final circle while your fps skills will get you the chicken dinner. This is a thinking man's game. Should you take a car and risk revealing your position via the engine noise? Do you have meds? If it's early in the game you can scavange for it but if not then you have to fight for it. And then you add in the ability to play with 1 or 3 others in squad. do you have a sniper gun? I can give you a 8 time scope. thanks here take some first aids. Anybody got a vehicle? I will go get one you guys keep looting! who threw the smoke grenade? I think somebody's in the building. we all push together. I'm down the guy is upstairs camping. Ok got the guy!

Battle Royale is here to stay just not in a buggy format with CEOs that rather sue everyone than use the revenue they get to develope the game further. Implementing an event pass that can't be earned through playing was the last nail in the coffin. I have no problem with past sale revenue coming from skins and other cosmetic items if the money actually goes towards fixing the game and new content but how these guys are handling their game is just dumb. They not only killed the PR but also the game itself. Props I had high hopes especially because I hate the overly cartoony skillless game that Fortnite was and is becoming even more nowadays.

Such a shame because it has so many other things I love about it but it's just unbearable to play now.Previous review I use to really enjoy this game. I still do enjoy it but not as much. While I still recommend it its become quite a time sink due to the wait times both to get the numbers for a game and also because the 1 minute countdown starts much too late. The wait time has made solo unbearable as you can spend 10 minutes looting only to be killed out of nowhere or by a camper. This in turn makes solo worse because there are less people queueing for solo making the wait time longer and making this game harder to want to come back to. Squads with mates is still quite enjoyable unless you have the misfortunte of dying early and your squad living on. Definitely still has a lot of potential but needs a lot of refinement.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But due to the release of Fortnite this game has slowly been dying due to the cost and how fortnite is free. I find this game better than fortnite due to the current state fortnite is in and how the developers are making it a more luck based game but then again pubg has its flaws such as personally i find more lag playing pubg and also being absolutely destroyed in seconds but then again its all about skill in this game fortnite is a bit diferent in the way it works with bloom and random damage so overall this game i find is better than fortnite but i believe it should either be free or they should lower the price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-12,0,0,1859,False,Not Recommended,This game should be a lot better. If they would fix the dysnc that would be huge. Another change that would make this game worth it is actually giving a crate key for winning rather than only coins would help this game as well since you know when you spend your hard earned coins on crates you end up getting a locked crate that forces you to buy a key. I have never bought a key i have 1800 hours into this game and i have more locked crates than i can imagine. As well when you finally get an unlocked crate you get some BS item like the weapons crate you ALWAYS get a beige skin.... WTF do i want 18 beige skins for??? My recommendation is dont buy this game wait till call of duty BR comes out and play that. The creators of this game only care about making money off of you not giving you what you deserve. Again i put 1800 hours into this game and have barley got any good items. These guys literally allowed their shell company tencent to make a better game than this with no dysnc and wont allow it to come out into america until PUBG dies. Once PUBG dies they will release that game and make more money off of people while having a well made game.

Once they stop dragging their feet on actually making updates on this game it will be 10 times better. All in all it's a fun game for $29.99Things that need fixed Servers are not the best The lag is real (By that I mean they have random network lag messages that pop up in game and everyone stops moving. When you're first dropping in on a spot it takes time for stuff to spawn. When you first land to take any action either to open a door or pick up a gun the delay is way to high)This game is a resource hog for not being a very graphic intensive game.

2017-07-09,0,0,280,False,Not Recommended,I kept my original review below. My stance has currently changed on this game. If you are an AMD user and I don't just mean a ryzen but FX processors as well just stay away as of update 20 in Aug 2018 they broke the game and have not fixed it. Update 21 has now been released and well it is still broke. I can't play I can load the game get to the menu sit on it for about 30 seconds and then crash if I attempt to start a match in that time I will crash before the match loads. This is incredibly disapointing as I loved this game and it doesn't appear from their forums that they are taking this issue seriously.I love this game. The matches are quick only lasting up to about 30 minutes if you can make it to the end. While there are still some lag issues the team building the game is constantly working on optimization over adding stuff so. The game's performance seems to always be at the for front of their work with additions as only added benifits when able. The three current main modes are well fleshed out and they are still working on making sure drop balance is right. Which I've found the recent update to drop balance and randomized cars and their directions a really good thing for the game.

2018-09-12,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,PUBG could have been good if they had been willing to listen to their fanbase. Instead they decided everyone who wanted to play on a team with people who spoke the same language were racist. Then they decided to add insult to injury that instead of adding meaningful content that they would just instead add loot boxes. Now pubg just sits in my library and every week when it has an 11 GB update I question why I haven't uninstalled it. If you actually still have friends that play this game it might be worthwhile but be aware that is only now trying to turn a new leaf after a year long journey of on the fanbase and now is trying to recover its failing playerbase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-10,0,0,140,False,Not Recommended,"im going to start this out by saying that i do REALLY enjoy this game. its a lot of fun to play if you have people to play with although not as much if you dont. but none the less is a great game. now lets get into the reasons im giving this game a negative review preformance and cheating. Preformance this game has some SERIOUS preformance issues on even midgrade hardware. im not saying i have a beast system but i can run arma and medium at 50 55 FPS stable. this games map is roughly 1/18 the size of altis (and the new map is slightly smaller) and im lucky if i get 30 FPS with ALL of my settings turned to very low after 1.0 this got better but that was just the frame lockups i experienced every 15 or so seconds. and this still happens but about every 30 instead of 15. so needless to say this game runs like trash and unjustly so. there is no reason i should be able to run arma 3 on medium at 50 and this game on low at 30 now on to my main reason i dont recomend this game Cheating this has a lot to do with the Chinese playerbase which really deservers a section of its own but it ties in with this problem so well i didnt see a point. (according to battle eye 99% of the cheaters in pubg come out of china) but Cheating is a huge problem in PUBG in the last 30ish matches ive played ive had maybe 4 5 where my killer wasnt obviously using an aimbot of somekind and no im not joking that few. as i stated above chinese players make up 99% of the cheaters in game and they also make up almost 1/2 the playerbase in the game. there is a very simple way to solve this problem and thats region locking the game not just for this issue but also because of the ping that the chinese players present and the garbage netcode this game has its literally worse than battlefield 4s was on launch. also dont use the ""but its quicker to find matches on NA servers for them"" when its not they make up almost half the playerbase. your arguement makes no sense in conclusioni love this game although it is plagged with issues i will continue te play it but these issues need to be addressed. if the situation improves i will change this review. but until these issues are resolved i do not recomend that anyone new buy this game and i encourge you to avoid it like the plauge until Mr. green decides to take these issues seriously itstead of calling the community that made this game sucessful ""xenophobes"" for presenting a straightforward solution to a problem",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They have been so focused on adding new content that they have not fixed some of the unrealistic and quite honestly immersion breaking animations sounds and items. Not to mention that audio does not seem to be working properly at random points. In multiple instances I watched players land and run by me without a sound. This also led to numerous deaths and losses and made me not want to play. Additionally the devs try so hard to communicate with the playerbase but fail to add things that players need and want until long after it is called for. This is a major reason why Fortnite though a little harder to get into coming from Battlefield games has become not only my new favorite but also the gaming community's new favorite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

First the game servers. Yes we get it its an early access game and we know youll have issues with the servers but with it happening multiple times in a day you would figure by now they would have it figured out. But the bright side is they will keep you updated through social media about the issues and when they are resolved. Secondly the game is starting to flood with hackers. Thing is they make it obvious when they are running 3x the speed than everyone else and insta headshot you without looking. They do get banned but i shouldnt be seeing hackers every day. And lastly WE DO NOT NEED ADVERTISEMENTS.

It was great when it started but got way to popular way too quit for the game to handle it. I installed it again about an hour ago and just uninstalled it for good. This game is absolute trash still from a few months ago when the major hacking started. Now it has gotten worse with hacking still a major problem and now there is a bunch of teaming going on in solo matches. Every match I went into there was teaming happening in solo matches. all 3 matches I played had a serious amount of teaming. Not only is teaming a major issue waiting for a lobby takes forever now days with it's ""Predition time"" being 26 seconds Waited around 8 minutes average for the 3 matches I played. I really would not bother buying this game and save your money.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

On top of that they're running ads in game in that region for a proxy that will improve players' connection to servers since they don't seem to have any in China.

2017-10-03,0,0,471,True,Not Recommended,It's a fun game when you're learning the ropes. Then you learn that there's an 80% you are killed by t or the wonky physics in the game. Pubg is yet another multiplayer game that hasn't learned the importance of region blocking people out of NA servers if nobody in their party is in NA. Servers are frequently down and zero progress has been made in fixing the game breaking bugs. I have the strangest feeling this game will be early access until everyone loses interest and then Bluehole will struggle to get 100 people into any games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-03,0,0,135,True,Recommended,i realy like the game and i think its very fun but i havent been banned for stream sniping yet so i dont know,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-03,0,0,302,True,Not Recommended,"Firstly I do still believe in this game and desperately hope they can make the game we all wish we were playing when we run this hot mess. I was going to hold off on reviewing the game until full release. However with recent decisions being made by the development team their grace period for forgiveness in my eyes has ended. This is quickly turning the way of DayZ. With the title of ""Biggest Game on Steam"" comes a certain standard of quality or playability that is not being met. For the first 40 hours I had a decent amount of fun. There's a steep learning curve between the massive map different weapons and mil sim tactical gameplay all of which appeal to me as a gamer. I could excuse the rampant bugs glitches and optimization issues since it was Early access and I knew what I was getting into purchasing this game in that state. But as more of my friends bought the game and I spent more and more time in the world the issues that now cause this game to have a ""Mixed"" review rating became less subtle with every single match I entered. This game is poorly designed for competitve play. Firstly there is no practice range or training mode (which is a basic essential for any competitive shooter). That in itself wouldn't be as much of an issue but it requires the unpleasant experience of joining game after game simply to die in order to understand the game's mechanics. Since there is no killcam or ""death report"" breaking down your damage received or given there is no way to tell whether you're even doing damage during an engagement. A new player will die from seemingly nowhere and without the information on HOW they died or WHERE they were shot from it will discourage them from wanting to play. I would describe this as ""User Hostile"" and deters players from coming back. The number of friends I have with less than 5 hours on this game because of this exact issue is staggering. I've heard the arguments for how a Killcam or Death Recap would take away from the immersion or experience and while I can understand that point it's an invalid argument when put in the context of a competitive game. You cannot grow without knowing how someone outplayed you. There is no ""get gud"" when you're being left out to dry on exactly HOW you died so you can anticipate the same situation in the future and adapt to it.Next the framerate stutters heavily even on the most powerful and expensive rigs. I have a higher tier rig and I MUST play with most everything on ""Very Low"" to get close to 60. Ask any competitive gamer how important getting a steady 60 MINIMUM is for their performance. Especially during gunfights when the game will inexplicably drop frames because you. Finally we have the most glaring issue server connections. Between the MASSIVE desync and server connection problems I cannot reasonably call this game ""competitive"". There have been times where I have dropped from full health to none THEN I hear the gunshots after I am already dead. I have been riddled with bullets and survived with no damage. The number of times when I have been completely in cover THEN received hits from a few seconds ago is uncountable it happens nearly every single game. This issue right here is what breaks the competitive play as what the server thinks is happening is NEVER 1 1. The amount of t headshots I've gotten on people most likely in cover on their games is equal to the number of times I've been in total cover then received damage. It's not a connection or ping issue this is a game issue.I still have hope for this game. I hope they can fix the frame stuttering the desyncing and make it more user friendly. But until then while they continue to roll out new game content for a game with broken basics I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,193,True,Recommended,In regards to microtransactions They are adding them for a brief amount of time in EA to Fund a tournament Test the system Donate the rest to charityAfter the short window they will remove them again until the game is released fully.All the people rating it negative are overreacting a scary amount and you shouldn't let them dissuade you from the game.That being said there are still a few bugs and the servers can be laggy although in my experience Bluehole usually fix these issues ASAP so they are a non issue (in my opinion).The addition of first person only mode has been seriously fun and it's like paying once for two games because third person and first person just play so differently.I've had so much fun with this game I bought my friend another copy so I had someone to play it with.Would recommend even if the game was released in its current state with no further updates.At the end of the day this is a video game. If you buy this video game you will not regret it. If you buy this video game then get involved in all the out of game drama that doesn't affect you it may ruin your experience but if you are buying this video game to play this video game it is well worth the $30,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(most of the titles out now that uses UE4 has that blury image and slow loading objects... hope it get fixed)CONCLUSION The whole game is the best in this genre but it needs alot of improvements and optimizing as i have friends with older gpu's GTX 660 and cant play it its the main cause that games like this(no name needed) got alot of players out (optimizing promises not delivered) Ill give my positive with hope for the future !,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Although this game was only released as early access so the devs have an excuse to put out a buggy game just so they can make more money during development it's still a good game even in alpha. For some reason you have a will to just try and get far and win. Although I started with negatives let me list the positives. First Person Only mode. (Third person shooters are dumb you can stand in cover and still see a push coming.)Active devs that listen to the community. (H1Z1 take notes)Combat is fun even though it can use some work.Although RNG is annoying at times I think it adds to the excitement and challenge to the game. Some mechanics are great such as the airdrops that rewards aggressive players.Motivates you to play for some reason like an itch to win and this game doesn't get too boring because of it.For a game in Alpha the settings are pretty in depth. Ultrawide support.Duo and squad are worked out pretty well and are definitely super fun. My personal favorite mode is Duo.One problem that doesn't affect many people though bans are easy to get. The staff are too serious about stream snipers and team killing but that is already a ranted about topic by the community.Overall I recommend this game. It's just fun and it can be casual and competitive.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,575,True,Not Recommended,Edit This game is complete Desync never fixed. And after a month hiatus I come back and the sound of the game is at unbelievably low default levels that I can't even increase within the game. So now I can barely hear people when they're walking around without making adjustments to my computer's audio settings. Game just isn't fun anymore and the incessant problems that arise that WERE NEVER PROBLEMS before is hilarious. Uninstalling and never looking back. I hate fortnite but it's only a matter of time until someone halfway competent makes a PUBG style BR game and then this ultimately turns out to be what everyone always thought it was a pump a dump from a korean company.Edit This game has improved and I actually bought a new computer because of this game. While this game still has a plethora of issues and bugs it's a fun game that actually runs. It's still poorly optimized but content patches are constantly being updated to the game along with client improvements. Really the only positive since the game came out is that the game receives regular updates. Which is a good thing for an early access title.This feels like a game that I could really like further down the line. At the moment though I cannot exactly recommend it. It's in a very early access stage. Most of its problems right now rely on its horrible optimization. I'm a little fearful if this game will ever solve its performance issues because so often they never get fixed with a lot of games but I've been proven wrong plenty of times on this. I suggest waiting on this one if you're truly on the fence but I will admit I'm having fun playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-06,0,0,223,True,Not Recommended,This game is by far one of the worst overhyped games I have ever played in my life. First of all the mechanics suck the gameplay is not smooth at all you get stuck on edges and ledges every chance you get. The menu navigation is ing horrible nothing is organized everything is lumped up in the same category. Secondly the gameplay this game besically take no skill or stratagy its all about being lucky that you get an assault rifle and a car then you are set to go. If you dont have both of those things you will 100% lose. The entire game is based on getting better gear before your oppononts do and all of that is based on your RNG. you can land in an area where its only you and one other guy so you both get into different houses and he findes an AK 47 and you find a Pan good luck trying to hit the guy blasting your with the AK while all you have a a frying pan and a pair of sunglasses. Again I state whether you win or lose is based on how lucky you are with the gear you get when you land. Even if you do find a good weapon they still might spawn the circle(the place you have to be in before the timer ends) at the opposite side of the ing map. Good luck going there if you cant a ing car because you will 100% die or an anal lazer infection if you dont find yourself a car in the first 8 minutes so your only hope of having a dignified death would be to shove your frying pan as deep in your as possible before that dumb ing lazer wall burns your Last but not least the ing servers. the connection is so ing laggy no matter which server I play on. Its not due to my internet I have played many games that require good connection(abttle field CoD LoL Overwatch) and I never had as much trouble as this ing game. In conclusion this game is a waste of time and money. Please spend your hard earned cash on something timeless and worth it like the Witcher or something not this joke of a game. The only reason this game is even popular is because the PC master race commuty like praising indie games because they are just a bunch of neck bearded hipsters that enjoy fapping to anime,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-05,0,0,161,True,Recommended,Over 100 hours in and I'm still not entirely sure how to feel about this game. On one hand I've had some really good times playing and sometimes winning high octane games on the other hand I've also been in games where I've spent 20 minutes running only to be killed by someone camping in a bathroom. On one hand I've seen marked improvement since this game came out on the other hand for some reason it's getting a console release far before it can be considered a 'finished game'. On one hand I've had games that have run smooth as butter and on the other hand I've had games that felt laggier and more glitch filled than would be acceptable from a pre alpha demo of a game.My answer is a very hesitant yes. Hopefully the developers will continue to improve and expand this game to the point where I can consider it without a doubt worth the $30 I paid for it but until then at least it's better than H1Z1 and Fortnite I guess.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This at times can make the game feel slow and even when you hide making it to the top 10 just to get picked off by a guy hiding in a bush makes the whole 20 minute treck feel worthless. thats not to say the game isn't fun i have managed a few wins myself but for maybe one of those wins i can say i had fun doing it most of my enjoyment with this game comes from playing with 2 4 people and just having crazy adventures and getting into big shootouts laughing at the glitchy physics in cars or how youre friend just bounced a grenade off a closed window and killed himself those moments to me are more fun then winning by playing bush simulator 2017. the core mechanics like peeking in scoped mode and getting stuck on a tree while you get shot and on behalf of atleast 2 people i play with the loading screen glitches and texture rendering glitches could all use some work but if you've got friends to play with or dont mind a solo quiet camping game the 30$ is definetly worth it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-02,0,0,209,False,Not Recommended,Do not buy this game. Not only is it exactly the same as it was during early access the developers decide to focus their efforts on lawsuits instead of fixing the thing they already have. They know their game is garbage and can't compete with other battle royale titles so they believe the only way for them to succeed is to remove the competition instead of making a better game. The game itself is terribly optimized even though they told us they were going to fix that. I constantly deal with framerate issues even though my computer is well above the recommended and connection issues are constantly a problem even though I have good internet. The gameplay itself can be enjoyable if everything worked perfectly at least 80% of the time but the majority of the time you have to deals with bugs and hope you don't get shot while you wait.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-28,0,0,326,False,Recommended,Lets see....Where do I even start with this game. The game (When working properly) is phenominal. I've logged close to 300 hours as of writing this review. The only issue with this game is the constant crashes lagg and desync. I have an issue where I have to set my CPU affinity each and every time i start a match and end a match. It frustrates me to no end. But yet i still end up coming back. The thrill of top 10 is just to exciting for me to just drop the game. Even for all the problems the game has. In my own personal opinion i would recommend it with a 7.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-28,0,0,401,False,Recommended,"There's something about this game that keeps me coming back whether it be solos or squads with friends. That being said there are so many small things they could do to make the game more enjoyable (that don't involve netcode).1) Custom matches like they were on the test server. 2 people to start a match instead of 10. I'm sure they must've had a reason to change it the way they did but it's far less enjoyable now. Those couple days of test server custom matches were the most fun I've had in PUBG. 2) If they can't swing OG custom matches then perhaps they could add a firing range like Tencent has in PUBG Mobile. I believe at some point Brendan Greene stated that a firing range wouldn't be in the spirit of the game. If that's really it then it's time to face the facts my dude you're not making an art piece you're making a game. Let's have some fun.3) Arcade modes with smaller circles and/or fewer people (8 minute matches and Mini zone) just like Tencent has in PUBG Mobile. 4) Greater AR/DMR/SMG/Sniper spawn rates. Sanhok's drop rate is pretty good but it was better in the early stages of the experimental server. I'm not sure why it's a gameplay element that you have to hunt around for a good 3 5 minutes sometimes to find an AR especially in places like Po i. Maybe they could do a testing period with increased weapons spawns. If only there was something of a test server to do that on...5) Separate the crates you buy with in game currency and the ones you buy with real world money through keys. The in game currency is more or less totally useless right now and it's really the only thing you get at the end of a match. I read on a forum that this is just how crate systems are and that if we didn't like Bluehole ""giving us free money"" (by selling crates on the marketplace for $2 3 each) then we could basically shove it. Unfortunately just about every single crate is worth $.03 now so that dude should probably do some re evaluating. Anyway it's frustrating that you can't just spend the in game currency and know you'll get a crate you can actually open without spending $2.50.6) Please set the default firing mode for freshly picked up weapons to full auto. It would be extra cool if they came loaded.7) If there's not going to be test server like custom matches or a firing range a dedicated deathmatch mode (or permanent War Mode) would be great to get some practice before hopping into a match or just messing around. It can be rather difficult to find a good match that will actually fill up on the custom games as is.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-26,0,0,455,True,Recommended,I was always a fan of console gaming until I decided to buy this game a fair distance off launch. This game has changed the way I game. I pre ordered WW2 on PC initially bought Destiny 2 on PC and a few other different game im looking into buying once they release. This is huge for someone who has never really played PC other then occasional WoW from time to time.I strongly recommend this game to anyone with a decent computer I had to upgrade a fair bit in order to play on high / ultra settings but I didn't spend a whole lot.There are a few points that I must point out 1) When a team member dies in squads or duo it places a large white skull on their body making it impossible to see anyone beyond or looting that said body.2) FPS drops quite a bit in many matches this isnt a huge thing but it does get annoying when in the middle of a gun fight and your guy decides to spike all over and place.3) First person mode is extremely fun and enjoyable if you can get over the fact you feel like you 4 foot tall. All the door handles and windows are eye level and after playing a few matches I begin to get a headache.There are a few other points but at this time I feel those are my top 3 they are very small points and they dont effect my review of this game. For being early access I would buy this game before the full game releases and the price doubles.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-22,0,0,411,False,Not Recommended,This game gave me a few memories that will stay with me for the rest of my life which I could only say to a few games. some things that made me want to stop was the fact the loot crates are now mostly locked and selling them is also not worth it. crates shouldn't be the selling point for this game but when you introduce any mechanic into a game it will and should be reviewed as a part of a game. Crates or loot crates will make or break a game (EA) mind you yes PUBG crates are just cosmetic but they are still selling for a pretty penny. This to me was probably the most looked at when the developers wanted fans to keep coming back and yes I almost agree with that to me that kept this game fresh for me and I even get locking a crate once every other season or two would make sense to me or why locking them would make the hacks less interested in playing this game. but to me as an actual gamer it isn't fair. yes the game lags and I got sniped with an impossible headshot a few too many times. I almost feel bad because I genuinely enjoyed this game. it makes my heart pump and my mind think of ways it never had before. I'm not a coder by any means but I believe you are all thinking inside the box and should start thinking outside of it. Maybe adding a lvl system too the player base may start helping out the bots become less involved in the later part of the game once you reach lvl 30(or more) then you can start getting points and can start buying crates and thus forces the hackers to go through the game legit. For me I Believe this would be a great idea and as long as the community checks their death cams with this kind of idea you should have a cleaner game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It seems like a game that should be free on your mobile phone. No weapon impact/contact no action no fun very boring simulation of falling out of an airplane (yeah it gets annoying after 2 3 jumps and the whole game is based on it) running around and getting shot. Graphics are low tier but it doesn't mean it works smooth not even on a high end computer. There are also lag issues.

2018-07-18,0,0,62,False,Recommended,Graphics HorribleTolerableNeutral I would say some explosions grass and environment effects are nice. Up close a lot of things look pretty bad. You can get lost in some of the big open maps (lost in a good way...visually).GoodAmazing Gameplay HorribleTolerableNeutral The movement feels very floaty and clunky. You can get caught on trees when parachuting and there are tons of bugs. However I thoroughly enjoy the gunplay especially up close. It also has more of a realism to it with the bullet drop bullet velocity etc which does come into play for longer snipes. This isn't a fast paced bunny hopping game like Fortnite. It is much more strategic and literally every step you take should be calculated.GoodAmazing Audio HorribleTolerableNeutral Good I would say Audio is key in this game more than most other aspects of the game and its more important than in other battle royales. With that said sometimes things do feel off. People complain that they can't hear footsteps until its too late.Amazing Audience KidsTeens YesAdults YesElderly Difficulity Too easyEasyNeutralHard Once you learn some of the gun mechanics movement audio queues etc...it becomes a bit easier. But its tough to master a lot of the aiming bullet drops strategies what attachments for what weapon etc.Too difficuiltSummary I currently love playing PUBG. With its flaws bugs and lack of developer interaction with the community its still a fun game to play if you are into the BR genre and want a more realistic take on it. If you want pretty graphics bunny hopping cute skins but general fun gun play then Fortnite is probably your jam. If you want something that takes a bit more practice more realistic more customization options in terms fo guns and how you want them to work for you strategy and tactiful gameplay...then PUBG is your jam. Just beware you will second and triple question some of your deaths.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-23,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,I'm late to this party and that's because I did not want to pay full price for this. I was almost never going to buy this game after reading all the terrible reviews until I got drunk and bought a key. I'm reviewing this with a slight comparitive slant toward Arma 3 since 'Playerunknown' made the mod in Arma before going on to make this one if I'm correct. So my honest thoughts? It's fun for a short while. I've found since I got it I like to play it for an hour although playing any more than that the game gets irritating. Getting the chicken dinner is hard. I got into the top ten at least. BR is personally a little lame to me. I essentially put it in the 'wasteland' style of play except in this game there are no military vehicles to watchout for and the game forces you to keep moving or die so someone magically wins the 'king of the hill' or the chicken dinner which usually ends in a 1v1v1 or 2v2 in teams type situation.The good The maps are nice I like the detail on some of them. Player models are good. Character customization is to me optional okay for people who like it.The bad Not enough rifles. Looting buildings sometimes sucks. No night maps which could make for some interesting gameplay. Characters have stiff movements. Footsteps are too loud. Adding a sneaking walk would do good. No shooting range/training mode. Other game modes are pretty much empty unless you get in on a private server. Not having a TDM just for fun. Can't change your name in game which should be simple.Edit I have run into at least one hacker who knew my exact position pretending to be swat and However mostly people who killed me were just in right position or they heard my loud af footsteps.I only can't reccommed this game because I think it does need a lot of work not just with their anti cheats. So I'm giving it a weak thumbs down.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Hate that thier is not a region lock them dont region lock china region lock NA to keep the hackers and teamkillers far away.its sad to say the least that the pc community hyped this game up for so many months to be left out to dry when literally half the damn community is all begging for a region lock. i have offically unistalled the game. i will definetaly download again. if region lock of someshort is enabled or if friendly fire on sqaud is no longer a thing!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But recently the game is a broken mess. it says that matchmaking estimate time is over 40 minutes that i cant wiat that long and takes for ever to render. Devs never respond and i never thought i would be saying this but fortnite is a miracle compared to this.. at least Epic Games respond to the community. The event pass i didnt even look into and their is no point of playing other then that ''Winner Winner chicken dinner'' that got old so quickly. i prefer the realistic approach to battle royale though but the bugs and glitches makes it seem so unrealistic.

Have to say yes there Money grabbing with this feature. might as well not put points in the game just earn a crate at the end of the match or just have a store where if ppl wanna buy a box just buy a box the point system is just redundent now.GAME MODESbase game is fine but now they have added custom game modes and it now takes 5 10 mins (even tho it give us an estimate time to matchmake personally i think the custom game modes have killed the base game and ppl end up leavingthe lobby even when you do get a game your lucky to get 80 85 ppl now.Optimization is a given and server optimazation how about more incentive to win the match other than more points how about win the match get a crate key or 2 or just a random piece of clothing or gun skins.these are just afew bug bares of mine other than the game dying right now cause of the custom game mode i think the base game is great.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-16,0,0,999,False,Recommended,Just a couple months after PUBG came out back in March of 2017 I decided to buy in. It has been by far one of the most thrilling and heart wrenching games I have played. You can sit for hours on end in pursuit of a victory and no matter how good you are at the game you always get that adrenaline rush when you're doing well.After the game came out of Early Access I was extremely disappointed. I did not think that it was ready and the hacker abundance was ridiculous. After taking a break from January 2018 July 2018 I am extremely pleased with the progress the devs have made. Not only have they launched the FIX PUBG campaign which promises to finalize the majority of all issues regarding server lag and optimization but the game's current state feels much better as well. There are far fewer fps drops and the only main concern is the dsync which should be fixed shortly.Overall this has been the best $30 I have spent online.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,180,False,Recommended,This game gets a lot of hate and I feel from reading and looking at the players profile is unfair. Most have 100+ hours in the game and you dont play a game for 100 200 300+ hours long and not like the game. What happens way to much and not even on just PUBG but people try to play demanding games with potatoe rigs. Is this game optimized the best no but it is still very do able with a decent mid level rig ( Which you should really have to play video games ). Youll need atleast a 1050 ti and a quad core cpu if older or newer better threaded cpu. I have a 1060 6gb OC with an 8 core cpu.Another thing this game is not easy or even advertised as being easy. Its really ing hard sometimes it strives for a degree of realism. Fortnite is an easier battle royal people win a lot becuase of how easy it but PUBG is more complicated and wins can become rare sometimes.Personally this game is amazing to play with friends to around or to try to win. I can recall countless time swhere matches eneded when we all were luaghing our asses off or we were yelling at eachother becuase they didnt make the right move. Overall this game is the best realistic battle royal there is out there. Yes there bug and yes it isnt optimised the best but they have pubilcly announced they are now working on it.

And it is mid range card from 2011. If I tried any brand new AAA games I would need to run them at 720p. But PUBG is SOOOOOO ""not optimised"" so I get 40 60 fps on 1080p. Very low and view distance medium. 85% screen scale just to get that sweet 60fps most of the time. I could definitely go to 100% screen scale and low. What the hell do people want. My GPU is at least 50% slower than 1050. I thought that It would be barely playable on 720p 70% screen scaling very low. I am suprised. Great game and I dare to say this VERY DECENT optimization.

2018-01-15,0,0,456,False,Not Recommended,The game is fun when you are matched with players that can speak your language I have noticed most players even in the north American servers are from China that creates a pretty big language barrier even if you both try to understand eachother. there has been a problem with cheaters from what I can understand and I have no doubt I see many death cams showing people hiding in a building or behind a mountain obly to come out and score an immediate headshot on me when i am nearly a mile away. Im not sure what the solution is exactly to fix this situation but I can tell the people at the top have very little respect for a majority of its customer base. Also the crates you get have basically rigged odds they are so low not many people will ever get anything that makes it worht investing hours into. Basically its a fun game if youre lucky to play with people from your own country or that can understand you at least and you are lucky enough not to get killed by a cheater. the gun play is fun graphics are all right though the game clearly still needs better optimization. I hope I can return in a month or so and give this game a thumbs up again. UPDATE This game is still fun in the actual gameply its self as long as you don't get matched with people that don't speak english when you play as a team but the big downfall of the game is the lack of content for $30 it sure is setup as if it were free to play any time you get a crate it almost always is one that requires a key and I cannot justify spending any real cash on this type of a game when they are treating the player base as if we are just a cash cow to be milked dry and thrown aside. still has problems with cheaters and hackers as well... it seems they don't care and never will care.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-26,0,0,526,False,Not Recommended,I have increasingly mixed feelings about this game the concept is great the gun play is solid if a bit sparse however I see the potential. At this time I would say wait before you decide to sink 100 hours into it. There is still so much to be done to make this game great. Some of my personal favourite issues are as follows 1. Laggy start parachute lag and rubber banding means almost 50% of the time you will be killed unarmed because the game can't decide where you landed.2. Engagment Lags Getting into to a gun fight almost 65% of time causes a frame drop and lag the game freezes for 1 second and when it finally responds you are dead...3. My game lags everytime a player is within my vicinity it's helpful to know a player is near by but it leads to problem 2.4. No local severs major lag as high as 500ms at times no good for an FPS can deal with 100 or 150 but anything higher is a death sentance unless you catch the player looting or unaware.5. Janky Physics Cars and People don't physics as expected... 6. Sound My own footsteps scare the sh*t out of me... And sound levels still seem completely unrealistic hearing a player stomp about like a disgrunted elephant in the building next door is not realistic...Now for the Pros 1. Great work has been done to improve on bugs and cheating2. Weapons feel real and have heft3. Very engaging and really sells the concept of survival4. Narrative is up to the player/players5. Replay and Death Cam are welcome editions6. One of the best co op games I've played great for teamwork requires focus and dedication7. Challenges the player to consider strategy and skill allows for growth and improvement.All in all I can say I think this will one day be one of the best games out but the current state leaves much to be desired. However I will recommend it to new players...__________________________________________________________________________UPDATED this t... after months/almost years of time and investment of time and energy this game just continues to disappoint.

After a year of playing PUBG in the beta and finished versions the $30 I paid for this game is overpriced.The desync is horrible being shot around corners and when not in view. The broken OC lobby with 50 minute que times the inaccuracy of hit boxes items dropping through the floor and going missing shooting a player when being killed at the same time results in no damage to the winning player car dynamics are poor broken sights on m24 rifle invisible players reappearing after parachute deployment cheating loot system is so low chance to drop a decent item that its near on criminal and the list goes on.The good? The first 100 200 hours were a blast. Intense and action packed with plenty to offer. This was a honey moon period for the game and the playerbase expected bluehole to optimize its servers and game to make it a real contender but this was not to be. Now with a playerbase that has begun giving up on the game bluehole is on its hand and knees trying to sweet talk us with a ""fix pubg movement"".

2017-09-30,0,0,1007,True,Recommended,So this is Playerunknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). Even though this game is in Alpha it feels more complete than other games that have been released as a full version. The Developers are constantly updating this working on new features and are trying to get rid of bugs.Speaking of bugs. This game has the habit to annoy you while you are gathering a team to get the game started. Very often you have to reload your game and the status of players is not shown correctly. (Has he clicked ready or not?)Let me say a few words about the game 1. The game is a fast paced (or slow in case you are up against 96 99 campers) multiplayer survival game. In it's core the game wants you to constantly move and forces fights vs. other players. There can only be one (or four) winner(s). You start with up to 99 enemies if the lobby is full.2. The map is great the landscape feels authentic and provides various locations to hide fight and of course loot. The conditions you are fighting in in terms of weather can be sunny rainy or misty. I believe nighttime and nightvision goggles as loot would be a great addition however some players leave the game lobby if it is raining for misty. There will be new maps and I can't wait to play in the sand.3. The loot that you can find ranges from normal clothing over weapons to grenades. The spawnsystem tries to place the loot at random locations so that sometimes you are fully geared within 2 minutes and other times you have a pan only. That is okay given the fact that you can go out seeking for more loot or hit someone with your pan grab his stuff etc. (You are probably dead before that or a lucky chap.)4. That blue hole circly thingy. After being thrown out of the plane and parachuting down to the island you will get notified that you now have a certain amount of time to get into the circle. Sometimes you are in sometimes you'll have to cross the entire island to get into it. It is random.PUBG can be a quick distraction if you want to play and have some action before you hop on to something else. (Quick sometimes equals 4 6 hours.) The real PUBG feeling starts kicking in when you are not alone. You can join or fill a random squad but that often results in them letting you loot just to abuse you as their mule and then killing you for the loot. Do not think it is always that way but it happens more often than I would like. I believe the Devs need to add a Voice system to the starting screen paired with the ability to get into a squad before going in. That way you know with whom you are going to be in a full squad. If you have not bought the game so far I can assure you it is okay. You can buy it. It is fun. There is loads of work to be done but even that does not make the game feel uncomplete.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-30,0,0,989,True,Recommended,It's a fun game that can make your heart beat real good when you're the 2 only guys left. This usually gets the blood pumping hard for me for about 10min after the match.But my problem with this game is the success sounds weird but it's true. At the start of the game they did a great job at optimizing the game and pump out good updates but now as the game has around 7million sales and 1million players at a time they know and think they are doing a great job and think they can slow down and start pumping out new content. Content is not needed at this moment imo they need to polish the game so much more fix small and big bugs and keep optimizing the gameHonest oppinion on this great game ing . I live in EU Norway and the ing NA servers are 100x smoother and better in every way. While EU is absolute . AS Servers work fine too. Hit reg is super inconistent the first 5mins of the match so the only way to play the game without lag is to stretch to the other side of the ing universe. You'd also think bluehole want's to make people play this game but that's an absolute lie. Got a message on discord and need to tab out? No worries but your screen will go black and you cant tab back inn again. My fav bug is when you try to hit play at times nothing happenes. So you gotta refresh your UI. But your buddies hit play and are wating for you so when you hit refresh UI they get put into the game while you get put into your own.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-07,0,0,281,False,Not Recommended,Heavy lost in interest in the game. I tried a match since they ve updated so much again and i can t fully support this game anymore. The company giving back to the community is great but the game itself seems like it was better about middle of their patches. I noticed a period of consistent hit detection and solid gameplay. Then they started patching in more stuff that seemed to ruin it. Their kill cams are extremely off or the opponents that typically kill me have a bot aim of some sort. Can t beat the excitement of getting somewhere and seeing a killcam that shows you 10 paces ahead of someone s sight only to die. On a positive note the new map did feel nice. On a negative note i don t know why someone wants to buy into a battle pass to get more crap. Seems like the game simply found a way to swindle some more money off the top before it goes all the way under. Edit.... with where the game has came still fun. How ever other games picking up the moth styles are proving that pubg will not have a stable server without rebuilding the game from the ground up... (enter ring of elysium *roe*). Even playing america to foreign servers proves a less de sync issue than what pubg has. My new recommendation is a 50/50. If it s on sale sure full price I wouldn t bother with it. old below STILL ENJOYING THE GAME and the server fixes have been AMAZING. A great KOTH style game and i've been hooked since i started playing it. the new patch updates that keep coming in are great. New weapons are apperciated mainly because the servers fixed. I have updated my desktop since initial purchase which helped alot and the most recent server fixes have made the game run smooth as butter. i maintain 80 easy. Highly enjoy this game. it truly does reward the those that know how to remain calm...assuming those people landed in a spot with firearms and amuniton. lmao. the game runs a little choppy with my proessor i have the listed bare minimal. but i have a upgraded one coming as well as a new MOBO and i expect the game to perform rather flawlessly. only change i would enjoy is the character being able to vault some things that are knee high to waist height. being a filthy casual i tend to mess up those jumps and get stuck behind a seemingly easy to pass barrier haha. anyone booting up for a first try my only suggestion is to scramble to the nearest house loot a firearm and gear and hit M to check the map and get your little buns to the playable area. if youre in it already then focus on surviving.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-17,0,0,585,False,Not Recommended,"First time playing this type of game and it's such an adrenaline rush!I'm not even mad when i get killed it's just such a rush everytime you encounter another group.The devs seem like they care about the game so far and the game is not too hard to get into.Would definitely recommend.Edit (31/10/2017)Pros + Wide variety of guns and modifications.+ Big map with decent map design.+ Fundamentally this is a great concept for variety and fun.+ Competetive but also allows for lots of casual fun.+ The unpredictable nature of the game through it's RNG Loot system.Cons Client Side Hit Detection. No regional server lock. Grass/trees and fog can easily be removed through game INI. The Mini 14 basically ignores the laws of any other gun thereby ruining all gun balance. Third person forces you to shoot with your right side and look for enemies on your right. Attacking an enemy by going/looking with your left side will give your enemy an upper hand as he/she can see you before you can see him/her. Guns will also hit a wide variety of things you never expected it to hit. Aim out a window? you're gonna hit the window frame 90% of the time. Laying on the ground shooting at the guy a tiny bit uphill? you'll only hit the ground infront of you. This games gun mechanics wants you to play it in first person if you play it in third person you will suffer. Ingame advertisements.Until these issues are resolved i cannot recommend this game anymore.Edit 15/11/2017After trying out the test servers and seeing the amount of improvements made to the game i can finally recommend it again! )Pros + Vaulting is amazing and game changing.+ Car sounds are way better now.+ Car handling is so much better now and bikes are no longer a death trap.+ Alot of audio has been improved to not hurt our hearing anymore.Edit 26/04/2018I've been wanting to get back into this game for a long time but the last 6 months have been so dead development wise that i've seen no reason to return. Money money money PUBG Corp seems obsessed with money to an extent where they are willing to kill their game for a quick payday. This game started out so well giving off the idea that they were working harder than any other Early Access game and that they were truly dedicated to releasing a great and finished game. But the game just amounts to the absolute minimum they have to do to make a game at this point. And they seem to be just fine with that as their priorities just seem to be to host E Sports tournaments and release skin after skin after skin to the game. ""People keep spamming ""Map Selection"" ""Region Lock"" Oh i got it! let's add skins to the guns and ban Reshade! D""I never even knew how depressing PUBG is to look at until they banned Reshade it ironically set a visual theme to the way i felt about the game at that point. The Desert Map This map was so amazing that people spammed ""Add map selection"" all over their every single steam update. They made a map so good that people were begging not to play it. I hated this map from day 1 it's impossible to drive in it and it's f**king huge. So if you thought PUBG was already endless running simulator then do we have the update for you! DThis map has tons of huge buildings with the most annoying rooms that takes years to loot. People camp their lives away in these buildings shooting you the second you drive anywhere near em. Meanwhile you can just pass by wondering which one of the 20 tall buildings they're sitting in.It honestly really made me appreciate the simplicity of the first map with all it's great spots that atleast felt somewhat balanced. If you get shot at whilst driving in Erangel there was often just 2 buildings the enemy could be in. Erangel also looks way better and has more iconic spots that you can actually visit without automatically losing the game. And you can often expect a certain type of game depending on where you land. This can barely be said about the Desert Map. The only thing you can safely assume about the Desert Map is that you will die in some BS way.One thing PUBG does care about though is being the only Battle Royale game on the market. They've been looking at the monopolies around the world and thought to themselves ""So if i just dominate the whole market by removing all competitors i can make bank from doing the absolute minimum? Where do i sign?!"". And so the lawyers were set free to hunt and several statements were made about the need for protection of ideas in the gaming world. Cause why would you make a great game and keep working on it when you can just be the only game in town?All of this just seems to show that PUBG Corp is too scared to compete especially since all their ideas are so simple and easy to copy. After seeing all the things Fortnite is doing with Battle Royale i'm having a harder and harder time seeing what's unique about PUBG. The ""realism"" often just seems to bug the game out immensely. And when there's a huge eco system for hackers in this game (cause of the steam market) a eco system that PUBG Corp themselves profit from aswell. (When they get paid for every single transaction of their ingame items.) and hackers therefore plague the game why would anyone care about realism?Watch me and my entire squad realistically insta die to Usain Bolt with a bolt rifle and see how much i care.PUBG needs to do something special that makes the game great and exciting again. But until they switch their focus to gameplay and away from micro transactions and E Sports tournaments for a broken game nothing will change.All of this sucks cause i used to enjoy this game alot but seeing it die out cause of their greed like this is incredibly annoying. Especially after the whole show of affection and love for gaming in general that they showed in the beginning of their Early Access. In the end PUBG was just like the rest of them a cash grab.Also you guys really can't pay artists for their artwork really? f**k this company.Edit 01/06/2018PUBG has for some reason decided to buff Frag grenades and every single top 5 battle is now decided by whoever has a frag grenade to throw at the other. The amount of BS deaths i've had to frag grenades at this point is making me quit this game for good. this game.Edit 15/06/2018I might be done with this game for good now this game is simply not fun anymore. Dying to some stupid bug or other BS is just not funny anymore.This game is so anti fun it's exhausting. You can't just mess around with friends cause you have to focus at all times looking at your sorroundings and always be prepared for the ton of campers that this game hosts.This game is such a camp fest it's insane. And for anyone who doesn't have a ton of time to play these games that is just a huge deal breaker.The game is also so incredibly high risk but at this point just really low reward.All the endings of this game is basically decided by grenades now. If you have a grenade you win.You can never relax you can never chill. All you can do is loot for 5 years and get shot by someone camping somewhere. And there is no way to survive this unless you play solo with a good headset and no background noise.The Time to kill in this game is so often legit 1 sec. And most of the time it's not even because the game is brutal. But instead because their servers are so incredibly s**t that you can be shooting at someone for 3 seconds but on their screen you only shoot at them for 1 sec. Hence why you suddenly receive 3 headshots in a second.This game is s**t competetively it's anti fun as f it's stressful as f it's greedy as f it's buggy as f it's just all around s**t and i'm so sick of it.F**k this game.Edit 11.

Its a mixture of in my opinion H1Z1 and ARMA III. With the difference being no stupid supple crates you need IRL money for and laggy as f**k servers (H1Z1) or no stupidly intense guys playing a stupidly intense semi realistic military battle royale (ARMA III). When you eventually go down from a straight up blast with a shotgun or a ""HOW DID HE DO THAT"" shot from a sniper rifle 1000m away you dont see a killcam enemy highlighted stats on how you died. Its just ""Oh you died this is what number you were and thanks for playing."" Which is frustrating since you cant really improve on what you did wrong. **The game is in early stages so any bugs that are currently in the game i wont complain about in this review.My high score comes from the amount of communication and teamwork it takes to survive in the dou (team of 2) gamemode or the squad (team of 4) game mode. I only have 2 friends with the game and when we squad up with the random we recive via matchmaking communication and teamwork are vital like crazy important to staying alive and being the last team left. Even on my solo games by myself i just have to think about every type of outcome that can happen with the 90+ other enemies that were dropped in the big play area around me. My summary?????????? If you want to get a game that is an FPS/Open World/Survival this game is pretty much for you it'll have you yelling because you died or cheering cause you sniped some guy across the field as he hopped into a motorcycle. My only note is try to get friends to play with you it makes the game much more intense or fun however you play with your friends.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-13,0,0,198,True,Recommended,I'm extremely satisfied with this game. I've played nearly 200 hours and I can honestly say that I only have one complaint and that is that the game needs to include 5 6 7 8 team Squad options. My friends and I frequently have to spit up into smaller groups when we really want to be on a giant team. Other than that I'm extremely satisfied and will continue playing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-19,0,0,668,True,Recommended,I extremely recommend this game especially if you can get a group of friends to play with. It is super addictive and competitive. After watching multiple streams of this game I decided to buy it and my laptop couldn't run it so I ended up custom building a PC just for this game and am at roughly 100 hours played now well worth it. Looting can be monotonous although. Also it has very few errors in my opinion for the stage it is in for development. They listen to fans and that's what counts the most we asked for more guns and we got them! Thompson and Mini14 gun. Players wanted a First person only mode mode they delivered. Developer connection with the fan base is fansastic and that in itself says alot about the direction this game is going in. As long as they keep this up this game is going to blow up faster than it already is. Fantastic game recommended!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-08,0,0,673,False,Not Recommended,This game is everything you want it to be but done poorly. In well built games you can learn to be better if you so wish. You can examine the mechanics of the game view replays and generally figure out how and why you died and what you need to improve upon. In Pube G you might reach a wall in your learning and find that the game is blocking you from that wall. You can't even see the wall because the game is in the way. You can't trust the replays because they don't represent even close to what actually happened. You can never be certain whether you ran the right way fast enough or anything because of desync. You can't even be sure that someone is hacking because of the absolute garbage way the game runs. All the feedback that the game gives you can't be trusted and that's a huge problem. Sadly this game deserves its negative rating.

2018-01-31,0,0,234,False,Recommended,Seit einiger Zeit ist die Karte Miramar in PUBG spielbar. Doch nicht alle Gamer sind damit glücklich. Nun überarbeiten die Entwickler die Karte komplett.Mehr als 20 Millionen verkaufte Exemplare und über zwei Millionen aktive Online Spieler täglich PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) und die darin zelebrierten Battle Royale Schlachten gelten als das Phänomen des Spielejahrs 2017. Nächster großer Meilenstein war die Veröffentlichung von Version 1.0 für PC am 20. Dezember 2017. Mit an Bord war auch die Wüsten Karte Miramar die bei vielen PUBG Spielern allerdings nicht so gut ankommt. Entwickler Bluehole hat nun auf die Kritik an der Map reagiert und nimmt mit einem kommenden Update massive Änderungen vor.PUBG Tuning für MiramarAktuell können PUBG Spieler den neuen Patch auf den Testservern ausprobieren. So gibt es auf der Miramar Karte nach dem Update mehr Gebäude und Unterstände zum Schutz. Außerdem finden Sie dann auch mehr Offroad Wege für einfachere Fahrzeug Touren durch die staubige Pampa. Am Waffen und Ausrüstungs Spawn legen die Macher ebenfalls Hand an Während in manchen Arealen nun deutlich mehr Gegenstände liegen ist die Ausbeute in anderen Gebieten hochwertiger. Ferner testet Bluehole in dem Update neue Anti Cheating Maßnahmen. Ob die Änderungen fruchten bleibt allerdings abzuwarten. Sie haben PUBG noch nie gespielt? COMPUTER BILD SPIELE verrät Ihnen im Test wie sich der Shooter nach Patch 1.0 schlägt.Willkommen in Miramar!Wichtigstes Merkmal von PUBG 1.0 ist zweifelsohne die neue Multiplayer Karte mit dem klangvollen Namen Miramar . Analog zur weiterhin enthaltenen ersten Map Erangel umfasst auch sie eine Fläche von 64 Quadratkilometern. Das war s dann allerdings mit den Gemeinsamkeiten denn das Szenario ist ein gänzlich anderes. Statt auf einer stark bewaldeten einst vom russischen Militär besetzten Insel in Osteuropa kämpfen Sie diesmal in einer gebirgigen von Mexiko inspirierten Wüstenlandschaft ums nackte Überleben. Zugegeben das Setting mag auf dem Papier etwas karg und langweilig klingen entpuppt sich in der Praxis aber als erstaunlich abwechslungsreichHauptgrund hierfür sind die vielfältigen topografischen Gegebenheiten sowie etliche Sehenswürdigkeiten. Im Unterhaltungsviertel der westlich gelegenen Industriestadt El Pozo etwa befindet sich eine sogenannte Luchadores Arena wo es in den ersten Spielminuten häufig zu blutigen Faustkämpfen kommt. Begibt man sich von dort in östliche Richtung folgt das nächste Highlight ein verlassenes Gangster Anwesen (Hacienda Del Patrón) inklusive Schwimmbecken Hubschrauberlandeplatz und unweit entferntem Flugfeld wo Kriminelle früher höchstwahrscheinlich einen Drogendeal nach dem anderen abgewickelt haben.Aber auch eine gigantische Silbermine ein heruntergekommenes Elektrizitätswerk eine marode Wasseraufbereitungsanlage ein rostiger Fahrzeugfriedhof ein staubiger Rangierbahnhof ein düsteres Tunnelsystem ein ramponiertes Hochsicherheitsgefängnis verschiedene in Mitleidenschaft gezogene Kirchen sowie eine mysteriöse Ausgrabungsstätte zeugen von der Kreativität der Leveldesigner.Nicht zu vergessen die beiden riesigen von Meteoriteneinschlägen geformten Krater von denen der östlich gelegene den Blick auf eine im Zentrum zerschellte Passagiermaschine freigibt. Großartig was Bluehole hier abliefert! Wolke sieben für ScharfschützenWer bereits viele Stunden auf der Ursprungskarte Erangel verbracht hat dem fällt außerdem die im Vergleich spürbar gestiegene Dichte an Siedlungen und Städten auf. Heraus sticht dabei insbesondere das riesige südöstlich des Kartenzentrums gelegene Los Leones mit seinen zahlreichen nicht fertig gestellten Wolkenkratzern. Da viele von ihnen über schwindelerregende Treppenkonstruktionen verfügen fühlen sich hier vor allem Scharfschützen pudelwohl. Gleichzeitig stellen die unzähligen Gebäudeansammlungen der Miramar Karte eine hervorragende Gelegenheit dar die Möglichkeiten des überarbeiteten Fortbewegungssystems auszuloten. Zur Erinnerung Bisher waren Spielfiguren in PUBG unter anderem nicht in der Lage durch geöffnete Fenster zu klettern über mittelgroße Hindernisse zu springen oder sich an Mauern hochzuziehen. Das Update auf Version 1.0 fügt all das nun hinzu und sorgt damit gleichzeitig für deutlich mehr Dynamik im Spielablauf.Sie sitzen unbewaffnet im ersten Stock eines Hauses fest und hören Ihren bestens ausgestatteten Feind bereits kommen? In der Early Access Fassung kam eine solche Situation meist einem Todesurteil gleich. Jetzt aber suchen Sie sich einfach ein geeignetes Fenster im Raum und wuchten sich mit einem eleganten Sprung ins Freie.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

WHY? IT NEEDS TO UPDATE. but hey. That's fine. it means they must be really on top of their bugs and problems right? hooo boy WRONG common and consistent bugs through every patch so far include but are not limited to black screen once you load into the plane preventing you from dropping getting stuck underground at random times being forced back to the lobby every once in a while and needing to reload the title screen multiple times praying that maybe THIS time the play button will actually respond. Update since the institution of paid loot boxes I can't actually recommend this game. It's still technically in early access as far as I'm aware.

2017-07-09,0,0,148,True,Recommended,Great game overall. There are some kinks to work out but from what I've seen the developers are active in building this game. I hope I dont regret giving this a positive review but I can't lie even in the current state this game is fun to play even if you are just hiding for 10 mins waiting for someone to come to you. Hopefully this game will just wow me more once it comes out of Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-09,0,0,33,True,Recommended,Be prepped for lag make sure you optimize the game to the best of your ability. Otherwise really fun game with friends. It is in early access so I thought it would just be another H1Z1 mess but it surprisingly holds up really well. I wasn't really into these sort of games because I was afraid of dying getting scared etc. But the game is actually pretty fast paced so you will constantly be thrown into another match to try again so I'd say it definitely is fun in that department. Also the servers are quite good and even though there are 100 player matches my mid tier internet holds up fine. TL DR 8/10 game but make sure you have a decent computer and its more fun with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,19,True,Recommended,TL DR Buy it! 5/7 two thumbs up etc.The battle royale game done to perfection. 100 people go in 1 comes out victorious. (or 2 or 4 if you're playing Duos or Squads )If you don't like having your heart racing from adrenaline after playing video games then you should go ahead and pass on this game because it will get your heart going almost every single match.I haven't been this compelled to play a game since Modern Warfare first came out and I played that game online for 500+ hours. Not only is it amazing to play it's engrossing to watch others play. If you're unsure about it check out any of the endless people streaming it on Twitch. (Specifically though I'd recommend giving Edberg or SombreroGG a watch.) Yes it's as fun as it looks better even.There is a bit of a learning curve with the game especially if you're more used to playing twitch shooters but if you've spent any time at all playing CS or ARMA then you'll find a lot of the skills (epecially team related) will transfer over. PUBG definitely leans more to the ARMA side of shooters.While there are issues from time to time with the servers ranging from minor lag to unplayable connection problems it's rare enough and finding a new game is easy enough that it doesn't hamper the enjoyment of this phenomenal game.And yes as of this writing (7/9/17) there is only one map available. I promise it doesn't impede the playability at all. The map is 8km by 8km with tons of areas and terrain to learn. Through a little RNG on top of that and the one map alone is worth dozens and dozens of hours of play. That said if one map isn't enough more maps are in the works with a desert map being teased as up next.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Biggest issue is that the developer trying to squeeze every penny out of their player base. Selling the game for a premium price new loot boxes every month season pass (with timed rewards) and now they are talking about having a price for custom games. It's hard to not be cynical about this game and I would only recommend the game if you read literally nothing about it and only play it like a few times a month unfortunately there's no real competitor at the time of writing that is doing the authentic style battle royale.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My game still randomly crashes server lag is not uncommon and desync is still an issue. The fact that this game is 30 dollars and fun is the only reason i can reccomend it.That was my original review back in late december now that i have played the game a bit more i have more to say.Since then all bluehole has to with this game is add some buildings and to the desert map change where you spawn in the pre lobby and fix rubberbanding. You might think ""oh wow they fixed rubber banding?"" Don't get too excited because desync is worse than ever. You will die getting behind walls many times in this game and when you go to look at your deathcam it will show your oppenent shooting empty space and killing. Not to mention the tons and tons of hackers and chiese players destroying the servers (#regionlockchina). On top of that they're now adding crates you can only open with keys because that's what everyone wants.

2017-09-20,0,0,364,True,Recommended,"I bought this game for myself and a friend I saw a lot of people hyping it up and ignoring the hype was pretty hard but I held out for quite a while. I want to preface this by saying that I am TERRIBLE at engaging in firefights in this game. The guns have heavy recoil when firing full auto you have to really pick your battles a lot more carefully than in most popular FPS games. The learning curve seems a little steep if you're used to playing only CSGO CoD and Battlefield like myself. But it's so rewarding to get kills in here. Whether you choose a more aggressive approach or a more stealthy approach the latter is how I have taken to playing I stay away from large towns and hit small clusters of houses on the outskirts and shacks along the way so getting the ""best"" setups is a little harder but staying low and non confrontational until the restricted zone forces you into an engagement can be super tense and the various strategies you can employ are keeping the replay value higher than most other games these days. After 12 hours straight in one day of owning it I can definitely say that I'm hooked and continuing to improve will be a joy for me. This game isn't perfect but it's a solid take on the battle royale concept and I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a change from the average FPS. This game has potential to be a true 10/10 if the concept is expanded on in the final release and the performance issues are fixed (I have an i7 7700k and an R9 390 I should not be getting dips into the single digits no matter how rare. )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Since it's in ""Early Access"" this means the game is bound to have several glitches and not be a finished as some Triple A titles would be like Call of Duty Battlefield etc you get my point The game is updated with weekly server updates and monthly content drops all of which have been free thus far and i assume they will keep it that way The map is a decent size but it lacks character. By this i mean you either play with game at day time with clear skies or with rain. I'm not to sure how a night time based map would do but it's something i would like to see put on the test servers Side note to my previous point the game also comes with a second download which is for a test server. For those who don't know a test server is a place the Dev's can implament new items and game mechanic's without affecting the core game kinda like a vitural world. Come here if you want to try out new weapons attachments items vehicles etc. Don't compare this game to H1Z1 they are similar but i personally think Player Unknown does the Battle Royal style much better andmore realistic then H1Z1. Car physics and player mechanics are more like real life compare to an arcady style. I.e you jump out of a fast moving car you will take lots of damage same with hitting tree's or terrian.So overall i think this is a great game to play with friends i wouldn't reccomend this game to people who only play Solo i dont think you will enjoy this as much as other solo games but that's for you to choose.If you have any other personal questions just add me on steam or comment on my profile saying you want to know more indepth about the game and i will surely respond ASAP.

Also it often feels like it's not always about skill but rather about luck. I can't complain too much about that however since it's good to have variation and such. To be honest the devolopers seem greedy as hell with a steep price on their game loot boxes and cosmetics being the only goal to work towards being purchasable in the marketplace and being expensive as hell in game.

I LOVE IT! yes it has its issues but its what you expect with an early access game. if youre wanting a pvp based game BUY THIS! Playerunknown has created a masterpiece that can be expanded onto more into something truly remarkable! I hope one day Player unknowns creates an survival adaption to this game (like dayz) as i would buy it DAY1. if youre looking for a game you can sink hours into this is one of many games to get if youre into pvp games.Pros Very fun Realistic Has Most features from Others games but better Fresh.Cons There is quite a few bugs and glitches something we like to call paint mode where the houses havent loaded in correctly meaning youre stranded until it loads. Lagging issues meaning ive had to lower my settings Lack of character content. the odd crash now and then.Dont let the cons put you off from this game this is honestly a great game with such great potential! support devs like PlayerUnknown as he/she has listened to fans and created a game for all to enjoy!

2017-05-16,0,0,142,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds dives you into a massive map from a plane with over 100+ players at the current stage of the game. You begin by going into the safe zone whilst the players load in during this time you will be generally calling out the pre order or being a snnnnaaakeee.The goal of the game is too survive as long as you can or ultimately become the winner winner chicken dinner you will begin by everyone in the game put into a plane and having to drop out over the field at your choice. Throughout the map there are weapons attachments first aid items and vehicles for your needs. A plane will also drop off elite items every time the radios decreases as well with no need for micro transactions to acquire just usually ends in a death pool. Each time you start a new game a radius around the map will appear with a large circle the goal is to stay within the main circle with every few minutes closing in the design of this is to keep players constantly aware that they need to maintain in the area of influence so their isn't just a stalemate across the map of people constantly camping.If you are an experienced royale player or new this type of gameplay it is quite a blast you can solo que duo or have up to a group of four others. Personally I feel the game is more fun with others however the options are there. Whether you are a careful player by sneaking into houses and taking people out or holding down T and blasting Ride of the Valkyries their is a lot of fun to be have. Their are a few bugs however weapons not being equipped stuck on doors or the rare crash however these are generally rare from my Experience. My system specs will be bellow and I currently have the game on High with AA at the lowest have no idea whats going on their but it tanks the frames (most likely MLAA). I am currently getting 70 80 FPS most times crashes down like hell though during the initial plane drop however.Patches are generally implemented weekly with improvements and extra additions such as hardcore mode soon to come.

But after playing it it felt very repetitive. It was fun when you actually got to fight an enemy but for the most part that never happened to me. I would just land and then see no one for 10+ minutes. Also the game consistently lagged making the few fights you get into infuriating since you think you're shooting someone when in reality you've been dead for a couple of seconds.

I get above 60FPS and the game feels like you are playing on 20FPS. Like I use to have a bit of fun on this game before the abundance of hackers who literally will headshot you as soon as you leave the plane. They seriously dont hide the fact that they are hacking. PUBG releases updates that only break the game more with constant lag spikes glitched cars that will blow up as soon as you get in them the entirety of the parachute system is nothing less then cancer. The devs are not fixing this game. But fixing the game doesnt matter if you can throw out an update with more cosmetic items. Cosmetic items are good but why cant we get what we are asking for... better optimization less glitches/bugs region locking China seriously the usual NA server contains about 60 percent of hackers or atleast people with crazy pings.

2017-05-21,0,0,153,True,Recommended,Battlegrounds is the most excellent battle royale game out there as I'm typing this. Here's what happens a hundred players drop from a plane on an island to scavenge for loot and fight to be the last man (or squad) standing. It's an exciting survival experience that blows the survival genre out of the water. Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is successful because it brings the excitement of survival games without the biggest faults. The game is based on separate shorter matches instead of semi permanent servers. Every player starts off every match on a plane parachuting to the ground with nothing but the clothes on their back. Just like a survival game scavenging is a heavy feature but there is a finite goal to acquire weapons and be the last man standing. You are still building your character from scratch it's just greatly accelerated from the standard survival game. The thrill of the hunt feeling is still there and even more concentrated. You don't lose hours worth of progress when you die you lose ten minutes of looting and exciting skirmishes. The process becomes purposeful constant fun instead of an arduous buildup broken up with small amounts of action. Player Unknown's Battlegrounds provides all of the fun exciting parts of the survival experience but removes the rest that drive people away.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v URT9cvllIm8,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-25,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,tl dr Luck over skill not worth the frustration Success depends too much on luck in so many aspects What loot you'll find or how the kill zone is moving is absolutly vital. It's not even a matter of skill. The player with the better equipment usually wins over the player with less valuable stuff in the first half of the match. (So if you are looking for a fair fight go look elsewhere.) Since this game rewards camping so much (which is vital in the second half of the match despite the need of moving from area to area) snipers are most of the time overpowered. If you did not manage to find a good scope and a decent rifle your chances of winning are very small. This produces many frustrating moments and eventually the lack of fun. And this is the main problem of PUBG Frustration gets bigger than fun. This is very sad beacuse PUGB has many good elements and you'll tend to come back to it for a quick round or two but then you get to feel it again... frustration is bigger than fun.What could make PUBG better in my opinion? Looting is an intrinsic part of the game but it would help to start with some equipment e.g. a fully loaded pistol and a backpack or/and to get rid of all scopes bigger then the x2 scope. This could work nicely.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In my honest opinion this game is NOT worth the 30 dollars. Edit It's almost like this game got even worse after each update. The cheaters are becoming more frequent and every single time I land in densely populated areas it's always the cheater that comes up on top. Every game unless i'm lucky and someone kills or I kill the cheater from behind all you will hear are broken shots that somehow hit you from inside a building without any windows. I wish I knew how much bad this game was going to get . Would not recommend until they fix the game. Loot has been worse with each update too.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is still unfinished all updates are simply adding more adverts and ways to make money such as ""season passes"" and loot crates with major game issues not being addressed (server performance hacking bugfixing etc).Hacking is slightly less prevalent than it has been in the past but still around there is no region locking meaning those looking to troll with hacks join whatever region they like there is no modding support as was promised before release and in general this appears to be a very shoddy development by a group who don't know what they're doing.However I can't claim I haven't got my money's worth literally more than that actually considering the money I have made off of crate sales but no I strongly recommend against this game it leaves a bad taste in your mouth after you realise how terribly developed it is and you will not make money off the crates anymore unless you're very lucky.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,0,0,85,True,Recommended,This game is very fun. One of my favourite features is that you can add attachments to weapons unlike H1Z1 KOTK.Also I feel as if PUBG is more realistic which personally gets me on the edge of my seat where as H1Z1 has a m ore Arcade type feeling to it.One of my least favourite things about PUBG is that because its a relatively new release and in early access it doesnt have much to it other than trying to become last man standing. New rank feature on leaderboards and if you do end up becoming the last man standing the rewards are pretty pathetic (couple of hundred coins). Other than that its a great game. Dont be worrying about what I said negatively as this can be fix in further updates and as the game progresses.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is the game that brought me into PC gaming. The only reason this game reviews are bad is the same reason why lot of other games die! Ther community mainly game community! All the gaming community is are people who have no knowledge of game devolperment. Yes Bluehole needs hurry and get thier problems sorted out asap which seems they might be doing. But the game community can easily ruin any game (You know like Undertale Day Z etc). So you go in this game think on how this game has potential and still does.

They also don't give a crap about their own consumers and product.Heres a list of why 1. cheaters are still present and no efforts are done...or not enough.2. Not racist here but chinese players in US servers...seriously. How to combat that ? Holy crap a game like medal of Honor in the 90's found a solution and its a simple one...Jesus Christ guys...wtf.3. Game was released in a broken state and was filled with bugs. even today after 100m$ worth of revenue the problems are still present. Its mind blowing how this companies managment only thinks not about money but how to suck of life out of everyone.4. Microtransactions are present. I hate it...IN ANY FORM.5.

This may sound but for a person like me who is suicidal its ing amazing. You got a nice hunk of weapons a ton of cars and and a big map. I heard people getting banned for being falsely accused of stream sniping but for a person like me who struggles to get kills I think im fine but if you have the game watch out for some streamers that suck.

The game runs smoothly untill i am near someone and i then get like 20 fps and cant kill anyone unless i have a shoutgun and blindly fire.

2018-07-21,0,0,561,False,Recommended,The game is fun the gunplay is great the format works. There are admittedly some issues with lag and probably desync and the game does crash more often than it should. Having said that I can't believe people are so negative about the game. It's a fun game does its job has offered some decent updates and the new map is a great addition (now I sometimes even play a solo round thanks to it) and there is another one coming later. The event pass thing I don't really understand but I have never even considered buying it and cannot see how that has anything to do with the functionality/quality of the game. It has no effect on gameplay. Furthermore the game has paid itself back and given another one for free by letting you sell the crates you get by just playing the game. And finally it's not even a full price game (which it definitely shouldn't be either). It's a decent game with some issues here and there. It's not perfect quality and I do hope they keep improving the game but I've got about 400h on it having loads of fun with my friends and it has paid itself back in the meanwhile. It is sometimes a bit difficult to understand the requirements people have with games. You see people with 2000+ h and yet they are unsatisfied? I can't see that as anything other than arrogance. TL DR Is it perfect? No it has some issues and crashes too often. Is it Fun? Yes. Is it worth the money? To me it is and actually it's already paid itself back through steam marketplace anyway.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You jump into the game and run across the map to get into the circle just to get shot by the guy thats been there the whole time waiting for you.

2018-02-03,0,0,58,False,Recommended,We've all wanted a standard game just battle royal. Collect things and survive as long as possable. other games protrayed this but never lived up to it's tittle like this game does. It's best to say that PUBG PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a game that will most definetly reach new hieghts as time passes. The combat in this game is like any other FPS and the fact that you can switch between first and 3rd person in an instant makes the combat even more better! I love this game because I always wanted a game where you can simply jump in and survive (rather than colelct materials and build a base...because theirs not much combat going on). But this game is truely remarkable. It's a must get! I know their are other games out their like Fortnite which contributes the same genre but this game will always have a serious approach to the 'Battle Royal theme' and that's what keeps it standing. 9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

DO NOT BUY.Still garbage perfomance is still pretty garbage since the Devs dont even bother any more.Hackers ahaha litterally every game they will stalk you look at you through walls aimbot not so common but still around. Thier wallhacks are so easily noticeably they dont even hide it any more specially with all the radar going around.Server lag/netcode still the worst in any online game in history behind a wall? Doesnt matter you dead.I would not recommend this game to anyone ever. By FAR the worse excuse for a multiplayer game ever the devs simply do NOT care about anything apart from making money.The devs for some reason in thier overly ways decided to follow blizzard ban wave once in a while. While all fine for an MMO doesnt really work vs aimbots and walls.Early access was next to no hackers no they just everywhere in every game there is no point wasting your money on this poor excuse for a game go buy something worth playing dont waste your time on a pure moneymaking game. Also lootboxes are pay to open even though cosmetic devs lied yet again about any microtransactions.Want more proof that this garbage is a pure money maker?

I love to surprise foes by moving quietly in their house and shotgun their face.

2017-07-08,0,0,286,True,Recommended,FIRST experience I landed quickly ran into a building upstairs and grabbed a shotgun. I heard footsteps below me so I shut the door and waited. The door opened and a body was perfectly in my crosshair BANG first kill in pubg has got me hooked! PEOPLE have been complaining about lag FPS and or hit registry...but I don't know why. I have played 5 matches and not experienced that at all. So the problem might be within those specific reviewers' CPU GPU specs and/or internet connection.OVERALL it is what it is A battle royale with average combat system with decent looking graphics. The timeframe seems spaced out to an average pace it isn't rushed nor does it feel slow. Getting into a match is pretty fast which for what this game is is pretty good. PRICE might be a bit high for early access but overall is worth it if you rationalize price to entertainment value. THIS game or a battle royale type should be in everyone's library.

2017-09-08,0,0,193,True,Recommended,"It's no secret that in the field of ""Battle Royale"" games there aren't an overabundance of choices in the market but PUBG is at the top of the heap for sure. Sure the game has all the same game mechanics that have become standard 100 players parachute in a mad scramble for loot ensues and as the lethal circle of gas / energy closes in fights become more and more intense as the dwindling number of players kill each other for the chance to eat chicken dinner at the top of pile of vanquished enemies.But PUBG has something more while H1Z1 s fast paced neon splashed arcade style unreality is definitely a good time it lacks the depth to truly immerse you into the world they ve created. The rules of the game may be similar but at the heart PUBG is a much different experience one that draws you deeper into the well crafted reality it creates and in so doing provides some of the most intense heart pounding gameplay available.Like any early access game there are wrinkles that need smoothing out (the details of which you can read in the reviews surrounding this one I m sure) but the overall experience of the game is solid and the core gameplay is dead on. However in my 100+ hours of gameplay (at the time of this review) none impacted my game enough that I stopped having fun playing the game. This is a game in an early state but the developer is highly involved and updating regularly and the community of players is large passionate and highly vocal (a must have for a game that wants to stand the test of time. No one knows a game better than its die hard players).TLDR PUBG is immersive challenging high intensity fun. Ever in the current pre release state it s worth buying if you like skill intensive tactical shooters / battle royale games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Amazing game truely is. I'm not a fan of battle royale type games but I love this one!Pros +Good graphics even on very low+massive games (100 I think is max)+Instant queue+Gets your heart pumping (sometimes with rage)+Very Fun solo or with others+Good bullet mechanics+Huge map+And moreCon Some bugs (Not game breaking though) Sometimes buildings don't load so you can see inside of them and see anyone clear as day and you can even shoot them (not sure it does any damage but it's there)Overall 9.5I'm sure there are some more negatives but I havn't encountered them yet. This game is amazing for it's price totally worth. It gets your adrenaline running and it's AWESOME. This game does require strategy so don't expect to run in gun blazing or even decide to camp. The zones get smaller and smaller forcing players into a smaller area so camping isn't really a good idea unless you have area to camp in (middle of safe zone). I was skeptical buying this game because I don't like Battle Royale game types but this definitely changed my mind. The game isn't for everyone but I really do enjoy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After exiting the plane and landing on the ground the textures will not load and the game freezes. I have uninstalled and re installed the game with no success.

2017-08-10,0,0,101,True,Recommended,This game hits all the points for online shooter with friends or solo. There is no boring start where we all know who is using what gear no one knows what anyone will get until you hit the ground and start running. The gameplay is intense in the sense that you have no map saying HE IS RIGHT THERE! and you cannot necessarily see the guy about to ventilate your dome piece. If you enjoy the challenge of finding gear and outsmarting apponents through maneuver and engagement this is the game for you. I have seen more matches come to a close based on smoking apponents out (literally) and waiting until the right time to hit them for the win. A must have title for die hard shooter fans and a must try for new blood into the genre. Pros Great graphics Decent selection of weapons Large map (at least enough that it does not feel crowded in the beginning with 100 players) Regular effective updates Solid gameplay and reactive controls. The added Horns to the game 10/10 will charge across the bridge blairing the horn until shot to death again. Cons Graphics settings ( go ahead and put the grass and foliage as low as you can you may be in tall grass hidden with your 1080 to all ready to strike but billy with his dads outdated laptop sees your dumbass lying in an open field with nothing around you.) Weapons can be spotty with damage sometimes you will shoot someone once and drop them other times you will shoot the out of them and they will kill you. (it is alpha and the system is still being balanced) Vehicle mechanics are hilarious hit a buggy with your buggy and fly into the air sailing 5 map grid squars to plunge to your death 10/10 will do agian. Overall if you can get over the minor hangups which come with a well developed pre release game this is the game for you this is the game i stream and play the most with friends at the moment. We have had many hours of hilarious deaths and stressfull butt clenching wins. See you guys in the battle royale!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,365,True,Recommended,"A lot of people are boo hooing BlueHole for 'breaking a promise' on microtransactions. They're entitled to their opinions but BlueHole's microtransactions don't affect anything. They give some flavor potential for those that want to spend some money on the potential for cool skins but you aren't forced to buy anything that would make you more efficient in game. To negatively review a game because you felt entitled to a ""microtransaction free environment"" is petty and childish. The addition of these transactions literally affects nothing at all. Another lot of people don't like third person. You should know up front that this game is 3P and that affects gameplay in a major way for people expecting to play it like a FPS. If you're in a house and concerned about someone peeking you use your ears position yourself intelligently listen for doors opening or footsteps.

I've moved to fortnite because of the fact that because of the laziness of the developers and slow pace of the game it seemed so much more apealing than a buggy and laggy piece of The sevrers are along with the netcode because lets face it no one knew batte royal games specifically PUBG would blow up so they didn't code for that. If they completely redid this game in a better engine with better net code got decent servers and made this game a bit more fast paced because the mid game is terrible then you could have a good game on your hands.

2017-11-25,0,0,327,False,Not Recommended,This game triggered me to the point of looking up my early access review where I recommend this game and deleting it / Here's why 1. The game is so janky! First I thought it was cuz of the early access but nope. It feels like you are playing against the game... There is this delay from when you press 'w' and the character actually starts running(No its not my keyboard I've a mechanical one). Vaulting animation takes way too much time and even jumping feels and looks odd in this game!2. Event Pass Really PUBG? You gonna charge 10$ for 4 weeks for a system you literally ripped right off fortnite in which it's got 10 weeks give the best skins but for limited amount of time AND ALSO CHARGE FOR YOUR SKINS! Either be overwatch where you get all skins free and obtainable by gameplay(Not keys) or be Fortnite and remove ing LOOTBOXES!3. Gameplay You know you have a problem when your mobile port gets better ping and overall runs better than the PC version! Console version is a joke and even on PC it crashes freezes to the point where you have to restart your PC!4. Connectivity I get 30ping on mobile playing PUBG but the pc version where I actually paid money to buy the game. Money they can use to get better servers runs like 5. Cheaters So many damn cheaters it frankly makes the game a joke! I was getting 2 cheaters a day until I decided to uninstall and haven't installed it since /Verdict Had a lot of potential when it was in early access but the moment they released this mess of a game it showed that the devs had no intentions of adding any sort of polish to the games mechanics and the drop in the player count shows.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

YESYou can understand where this is going...I will list the pros and cons here + Really fun with friends you can get to really funny situations+ Realistic battle experience with recoil bullet drop shooting modes (single auto burst) bullet speeds and sounds (if the speed of the bullet is faster than sound you first feel the shot and then hear it)+ Kind of good graphics (on high settings)+ Exciting battle situations Lacks a lot of optimization (even on high end systems) A lot of bugs Cheaters (although I never seen one my self a lot of people did) More focus on in game transactions like cases and event pass than on fixing bugs and optimizingOverall the gameplay is very fun but the 30$ that you pay for this buggy game are not worth it. I think that the game just fell into the wrong hands and they are just ruining it. This game had so much potential. HAD.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-30,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun no doubt about that. But here is a solo guys review. I have no friends who play this so I always have to play with randoms which I don't mind doing apart from the fact I hardly ever get people with mics. Even when I do get someone with a mic it's a 50/50 chance they're either terrible or they're just there to troll. So in my opinion either play with friends or only play solo games. As for their matching system. It seems the devs of this game are just doing it for the money. I read they're working on climbing instead of the current bugs? The amount of Squad or Due games I have joined and only to be put by myself is stupid. It says it is a full game but I am solo on Squad? That's just stupid. Overall Good game have friends to play with or only play solo. As of Jul the game is Hitreg is awful the game is just super laggy so until they make this game more playable I do NOT recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-02,0,0,795,False,Not Recommended,Update3 Winner Winner Chicken Dinner too bad the game doesn't live up to its own memes...I am impressed at how bluehole is not capable of fixing years old issues and going further by adding new issues and making everything worse!PUBg have added 2 new feature to make money they now allow bots to voice spam announcements about bots in game and you have to cope with it since you cannot mute a particular teammate.The other feature is it takes roughly 20 minutes + ( https //i.imgur.com/WwdCj8g.jpg ) to find a FPP game on SA / NA servers during week day for battle royale.I've tried coming back to see if things would be better(played little over 2 weeks) but I guess its finally time to graduate from PUBg forever and move into a real game where the publishers and/or developers actually care about the game and not just releasing gambling crates to monetize it.And yes I did spend money on PUBg keys which I now regret doing so.Update2 Another very annoying issue found 05/14/2018 they are updating the game too frequently(every 2 days? maybe daily at times) and you have to close the game update to play again.Update Started playing again today 05/06/2018 after a long hiatus only to see the game not only did not improve but got worse... they added 2 of the featuers I've requested below to retain the matchmaking options and being able to select a map still its just not enough... They keep taking the game in the wrong direction... how sad it was a good game. Too many Asians that are unable to speak or understand English and insist on playing at South and Central/North America servers.Alright I am done with this game tired of getting teammates that are unable to speak or understand English every single game.As I can see you already lost 600k player base and it will continue to drop if u dont solve this issue!Because of the above my routine to play a single match was checking players name for things like xin qin xao bao too many numbers in name(for some reason Chinese and Vietnamese like to express their names with numbers) if those are found back to lobby and repeat. Usually takes around 10 tries to find a team with people who can actually speak and understand English.Downside is I lose more time finding a match with teammates that can communicate rather than playing the game which is a very bad experience. Server busy and reconnect required after every single game which is very annoying and sometimes u need to click reconnect several times for it to work or restart the lobby. For some reason it will some times change you from NA/SA to AS servers for no reason which is again very unpleasant. Match fails to ready up and requires you to restart the lobby to work again. Why does it need to reconnect every time after a match is beyond my understanding why not just keep the user connected at all times while they are playing and only disconnect them when AFK for longer than 5 minutes while not playing any match! No FPP mode on South and Central America server for DUO. No option to keep the last selected option for the next match for example if I am alone and was doing SQUAD/FPP I have to re select every single time. No option to select which map I wish to play. some times I want to practice a single map and it keeps rotating between both maps a very unwanted behavior. There is no ability to mute a specific team mate during game play there should be a mute button next to their name at the team list. Some times there are racist people or people playing music or that refuse to set their microphone to push to talk and keep making noises making it impossible to hear footsteps or have a pleasant experience in game. The list of issues goes on but these are the main points I want to see addressed before I can provide a positive feedback for this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-06,0,0,527,False,Not Recommended,Could be way better. As you know de synch is still an issue. Somehow you can put 3 shotgun shells into someones face and they can kill you in 1 punch. If you like to constantly replace your mouse keyboard and headphones from rage caused by game then this is the game for you. Updates come extremly slow and is on par with pokemon go as far as release schedule 2 years in we finally have trading. something the game was advertised to have from the begininng Not to mention that there is hackers who play regularly and get banned and they create a new acct continue cheating and transfer purchase to new acct. Vehicles react in abnormal ways. They motorcycle hits a pebble and pulls a full speed stoppie and kicks you off vehicle to die. Guns glitch causing ADS issues with terrible clipping from map causing your avatar to shake and glitch giving away your position. Would rather play cuisine royal because at least it is polished more graphically although game play is clunky still does not cause same rage as pubg.Not to mention the only way you can get customizable character clothing but at a cost of real money to open 90% of the loot boxes you recieve by purchasing boxes with earned in game currency. Maybe if there was an option to buy keyless boxes separated from premium boxes would be better but not even that is an option The biggest streamers for this game are as well over and fedup with this game and publicly denounce it. My guess is the next 3 updateas and the new map stated to be released winter this year will probably cost money like an expansion pack. In my best opinion you can tell that the company is trying to make as much money as the physically can without doing anything to earn it. Heres some new content that if you want access to you must complete all these quests and pay 9.99 for a month pass.One suggestion i would say to make in game change for the spawn situation. How about we air drop and for the first 2 5 minutes of game you can respawn randomly where there is no one currently looting. That way the long wait for a game to start isn't at odds with a very short game caused by poor loot or slow loading of the game. After that time has passed you no longer respawn and must restart a game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Oh and be sure to mock your fallen teammates mercilessly for doing something stupid (it's required in the terms of service).

2018-01-07,0,0,1093,False,Not Recommended,I have no idea what they did to the game. According to leaderboards I'm in the top 2% on solo in NA servers. The ballistics changes don't account for the incredible decline in accuracy. I used to love this game. I used to be decent. Not amazing but pretty good. Ever since 1.0 I hit about 20% of the shots I used to and almost every game I'll be shooting at someone crosshair directly on them at 100m shoot 10 times and get 0 hits.If I just sucked at the game I'd be like okay I'm just not good. I suck at a lot of games. But before 1.0 guns felt relatively reliable. I knew that if I put my crosshair on my target and shot I'd hit them. Now all this game does is frustrate me.I don't know what they did but they 100% ing broke shooting in this game.

2017-07-04,0,0,93,True,Recommended,i would say this game by far has been the most enjoyable for me i dont normally enjoy survival games or games that put you against other players like free for alls etc. but this game is enjoyable for what its worth you get either 3 choices before going into a match 'solo duo or squad' i love going into a match with 3 friends and just trying to survive for as long as possbile. the cons in this game though theres only one map and it does get boring after so long thats why a lot of people take breaks from this game and play a different game. but for now the only cons i can say this game has is theres only one map and few new guns would be fun to bring into the mix. maybe camos for guns etc i dont know but yes if your looking to spend 30 dollars on a slow paced survival game i think this is the best choice. rate this game would give it a 7 8 out of 10. 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It was a good mixture of a survival game like Rust where you get straight to the fighting with very little dissapointment when you are killed you just start a new match. The highs are super great and the lows of losing are gotten over quickly. However the moderation of not only their official but also their community forums (Official and unofficial Discord/Subreddits) are extremely picky and choosey over who they ban or what they consider appropriate content.Next is the statements that PlayerUnknown makes himself. PU is extremely wishy washy on everything he says. Months ago he stated that there would not be ANY paid content until after the release of the game yet here we are with a paid crate system still in early access with a tournament that has a prize pool for a game that IS NOT RELEASED. PU has shown time and time again that he is not capable to be a voice for his own game on social media he makes a joke of himself through the tweets he makes. (picking fights with streamers Creating arbitrary rules for what is or is not bannable)Next off is their Code of Conduct for their game that only benifets streamers showing that BlueHole as a company only cares for the community that helps make them more money. The constant changing of bluehole and their stance on the game and community makes me want to warn all would be buyers to research the game and the company and make an educated decision before supporting a company that is clearly incapable of doing ""Early Access Right"" as so many people have stated.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers could a less about what the players think and feel which makes it one of the most unpleasant games out there.You'll get stuck on rocks trapped in your parachute killed behind cover (because ping) no region lock established drop rates suck (but are fair right?) and they still haven't fixed the team bug when a player quits the game before leaving the team gotta remake another team. Solid 3/5 as far as battle royale games go. Still better than FortNite. edit Since implementing the fix.pubg.com aspect of the game the developers have basically shouted back at the community.

Then he hopped to pick up the face smashing airdrop which contained three sets of medical kits and AWM. I've never been so fat in all this time. I've seen four Class A's and lots of guns. And then jumped around happily running drugs. In the middle of the trip I met two people who had formed a team illegally. I killed one of them but I didn't think that the enemy in the single row still had a teammate. Then I died a terrible death. Then I have been watching want to see them play after all there are only about 10 individuals. After a couple of diversions I finally got to the final with three survivors left. As the last one or two of the poison circles narrowed my screen got stuck and then I was forced back to the main interface and showed a bunch of code. I didn't pay much attention.

Devs have put more into microtransactions lootboxes and skins than they have actual bug fixes. Optimization issues are still rampant. But no lets add a battle pass. Sure hackers still plague the game and I can't matchmake on US servers without an entirely chinese squad I can't communicate with when communication is a HUGE part of this game. But that's cool just make sure those loot boxes I have to pay to open have like a 0.01% chance of getting anything thats not a grey shirt. Haven't been able to actually enjoy this game in a while. It's just frustrating now and not the good kind.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-28,0,0,188,False,Recommended,Product received for free. This game shaped the new and growing battle royale gametype the way we play games wont ever be the same. Instead of the comedic reviews I normally do I want to talk about the game as a whole and the way it was built. This game started as a mod for Arma 2 and Arma 3 similar to another similar popular mod by the name of DayZ. DayZ the modm and standalone early access game shaped the open world genre forever the vast gameplay was something Pubg wanted to replicate and they did it amazingly. The way Erangal is layed out is amazing the map easily gets into my top 10 favorite maps. The gunplay is also very fun and it makes for very tense moments. Speaking of being tense the game makes you feel stress like you have never felt it before the way the game makes you feel scared and tight is addicting and fun. The performance is ok at worst for me at least and the settings for me are high medium. The time and weather in this game is also very cool as the fog creates a more sneaky approach and the daytime giving you a couragous feeling(as of now the fog and weather features have been removed for development). The loot system is also very rewarding and fun to work with there are low risk low loot areas and there are high risk high loot areas. But the best feature in my opinion is the squad and duo feature. Out of the 100 hours I have put into this game I only have 2 in the solo mode the duo and squad modes create a lot of fun and memorable moments with friends and you can even make new friends through squads. The game also forces teamwork making you more strong as a team in the 4 vs 100 situations. Overall I think this is one of my favorite games at the moment and I dont see myself stopping there are problems like the hackers bugs server connections and other people who ruin the game *cough* CHINA *cough *cough*. But when you look at the game as a whole its hard to take it apart. Overall the game is great and im happy for the awesome memories my friends and I have with this game.... but seriously tho add region lock,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-02,0,0,38,False,Recommended,I've only been playing PUBG for a little while and overall it seems like a great game idea with pretty realistic weapons. (At least as realistic as they can be without overcomplicating the game) Hackers and bugs are constant problems as are random lag spikes. If you like to play for fun its a great game if you dont mind some issues here and there. There's also a pretty steep learning curve especially if you're new to shooters so bear that in mind too. Overall I think this game still has a lot of potential.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-07,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,"Edit I kept this game installed to play with friends and found that increasing your page file in windows has a huge impact on performance. Met one too many people with absent recoil and finally uninstalled today. There appears to be a trick where rapidly clicking your weapon in fully auto keeps the reticle on target and people are able to use mouse bindings to do ridiculous things like 50 clicks per click. I don't think this is against any terms but it definitely violates the spirit of any competitive game. It seems like this game isn't for casual players as it's riddled with try hards and cheaters. The only people who seem to be able to keep up with all of the changes in game mechanics are the people who play this religiously. Why bother taking the time to learn these mechanics when they get changed relatively quickly? Spent $20 on loot crate keys and got some of the worst skins you can muster. Resale value on most of the cosmetics was less than 10 cents. This game is so obviously a scam it's no wonder it has terrible reviews and the top streamers are glorified employees. OP I don't have the hours like some folks do but I did play in beta so there's that. I like the finalized graphics and optimization... That's about it. The only thing that increased the recidivism rate in this game were the loot crates you get from battle points and leveling up (because that's the only sign of progression you get beyond increasing your skill). Now in order to open the crates you need to spend $2.50 on a key for each one... You know.. To get a randomized item. This game went from being a ""check it out and see if you like it"" to a hard PASS. This game didn't do it first it didn't do it best and it won't do it last. The price per content ratio isn't proportionate. I really hope we can get some laws and regulations passed regarding loot crates in games that have an MSRP attached.

2017-12-28,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,This game is really hard to have fun with. Yes some match you will have a blast but most of matches are just lame and boring. It's really a camping simulator with people that hear footsteps first just camping waiting for the other person to peek. Sure if you have the better aim you will win the fight but the odds are against you. The game rewards the person that has no real skill other than a sneaky attitude and a goal to not have fun just camp and try to win you with the odds on his side. Most of the time this ends in terrible death cams with the camper barely hitting shots. Optimization is also not great but kinda improved.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-30,0,0,492,False,Not Recommended,I've played 266 hours on this game. I have given it a thumbs down but specifically due to the cheating. I must admit when I normally read about cheating I take it with a pinch of salt because whilst I know cheating goes on in many games a lot of moaning often seems to be down to a reluctance of many players to admit they have been outplayed an opponent played well or good old fashioned luck. However PUBG is different. There is so much cheating going on. Recently had someone exit a car still moving full speed (which should kill you) hop into the air turn and one shot kill me without it even being a headshot (M14). I was at full health lvl 2 vest and helmet and keeping a tree between us (pretty sure he should not have been able to see me). Replay showed him 100% health despite the full speed exit. In isolation maybe not an issue but it is so often. PUBG devs have banned well over a million players now in fact banned more players than games get to start with. Just a shame they cannot find a way to permanently ban players. So they are trying and I will perserve. Why?Well that is because the game itself is brilliant. For all its quirks it is very addictive and compelling. I am not particularly good at firefights and there are a lot of legit excellent players in the game so i would say I lose the majority of head to head firefights and cannot snipe for the life of me. However I am good at movement and planning so often arrive in the final 10 players through stealth observation etc. And I like that a lot. Others will prefer the 'kill 10 blaze of glory' approach. Not me (neither could i if I wanted to!). Each season I have a 40 50% top 10 ratio but my KD is usually 0.3. Only 2 wins but as far as gaming goes they were a real rush! One with 3 kills and One with 1 kill (the final one). Lots of luck on the last one final opponent sniped #3 and it turns out he was right next to me and when I rushed him he was holding his Kar98 so I nicked the win. I'd have had no chance otherwise but the game makes you use the skills you do have rather than the ones you wish you have.If they could do something about grass disapprearing at 150 yards that would be good too but the main thing is the cheaters. Without the cheaters it would be my #1 games. Others I like a lot are RB Siege Dishonoured Styx Thief 1/2/DS Insurgency 7DTD and the Long Dark.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes there are A LOT of fixes that need to happen but all things considered it's still a good game. The loot boxes are annoying and I wish PUBG corp would just make it so that you could just buy the crates separately from the free ones (since I now have 30+ unopened crates that I have NO intentions of purchasing keys for).

2018-02-05,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,This game is no good. And maybe that's due to my own lack of investigation upfront. First of all it has you running around collecting anything decent to use against opponents for 20 minutes which comes down to being alone not seeing anyone for the most part. Running is really the major part of your time spent on PUBG along with opening doors and hitting 'i' to collect whatever is better then you're already wearing. And like groundhog day you get to do this over and over again. Or let me be more specific you collect stuff and then you die. at least for me that's what sums it up. Offcourse this is due to 99 5% of players being more skilled in this type of game then I am. Suggestions would be to have some kind of difficulty setting that allows you to be paired with evenly poor skilled people (with less rewards in terms of ranking I don't give a anyway about that). and adding more transportation options along the way so I don't feel like I've bought 'summer olympics' the stupid war like version.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-02,0,0,26,False,Recommended,this game is great fun however I have reserved myself to being happy with a top 10 position instead of top 3 or actually winning a round heres why........ every round i have played on has hackers in it there is ALWAYS some fat kid sitting in his bedroom with god knows what hacks activated where all he has to do is spin in a circle and he destroys anything no aiming just holds the trigger down and gets headshot after headshot this is a HUGE ISSUE that needs to be erradicated asap the player base in this game is HUGE but the fact that literally every game has at least 3 5 hackers in it pretty much make winnig a round impossible. I do enjoy this game and play both solo and with my friends and i will continue to play in the hopes thaat the issue above is somehow fixed with a decent anti cheat system which could BAN the fools with hacks on........now a message to thoes who hack ...... Why do you ruin this game for everyone else? why use hacks on a game that actually requires little skill to get near the end of the round? are you that thick that you cant even play the game you have to use noob hacks to make yourself feel good ? i feel ashamed for you i really do i have to tell you something little hacking children the fact that you win a round with your hacks active DOES NOT make you a beast or good at the game or a boss player.... IT MAKES YOU A FRUIT A NAPPY HEADED FREAK ! your literally scum LITERALLY !!!! you should actually go ahead and sell your rig as you CLEARLY dont know the 1st thing about gaming whatsoever. i bet most of you are sitting there now with mountain dew in front of you and a big bag of cheetoes open fatties I hate everthing you hackers are about and I hate the fact you all think your great at games when in actual fact you AINT your really not good at all go play some cs go and leave the decent games to people like me who actually play and use tactics to get as far as i can. your CANCER virgins with cancer the lot of you. you make a show of the gaming community and you should feel ashamed if you wanna use cheats do it on single player games not on multiplayer games your ruining the fun for others just to make your fat self feel good,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,642,False,Recommended,Still don't understand why there aren't locked servers on here. Plenty of games do it and it would keep the players who shouldn't be on certain servers (ALL the asians playing on NA servers aka the cheaters) yes I understand there are ways around this but it's at least going to cut down on the t. Getting killed in 8 consecutive lobbies by players with #unkown names and full autod from across the map or insta headshotted really gets old. Battleye is trash. Pubg could easily afford a better anti cheating system.Edit Game has honestly gone downhill significantly. Cheaters galore again and waves of bans that affect innocent players. Company obviously caters to the Asian market ie scheduling maintenance every week during prime hours for everyone but the asian servers. Then theres still the simple fact that for some unknown reason asian players always have latency/desync issues that work in their favor regardless of the server they play on. I still pour hours into this game because it is enjoyable especially with friends but Pubgcorp have way too many issues to not be addressing them rather than pump out paid crates that require paid keys. I wish there was an option for a middle ground on recomendations as the game has a lot of fun to be had if you can wade through the issues,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-04,0,0,353,False,Not Recommended,So i initially recommended this game based a bit on hope that the developers would work on optomising the game and reducing the number of hackers present.Well unfortunatly they stuffed it up.Hackers aren't so much of a problem now (although i run into them time to time) but i find it idiotic that they havent optomised the game after such a bloody long time. Infact the game has gotten worse.I am an ociana player and its stupid to think that i have to wait 15+ min just to get into a game that i have i high licklyhood of dying in strait away (due to the stupid lagg spikes and late load ins for loot) i know my internet is not the problem because i can play every other game on my comp with no problems (on highest settings as well).Instead of optomising the game the publishers think it is more important to put in advertising for their events and make small changes to the countdown timer (which was fine).Oh and their new anti cheat system? Pretty sure it prevented everyone from joining games on the first day of release so good job their.Is this a fully optomised game? NOShould it be worth the amount of a full release?

2018-02-05,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,The gunplay is beyond stiff. Theres no real fluid to it you get cought on the edges of things all the time its EXTREMELY annoying. I mean Im not asking much interms of being more smooth it doesnt need to be buttery smooth like Doom or rigid yet smooth like Arma 3 I just dont want it to feel like im controlling a lego character. BTW all these reviews talking about the chinese problem its real. The problem is so bad I have played 8 matches total (i know thats low i refunded this.) 3 of those matches im pretty sure I was killed by a hacker. How else does one get headshot in a windowless bathroom and sprinting through an office building. Along with all these wonderful perks of playing with our PC brothers 7 000 miles away the lag makes everything super jumpy. Its hard to play an FPS when the other guy teleports behind you like Goku. Dont get me wrong I dont hate this game. I actually like it but the state it is in feels like a beta. No cheater detection (or punishment) slugish stiff gunplay and movement and one massive server everyone plays on (pfffffftt.... like they couldnt afford more servers). If they fix those things especially the gun play and movement Ill totally come back but for right now im gonna wait for another battle royale clone to come out that fixes this glaring issues.BTW fortnite sucks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Hackers are also a big problem you can have to best loot and superior skill but it won't matter when another kid can use his mommy's credit card to buy hacks online.

I have no quarrel with what you guys have done with said crates. (Yes even the paid one.) But what I really do have an issue is with banning people for suspicion of stream sniping and stream honking or whatever the else.

The ""problem"" with irl money and crates rly dosnt bother me cuz 1. The crates dont change how you play.2. You can earn back the money you spent on the game by selling crates to others really fast.3. The crates is not the reason i return to the game all the time! Its the joy of the game and the rankings. The crates is just a plus for me to earn some money on playing a good game. 4.

It doesn't pay for anything when they are already extremely successful. It takes up developer time for no benefit to the players. It's gating off content despite having very low customization options. When PlayerUnknown posted his justification for why they did it he gave no reasons beyond they were testing the system.

And the servers/ netcode is complete garbage. lag and desync is ridiculous and the game has a major ""laggers advantage"" if someone has a higher ping than you your ed as they will be able to shoot you even though you moved to cover because their pc hasnt caught up yet.Its mostly client sided and as we know or you should know that makes it easier for hackers and leads to more desync/lag issues. literally zero server side checks for pretty much anything.dont waste your money unless its on sale for $15 or less. this game will literally die overnight the same day a comptitent or AAA dev studio releases a battleroyale game.3/10 would not buy again. would actually take a refund if i could....BUT it is literally the only semi serious Battleroyale out at the moment soo.......take that with a grain of salt though. as fortnight's BR is already serious competition for it and that game is like 2D counter strike compaired to CSGO when it comes to competitive mechanics.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-21,0,0,471,False,Not Recommended,100% DO NOT RECOMMEND.In it's current state this game is total garbage. Which is sad to say considering how many hours I have into this game. It has its moments since Early Access where it has been great. This is not one of those moments.There is terrible lag and desync issues. You can pre aim a door way full auto a guy and still lose the gun fight when hes not even aimed up. This is due to him seeing you way before you see him. Lots of Chinese hackers and laggers in NA servers. This is common sense. They need to region lock the game. Not sure why this hasn't been done despite being requested over and over since the start.This isn't even touching the battle pass fiasco along with many other issues this game is currently facing. Do not buy this game until these incompetent devs fix their game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-19,0,0,386,False,Recommended,This game has HUGE potential . It is very very fun and you can't be bored .Unfortunately it is not optimized properly gameplay is sluggish and laggy and counter intuitive . If the devs manage to smoothen out the gameplay fps it can be great . I played FPS for 18 years now i know what i am saying . Call of Duty BlackOps 4 has none of the above issues great FPS better graphics smooth gameplay and very intuitive .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Simple but effective loot system. Unlimited replay value. Rewarding victories 1st &amp 3rd person modesCons Poorly optimized / FPS drops stutters Extremely CPU intensive w/ poor results Hit ditection is terrible at times ( most of the time it's sub par ) Desync ( Iv rarely experienced this but many others have ) Gameplay feels clunky at times especially where jumping is involved. Audio / Directional sound is awful / when it's raining on the map you can hear nothing else. Terrible community ( but this is just gaming in general in 2017 ) Developers banning people for exploiting bugs in early access Developers banning people for "" stream snipping "" Microtransactions in early access after the developer "" promised "" there wouldn't be any until the game was complete Decent amount of cheaters 1 hit kill HS punches ( like why lmao ? ) Melee weapons besides the pan are essentially useless Lack of weapons 5 are only obtainable through random crate drops on the map.

2017-03-23,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,At first I praised and recommended this game but since its release I've slowly changed my tune.Sure the market is now over saturated with battle royale games with most borrowing elements from others and throwing originality out the window but PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS hasn't aged well in the short time that it's been released.The gameplay is fast paced and extremely enjoyable. The guns feel great and for the most part there are few titles that provide such an exhilirating rush as hunting other players while also being hunted.However PUBG Corp has not managed this game well.Despite all of the additions to this game it is still rife with bugs and glitches some even breaking the game. And there seems to be very little hope of them being addressed with the dev favoring new content over fixing older content.And yes the number of battle royale titles have spun out of of control but there are actually cheaper AND better battle royale games out there than PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.It's still a very solid title if you want to play with your friends but you can do a lot better than this game if you're looking for the best battle royale experience.Until PUBG Corp steps up and takes responsibility for the problems plaguing their game I cannot recommend PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

As we go through the process of recognizing whether we should add a cost for complaints against the FCC (As we see it as just given that we need to afford a new underground bunker) I would like to take the time from our heroic endeavour to talk about this game. While true I did find enjoyment with this game and truer still it can be fun at times it has lost its luster and has consigned itself to a rather dark hole given the recent plans the developers have initiated (keys more keys crates tickets). Along with a lack of credible updates and further still bugs all around I regret to inform the steam community that the FCC has now rescinded its support for this game.

Changing negative to positive. Still lacks 1st person only hardcore mode but it has been confirmed to be added in future. Can i recommend this game at the current state? NO!Let just say the game has a lot of potential its a shame it ended up in the incopetent devs. They cash in milions and instead of fixing the game they are traveling on vacations. sighReasons Servers are cancer they made so much money and i dont see them investing in new servers.Takes several attempts to grab a weapon items open doors get in car people rubberbanding all over the place makes CQB a nightmare.Hit registration is off people can shoot you even when u got recently in cover because on their screen u are still outside of cover.Weapon balancing is crap also the game is basicaly who can unload whole mag into another person faster. Ever seen in another game where you unload 15 rounds with beretta to his back and he stays alive like nothing happened just to turn around and 1 shot you with a shotgun?I wont even go on on how unoptimized it is but hey its early access so ..And last but not least about 30% of playerbase are clearly using some kind of cheats and the devs are completely ignoring it and when u talk about the ""cheating issue"" on forums your post gets deleted. (just look up cheats for PUBG youtube is full of it sad)Coming from games like Arma3 Squad Insurgency 3rd person view abuse is a major issue. There are no hardcore servers with 1st person only. In this game if you dont use 3rd person you will always lose.Conclusion just stay with the bug free mod for Arma3 and save yourself some money and not support incopetent devs.I may revisit this review when majority of the issues get resolved.

My friends and me were blamed even slandered as a cheater just because we are Chinese players. I believe the problems of PUBG are rising to the racial discrimination. Many of my compatriots bring the shame to us and they just use Steam as a launcher of PUBG DDDD之所以做出这个请求 是因为PUBG的外挂问题已经开始影响到我在其他游戏的游戏体验 仅仅因为我是一个中国玩家 我就要被侮辱甚至无故被污蔑成作弊者 我和我的朋友们在近几周遭遇了不少类似状况 我相信PUBG的外挂泛滥已经成为一个现象级问题 或者说 是一个现象级的种族歧视问题 我的部分同胞们对中国玩家这个群体造成了严重的抹黑行为 而他们之中的大部分人只是将Steam作为PUBG的启动器 It's not about the honour of Chinese. It's simply a Chinese player want to get his game experience back (not for PUBG only). I pay for the games just like most of you. There's no reason that I get a different experience. But Im not going to refute the accuse with any standpoints (if I have). Because I know if I am a foreigner I will do so.这无关中国民族的自尊 我也不认为一个游戏应该上升到这样的高度 这单纯是一个中国玩家想要找回他应得的游戏体验 就像绝大多数玩家一样 我是通过购买来获得游戏的 但我却没有得到我应有的游戏体验 我应该反驳那些攻击我的人吗 不 因为我清楚 如果我是他们 我也会这么做 作弊玩家给正常玩家造成了非常糟糕的游戏体验 就像愤怒的外国玩家对中国玩家们做的那样 If Bluehole is a responsible firm then it should start to consider about the region lock after the open beta of CN server.如果蓝洞是一个有责任感的游戏公司 那么它应该开始考虑锁区的问题了,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,223,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I've put a lot of my free time into this game. Overall I have had many likes and dislikes about this game. Bad things being like optimization gun physics server laging. At first when this game came out even though running it on the lowest of the low (I have a AMD A10 7850k and a HD 7870) I had tons of fun with it. Then as the updates came out I saw it go into a downward spiral for me having server lag losing frames and having overpowered guns (the mini) But after all of that the test servers came out and I played those. I was amazed how far they came with those test servers. Everything felt so much better and it ran way better. I loved this game then I hated it and now I give this game tough love. Overall I recommend this game only if you have a decent computer that can run it.Update So after the rough months since this review I still have tough love for the game. I barely play it now because it just doesn't run to my liking at the moment (I am still with the same system as mentioned above but gonna be upgrading in about a month or two) I still get server lag optimization can still be better and overall devs just being weird and super just bleh. I do recommend though because of it being the most ""realistic"" in a way kind of battlegrounds. I've taken a liking to totally accurate battle royale which I've had a lot more fun with friends but I'd say PUBG is the game to go too for realism. I still of course recommend a not decent but powerful pc to run it. To be honest I'd also wait for it to actually become a 1.0 and not the t they publlshed as 1.0 because honestly it is still the same way even in beta with its tweaking. Over powered weaponry though has become more balanced. I do wish melee pistols and shotguns where more viable weapons but I am happy with the meta guns. I do have to mention the optimization again because come on it is made in the unreal engine how do you up performance in the unreal engine? Anyways I do recommend but if you don't want to grab a beta game just yet I'd say wait for majority and play the free totally accurate battle royale. Much love for this game though.Update 2 So as of this update I can and can't recommend this game. Steam neutral option? Anyways aside from that this game has seen improvement. Overall though I can't recommend it anymore. Since time has gone by (and as mentioned above I have gotten a much better PC) this game hasn't been as much fun for me. There's the hackers which I don't see often but once or twice every two days or so. The graphics are actually garbage to me compared to a game like cuisine royal. I have upgraded to a Ryzen 7 2700X 16 GB of RAM and lastly a 1070 ti from MSI. I do play in 1080p so that probably also explains why I can run this game on ultra with no stuttering. Though for people with worst PCs I don't know that side anymore and if it is terribly affected. Anyways I still do play this game but with how the devs are with their cash grab espeically with the ever oversaturated microtransactions. Like jesus christ I would love them to stop. I don't buy into them when I play games with them and I do believe that they still exist because of others who do buy into them. There is also the stupid season pass like CS GO's that they do for ""special loot"" or just stupid events that should be free and not bought through a pass. Overall though guns have good balance. So far (I've only replayed a handful) the net code has improved. I still hate the desert map because of just the huge size of it and the hilly terrain but their new jungle map I love with more tight quarters fighting and how dangerous situations can get. So as it stands I don't recommend this game anymore because battle royales such as simulator or cuisine are so much better and even free. I had so much more fun with my friends on batte royale simulator than PUBG. I will come back to this game because it is the only semi realistic battle royale that I can play. If a new battel royale comes out that goes for realism like PUBG though I'd switch to it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It takes a decent amount of points (earned through matches by killing surviving winning etc.) to earn cosmetics and that is the only sense of progression this has.

2017-08-28,0,0,123,False,Recommended,I absolutely love this game but it's not with its drawbacks. If you don't know what the gameplay is you must be living under a rock but it's totally awesome. It's extremely repetitive with only three maps as of now but it has an ever expanding roster of weaponry and attachments which does give each game more variety. Sadly the cosmetics are even harder to get now and even though they are cosmetics there used to be a bit more of an incentive to do well but now that all crates require keys to open (and keys cost real money) it takes some of the fun out of it. A lot of people are talking about connectivity issues and crashes but I haven't experienced any of this since its 1.0 release. Performance and optimization could really use some work and I think a buff to graphics would help but these are relatively minor complaints and don't do much to affect the meat of the game. If the devs want to do something to make this game better take off the microtransactions and just let us have the crates we earn and add more variety to armor. Right now you get three levels 1 2 and 3 with one having the least armor three having the most pretty basic but I feel like they could add more detail here.While I have said more bad than good I still love this game and unless it tanks for some reason I won't stop playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-30,0,0,170,False,Recommended,PUBG is at my point of view a good battle royal game. The maps are always fun to play never boring with their own touch. The weapons are variable and different between them the attachments in the game lead to a variable customization of the weapons present in the game. The flaws though of the game are the optimization which will make players with a non good PC to encounter problems with the FPS accompanied from the gameplay that sometimes may be a little frustrating for some players though it's not a problem for me. Battlegrounds itself has a big potential if developers start focusing more on the gameplay and optimization instead of the cosmetic aspect of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-05,0,0,1315,False,Not Recommended,It can be a fun game to play but it is far from a finished game. About a 1/10 chance of crashing during a game all the while the developers are pushing more and more microtransactions every update. They actually have a button in the menu to restart the lobby because the game bugs are so prominent. While the was released a while ago I would still call it in the beta phase.The game has an unnecessary learning curve to it. The is no tutorial in game you have to play in either ranked random matches or the small list of private matches (that you wait in lobby more than play). Each weapon has its own amount of bullet drop which is daunting trying to figure it out your first few games. The loot/vehicles/circle is procedurally randomized which makes for a new playthrough each time.The reward system is a cruel joke. You play the game to earn BP to buy crates (that inflate the cost for each one purchased in that week). You have a 50% of getting a locked crate that you cannot open without buying a key. Each type of locked crate has a separate type of key that costs $2.50 US. The other half of the crates you get you can open for a random piece of clothing or weapon skin. Most of the time you get duplicates of that you already have. Rather than get a useless piece of clothing (that I already own) I end up selling all my crates on the Steam Marketplace for a profit. That is the 2nd biggest plus for this game IMO is that I have made more money trading crates than I spent on this game.The biggest plus is having fun with friends on the rare occurrence the game doesn t crash for one of us. I plan on continuing to play mostly to play with my friends. I would not recommend for anyone just starting out themselves.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-06,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,Going into PUBG I really wanted to enjoy this game. Sadly PUBG falls short in several areas that mean I cannot honestly recommend this game. The first elephant in the room is the abundance of hackers server lag and the fact the game randomly decides to crash my PC when I attempt to close it or the game just freezes. While these are technical issues and can be solved with time the fundamental issues with PUBG will never be solved. Unlike other FPS series like Counter Strike Call of Duty and even older titles like Unreal Tournament PUBG is not an arena based game. There is no respawning in a game of PUBG. Games can take upwards of 15 minutes and very little of that is actually spent engaging in firefights with other players. Unlike arena games where you can engage enemy players without fear of dying due to the respawn mechanics PUBG punishes you for taking bad fights. However it is not a simulator in lieu of ArmA and attracts a totally different crowd. Ultimately this ends up with a gameplay experience that is essentially many many minutes of what can only be described as vapid emptiness as the player runs around trying to collect random spawning items and several seconds of firefights with other players. While the size of the map might sound exciting you quickly learn which spots spawn the best loot and the game quickly devolves into a point and drop game where you hope to get better gear than everyone else not get sniped from a location by a player you couldn't see or encountering screaming toddlers through voice chat. Gear in PUBG is totally unbalanced and many guns are outright useless practically all of the pistols and shotguns are worthless and later anything that isn't a automatic rifle or a sniper rifle. There is also periodic supply crates dropped around the map with the chance of containing extremely powerful weapons like the Arctic Warfare Magnum / AWP or M249. These two guns break the game and getting one is basically complete luck to be in the correct place get the supply drop and not get sniped from a player you couldn't see. Then there's the issue of the controls. WASD is your standard movement key but SHIFT makes you run C makes you crouch and Z sends you prone. This is all well and good but I'm left handed. This is then compounded by the issue that the map button is bound to M the complete opposite side of the keyboard where my hand will be perched. Then there's the put away weapon button bound to X. Whoever's idea it was to put this key in between crouch and prone two very useful tools in a firefight should probably reevaluate basic control mapping. There is nothing more frustrating than dying in a firefight because you pressed X when you meant to crouch or go prone. If you're counting how many keys PUBG is using we're currently at 9. TAB opens your inventory fair enough. Buttons 1 through 9 access your items but good luck actually figuring out which button does what because the game doesn't tell you anything. You can also scroll with the mousewheel so we're up to essentially 20 buttons. Left and right mouse button fire and zoom you in and out respectively. B changes your gun's mode from single burst or auto if it has it. Pressing shift while in zoom will make you hold your breath and steady your sight and finally V changes you from first person to third person while ALT allows you to look around.So that's 26 buttons. For those of us who aren't octopi or professional Starcraft players the constant need to dance around the keyboard especially if you're a leftie like me is incredibly uncomfortable. The game itself isn't overly pretty but don't worry it's another one of /those/ games where playing on higher graphics settings obscures your vision so turn everything down to potato settings for optimal gameplay. Really why.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is improving but still... problamatic it runs smoother since the release but it still doesn't run smooth on my not weak computer. Crashing also occurs from times to times around once a 2 hour playing seassion. The game is buggy not Bethesda release buggy but far from smooth. It also feels kind of cheap from bad sound design to wanky animation the game shows the fact that it was done by a very small group of people. But... How's the gameplay? It's fine... Although I have a lot of hours on the game it's less of a game for me and more of a platform for friends to talk over it doesnt need a lot of atention to have the peak expirience. My biggest complain on the gameplay is the very fast area reduction speed it's probably only me but I'll like it much more if the game would take it's time and let players kill eachother slowly.

The game has good content and is fun solo but obviously way more fun with friends. The few complaints I can agree with is the slow/unstable UI for the lobby. I don't know why people have an issue with all the micro transactions Don't buy 'em. Pretty simple.In Short +Gameplay is Fun+Character Customization is Decent(Clothing)+Teamplay/Playing With Friends is easy Lobby UI The Occasional crash (Very Specific Bug) I'm unable to alt tab my game after I've gotten into a game for the first time it will immediately crash the game and require me to close it through task manager,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-28,0,0,279,False,Not Recommended,This game was pretty fun when it was still in Early Access. It was accepted that the game was flawed and part of the fun and charm was that you would regularly encounter a bug the results of which ranged from frustrating to highly amusing. Then the game launched officially but the bugs were still there. Okay no big deal most games ship with known bugs and in the internet era these can be patched. So you wait until the first patch comes out. And then the next patch. And the one after that. Increasingly these patches do little to improve the gameplay experience. Hacking would still be pervasive rubber banding and lagging still a major issue your sights would clearly be centered on a target but you instead shoot the window sill. Meanwhile the new content being added to the game introduces things that seemingly no one asked for pay to open loot crates an emote system (???) then eventually new game styles and maps. But the original issues still persist so now you have new and exciting ways to experience bugs and suffer unoptimized gameplay. It became quite apparent that the focus of the developer was to encourage micro transactions with little regard for stabilization or optimization to the actual game. Understandably those things cost money and take time and are therefore kicked to the bottom of the priority list while emulating Fortnite has suddenly become the top concern. But it's too late. Fortnite has already eaten PUBG's lunch and PUBG is more concerned with legal disputes than trying to make the better game. It's a shame. I used to have a lot of fun playing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-06,0,0,646,False,Not Recommended,I ve put many hours into this game since before release and it had a lot of potential but don t buy it. PUBG Corp has killed this game by continuously ignoring community feedback on core game issues such as desync server issues vehicle bugs etc. Instead of spending any resources to improve the gaming experience PUBG Corp has relentlessly pushed out untested patches that have made the gameplay experience worse than it has ever been before. In addition to these patches further breaking the game PUBG Corp has also consistently pushed out an absurd amount of purchasable cosmetic content indcluding the recent event pass. The event pass missions are broken and rewards that players have already paid for are often unable to be redeemed despite accomplishing the mission objectives. PUBG Corp also has continuously pushed out crates that can only be unlocked by purchasing keys. Last year with cost and taxes factored out PUBG Corp made $750 million and they still refuse to dedicate resources to fix the game. To put that into perspective it costs $450 million to carry out an entire space shuttle mission and PUBG Corp will not spend the money needed in order to deliver a game experience that anyone would consider acceptable in 2018. I love the idea of this game but greed and incompetence have completely destroyed what it could have been. Save your money on this one and wait for an inevitable release of a AAA title that will deliver a good game experience with a similar concept.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game still crash sometimes but most of the time i can reconnect and continue playing.Yay Best fps game i ever played (my opinion) not talking about story line games tho. BR gamemode is entertaining this is next step gaming it's not just a trend. They keep adding content even if they should work on fixing issues first this will keep the game from dying and i doubt it will stop so no you are not wasting your money. Zone is well balanced keep pushing you but not too much. Different situations all the time.Conclusion this is my favourite game but they really need to work on servers and they surely will they showed us that they listen to us it take some time but it should happen give them a chance ) . (1000 euro compo and it runs really fine (without the lags) i play on lowest graphics tho but by choice not for perfomences).

2018-01-04,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,"More often than not you're gonna end up with people that you can't understand a word of. For this game you want to play with friends so that you have better communication which for this game is a very key factor in order to achive victories. Plus you know that your friends won't intentionally kill you as you'll sometimes find team killers that'll take all your stuff and then try to kill the others leaving him/her the last one standing. One game I had included a team killer that I couldn't understand a word of except for and I quote "" YOUR MOTHER' to which he than killed another member of our team while driving a motorcycle than just did whatever he pleased till he died in the game. Don't depend on the report feature too much either because sure you can report a teamkiller. you can't report multiple team killers that were on the same team as you and planned to do it for giggles. Another game I had involved someone I could understand but didn't like it when I told him that I wasn't gonna use the 'push to talk' feature to that he moved over to my spot than he shot me till I was downed. He then tells me after I asked ""Why did you shoot me?"" to which he responds 'Arrogant s deserve to die' After he left me a friendly team member of ours brought me back up but was then... you guessed it shot down by the same guy who shot me then tried to kill me in game. Before he could kill me I shot him down than brought up my other team mate. I offered to help him back up if he was willing to put up with me not using the 'push to talk' feature as I was willing to put up with him instead he retorts before dying in a lame man's terms "" off."" All that just because I said 'no' to using a feature in the game. Such paper thin skin he had. I was only wanting to play the game and have fun just like the person who tried to help me but if I or anyone that doesn't like to use the push to talk feature bothers you or that guy who shot both me and my buddy down so much... then we might wanna include a mute feature as well that other players can use on those they don't want to hear from an easy fix if you ask me. Either that or they can just deal with it and not shoot at their own team mates and insult them. So while yes I did commit one act of team killing had I not shot him down he would of killed both me and my friend in game not very sporting if you ask me. So if I happen to be banned for a bit because of that one team kill I did at least allow me to show you pictures of the guy attempting to team kill both me and a friendly. I looked over the game play footage I locked it in my replays and I have the photos to prove my case. I want to see this game improve not just in gameplay but also in match making as it seems that the player is gonna likely be hearing a lot of other languages that he/she can't understand as well as have possible issues with those that'll team kill her/him for fun then take whatever he/she had on their person. Only way to avoid both issues is to play solo or with friends. In terms of graphics they're pretty good but not too important as for the gun play you have quite a selection and a lot of weapon upgrades that can batter fit your playstyle though I do feel that maybe it needs a few more guns in both of it's maps. As for melee weapons where's my fireman's ax? Where are the wooden bats with nails hammered into them? Why can't you kick anyone to get some distance or to push down the stairs? Where are the knives to stab people in the back with? There are so many melee weapons that could easily be in this game yet are no where to be found. Another feature that should be included are the maps actually having a day and night cycle. Can you imagine fighting in the desert at night? or in an open field at dawn? That would be freaking sweet. On note of the BP system... it's there... but I don't see much use in it if it's only gonna let you get clothes or for an outrageously high price of 3000 BP... change your appearence instead of being able to let you change your person's appearence for less or even free. This game could also use more game modes as well like capture the flag or something other battle royale. Hell I'd even want to play against some bots if they ever decide to have them be included. Smart bots that'll be organized and make quick work of you if you're careless. It also wouldn't be too bad if we got a new island to explore one made of ice and snow or maybe on a big jungle island with all sorts of tribal looking camps and hutts as well as a volcano that's dormant but if one falls in or gets too deep they roast alive inside of it. There's just so much that can be done for this game to make it better but all it has right now are two maps that you can't decide between as it's randomized some hackers team killers and a reporting system that really needs an update so that you can get multiple people at once for incase you end up having to deal with two or sometimes even three people that all broke the rules at somepoint during the game you had with them. The game can be fun but more so when you play with friends or by yourself not so much with randoms that you probably won't understand a word of anyways.I don't hate this game but I don't love it either. It needs work. On another side note for the report system let us be able to type in the specifics as well just so we can make detailed reports of what happened as well as being able to send both pictures and picturs that we can take as we looked over the game where we got team killed or suspected a hacker or two.Update It really does pain me to say this but with the massive lag issues the number of cheaters that plague this game as well as the net code being an overall hot mess and grief as much as I want to enjoy this game the problems it has from when I first played this game only grew as time went on. The makers of the game need to stop thinking about what sells for a moment and focus on trying to listen and fix this game so that it's more rewarding and more enjoyable to play. Region locking needs to be an option the idea of the BP system needs to be reworked entirely to where once you have certian bits of clothing you keep them they are off the list of collectables for the players to obtain. The net code needs a lot of work as players in the game still fall/jump/walk/run/drive/swim through walls. The parachutes can get stuck in nonsensical ways in the air or between a tree or two that isn't even touching it and so much more that really hurts this game's chances of being able to become a success. Sure it may of started out okay for a while but wow did this game not age well in the few years it's been around. When I first saw it I could understand why it was in early access at the time but if it still has so many glaring issues even when out of early access then I'm sorry guys but this is an undercooked game that needs more time in the oven. It needs more of the company's attention and the company itself needs to spend their money on FIXING the game not marketing it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-21,0,0,113,False,Not Recommended,This game is bad. From a technological standpoint it's buggy glitchy unpolished and unoptimized.From a gameplay standpoint it's a whole lot worse.To put it simply this game does not reward skillful play. In fact it punishes you for actually playing the game. There is almost no reason to actually fight other players. You are rewarded with in game currency for doing so but the only thing it can be spent on is opportunites to spend real money. The only other bonus you get is the chance to loot their bodies. By the time you actually kill another player there's a good chance you've already got good equipment so the benefits you earn from killing other players becomes so miniscule that there's really no reason to pick a fight and risk dying. If you want to win hide in a bush and don't move.You could put me in a 100 player match with 20 of the world's best PUBG players and there's a good chance I would make it to the top 20 because I can just camp in a bush all game. That's not strategic. That's not smart. That's not fun. That's not fair. That's cheap. This is coming from someone who has won this way. That win was not fun. In fact I felt bad for the other player. I've lost a lot of interest in playing the game now that I know actually playing the game is a lost cause and the #1 easiest way to win is to literally not play the game.The developers have been trying to make this game an e sport. This is beyond stupid. This game has an outrageous amount of RNG. The plane spawn location is random plane flight path is random loot spawn location is random vehicle spawn location is random playzone location is random redzone location is random ect. ect.. Not only that but when prize money is offered every single player will be camping in bushes. Why would anyone risk dying when real life money is on the line? PUBG as an e sport will never work.The 1.0 release of this game is in a practically unplayable state. Unbelievably unfinished. Don't buy this game no matter what. Go outside and hit yourself over the head with a rock 50 times it's more fun and you'll at least get one kill before dying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-10,0,0,1094,False,Not Recommended,EDIT_____________________Update nearly a year on I have so many hours on this and I have no idea why what a complete pile of buggy laggy filled with Russians on their dial up net and 5 fps who some how have a major advantage!! Got to rank 76 across all EU servers with over 2million active eu players at the time after they banned a ton of players for a small period it was fantastic but it's back to being an utter pile of Original_____________Will you fix this ing game! fpp has constant mini stutters every few minutes and at the worst times ie open door freeze DEAD. What's the point of a quick draw mag if pulling my gun out and hitting fire means it doesn't fire because I pressed fire before it was fully out. The start lag is unbearable and the game is clearly catered for 3rd world s from the likes of Uzbekistan who can't run 10 fps but can see you through every unrendered ing building. Laying in the grass is ing pointless because although I can't see while im laid in it it's not loaded for any other over 15 feet away and I stand out like a ing forest in the sahara desert. When other than in the epicentre of Hurricane Katrina has the rain ever been this ing loud? I find myself waking up my entire village trying to talk to my team m8s on discord due to the sheer volume of little droplets of chinese men smashing ing gongs! The rain is so ing loud that after a single game I have a sore throat from screaming instructions to said team m8s maybe this is infact how the singer Adele lost her voice and was infact nothing to do with a trio of concerts but a single game of pubg in the rain. Parachuting why is it that you place me 3 foot above the ground and then feel the need to fling me 40 ing feet across the map and to half HP? and why when given the option to cut the cord does it take like 12 seconds? Am I cutting through rope or a chain for anchoring a cargo ships? The zone why O why am I forever chasing or rather being chased by what reminds me of the smoke monster from that shity program Lost? and why do the zones times decrease so much faster nearer the end! in fact scratch that the starts fine and the ends fine but around the middle where you decide to zone at the other end of the ing map with only a minute to go is the one that really cripples me every pigging game... All that aside I love this game but I also hate it more than I hate these new age gender nuetral freaks!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-21,0,0,376,False,Not Recommended,I only have about 329 hours of playtime so take my review w/a grain of salt. I've been playing FPS games since the Goldeneye era (N64) and everything in between since. I think my opinion is worth SOMETHING so I'll tell you what I think about the game. If you dont want to read the review go to the TL DR section.**My PC Setup**Ryzen 1700 3.8GTX 1060 6GB OCed16gb Ram 2933144hz Asus Monitor 148 GB SSD1TB WD HDDetc etc For starters getting into a game takes forever. It's the main reason I dont hot drop. I hate sitting in the lobby for 30 secs/min just to get into the plane. Not to mention even when I do hotdrop and land next to somebody they somehow ALWAYS find a gun while I'm still trying to pick up a weapon but cant cause the servers suck. Anyone else land next to somebody and your sitting there right clicking on a weapon but you're just not picking it up? WTF is that t?Aside from that Erangel (the better of the two maps IMO) doesnt get rotated enough between Miramar (map sucks). They USE to have a feature where you could select between the two maps and I for one would always choose Erangel Miramar NEVER got played by me when I had the option to select what map I wanted to play on. Now with the latest patch they FORCE you into playing that crap map. Wtf Blueballs?! First you take away our rain fog etc Now this? I should have the option to play whatever map I want to play. Sanhok breathed some life into the game for me when it released as I felt that Erangel/Miramar just wasnt my playstyle. I prefer fast paced shooters and not running simulators. Even w/Sanhok out I can really only stomach about 2/3 games before I rage and play Paladins. The Dsync is terrible hackers are still rampant(albeit not as bad pre 1.0) physics still suck and not to mention I have 12 crates I cant open because they're locked behind a ing paywall. As it stands I'm currently downloading IoN and if that game plays better than this mess I'll uninstall this game and possibly never play it. The game has potential for sure but I truly doubt the devs even notice it. They're too busy lining their pockets w/ $$ instead of fixing their broken game. The only time I have fun is when I'm playing w/friends. Playing this game solo is boring as Oh I almost forgot. Playing for BP in this game is a joke. Cause when you have enough to get a crate you know what you get? Copies of you already have or a crate that needs a key to be unlocked. that t.

2018-02-09,0,0,252,False,Recommended,so ive had this game for 5x longer so what I honestly think is that the game is hard and is not for the little cod kids or people who mostly enjoy arcade shooters like fortnite but this game actually has recoil bullet drop leading and more of a tactical play style so you have to take notice of your surroundings.Hackers needs to be pointed out yes is really bad and it really is getting aimbotted from some dude with a username like Q2657606 which could be their QQ id (Chinese Platform) it obvisously isn't fun and is really annoying and frustrating but it really can't be helped.Gameplay is alright alot of running and driving the zone is something to take note of like how long you have till the next zone and the stages of damage each zone takes like the final 2 pratically can one shot you so BE careful ive died from it too many times.The gunplay is my turn off it takes alot of time to get used to THEY need to add a trainning groud like Playground LTM in fortnite to practice otherwise you will most likely get slaughtered by better players I would suggest tap firing or in small bursts at first otherwise you will have a hard time.FPS is the downer the game runs fine for me with a GTX 1060 with over 60fps at high to ultra 1080p so atleast a GTX 1050ti would do but idk about AMD i dont own one but maybe rx570 and 580 will do.Over all i recommend to more hardcore gamers who like a challenge and more tactical approach to the Battle Royale Genre this game always gets me coming back so have a shot at it see if you enjoy it!

Just to throw a few out there... Maybe even the AN 94... Or a riot shield? (Could work on duo's/Squad's?)Some new armour variants? How about some leg/arm armour? Region lock China!!! i'm yet to meet one not hacking. Give us the option to choose the map we want to play instead of forcing that god awful excuse of a map Miramar down our throats. It's absolute S**t unless you land in Peado or whatever that first time unity map designer place is called. Add some additional weapon attachments! or atleast variants of the existing ones? Mix it up abit! Melee Well. If that's what you call it. How about some structured monthly Quarterly &amp maybe even a weekly content patch? Maybe an urban map? 4 5x the size of Po i?For the love of god fix the death cam It is absolutely useless. Seriously why did you remove the map weather variants? If people have pleb PC's and struggle with fog map's and they're the legal age to play this game then the problem is with them not your game...Don't pander to them and remove everything.Oh and if you are still considering buying this benjamin button of a game Please dont get on a bike and ride shotgun. You'll experience what i'd imagine it feels like to OD on crack whilst hurtling down the motorway. Seriously Just roll out monthly content patches get some new maps on the go &amp stop pandering to console players Follow the 7 Days to Die model Run the PC version several patches ahead and let the Console players catch up if/when the console can run it.

I've played battle royale since the arma 3 mod was initially released played h1z1 battle royale the culling etc. And I can say with complete confidence that this is the best battle royale game I have ever played. It's not perfect by any means I'd be foolish to say that. But the game is slowly progressing in the right direction. From when the game was first released on steam compared to now its almost a completely different game. And I mean that in a positive way the newest update has adjusted a lot of issues among the stability of the game the region issues and the weapons in the game. As the m416 was easily the dominant and preferred choice overall which made the game lack weapon variety. It just outmatched most weapons. But now thats not so much the case. This game will change over the course of time it will be tweaked hackers will be banned things will be added bugs will be fixed and eventually it will reach its peak. This game has gotten tons of backlash and I believe its due to the astronomical amount of players that play it. I don't think that the devs were expecting that large of an audience that quickly and obviously that would cause lots of server issues and of course hacking. Hackers are an issue and they need to focus on that before adding anything. And thats my only issue with the game why would we want new maps and new weapons if hackers are making the game unbalanced and unfair? Think about it you join a game with 99 other players what do you think the odds are of running into at least one hacker? Pretty high. Other than that this game has been a blast and I still currently play it very often. It's very competitive and has a large learning curve. Each weapon has a unique feel and different intensities of recoil. It's not an ""easy"" game. And thats what I like about it. I feel like there is always something for me to do something to work on weapons to master new playstyles to try. Its an amazing game for what it is and I don't feel like it deserves most of the negativity its been receiving. I would highly recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-11,0,0,907,False,Not Recommended,I had written a pretty positive review however my mind about this game changed drastrically recently. All in all the devs do not seem to care about the quality of the game and did not fix any major bugs since release. The engine controls and performance is still the same for me pretty good. The thing is this game not only has substantial netcode/server/hit rate/region issues but the devs rather focus on bringing new skins behind a paywall with rng involved to cash even more while they seem to not invest any money into this game but they even want to go into eSports with it. Recently the game is almost unplayable due to ppl who are abusing the server regions or are simply lagswitching and even the almost useless deathcams are clearly showing the rediculous lags. There wont be the region lock so many ppl are shouting for they wont fix any of the netcode related issues cus in my honest opinion the devs are just trying to milk the game as long as it is possible and are just way to incompetent or lazy to fix game breaking issues. And finally even the sound engine seem to bug out extremely hard lately. Maybe its due to the netcode again or they just f**ked up in the last changes but ppl tend to just sprint next to me and i did not hear anything. And neither my headset nor my settings are the problem here. And if they are every other game like cs go and rbss seem to work fine with my setup. TL DR Don't get fooled by eSports PR or shiny skins. This game is a hopefully soon disappearing pile of steaming garbage that is nowhere near eSports ready. It is a laggy buggy and bad designed never finished alpha state cash grab disaster. Overhyped to the max. Save your money for upcoming titles and wait for the definetly coming replacement of this game that will hopefully be developed by a company that has more in mind than fast money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-07,0,0,1283,False,Recommended,"PubG is unlike any other game I've played. While there are certainly some flaws and performance issues it's so refreshing to have a game that offers a truly unique experience every time I jump into it and it has something to offer ALL play styles. The Battle Royale forumula is the hottest trend in gaming right now largely because of PubG but there is much more to this game than that. It allows you to play solo or with a partner or with a squad of four all in either first or third person mode. This flexibility keeps the game fresh since I can chill and relax in a solo mission with my morning coffee taking my time to sneak up on people with silenced weapons. Or I can jump into a duo mission with my friend and discuss coordinated tactics and maybe even join a larger squad that simply wants to jump the hot zone guns blazing.THE GOOD The graphics are amazing pure and simple. The two primary maps are huge and you will play hundreds of hours and still discover interesting little areas. The player models and textures are nice as well and in my opinion very realistic. The pacing of the game is nice as well. If you are fortunate enough to win the entire Battle Royale it is usually done in about a half hour though it may seem like more time has passed because you will have done so many different things during that time. THE BAD While many gun aficionados may appreciate the efforts gone into making guns and their actions more realistic there is a strong learning curve for anyone new to the game. Having played other shooters like CS GO which are much more simplistic it has taken me a long time to start adjusting to severe bullet drop firing rate gun attachments ammo types etc. New players may find that it takes several games before they get their first kill. As of right now there is still no practice range for players to try out the guns are ""git gud"" but it is hopefully in the works. One other ""meh"" factor is more cosmetic and that is the player starting areas just before each match. The lobby is a bit wonky at times and it often doesn't remember whether you play first or third person. And while I know that most players don't care about a ""storyline"" it would be nice to have some kind of opening cinematic or location that brings the players together just before we all pile into the plane and prepare to parachute over the map if for no reason than to fire everyone up. Finally when you eventually get your first ""Chicken Dinner"" (a win) it's a bit of a let down because there is nothing except a silent piece of text on the screen that says you won. No sound effect celebretory trophy or crowd or even a short cinematic. THE UGLY I don't find much to complain about with this game but there are definitely performance issues. While certainly playable it is much harder to succeed in this game if you don't have a top end machine because framerates and processing are so important in a game like this that boils down to milliseconds. Recently since the new Sanhok expansion I have been having the game crash more often at least once per session though I expect that to clear up over time.Finally it's worth noting that very often you may find yourself spending 15 minutes running around looting managing your inventory and slowly working your way toward the center of the zone only to eventually face off with another player that you shoot cleanly in the back only to have them spin around and finish you off. Happens to me all the time. If you aren't prepared to have that happen often I don't recommend the game. BOTTOM LINE Because of the sandbox type of atmosphere and battle royale scenario every jump is a unique experience. I know of no other game like it that can make me stress about inventory and stealth engage in intense fire fights and suddenly make me burst into laughter when my motorcycle explodes in midair when hit by an artillery shell. I believe it is totally worth the price even at $30.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And yes I've seen that people have complained about optimization and whatnot but if I can run PUBG on my laptop then everyone who has a desktop should've have a reason to complain especially since I can't really upgrade my laptop piece wise. The UI is a little clunky and if it was more like the PUBG Mobile UI then it may be more enjoyable. The combat is smooth and punishing. On one side without headphones you've got no chance and if you're ambushed you'll have to locate your target quickly before you're dead. On the other hand you gotta control the weapon and make sure your aim doesn't screw you over. When you get a kill it's rewarding since you know YOU killed them with skill instead of spitting as many bullets as possible ala Fortnite.

On the other that stat proves that money cannot buy quality development or programming talent as even with current net sales approaching 1 Billion dollars (currently at $864 000 000) the bugs optimization issues and rampant hacking have really hurt what could have been one of the greatest PvP shooters ever made.The dev team seems to have dialed in on the core philosophy that more content released faster more money gained faster and the quality assurance of said content is of secondary concern an issue that is glaringly evident by the fact we have seen a new map and new guns but parachutes still routinely bug out and drop players for fall damage or get stuck. Fixing core gameplay mechanics at this point wont make them more money so what's the point right?Unfortunately this leads to the game's biggest downfall the inconsistency of gameplay. One night you can play for 4 hours and everything just works. The next night parachute bugs desync vehicle bugs hackers etc. Variation keeps things exciting but this kind of variation is unhealthy for a game.I would love to see them focus on algorithm's to detect hacking which has really taken over the game lately. It is not rare to have more games ended via hacker than those ended legitimately. The first three games I played today were won by a hacker and those are just the blatant ones. What about the xy axis mouse macros for no recoil? It really is a massive problem in this game.Even with those problems I would still recommend the game because it has a TON of potential. It can also be a lot of fun. But the novelty will wear off eventually and you too will be wondering how they've made the money they have and cant fix something as simple as parachutes or cant lease proper servers to handle the client load. Enter at your own risk and expect to be frustrated beyond belief at times.Edit July 7/2018. I can no longer recommend this game switched my review. Bluehole is an excuse machine greedy constantly dropping quick money grabs and not fixing the game. Constant lag hacking issues bugs that have been in the game since launch. They have a mountain of money but either an immense amount of greed or an immense lack of developer talent. Either way not worth the money unless they actually commit to better servers and bug fixes. Such a disappointment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But sadly there are too many bugs and optimization issues that make this game unplayable for me. I don't get good FPS which I get with ALL my other games. However I really think that if the PUBG Corp. really focused on the game's overall optimization bugs and quality instead of being so fixated on making money then it would easily outnumber Fortnite and any other battle royale game exponentionally in terms of players. I really wanted to give this game a thumbs up but sadly that's just not realistic.

2018-07-07,0,0,156,False,Not Recommended,When I got the game in summer of 2017 it was really fun and enjoyable but as the game's lifespan progressed it got worse and worse. The gameplay and concept is nice (generic battle royale game) but right now the game is very poorly optimized and has frequent frame drops and bugs. If the game was optimized well then the game would be really fun like it was in the past. The large maps and vehicles are fun and the variety of attachments are nice (although a bit overwelming at first). Personally this game is a lot more fun with friends than it is solo.Very fun game but the optimization ruins it. If better optimized in the future then maybe it will see a rise in players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-27,0,0,835,False,Recommended,As a person who has played 700+ hours on PUBG i would like to share my opinion with the game. As a European player i have encountered less than 5 cheaters since i started playing so for me cheating isn't a issue. I do think it's kinda stupid that you have a higher chance to get a crate that needs a key than receive one that is free to open. After all you played for those battlepoints and you want to get something in return. Altough that is an issue it doesn't bother me all that much. Further i would like to say something about the battle pass. Im totally fine with the fact that you have to pay for it because it adds extra content and a fresh blow to the gameplay. Now it's time to discuss the desync that's going i've always had a little bit of desync but it has increased in the last month to the point where you are behind a wall for 1 2 seconds and you get knocked killed or hit. This is the biggest problem in my opinion and needs a fix as soon as possible. BUT this isn't going to stop me from playing because PUBG has given me fantastic moments with my friends and of course some bad moments like every game. Altough there are a lot of things that need to be improved i would still buy it again and recommend it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you die due to an aimbot and get #2 that is still a win in my book. I don't care so much about ranking this game is still a lot of fun.You are dropped onto an island and have to try to run and pick up loot. I love how there is no leveling system and nobody starts out with any advantage over another person other than their skill and knowledge (and I guess hacks). You can choose to drop in a hot zone and fight out for the winner to get a ton of loot or drop in a remove area and try for the sneaky approach to win.

2017-11-11,0,0,858,True,Recommended,This is a difficult review. The game has alot of positive sides like bringing friends together easy matchmaking so when you die or win you will quickly get back into the killing and it's sure as hell competetive.It does however have alot of drawbacks aswell. Im sure alot of them will be fixed over time I just sure hope they don't go all Bohemia about this. Alot of fame and players have arrived fast thanks to Twitch.TV and for some reason this has made the development process alot slower. Patches seemes to have slowed down and new content is slowing down.Allthough at the time of writing this they have the Vaulting feature in the works aswell as new maps. The negative sides atm is Ghost bullets studdering desync and their awfull loot table. I mean when you search entire Rozhok and you only find 2 AR's and some medical stuff something is wrong. The same can be said for the military base. There should be a weapon in every room. So players get equal chances of killing one another. Hopefully this will be fixed soon and the game could be out of ''Pre Alpha'' in a couple of months.I will recommend this game for the ammount of fun i've had.

2017-11-11,0,0,861,True,Not Recommended,PUBG is the Time Warner of video games or PUBG should be called Glitch City.Both of these would be fully accurate titles for a review of this game.What do I mean by they are the Time Warner? They have terrible customer service IE Their anti cheat software is GARBAGE. This game has so many hackers it's actually sad If there were a better option I would drop them so fast. For the love of God someone please release a better option (no fortnight is not a better battle royale).Glitch City? Only game in history where having the high ground is a liability as you shoot into the wall while getting head shot. Constantly shoot into railings that shouldn't stop bullets but will completely block your shot Get shot around the corner because the enemy has figured out how to curve bullets Willing to half cheat by messing with key bindings? Well then feel free to jump out windows. Don't worry we've got an update coming soon (you know in the next 6 9 months) which will allow you to do the same thing. Someone get a gun before you? Charge them and watch as they helplessly shoot around you because you'll glitch their interface. Pulling the trigger on a shotgun will give you a nice small burst of lag as well. That should really help your aim.What I mean by this is the concept is great the execution is GOD AWFUL at best. Yes I'm like 350 hours into this game and yes I'll keep playing it but if a game with a similar concept would release this game will end.They have already driven off a majority of the casual players by having a LARGE population of hackers. Yes there are some really good players out there they are in a different league than I am fully admitted so running into a mix of them and hackers is SUPER fun...The hardest question is would I recommend this game? The answer used to be yes when it first came out and the glitches looked like they may go away. Too late they've already made their money and driven off the player base. That said if you like screaming curse words so loud your downstairs neighbors will think there is spousal abuse occuring (true story) it's a REALLY cool concept just terrible game management...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS was one of my favoite games on Steam until it took a massive downfall after the popularization of the Battle Royale genre and the struggle to stay afloat amongst the other titles. Microtransactions As games like Fortnite and H1Z1 are free to play the integration of ingame skins behind paywalls while undesireable is necessary to make a profit but PUBG at $29.99 has no excuse to make nearly every crate ingame require REAL money to unlock (Only 3 crates ingame are free to open without any cash into the game.) after aquiring a random crate through the ingame currency which can only be obtained through gameplay (Which is a great and fair mechanic no hate) and increases in cost when buying more within a shorter time period. (700BP 1400BP 2800BP)Also after the debut of Fortnite and the success of the paid and free Battle Pass PUBG decided to bandwagon on the idea but rather than allowing players who paid for the game (Save The World in the case of Fortnite) to buy it through the currency which can be earned through gameplay or by paying PUBG forces it to be bought for $9.99 (The exact same as Fortnite however when buying in Fortnite you have excess to be spent in the ingame store.) and the PUBG Battle Pass features MUCH less content of which the majority is only TRIAL items which is total bullsh t when if you buy the game with the Battle Pass $40 total only rewards you with a few exclusive items. Battle Points An ingame currency which can be earned by simply playing the game is a great idea however PUBG does it totally wrong while this point may be disputed BP can only be earned through gameplay and there is no way in which you can purchase it to speed up the process of earning crates which to my knowledge at the removal of the PUBG Steam market is the only way in which the crates can be aquired another gripe about BP is that the majority of things you can buy with it are pure RNG RNG in RNG as a matter of fact as the only thing you can use BP for is buying crates and if you aren't planning on buying keys for the ""specialty"" 1.5k BP locked crate you will spend 700 BP on a crate which you most likely won't ever be able to open unless you buy keys to try your luck at a rare item but unlike games like CS GO no item can be sold bought or traded as of now so it's a lose lose situation. Hacking While I have not experienced this firsthand I have heard that hacking has resurfaced but I can't really describe what it is like as I have played about 3 games in the past 2 months. Overall PUBG has made me hate the Battle Royale genre (Following the PUBG Beta) that I have wanted to be a mainstream genre for a long time as of how many fond memories I have had in the Minecraft Survival Games I honestly want to love PUBG as I hate most other Battle Royale titles like H1Z1 and Fortnite but can't find a way to love PUBG after all the sh t that Bluehole has done to the game.I sadly cannot reccomend PUBG in it's current state there are better titles for similar or cheaper.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,203,False,Not Recommended,"If whatever Playerunknown said and promised during H3's Podcast will be fulfilled by the devs I could rate this game 9.5/10.Yeah there are some issues about rubberbanding/lags optimisation also hackers. However if you watch the update progress from April 2017 you can clearly see that dev actually put efforts on making this game great. Compare this game to other massively multiplayer survival games like DayZ and you will say ""holy quot . Remember that making and developing a game is not easy. I can say that this game is worth more than its current price.Despite of the positive review there is still 1 negative side of this game. Normal people (non streamer) can't make their own custom games. This shows that devs still favor streamers over us (plebs). Hopefully custom games will be available for all players. There is also another suggestion which I could give. Since modding is not possible I hope that PUBG gives us the opportunity to use their own PC/server to host games/custom games (so similar to CSGO).Overall I give this game a rating of 8.0/10. Update The fact that map selection and language selection for random squad isn't implemented yet is quite disappointing. Days ago I played with my brother and I had a bug where he can't revive me after being disconnected from the game. This bug happens after the game has been updated. This is showing lack of commitment from PUBG company. They had the option to update test server so that people can test it before implementing the game.Rating 6.5/10 Update 2 Wow so you (Blueballs) now introducing Event Pass? your system. Trying to milk the out of the players before the game is dead? Still insisting that normal players ie. those who are not famous shouldn't be able to play custom games or do modding?

2018-06-30,0,0,399,False,Not Recommended,This game could be tons of fun. It has a great platform however it has been ruined by a ton of hackers with no signs that the company wants to fix the problem. Investing 45+ minutes into a game just to be Aim Botted is not what I would call a good game and this happens to me 33% of all the games that I play (as of the past 1 2 months). How many hackers have to be in every game for me to get cheated 1/3 games when there are 100 people to start? If cheating wasnt enough to ruin the game the management of the game has been poor (not a strong enough word) since its release. Huge updates from 3 6 gb occur on almost a weekly occasion and the servers shut down at the worst possible times. Rather than schedule server shut downs at times where nobody is likely to be playing they chose prime gaming hours around 9pm 1am. If you are into shooters than you probably know the importance of building a sensitivity to the guns and the arsenal to know what weapons are best for any given situation. Honestly I appreciate attempts to balance gun dynamics however the gun functions change so frequently and so dramatically that it is impossible to get a feel for the game. Whether its nurfing guns buffing guns or changing bullet speed and bullet drop in a gun specific way the constant change gets annoying and deters from wanting to get invested in the game.And to corroborate what other reviewers have stated the game is shifting to a monetary reward system is a terrible way. Already PUBG suffered from any incentive to play (i.e. lack of a sense of progression) and now any reward based system has turned almost exclusively monetary. Pay for crates pay for items pay for keys to open crates. Now thankfully the pay based scheme doesnt improve chances to win its only cosmetic but without having a reward system for others not interesting in spending real money for fake items it makes the game get dry and monotonous after a while.Also they keep resetting the ladders. This does help to bump cheaters off and give a fighting chance for others but cheaters shouldnt exist in the first place.Overall the gameplay is great but the incentive to continue and invest time is terrible and steeply declining due to cheaters and the inability of the producers to fix the issue. I dont understand how they expect their buisness model to succeed. People have created a real monetary market based around the cosmetic items which encourages cheaters to seek profit from the system. The more cheaters the less people will want to play the more the market will diminish. The more reward based systems are turned exclusively to monetary purchases the less invested players will get and the less people will want to play. People dont want to invest their time and energy into a dying game which is how PUBG is turning out. I would not recommend this game until the problems are resolved however I fear the game has been tarnished too much already to ever be able to bounce back.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-20,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT You've read my review? well bleach that memory game became a ing disaster. I was sceptical about PUBG since it started gaining popularity seeing my friends play it more than CS GO literally SCARED ME TO DEATH that something can be even more toxic. Wellp comes out I was wrong.PUBG is a neat game graphics are decent ish (weaker than most games understandable when the amount of playing ppl is +/ 100 per game) Lore there is none needed except Po i being your city.Gameplay? simple as EFF. but extremely addicting because of the high risk high reward of being either shot or ran over with a vehicle for this sweet red crate. except that you have to run shoot drive drive by shoot etc. pretty much what action FPS stands for.this game could be considered MMO for it's amount of players both overall online and in the game it won't die so easily.Bluehole one of my fav studios since Black Desert Online is really neat developer sadly with all this greed and PUBG being one of the most played online games right now it had some DRAMASAdverts of VPN services in china (I'm polish yet heard about it) microtransactionsCS GO THEEMED MARKETPLACE BUT INSTEAD OF WEAPON SKINS YOU GET TO BUY A SLAVIC TRACKSUIT OR A FREAKIN JACKET. JEEEEEEEEEEEZZall those dramas are still better than SW Battlefront 2 or Destiny 2 and it's reduction DLCs and exp bars.TBH as a player of many genres i have to say Battle royale is not the future rather a standard a soon to be called ""requirement"" for future indie shooters.Hope that won't be the case and PUBG will be considered a classic after a year of it's release!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-02,0,0,141,True,Not Recommended,To preface this review of the PUBG I used to advocate for this game to all my friends and wanted them to get hooked on the game like I did. Instead of the game getting better with each patch it seems that the game has been increasing in bugs and it seems like Bluehole doesn't care because they've made tens of millions of dollars on the game.Until desyncing player models getting randomly stuck when parachuting non consistent loot drops (i.e. looting an entire town to only find pistols and shotguns. Like make it so there are set amounts of AR's Sniper Rifles and SMG's in each town or something to help the game encourage exploring and engaging in combat versus hiding in the same place the entire game) environmental clipping not being accurate to the models (i.e. when shooting at someone and their head is sticking out from behind a rock or wall some of the clipping sticks out further than the actual object so you can't hit the player's head) and terrible server connections (i.e. multiple times in a game my squad will experience network lag one or twice every other game usually when in a firefight) are addressed I cannot recommend anyone play this game. If you want a fun BR game that is fun and optimized get Fornite Battle Royale. It's free and comes with loads less of bugs and frustration. Once the Bluehole stops wasting time hosting esports events adding unnecessary weather effects and bragging about player numbers on twitter for this buggy unfinished and completely broken game and starts dedicating time to fix the bugs listed and more that I can't come up with off the top of my head and improving the quality of life of PUBG then I and probably many others will start playing this game willingly and not reluctantly with friends that just got the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have tried to get on this game every now and then trying to give it another shot I even kept up with the updates in hopes things will be adjusted I was wrong it's a damn bummer / Expect long walks and a loot simulator.

The loading screen also freezes and forces me out of the game and even when I restart the game it still freezes (And yes my pc isnt a toaster).

As much as I don't mind playing with players all over the world a great thing about the internet! however when you cannot hit them due to connection and the game STILL being unoptimised it makes the fun run out quickly. The Devs need to sort out the server bouncing and ristrict access to the closest servers only. I would'nt go on the NA server when I'm in the UK so why others feel the need to go on other servers is beyond me... Overall a great fun game when you get a good lobby however as it stands its in need of some dire work! Would I recommend it?

Lasting longer hitting people and especially getting kills earns you points to get cosmetics but those points don't get you many cosmetics of any value unless you want to pay real money for keys.

2017-08-21,0,0,494,False,Not Recommended,The game's developers are out of touch with what people want. *COUGH miramar sucks dont force us to play it we altered files to get rid of it and you banned us for it COUGH* People play this game so heavily because its the best the genre offers not because the people behind the magic are making good decisions.If you want a competitive BR then play Islands of Nyne. If you want a BR that panders to children and casuals play Fortnite. PUBG basically provides aesthetic appeal with gunplay somewhere between clunky and polished and always somehow buggy.Technically it's not that great. In fact if you get technical and break it down its a horrible game. But people said the same thing about counter strike when it came out. There are a lot of flawed mechanics that detract from it's viability as an esport...or even a competitive game in any fashion. Cheating is a serious problem that is commonly downplayed by kids these days because they feel mature or something for being the bigger person and admitting they got beat fairly. Nuh uh kid you got sprayed from 400m away with a SCAR L and every shot hit you no recoil.Heres whats up A visual recoil animation is coded into the game regardless of the physics of the firearms or bullets. This means that you can run custom scripts on your mouses software that are undetectable by any anti cheat (even ESL AC) and COMPLETELY remove recoil and your opponent will STILL see recoil in the kill cam. That coupled with how freaking easy it is to subvert their anti cheat and the kid culture of downplaying cheating has made it extremely prevelant. I mean ffs before Shrouds fame he was considered a dirty CSGO player that many in the scene considered a cheater but since he never got caught and theyre contractually obligated not to they never called him out. Btw he quit shortly after a small controversy arose around him. Hmm wonder why?Thats not even the worst. There are browser based cheats that they'll literally never be able to address. Literally. If you read this and they eventually change it I will buy you any game off Steam just add me and contact me. While there are various and diverse browser based cheats the major offender is an API cheat that displays the world map of the server you're currently on as well as everyones position in real time...Yes map hacks...open in a browser window like chrome firefox palemoon you name it. Your favorite streamers probably use this. The vast majority of people in the top 100 use this. For crying out loud we have people like choco taco claiming a guy that never saw him headshotting him through a wall isnt cheating because its heinous to call someone a cheater and yet a viewer in the same match as him posts the replay and the guy is obviously cheating and then gets banned...for cheating.Grow a pair be honest to yourself at the very least. The game isnt riddled with hacks its riddled with scripters and cheaters of all kinds.Once you get past the cheats then theres the mechanics and leaderboard metrics.You can ing avoid everyone get one kill once in 100 games and be in the top 100. Pathetic.In tournaments they disable red zones and alter loot distribution and spawn pools. Why? Because its not competitive? Because its not fair and heavily luck based? Thats not fun. Thats not even ing smart.Its the same t we see in most Asian games. Most people dont even realize that PUBG before you ever played it was bought up and completely developed by an Asian company. How many asian games have you talked about before? Probably several and if you havent then you havent played any.tl drIts worth $30 but i want you to know what you're buying into. This is the reality of it. Yes you will have fun. But you will also run into some of the most extreme t from devs and players youve ever experienced. Not moral t like you see from EA. But its still fun enough to often push through it all and enjoy it with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-11,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,At launch this game was redeemable for being immersive and fun as a team Despite all the bugs. The game now at full release is plagued with hackers in which the dev's seem to do nothing about. Since the issue began its been becoming worse and each game ive played (no joke) since launch has had at least 1 2 hackers. Last game i played someone lobbed over 20 grenades at me and killed me with perfect precision aim to the head. The grenades are possible but not likely without hacks but the precision kill is what got me. Not to mention the hacking raiding parties that camp in populated locations just to ruin your game. Those are really fun!A warning to all possible buyers Don't buy this game.

2017-12-23,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I'm on the fence looking whether or not this game deserves a positive or negative review.I started playing right when the game went into alpha and was met with a long loading screen and notable optimization issues such as taking an exceedingly long amount of time to render the map general lag in the pre plane lobby rubberbanding and so on and so forth. However...The game itself is fun as I've played about 10 12 games now both solo and multi player squads. The looting reacting to contact random crate drops drive bys reviving teamates taking on multiple squads while you hide in a bathroom makes a incredibly enjoyable experience when get your chicken dinner. Devs seem to be continuing their work of creating a better smoother experience unlike previous games that were abandoned as soon as the devs were happy with the amount of bank they brought in.This game is worth checking out IF you don't mind it still being a buggy experience.EDIT More lootboxes event pass and still no optimization?

2018-07-11,0,0,271,False,Not Recommended,PUBG is a game that I spent a significant amount of time in and watched it grow from its true early access form to its half way released mess that it has become as of the time of writing this review. TL DR I would not recommend this game based on the microtransactional model which the developers/publishers Microtransactions have many flavors and styles that are different for each developer and publisher some are more friendly to players than others. Many people do not have a problem with microtransactions as a whole and in 2018 microtransactions are par for the course in the gaming industry. However as a gamer I have seen many different microtransactional systems and I would argue that PUBG has gone with the model which least fits the genre and style of its game. PUBG's closest competition is a completely free to play game Fortnite. Fortnite uses a model where each item has a set price on the Fortnite store and has a season pass system similar to the one introduced to PUBG with the Sanhok update. Unlike Fortnite however PUBG uses an additional system where you earn chests through gameplay but they will randomize the chests you recieve from your gameplay. Some of these chests require $2.50 for a key to open the chest but you do not get to choose to recieve only chests which do not require keys or chests with keys. Meaning you could play for multiple days and get the maxmium weekly amount of chests for that week but not get a single chest which you can open without spending more money. This practice alone is why I do not recommend the game. Had PUBG gone with a free to play model I would not complain I would say that it is a fair compromise for a game offered for free. However this game as of writing costs $30. And it is not fair to introduce event passes and paid chests in a game which already has a healthy market for cosmetics and has one of the largest player base for a PC early access game in the history of Steam making record after record for concurrent players. This game feels as if it is merely trying to cash out the check of its popularity with monetary schemes which in my opinion are unfair for players and are a slap in the face to anyone who has been with this game since the start. Literally the only thing I ask for is that you be able to choose whether you would recieve a reward of a chest with paid keys or not. This would return fairness to the loot system of the game. In terms of gameplay it isnt that great anymore the Time to kill when someone starts firing on you is rarely if ever long enough to mount any sort of defense so essentially the gunplay has evolved into an elaborate game of hide and seek where unless you are extremely lucky someone seeing and firing at you before you see them means instant death and a waste of possibly 30 minutes of game time amounting to nothing more than a paltry sum of battle points which can't even be used fairly as outlined above.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At this point I fear lag problems and such will probably not be answered during this games lifetime so I would recommend going for some other franchise.UPDATE few months afterwards still the same almost all bugs continue unfixed server lag and crashing is still with us and has actually spiked after a large update from bluehole.

Now throughtout my playing time i have never been in a game with a hacker (that im aware of) and i have never been personally kicked.

The battle royale mode has become very stale and although they were not the first they did do a very good job at the time however it too has become flooded with micro transactions on top of the 27 purchase which although does not ruin the experience is a bit annoying. The maps are massive however i would deem this a slightly bad thing as you rarely get into combat for the first 5 minutes or be killed in a minute. I do enjoy driving around the map in the buggies with team mates hanging out of it. The desert map is in my opinion the worst as you can see players from a mile away but again there are several maps to keep the game less repetitive compared to other more popular games in the genre. Overall I do enjoy playing the game however you are probably better buying it in the sale.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-23,0,0,506,False,Recommended,"Intro Where to begin. I've been playing PUBG since the day it came out I didn't pre order which of course I regret every single day since I bought it literally a few hours after it was available for Order rather than pre order. Playability/Graphics/Smoothness The game has come a VERY long way it's now very smooth at least on fairly high end setups. I've played the game on a variety of Graphics cards and CPU's 1060 1070 1080 1080 Ti and 1080 Ti's x2 in SLI mode. CPUS i7 6700K OC'd at 4.8Ghz i7 8700k also at 4.8Ghz (pesky 5Ghz I can't get it to run at stable speeds ( ) Back to the subject with these setups I've been able to get frames of up to 130 140 FPS in the past 4 6 months I don't think I ever drop below 100 FPS under any circumstance with settings which are mostly set to Ultra/other than effects and shadows which I've got set to either low or med. The guns feel very realistic. GUI/UI So this is a tough one. I think for a game this huge maybe it's not as huge as it once was and it could even be on the decline it has a pretty mediocre UI that's being fairly kind here. They could add the following A) Allow you to tag buildings/positions of enemies/trees/whatever the hell you want so that you don't have to shout to your squadmates ""behind you!"" or ""to the left of the green building"" or ""174!"" Which 90% are completely meaningless or by the time you figiure it out you are dead or they are gone.B) Allow you to place a marker on the map which is visible to your squad mates in 3D like in Fortnite basically so you dont have to use the minimap in anyway. Perhaps this hasn't been done for a legitimate reason like realism? I don't know but I'd personally love to have this. Surely if we were Navy Seals we would have some kind of way to know where we are parashooting into with some kind of smoke which only we can see etc.C) Re design the front page/shop. It's far to laggy clunky and it just feels like a very poorly written game from the very start it's nothing like COD BF Fornite LOL Any Blizzard game basically any other great game out there right now.D) Give us more information in the GUI for example how far a team mate is from you in meters when you are looking toward them. This is a tiny little recommendation. I'm sure many other people could come up with far better suggestions. Sound Now this is a VERY important aspect of any combat game especially FPS games and when you are for example doing a 1 v 1 in a building or you are simply hiding in the bushes... I don't know but I don't always feel like I get a sense for where people are coming from. I'm using high end 7.1 Gaming headsets the latest Corsair Void 7.1 and also the Logitech 7.1 cabled one I don't know exactly which model but it's a good one I've also just tried good stereo headphones. I'm still not sure 7.1 makes any difference at all. The sound quality for the shots can be pretty terrible on some guns like the M15. Does it really sound like that in real life? Some of the silenced shots sound pretty sweet... so it really depends on the gun. Re Playability For me personally it's about having a group of friends who are willing to play with you on a regular basis. If you have that this game is extremely fun. With the release of COD Blackout I've yet to compare as I've not had the chance to play COD Blackout with a group of friends as I can't seem to find any friend who play COD Blackout they play Zombies or Multi... which really surprised me. Anyway. In Summary... PUBG is a great game which I'll forever hold dear as the best Battle Royale game that was ever made up until this point. Perhaps after I play COD Blackout enough with friends I will update this review... that game is highly polished the gun play is amazing and most of the aspects I described above are addressed in this game though not all.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-20,0,0,84,False,Not Recommended,"25 hours into the game. This is what I know so far.First off there are TONS AND TONS AND TONS AND TONS AND TONS of cheaters. Yes you can report them and yes the developer takes the reports seriously. It won't do much good as there are so many cheating these days that it'll not even start to make a dent to report every cheater you get.Second this game is an exercise in how to not have fun. The learning curve is ENORMOUS. You're just now starting out and for those few people not cheating they've been playing long enough that they're superhuman. VERY few people will give you any information or help.Third the problem with Chinese people getting into US servers is still a very big thing. Mroe than 70% of my teammates are still Chinese even after the patch that ""fixed"" that problem. Of course they almost never have a mic or speak english so if they do have a mic they don't speak at all. The ones that do speak so little english that they may as well not speak.Fourth this game will cause you to lose because of the desync a LOT and by a LOT I mean almost every map you are going to lose because of desync or because the other guy is cheating like crazy or because weird glitches happen like ""a floating bush appears in front of you so if you touch it you explode"".The game is so seriously flawed it's not really playable. You will not win a chicken dinner unless you've already played for a very very long time or you're cheating like crazy. It's just not possible. But it can still be fun if you recognize that fact and play anyways right?Not usually. You'll die by the cheapest stuff ever imagined like ""you nose dive immediately when the plane allows you to jump out so you should land absolutely first. When you get towards the ground three dozen people pass you. They get guns immediately and shoot you as soon as you drop your chute"". Or ""you land as fast as possible. As you move towards the building only two feet from you a guy that somehow already landed and found a vehicle runs you over as his buddy who already landed and found a gun that is hitching a ride shoots you"".The game is just unplayable. I can't get my 30 bucks back from steam because I've had it for a week but you can't tell that it's an unplayable broken game within the time frame they give you for refunds it takes longer than that to install. So instead I'll be doing a bank fee reversal for the cost of this game and if steam bans my account for doing so I really don't care because they allowed a game as broken as this to be on the store for this long without forcing the developer to fix the game or pull it from the site until it is fixed. I don't care. This was MY money for a working game that can be possible to enjoy not broken crap that you can't possibly enjoy due to cheaters server problems and maps seeming to think it's fun to never give people weapons (land in named areas to find weapons my ).Oh and the ""we're sorry for the problems here's free RP"" was a slap in the face. All the stuff you can buy with the RP requires a key to unlock and keys of course cost real money.I'm having my bank reverse charges.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are a few problems such as the very low and unstable tickrate and the subpar anti cheat ( although i havent encounterd any cheaters for almost a month now so i think that the problem is prettey much solved ). The Newest Update has caused performance crippiling issues but im positive that they will be patched immediatley ( also you can fix the issue if you dissable replays and deathcam)Before the last update the game ran fareley well but i would recomend a somewhat strong cpu otherwise you may see fps drops into the 30s or below in higly populated areas. If you need 1080p and 60 fps i recomend a minumum of a 750 ti / r7 360 (which will acheive that on low settings ) on amd but the game is playable with a 660 (or lower if youre willing to lower the resalution ). I am able to reach 1080p 60fps with A mix of very low to medium settings with this game.The game is amazing with friends. especially a squad of 4 and has great momments but also delivers an enjoyable expereincemy system specs Gpu Radeon r7 360Cpu Amd a10 7700k ( Deffinitely should avoid a cpu this weak for this game)Mobo Asus a68h EMemory 8gb of ddr3 ( 8Gb is fine but most people reccomend 16Gb),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-27,0,0,101,True,Recommended,"So I have only played it maybe 15hrs so far and I love every second of it EXCEPT clunky mechanics. It isn't to the point where it's unplayable but everything is kinda sluggish and ""have to give it another go"" type stuff. That really gets under my skin. It's annoying and frustrating especially if you're in a firefight with people. For example to open a door you press ""F"". You might have to push F three times before the game registers you pushed F and then it might close in your face when you try to go through. Then (my worst comaplint) is when you're prone and you try to get up and run and your guy just sits there or goes into a crouched position. Super annoying and detrimental. Z needs to be overwritten by ""Shift"" C needs to be overwritten by ""Shift"" You should never have to push the same button twice to return to your previous position. If i'm prone and I press ""Shift"" to run I expect my guy to get his off the floor and haul Not ing sit there like a sitting duck until I mash Z 600 times before he finally decides to move. Another annoying ""feature"" is not being able to shoot through windows (very easily). Sometimes if you get too close to a window your gun will just pop up and not allow you to fire. Super convienient when you're in a firefight and you have 4 bullets / second coming towards you. Like seriously? It's a window you pillock. Sometimes the splash screen will freeze the game too. Hit detection is kinda garbage and the frames drop sometimes if you're in a heavy firefight. Not good. With all these complaints being said I really would reccomed the game to anyone because its super ing addictive especially if you play with a duo or a squad and the fun kinda overlooks the bad stuff. It's a load of fun looting buildings and posting up and strategizing with people. All in all I give this game a 6/10. cons laggy glitchy buggy poor hit detection mechanics are clunkypros a ton of fun auto matchmaking for squads (thank christ) replayable lots of places and items to explore the UI is goodAfter a while you start to overlook the bad stuff and just adapt to it but it shouldn't be that way. Please don't let this review stray you from buying it becuase you would seriously miss out on fun be be mindful of what I said before.

Way too much RNG too much server problems too many bugs people teleporting around because of dsync and like this. DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS U LIKE TO GET FISTED BY BLUEPEARL,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-19,0,0,722,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game during this time last year when it promised a lot of action room for optimization. Over the course of the past year all the developers have done is figured out the maximum possible ways to make a profit out of the game and squeeze every last bit of penny from your pockets. Earlier the game promised custom game options for all but it turns out they have already prepared a roadmap for you to pay them more along the way for these benifits. I suggest they make the game available on Local Servers so people can play it with their friends without waiting for Try again servers are too busy for hours. All in all the game seemed to be worth the price initially before the blue ballsack turned greedy too.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-05,0,0,698,False,Recommended,Game has been optimized and runs smoothly on my pc save for the occasional ui lag which affects everyone. The 2018 road map looks great as 2 new maps are being added one of them just finishing its closed beta. I started playing recently and I have no idea how i already have this many hours. If you are coming from fortnite expect a much harder aiming/ ballistics system as well as slower gameplay if you land far from the plane and avoid hotdrops. So far the only real t I die from that isnt my fault is getting run over by my own vehicle. (admittedly my fault after the third or fourth time). Even if you dont win this game is very satisfying no matter what playstyle you choose unless you are a camper in which case you wont even be able to turn or switch weapons without being heard. Also sounds that depend on what you are carrying are to be added. The price is reasonable and I would buy again if i had a choice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-10,0,0,370,False,Not Recommended,My opinion on PUBG is one of extremes. On one hand I absolutely love PUBG while on the other I absolutely hate it sometimes.At it's core it's really a dynamic experience game to game and the possibilities of engagements and fights you can get in are seemingly limitless. It's fun and engaging rage inducing and adrenaline pumping and as you get used to the game and the victories and losses mount you notice problems but up until last patch they were not game breaking for me.This game has got simultaneously better and worse with each big patch and with 1.0 I decided it was time to review this game.I do not recommend it as of now.This game is broken and has become worse the past two major patches. From effects and environmental objects not rendering in consistently between players to server registry of shots. Both players shooting at each other face to face but half of one players shots not registering is a huge problem. On more than one occasion it decided the fight and I have been on both ends of this exchange and have won rounds and lost rounds because of it.Cheaters are becoming more prevelant in the game where I went from seeing a few potential cheaters to people with pans in front of their faces getting repeated neck shot at 200m by a guy with a red dot and watching replays of players track me and my teamates through a wall. It really can put a damper on an otherwise good time. I cannot speak for third person but I have been getting more and more in first person.Lastly the loot distribution in this game is awful. I believe that although there are good spots in almost every major zone the loot seems a little TOO random. Although this is part of the game if the loot were a little more balanced or predictable in spawning the game I believe would be much better (Ex One AR one SMG one shotgun with chances at more spawning per major house cluster or One AR/Shotgun/SMG and one Lvl 2 equippable item per warehouse with chances of spawning more). This is personal preference but it is something that I see as a problem where randomization is a bit too extreme.I have gotten my money worth but I may not have if I started playing after 1.0.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Here is some of my parts to my PC Graphics GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1060 CPU Intel Core i5 6500The game runs choppy and there are lag spikes here and there so I hope when the full version of the game releases the optimization will be fixed.

2018-02-16,0,0,313,False,Not Recommended,I have fun sometimes but the laggy sh*tfest it is with Chinese players is beyond horrible. Simple solution is to region lock the game other than create some all in one international servers for everyone to join. They have region servers for a reason yet they exploit the lag to their advantage as usual. And before some politically correct idiot says that it's racist it's not and it's just a simple observation. The Chinese players happen to be the majority of the well proven cheaters as well go figure. These Asian players are a plaque on the playability of this game from the many hours of game play just from myself all the way back to early alpha. These same players ruined Battlefield games as well. Asian and South American players with bad or high pings and using cheats to boot. The tick rate on this game is horrid as well.

2017-06-21,0,0,719,False,Not Recommended,It's fun as hell. Still needs improvement in terms of performance granted it is still in Early Access so there's surely improvements coming down the road. EDIT This game is just simply unacceptably broken even after 10 months of it's initial release. Over a year ago I bought this game during early access and despite the fact that it was broken in many ways I trusted it would get better when coming out of early access. As I update this review the game still has a ton of broken netcode issues matchingmaking issues and broken game mechanics. This game is on it's death bed and honestly deserves nobody's attention. The approach that Bluehole has taken to resolve the game's issues seem admirable but incredibly ineffective as with each patch things seem to get worse.Don't buy this game. If you want a BR experience there are better options out there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-08,0,0,322,False,Not Recommended,"I have 300+ hours on the game at first it was amazing. Nothing compared to the game. This compared to Fortnite was like Gods to men. For months i looked forward to playing this game everyday as the days went on i started noticing things. Things like players teleporting across the map people randomly shooting in the air and killing me over 5km away the desync slowly progressively getting worse and worse. It has gotten to the point i dont even touch the game anymore and forget i even have it for the most part. At time i try to pick it back up hopping it will be better but every time i am let down once again. This game opened up the world to what a great genre this is. Sadly its become derailed everything this game could have been is gone far out the window being picked up by other companies who are doing those things so much better. I love this game for what its done for me throught the time i have played it but it has lost me as well as many others for the lack of communication dedication and maintenence form the developers. I would go as far as saying this game was better as and Alpha and Beta compared to the ""FULL"" release of the game. If you are looking for a good BR game this was one of them just not anymore. Maybe Bluehole will get their act together and bring this game back into the light but until then i can not play it any further without wanting to smash my keyboard into my monitor.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you join the NA server you will find that there are more players from china in your match than there are actual Americans. 75% of those are hacking.

2018-04-08,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,Simple answer is this game is not fun. Long answer is that I can see why people like this game. It really draws you in and gives you the urge to keep playing. You spend 30 minutes running around trying to find better items. The last 10 minutes of a match you spend trying to dodge the oddest firearm controls I have ever seen in a game. As an example I just finished a round where the player who killed me first nearly blind fired a sniper rifle at me and hit then pulls out his M4 with a holographic sight and proceeds to just lob bullets at me killing me. The match before that I was toe to toe with an enemy. On my screen I unloaded an entire magazine into him he ended up killing me. Upon watching the replay it showed I didn't make a single dent in his heath. Ultimately this is my biggest issue with this game. The gun mechanics do not make any sense and are not natural. The graphics are nice but I have had instances where because my graphic settings are different from other players they may not see the vegetation I am hiding in so to them I am just crouched in the middle of a field. The network backend always has some form of lag in it and constantly throws error messages saying it couldn't connect. Other than that the game is solid. Looking at other players feedback it seems I am not the only person to feel this way. If it is on sale I say go for it but I wouldn't pay full price for it again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-18,0,0,21,False,Recommended,yes i recommend this game. I see all of these reviews complaining about chinese players and cheaters. I have only played a few matches of PUBG on PC. Within those matches i never ran into a cheater. Everytime i lost it was fair and square (and somtimes hilarious) I Have started to put some decent play time into the xbox one S version as well since my friends play the game on xbox. We have a blast every single time and we have even won a few matches together and dammit all never ran into a single 'cheater'. Idk if a lot of you are just blaming 'cheating' on why some players are kicking your or maybe this game does have a problem (or previously did?) either way i have not experienced really any issues..... except for 2 things. Games needs to be optimized better (which they have been improving noticablly hats off to the devs for the hard work) and a couple game crashes. Even with those it comes down to game optimization. Hopefully they will continue to improve on the game as they have been.Final note all the guns feel AMAZING to shoot! as the games stands unfinished I rate a 8/10. I will be playing more and more. Once the optimization is resolved this game could be unstoppable. Keep It up Devs you got a fanboy,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-12,0,0,203,False,Recommended,This is my first review on Steam but I wanted to post one on this game. The biggest reasons for me wanting to post this review are 1. This game has been a lot of fun for me and I haven't been this addicted to a game since WoW back in 2004ish. I don't know if it's the rush of dropping into School/Hacienda and actually surviving or getting to those last 10 players but it's been one that keeps me engaged.2. I've never been a big player of FPS games. Counter Strike was the one I played the most back in early 2000s which wasn't all that much. However this game has been a lot of fun.3. This game gets a lot of flak.Let me preface this by saying that I am very calm person I don't think I have ever gotten mad about a game. I may get slightly frustrated at myself for doing something dumb but never raged over a bug or losing. So take that into consideration as this game may not be for those who are quick to anger at games. Anyways here the list of pros and cons from my point of view. PROS Easy to learn hard to masterVariety of play stylesFun with friendsVariety of weapons that are fun to mess withVery exciting when in combat and in top 10 situationsQuick to get into a new roundStrategyMultiple towns/locations to explore and learnGraphics are pretty good CONS No region lock Biggest complaint I see. I rarely play squads without people I know so I'm not too familiar here. Cheaters I have encountered a few cheaters however like I said above I don't get upset with games so I just start a new match. Bugs These have been worked on quite a bit since the release of 1.0 but you do still get occasional crashes or load screen freezing. RNG This one can be slightly irritating at times but it's part of the game so nothing to really stress over. As an example I looted two whole apartments one time and only got a pistol. On the flip side dropped into a house one time and found 2 level 3 helmets and vests. Sometimes loot just doesn't make sense but I know it's randomly generated so whatever. Unfulfilling This one is subject to opinion but I know at times it can feel like a waste as you spend 20 minutes looting only to be one shotted by an AWM from someone you didn't see. A lot of people hate that part of this game.Overall like I said above. I would recommend this game as it's given me plenty of enjoyment. Most games nowadays I'll play for maybe 10 20 hours tops and either get bored or feel like I've completed everything I want to. This one keeps pulling me back because it's always a rush. There's just something different about a free for all survival than the typical FPS deathmatch. Hopefully they will continue to work out the issues that are still out there but I'll continue playing either way because I'm enjoying it. That's really all I can ask for from a game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-18,0,0,520,False,Not Recommended,****ing people playing in their non regions literally ruining the game. Region lock with invite only plz. Also the amount of cheaters is ridiculous. Will change review when developers get a handle on both issuies.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-18,0,0,536,False,Not Recommended,While I have played this game for quite a while and found much of my time enjoyable the quality of matches has plumitted. This is almost exclusivly due to the number of hackers this game harbors. Unfortunatly this renders a game that is purly based on enjoyment through compitition rather worthless. Examples of hacking include enemies firing wildly into the ocean from a moving vehical and headshotting 4 5 people per magazine who are in a different dirrection across the map as well as enimies who can see your possition and throw an infinite number of grenades resembling an airstrike. Please don't waste your time or your money games are about enjoyment and there is very little to be found here now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-23,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,It's a good game i want to like it even more but the main graphic and connection optimization issues are keeping me from recommending it to anyone to buy at its current state as it is far from a 3xa title and yet it's priced like one. I want to love it but i can't and it's very unfortunate i just wish the issues get fixed in the future and pubg manages to get itself unstuck from the hole it's in at the moment. Now if you want a really good well optimized game to play and you love the idea of pubg i'd say try pubg mobile the rank system graphic and connection optimizations as well as the free crate system and of course the FREE price make it an ideal game to spend time on with or without friends all in all the best alternative currently until hopefully this game sorts itself out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-23,0,0,315,False,Not Recommended,I've been with pubg from nearly the beginning as it started as 'early access.' While it claims to be a full release the game still plays like an early access title. I've had fun with friends and this game is exactly what I wanted in terms of vision just not execution. Lag terrible optimiztion glitches buggy interface and occassional crashes mean you are fighting the game as much as other players. Speaking of players the player base may still be huge but it has fallen considerably and those that leave are the more casual players. The overall skill of the pool feels much higher than even a few months ago meaning that if you are new this game is much tougher to dive into than before. The game can certainly be fun (there's a reason for the hours I have) but there are issues the developer seems unable to address. Instead they focus on monetization with crates and passes. These days my friends and I still have fun games but they are less frequent than before including for those who have only started more recently. That said if I saw real progress on the issues and less focus on monetization I would recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's not perfect of course there's still server problems like lags that allowed your ennemy shoot you 1 or 2 times while you're behind a wall. There's still cheaters but I found one rarely. Very addictive and I will keep playing it and getting better! Very funny when you play with your mates in squad! And if you're solo queu you might fnd funny guys.

The whole game is a desync. literally. Devs concentrate on unnecessary ""fixes"" wich doesn't work in 90% of all cases. Opening a lawsuit against EpicGames/Fortnite &gt withdraw it &gt copy from fortnite in a bad way........... +Only hope is the complete recode&amp overhaul they've announced..but we know bluehole meanwhile.. If they announce something it probably take more than half a year to release OLD REVIEW Ooouuuuhh such a yummy 26bucks game.So creepin' delicious.You can stalk your enemy 4 miles observing him like a little creeping up on him shooting him in the neck and fill your filthy lvl1 backpack with all his dilicous epic loot. Or just drop like Rambo in the middle of the military base instantly loot after droped with your parachute and fckin escalate quickly.And in the end every unique playstyle meets in a tiny speck of this 8x8(km or miles i dunno) map.. what else do you want? great yess?Make sure your PC is able to run it one friend's pretty unhappy while playing his diashow.. So care.. Mid High specs needed.Absoloutely recommended. Total focus on organised teamplay or lucky sneaky lonewolf. Endless opportunities. And killing enemys with grenades is even more satisfying..Don't wait with that carzy system ""Money"" just waste it on this game.. no doubt this ""waste"" going to bring you alot of fun and unsuspected memorys.172hrs in two weeks might be a sign for something.. either this game is awfully good or i might be addicted to a crappy early acces game... just invest that little cash and be amazed.Good work so far",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-18,0,0,47,True,Not Recommended,I was really excited when i first saw this game I think it is an excellent concept that has been poorly executed..I am very disapointed in this game so far it is an incomplete buggy game I understand it is early access but they are releasing the game on console before even getting the game to a remotely playable state on pc.The updates are months and months apart I believe the last 2 updates were released 6+ months apart and instead of fixing most of the bugs glitches and optimization they are releasing new guns maps and vehicles. I dont believe I have played a single game without running into some pretty serious/ annoying issue. I found running the game on the lowest possible settings got rid of half of the issues but its already such an ugly game I could hardly justify lowering graphics to make the game run slightly better. Basically after 30 hours I gave up on the game and will not be back until i see some serious overhauling.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-18,0,0,47,True,Not Recommended,When I bought this game I had high hopes. I played a bit and quickly got a team together with my firends. For the first (roughly) ten matches it was fun. Eventually the game became mostly running and getting shot. Depending on your play style and skill you could avoid this (I could not as I was bad) but that isn't really the complaint I have with this game. The main complaint I have is trying to play with my friends and having the game crash well over 5 6 times. You could get the game running with enough determination but honestly it is not worth it. There are many other battle royal games that are actually functional (fornite). Just go play that game if you like this type of gameplay.In conclusion The game has good mechanics if you like battle royal games. But is nearly unplayable with the crashes and lag. You would think that with only 5 days until the full game is released the developers would have made it more stable. If you are considering buying this game do not.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-21,0,0,300,False,Recommended,Well worth the money. I've almost played this game every day since I've bought it in early access. Ridiculous value for money given how much replayability this has. Even though it's exactly one of two scenarios every time (desert or original map) it still feels fresh due to the unpredictability of other players. I've spent a lot of time playing all the other battle royale styled games prior to this and this is the leader by a long shot. After watching an interview with Brendan Greene (the creator of PUBG / Battle royale format) I have a whole new perspective and appreciation for the game. It takes time and skill to perfect such a large map with such high player numbers.If you're on the fence about buying please just do it it's insane value for the price. I wouldn't be upset if this game had cost me $50+ I've paid much for games I've played a lot less of.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,352,False,Not Recommended,Over 250 hours in this game and I am struggling to put more into it. I originally gave this a good review but it has become over run with hackers and is now unplayable. I am questioning every kill that goes against me as I have gone from winning games regularly to being killed instantly from across the map (I have recorded proof of the worst ones from the deathcam). With upto 100 people in each game you are likely to run into a hacker every single time. For what it is the price of this game is very steep. so it makes no sense that someone would hack only to be banned and waste the 20 + quid that they have payed to play it.Honestly if you're thinking of buying this on PC... I would urge you to reconsider. That is unless you like looting/death simulators,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-16,0,0,283,False,Recommended,"GAMEPLAYYou can play this game solo duo or squad. If you play solo you have two options. Drop in populated areas and probably die before the first 5 minutes of the game or drop where nobody else is and run for 20 minutes not seeing a single person only to get shot and killed and not even know where it came from. Do not play solo if you are easily angered. You will undoubtedly end up enraged. If you have poor self control you will probably break your monitor. I learned that the hard way. Duo and squad is a lot and I mean A LOT more fun. Having friends to play with makes pretty much every game better but in my opinion it is an absolute necessity for PUBG. As long as you don't take the game too seriously and are playing with friends (and don't experience any of the techinical/optimization issues or bugs listed below) you will probably have a good time and only rage a little bit. On the other hand if you play solo I doubt you will have any fun at all. OPTIMIZATION/SUPPORTThis is probably one of the most poorly optimized games I have ever played. Horrible hit detection ping spikes rubber banding and tons of latency is common for a lot of players. Despite having a decent PC (GTX 1050 i7 Core 16 gigs of ram) and the fastest internet plan my provider offers (300mbps) I have experienced those problems before. Those problems don't occur every time you play the game but they will happen every once in a while. Now lets talk about the devs. Man are they COMPLETE garbage. I know people who have been banned because a they killed a popular streamer and that streamer accused them of hacking even though they werent hacking. Not to mention all of the stupid micro transactions and the recent ""Battle Pass"". The devs are so busy trying to milk their players for every last penny and suing their competition (Fortnite) that they won't even fix their own f*cking game. The funniest part about this is that before they could even fix the optimization and bugs in the PC version of the game they tried to port it to the Xbox. Needless to say it is probably one of the worst if not THE worst port in the history of video games. If that doesn't scream that the devs only care about the money then I don't know what does. F*ck you Bluehole. YOU MADE OVER $720 MILLION SO STOP TRYING TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND USE THE MONEY YOU ALREADY MADE TO FIX YOUR GAME. Watch this YouTube video. It pretty much goes over everything wrong with PUBG. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v Ns3bp2yWA1MMY THOUGHTSDespite all of its te al issues bugs atrocious optimization and pretty much always getting angry playing it my friends and I always find ourselves coming back for more. Our conversations usually go along the lines of ""Hey what should we play?"" ""I dont know."" ""PUBG?"" ""I f*cking hate that game though."" ""Yeah its pretty garbage.""""We got nothing else to do though.""""So yeah?"" ""Sure. But still f*ck this game"" This game is like a drug just like League of Legends. You get so god damn angry playing it (particularly in solos) yet you always come back for more.

This WAS one of the most fun battle royale games to play with quite the active community that had so much potential to be one of the best games on steam.

The servers are full of cheaters and hackers that make the game unplayable. Bugs are still rampant and the developers don't care about anything but making money. But one of the biggest slaps to the face was the Battle Pass system and loot crate design. Expecting people to pay $10 USD on top of the $30 USD for the base game for a buggy cobbled together piece of trash is just insulting and the current loot crate system is just a shameless ripoff of other systems like CS GO except this one is poorly put together and not fun to utilize. As much fun as I had with this game in the past I cannot recommend it in it's current state due to careless developers cheaters bugs/glitches and overall horrible experience. As much as I hate to say it you're probably better off playing Fortnite at this point.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The risk of engaging enemy players is never worth the risk as killing them and achieving their loot is probably not worth it. Despite battleye the game has far too many hackers that come in especially from China. Battlegrounds has also banned people for ""stream sniping"" by killing someone who is streaming the game without ANY evidence whatsoever in the past before match replays and recordings. They cater too much for their streamers and make it so that they are the only one who have CUSTOM GAMES.

2018-03-28,0,0,532,False,Recommended,Honestly to play this game you need to have the right computer specs. I'm writing this review based on my own gameplay. If you can stand the constant spewing of asians screeching and memes in the pre game lobby then you're on your way to a good time. I enjoy the pop culture cancer that erupts from that environment. Once you're in game if you have above average specs you can expect to see loot from when you pop your parachute but if not you have to wait till you land and on top of that hide in a corner for 15 30 seconds until everything renders. Then you may proceed to loot the scraps left behind by the professional e sports ready players with $3 000 Titan Vs. After all this you can put your sheer raw talent to the test. With my case this game has come a long away after nearing 500 hours on it and I can safely say it's my favorite game on steam. I strongly recommend it with all the memeing aside it's honestly a good game with devs that are slowly working on making it better although it's taking forever they truly listen and do try to listen to the community. They've shown that before and although the hype has died down because of fortnite this game still has all the potential to be the best game on the market. Currently they're working on a 3rd map but in my opinion I think what they need to work on is movement and fluidity because the game still feels really clunky and slow which some people might enjoy because it resembles reality. I prefer a fast paced corner cutting edgy feel that puts you to the test when bullets are flying at you.All in all with the current state of the game I give it a *************************** 7.5/10 ***************************.This is because I'm used to the game and the mechanics. Note for new players This game is hard to get into because people are already good. Don't give up when you get shot from out of nowhere this happens all the time. All you have to do is discover the common spots people go to and to always keep an eye on your surroundings. Use the keybind for free look and set it to something comfortable because I honestly use free look more than my left mouse button! The key to winning in this game is to see your enemy before they see you and to position yourself with an advantage. Always think before you shoot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And yes Since I paid for it I am at least entitled to a very good chance of getting all the items.400xp/day don't sound that much but most of the missions reward only 40xp. A ""Premium"" User who purchased the Event Pass does get a bonus to daily XP from just playing but that bonus is laughable at best. Instead of the standard 80xp/day we should be able to get 400xp/day in the same amount of time it takes non premium users to get 80xp.I don't understand why they need to milk PC players in such a disgusting way.

2017-06-30,0,0,159,True,Recommended,I don't understand all this negativety. I'm certain some of it is valid but most of it is just little heads getting mad over nothing. The game is amazing. The only major flaws it has that actually effect gameplay are a lack of optimization and occasional and random server lag. Outside of that it's really ing good. I'm not saying there are no other valid criticisms but those seems to be the major ones from sound minded people. I feel bad if you got unjustly banned from the game but before you got banned how many hours of gameplay did you have on the game? For most it's a whole lot of hours most of which was a positive experience. I know it's still unjust that they banned you(if it was invalid) because it is your property after you buy it(that is of course as long as you don't violate their terms) but most people can't say they didn't get their money's worth out of the game. And did you try talking to support to get your account unbanned? I personally haven't talked to their support or know anyone that has but I really doubt they are mass banning people falsely. And if they were I doubt they would perma ban all those people. And for the people complaining about the microtransactions just shut the up. It's not like they are limiting gameplay. THEY ARE COSMETICS and most can be acquired by just playing the game. And if you can't get a certain item it's typically just 10 30 cents(of course outside of the really rare ones). They do the same in every other major shooter and yet no one complains there. How do you think they are going to monetize the game after launch? Map packs? That would separate the community and there wouldn't be a need to so long as they have harmless cosmetic microtansactions. I really do hate microtransactions but this is one of the few cases where they aren't out for your money purely out of greed. The game has lots of replay value and there is certainly going to be updates long after the full release thanks to these microtransactions. Not to mention they have frequently added to the game since it was put up on steam and continue to do so. In summary people gotta shut the up and enjoy the quality games served to them and stop supporting the ones that do even worse,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-29,0,0,201,False,Not Recommended,Where to start? The game is broken in so many ways the optimalization is horrible and amount of those chinese ching chongs is just way to ing big. But aside from that (and the fact that there are free unity assets used in game XD) it has a huge potential and is incredibly fun with friends. Also the excitement when u are in top 5 then top 3 and finally u are 1 v 1 with the last guy in the zone is just something incredible ofc after some wins it is not so interesting but still worth time spent. 65 hours (at the time of writing this) isn't much but im going to spent much more time in this game with my m8's. The best actions happen with 3 4 man squads when u have 4 vehicles and decide to make a race to second part of the map cuz why not? The game has it's problems mainly 3 (but not only) horrible optimalization amount of cheaters (tho BattleEye is doing good job with purging them) and last but certainly not least the Miramar map.... i honestly don't understand why this map is in the game and why u can't turn off searching it in matchmaking. Remember Erangel&gt Miramar. The game doesn't forgive your mistakes the locations are interesting and offer multiple choices and random loot. Guns are really good looking and have that really nice semi realistic feeling to them some may say it is a flaw but not for me. If u read this u probably don't give a damn XD but still if u are interested if i recommend it here is the simple answer. No don't buy it it is not worth the money NOW as of July 2018.Update 10.07.2018Game is still broken still funny with other players but after considering how much money they got it is just disgusting that they did not fixed most of the bugs and performace drops. Also the map select option after it was added got removed cuz nobody played Miramar and it them so much that they needed to force players to play on it.

NONE OF THIS MONEY HAS GONE INTO THE RECENT DEVELOPEMENT OF THE GAME. Their needs to be new maps every month WITHOUT copied structures pasted all over the map...complet with new guns vehicles and even enviromental dangers to beware of such as cold or radiation...after all this is supposed to be a survival game at its core. Personally I think the game is better off without hunger or thirst mechanics so its great they havent made that mistake yet. I think what Im trying to say is USE YOUR MONEY TO PUSH THE GAME INTO A REAL EXPERIENCE OR CREATE A PUBG2 WITH A BETTER DEVELOPMENT TEAM. Like star citizen is taking some time too but you can see the work they are trying to do and PUBG has 1 major update from last year that seems like a ENORMOUS mistake and even though Bluehole has to know people are starting to look at their game as if it is maybe the biggest joke(middle finger) to every single player in the gaming community they seem as if they have intentions to give us what we really want to play.

I struggled a lot in the early parts of when I played the game so having a beginner system would really benefit me and a lot of people still needing guidance on the game.About the battle pass and stuff like that I am not bothered by skins battle passes and other purchasable items in the game because I don't buy in game products and I play this game because it's fun not a game where you customize your characte by using real money.

2018-09-25,0,0,1118,False,Not Recommended,I loved this game for the longest time. I stuck by it through early access and all the bugs that came with it.But for six weeks it has been unplayable on the Oceania servers. Despite constant attempts by the OC community to get Bluehole to do something about the broken matchmaking they just ignore us. So I cannot reccomend this game as it does not work in my region due to just lazyness on Blueholes part.They're are much better polished look BR games on the way I'm just gonna play them rather than wait for these tossers to get their act together. I reccomend anyone considering purchasing this game does the same.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Ever since early access Bluehole has been playing catchup to fix bugs and add quality of life features. The game is fun and I recognize it has come a long way since the early days but I still have some pretty significant criticisms. 1. Lacking quality of life features2. UI is underwhelming and needs work3. Netcode/servers can be wonky occasionally4. Optimizations needed for smoother game5. There is no offline firing range for practicing and there is also no online custom servers for everyone. (Everyone not just pubg partners aka streamers Bluehole approves)6. Loot box system is beyond underwhelming and lame7. Movement on foot is sluggish and driving is deadly bananas in FPP. These mechanics need refined.8. Asking for money after every single patch.9. You'll feel the game's potential but don t expect a polished AAA experience now or any time soon. At least it is only $30 and a good time. It's just not a great time like it could be.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,I went into this game excited to see what all the fuss was about. I played for a while dealing with constant framerate issues as low as 3 seconds/frame at times (yes you read that right) even on Very Low settings where the game looks like Half Life 1. My computer isn't a monster but I can play much better looking modern games with no issues whatsoever. I had no choice but to ask for a refund.On the gameplay side I didn't get a lot of time with the game so I can't say a lot. I don't understand how this game has gained so much popularity. It's a broken unfinished mess. It has very little in the way of content. It feels like one of the asset flip games that Jim Sterling would dunk on.This experience all comes right before the 1.0 update so maybe it will be better in the future. I don't know. Based on my experience I have to give it a big thumbs down. You might enjoy the game if your computer can handle it and you enjoy survival focused large arena shooters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(silencer . d e . glock . etc etc. custom skins you can also buy . custoimzed . ) so having a default pistol in the start with lessen the ( R N G FACTOR or dying to a noob if u dont land on a gun and they do . when u cleared 5 houses and all u found was a crowbar.other rng factor. The airplane landing. should be at least 5 planes dropping people all in the map. not just 1 PATH 1 plane.no AFK farming because there is 5 planess dropping people so less afk grouped.other rng factor . well the circle . only thing is the circle SHOULD DO MORE DAMAGE. BUT people should out run the circle due to the fact not every one gets a CAR . FINDING A CAR should not determine your skill . and the circle should not Be so fast so people can not just run with the circle.3.needs deathmatch mode or something to help players with the gun practice offical not custom mode.4. should be a smaller map like 50 players 20 players FOR LOWER END COMPUTERS.bigger then map THE LAGGER and bigger the computer you need.5. servers needs to be improved . needs more servers . US WEST US MID US EAST . same with china . china east. china west. china mid.6. rank needs rank rewards . and THE Ranks needs to be yearly reset or have seasons so people ACTUALLY care and worth the grind to climb. 7. esports needs to improve because the camera ankle is boring to watch and needs more clearer esports 8. has so much crashes . bug splash . too much . needs TLC on those . 9. needs somethign to show off your ranks like a badge . or something10. needs name change for steam dollar or something.11.

2017-10-16,0,0,674,True,Not Recommended,Would not buy this game if you're looking for a consistently good/reliable product of video game entertainment.PUBG is just like any other early access game that is being released these days. The game is an unfinished poorly optimized mess. Cannot play the game with graphics settings any higher than 'low' on an nvidia gtx 970. It's been like this for months. And instead of fixing tons of bugs/obvious issues that people have repeatedly complained about they try to grow the esports scene add weather modes to the games that are illogically designed and disregard essential improvements that need to be made to the game.I feel as though the only reason it is still popular is because of the amount of coverage it gets on streams and because there are no other similar battle royale games out there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,211,True,Not Recommended,"As a person who's put almost 200 hours into this game as of writing this review I am utterly disappointed with the product that's been released. A game that implements a ban system for hacking but only uses it to punish those who kill streamers is a terribly poor ban system. The North American server is dominated by wall hackers half the time it's impossible to land on the ground and immediately open a door and the only good thing about this game is the fact that I can laugh at it's terrible physics engine with my friends. I'm absolutely confident when I say this game is still in Beta yet it's apparently in ""full release"" but still it tries to pass itself off as the next ""big competitive E Sports"" game. The first PUBG competition left it's viewers completely off.Honestly Devs if you do even read these reviews. I hope you stop trying to tweak the gun balance in this game and actually start working on the real issues. Get the ban system to start working fix the terrible physics make it so people stop breaking their legs when parachutes get caught on invisible roofs and work on the hit box so bullets stop phasing through people. I don't know how many times I've shot completely through a person because of ""lag"" or another ridiculous excuse. This is just a bad game in it's current state.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-16,0,0,62,True,Recommended,You see all the negative reviews that the game has and most of them do touch on important issues but the game is in EARLY ACCESS. Sure Bluehole could step up the game a bit but I feel like people are too critical of things. A large part of the game is understood through trial and error and pure common sense for example the game is only a walking/running simulator if a) you make it one OR b) you get unlucky. There are vehicles in the game guys... use them. If you can't find them learn potential spawns or drop in a more strategic area. Also you can mostly CHOOSE where and when you will get into combat again by learning from trial and error. and common sense. Dropping on the school combat and about 9 in 10 chance of dying within one minute. Drop somewhere secluded or go to high loot areas that aren't as popular depending on your drop zone (like the shooting range port town or even the bunker system if it's far enough away from the plane's path). See people expect an easy run but it just isn't like that especially near the end you just have to be persistent when you die and keep on going. Also try different modes. Play single player I find it much easier than duo or squad since people don't get downed and there is normally no teaming I average 5th place when I'm put into a single player game opposed to about an average of 20th place when I play with friends consistently. Or try a first person only server it makes the game surprisingly different and quite balanced in my opinion. And for the love of god don't play non stop. Some people can do it good on them but I personally need a break from multiplayer games sometimes. Consider a solid story based game and then re visit when a new update comes out or when you feel like playing again. The game is fun but just like any other it will get boring so instead of complaining about no new content do something else for a change. All in all I think it's worth it. Obviously the devs are going to keep the work up and they even plan a console release so that alone should justify the $30 (or whatever it costs for you). Get it now before it's a AAA title cost. I believe it's worth the money. Thanks for reading all of this hopefully I helped you make a choice in regards to purchasing or if you already own it maybe you learnt or thought of a new strategy! 40 hours playtimeAlso just a side note for the micro transaction haters if it isn't pay to win who cares? Just play the game and have fun. Most things on the Steam Marketplace can be obtained through playing the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-17,0,0,111,True,Recommended,"So Ive given this game a go for the last few weeks and while I have mixed feelings overall I still kinda like it.First off lets be real this is a social game first and foremost and isn't always about getting that chicken dinner. I forget exactly what it was before the leaderboard was wiped but it seems maybe 20% of players EVER win a game. If you're a rich troglodyte kid amped up on redbul and sitting on a 1080 GTX system with a T1 connection I'm sure you'd have a blast going solo and wiping the floor with folks. For the rest of us though we neither have the hardware superiority nor the time to ""get gud"". This is where squad games come in.In my experience playing PUBG is best when playing with friends and getting into all sorts of hijinks (and dying... a lot). For the average aged gamer late 20's to mid 30's this game is pretty damn fun. It's pick up and play it's social and it has enough depth to give the option of getting REAAAALLY into it if you so choose. Hell it took me a month before I figured out going barefoot gave you a slight advantage when moving near enemy players.On the negatives The game engine is not even close to optimized if you're playing with less than 16GB of RAM and bleeding edge Mobo transfers (15 year old me would have a heart attack at this) your game is not going to run smoothly. The U.I. needs work developers are saying that this is a work in progress and will be changed but as of the open beta it's ugly as sin Community support is limited the Steam forums have been abandoned by the developers and their official forums are... unhelpful at best. NOTE If you play this game don't around with the engine unless you know how to code! The pacing of the game is kind of... meh. I think this will improve over time but as it is now you really need to go looking for a fight if you want one before final circle. This can be a good thing and will play to individual playstyles but the devs need to introduce more mechanics that encourage players to converge on an area before reaching final circle. In balancing weapons of the game devs seem to have relinquished realism and tried to gamify their mechanics. Of course this happens with any game but PUBG seemed to be different at first.The positives Excellent for social gaming (I've had some problems with adding friends and whatnot but I think this is a Steam issue rather than a problem with Bluehole) Depth and breadth of gaming experience THERE""S LOTS OF RANDOM TO DO and many different ways to play FPS elements are highly appreciated for those of us used to that experience versus 3rd person games there's a stark difference in playstyles between the 3rd person and 1st person servers that such a simple fix encourages a broader group of gamers to join in. Mechanics of the game may not be innovative but they are executed well.All in all I'd advise giving this game a shot if you have a weekend a few friends and a semi modern gaming rig. However I don't think this is a game worth making a system upgrade for or putting hundreds of hours of your life into it's decent but it isn't that dense.P.S. Hey Bluehole! You should offer 4 pack deals for your game! I can think of a dozen people that I would bring in for the experience if I could get them to have a taste.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,68,False,Recommended,This game is love/hate relationship really. If the game is going well for you and you're striving for greatness then hell yeah! On the other hand if the game is crashing and not going well then damn it!This game is honestly great fun I love the randomness of it and how different each game will be and that is one of the main reasons I keep coming back to it you never know how that match is going play out. You could win or be the first to die who knows!?There is a lot of skill involved but it didn't take me too long to really get the hang of the concept and which weapons to use or to not use etc. Just takes a little bit of expierence and time.I was really surprised by how crisp the game feels I mean It's not perfect but pretty dang good if you ask me. All the guns feel great and different etc.The sounds are incredible thrilling and very scary at times! Play the game on high volume if possible it's definetly the best way to play it.So the only thing I really dislike about this game is the crashes (they happen quite often compared to other shooters I've played). It's going to be different for everyone but for me it crashes about 1 or 2 times every 2 games or so. One thing that's nice though is that if you launch the game back quickly enough it will let you jump back in that match assuming you haven't died yet.Overall a very fun game that I recommend! Expect a very good time and a bit of frustration here and there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,227,True,Recommended,PUBG is a very fun battle royale game with a lot of different weapons attachments and more. This game is most fun when you are playing with a squad of people ( like most games) because you can use communication to find and kill enemies using the games compass. The objective is jump out of a plane flying over the map land loot kill and win. This game is also very laggy at times and there is little effort put into this game (at the moment) I am writing this review hoping that the new pubg update will make this game a lot better because lag is something that ruins the game for me at times.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-20,0,0,11,True,Recommended,This game offers a fresh take on battle royale style games. Each match is slightly different from the next and depending on where you choose to start the action can begin from the time you hit the ground to take out the players around you. Of course you do have the option to parachute to a location that is away from the chaos and simply try to stay low and survive. You'll want to loot quick and move across the map as the playable area becomes smaller and smaller.Although I'm not the best at the game it does offer a fun exciting gameplay that keeps me coming back.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are other gripes you can make as well but honestly they ultimately dont matter enough to me for me to hate this game. This game is one of the best games I have played on my PC. Albeit this is my first battle royale game and im fairly new to PC gaming (about a year) so my opinion may be a little skewed however i have played all other AAA games on consoles etc and i do truly enjoy PUBG very much. Its really fun especially if you have a good amount of friends that can consistently play with you. The best feeling is having those 5 8+ kill games and ultimately getting that chicken dinner. The combat is great and fun and bluehole has made numerous optimizations to the game along with more to come.

2017-10-18,0,0,25,True,Recommended,I personally think this game is pretty good but as far as overall score goes I give it a 6/10 here's why Pros Great with your friends if you want to spend the night gaming Great player match system it fits to your skill level Although combat does not have a whole lot of variety it is enjoyable to fight other players in a tight space which is usually where you will fight Map is nice and spacious for 100 players it does not at all feel claustrophobic like a lot of other similar games did Gets you on the edge of your seat and really feels rewarding when you get your chicken dinner especially in squad play One of the better Early acess games I have playedCons Weapon damage is inconsistant I have shot a person with a shotgun in the chest on two ocassions and they weren't wearing armor and one died instantly the other took three shts and they killed me in a couple with a pistol (starter weapon) Not a lot of variety to guns for the game it is nor attachments. You have to play this game on low graphics or you won't see S**t and get killed by players that will for sure see you in a field Little variety on vehicles there is only 3 MICROTRANSACTIONS (but honestly it isn't that big of a deal you don't get anything out of the crates anyways) Graphics sometimes don't load properly when you first drop (can be bad in a hot zone) and the game crashes ocassionally Chinese Players always are the hackers in the gameI don't have that much claim because I have less than 50 but overall wait till launch so they can Iron out the kinks in the game and shape up their buisness practices. Don't listen to too many people on here this is an early acess game after all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,"I wish I could give this game a thumbs up. When I first played it the experience was magical Everything was suspenseful you were constantly thinking and planning your next move as the blue zone shrinked further and further and after hundreds of ""almost there""s later you win your first chicken dinner. I know how mine was Adrenaline was pumping I was screaming and hollering and telling everyone how I finally won a game of PUBG.But over time I pretty much lost all interest.The system is horribly engineered. If you can get past the loading screen into the lounge and then into the game without crashing good luck not lagging horribly both client wise and network wise at the beginning of every game and every time you're near another player. How good of a rig you have barely affects this if at all. For a game that's announcing that they will soon be releasing ""version 1.0"" the whole experience still(!) feels incredibly pre alpha. And for a game that got so incredibly popular for a company that must be swimming in money at this point it feels very little effort is being put into making the game stable. Every time they publish release notes they talk about how they added this and tweaked that and all the bugfixes are rarely related to network connectivity and client stability but rather how they fixed various rare bugs where some object or action glitches out.It's been many months now and it hardly got any better. Not even Dice is this neglectful of their Battlefield franchise. Hell it sometimes feels that it actually has gotten worse. My experience with this game just keeps getting worse and worse I keep crashing and lagging more and more frequently and I don't want to play this game anymore.Wake me up when the PUBG gets its act together.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,372,True,Recommended,As of the time of writing this review I have over 200 hours played on Early access. I'd recommend the game overall. Obviously it's not perfect but it's very fun especially if you have friends to play with. The game is so intense especially when you're in the top 10. I've won a few games and it's so rewarding to win. Just knowing that you bested 99 other players. Now to name the problems. I have come across some obvious cheaters/hackers. And the Chinese players are overrunning the NA servers. This ruins grouping with randoms because you can't communicate. The game crashes sometimes and is terribly optimized. Being early access I can let that slide it does improve with every patch. Overall it's a great game and I would recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Since playing I've gained a lot of friends while running squads and I've had the opportunity to get me a couple of Chicken Dinners! This may be my number one PC game of all time. Optimization is being worked on and will put your PC to the test however with the release of 1.0 they have optimized the game to run better and more optimization will be coming further in the future.

Currently it's still ridicuously buggy and instead of fixing some bugs they've added TEMPORARY cosmetic skins for people.

This game is not worth your time because it treats you like cow to milk.This game you have to pay up to 30 dallors for and it has microtransactions. The microtranactions were stated beforehand as something they weren't going to put into the game until full release. They had also promised by the time they came out with the microtransactions that they would be going free to play. niether promise was kept and early in the beta they crammed the microtransactions into it. This is not a product worth its price tag and it has yet to achieve that value. The player base is going to start falling rapidly unless something is done fast.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Addictive game but needs a ton of work on just the core game itself if you do headshot after headshot on a player and no death as result. Frustrating! I wouldn't recommend this game in this state... it needs alot of fixing.New map out and vaulting. But still nothing is fixed. hit registration is granade on other side of walls kill people.

2017-11-20,0,0,10,True,Recommended,This game is what I would call a dynasty game this is reffering to dynasty warriors. Tant means that this game is only fun in short bursts and gets stale fairly quick. Another issue I have with this game is it's favortism to certin playstyles. A problem many modern shooter games have. I grew up a variety of fps games (doom halo TF2 before it became ) many of these games accomadated multiple playstyles whatever you want to play tacticly (halo/tf2) or if you want to just run and gun like there is no more bullets in the world (doom). This is a prime example to me of why steam needs a rateing system that does not only include thumbs up/down since it is a game I have a more meh feeling to.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-20,0,0,118,True,Not Recommended,Honestly this is one of the most poorly created games I've played. I believe the server tic rate is approximately 17 and it shows grenades do not throw correctly shooting is a ridiculously off (e.g. someone will be holding still you shoot at their head with maybe 20 meters from them and it misses) and jumping over things is literally the hardest thing to do in this game. My understanding is that a vaulting update will be pushed soon and that's great! It's literally the first update I've seen done to this game since it was in beta (which by the way it basically is even though it's being sold as a full game). I'm upset with the network lag the delays in actions (shooting picking up items reloading) and I'm sure others are as well. I do NOT recommend this game until further patches are implemented.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-20,0,0,770,True,Recommended,"I think the biggest knock on this game is that its STILL in early access.. It was suppose to be out of early access awhile back but it keeps getting extended. So i think the ""despite early access"" excuse is played it for this game at this point. It still suffers from crashes poor optimization and a horrible netcode. Bluehole seems to be scared of competition because they did not really enjoy fortnite getting into the foray.

Then drop at hot spots (School or the Hacienda Del Patron). Die a lot try to learn to kill. The more you die the more you can learn. Use the Nvidia reply and the killcam to try to learn from your deaths.Look up tips for sensitivity for your mouse setting this up can help quite a bit if you have high sensitivity.I really enjoy the game solo duo and squad are all fun for different reasons.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I really think it s so poor how easy they pass judgement without any form of formal review just look at my stats.. I m not exactly doing well but love playing it with my friends. If steam have acknowledged my account was compromised and I sent this email to PUBG as proof of their response why will they not lift the ban. 5 mins of google and you will see this is an incident for MANY innocent victims and the general response from PUBG is we do t care you already paid out for the game at worst you don t play anymore and at best for us you make another account and buy it again and there s literally nothing you can do little man. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS DEVELOPER. There are several petitions going online one is even up to 2256 signatures so it shows the frequency of this problem.

It's the onlly reason why i bought it was for that because the battle royle is to slow paced and too much hide and seek seeing the PVP on mobile (which was really fun) I thought it would be on here. Maybe it is my fault for not doing research but why would you have a game mode on a port but not on the original. I feel kind of played because sadly this game is pretty wack for a casual player in my opinion without the other gamemodes.

I say that because the game still has a long way until it s an AAA game. With poorly optimized maps and servers to FPS and Desync problems it can really break the immersion in during critical. Nothings more of a boner killer then when you are in the middle of a firefight or an instance moment and rather than have a satisficed conclusion win or lose you die because of something outside of your control. Moving away from the playable aspect of the game the other issues is with PUBGs choice to implement hard paywalls for content and Season Passes that unlock more content is when the game is in need of bug fixes and optimization. If at anything Keys &amp Creates should be purchasable for in game currency rather than actual money. If people want to spend actual money so be it. But the price to unlock said Create is pretty steep if you think about it $2.50 for a single key for a random create for random rewards most of which you will get duplicates for. And guess what? You then get to recycle that item for in game currency to buy ONLY a create. There is no other way to unlock said Creates. Only get the game if you got someone to play with. Otherwise stay away as it not worth it to play solo dolo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-23,0,0,101,False,Not Recommended,Changing my review unfortunately. My original review is below the dotted line.Game has issues. One is cheaters read anyone's review and you already know that. Next up is terrible hit registration. Anyone with a high ping gets compensated on the server end which ends up with a dead player if he has a low ping. The really need to ping cap their servers.Next issue their bandwidth. Their servers are buried usually 25+ hops into Amazon's network. Amazon cheap bandwidth and it shows. Any ping of 100 or more means when you finally land you'lll be in a sort of LAG as the textures load meaning you get a delay/stuttering on looting and a few seconds later someone killed you with a pistol.This game needs 4 core elements to be playable by the masses 1 Get rid of the cheats2 Better netcode/hit registration3 get their servers off of Amazon's cheap solution. Amazon is fine for data not for gaming.4 Add in a fully stocked training area. FFS this is 2018... FPS games should have this by default. Like the fast action Unreal engine. Nice maps fun game.Dislike high amount of hacks/cheats being used by other players but not as bad as people are saying but noticeable none the less. Also dislike NO training area to aquaint oneself with the weapons physics UI and mouse settings and graphic settings. Last dislike is the poor optimization. Max GPU usage in the Lobby. Video stuttering happens often.Overall I think patience is due while the DEV's work on optimization/performance and whittling down the cheaters. NEEDS a training area badly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,This game is beyond hard to start playing today as a first time player. You cannot test anything or really get a good feel for the game because there is no area to familiarize yourself with the controls and hotbuttons except for in the 100 man matches where you will generally be immediately killed by the first experienced player you come across. in the last 4 5 days of owning this game I have died more times than I have shot bullets.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-20,0,0,652,False,Recommended,Not the first and not the last Battle Royale but this is the on everyone tries to be. You never know what you are going to get your self into when you pick a place to drop in. This game isn't for everyone. It has a bit of a slower tactical pace to it. It is best with a group of friends to work together with and joke around with during the slow moments. It isn't without it's issues either. Server lag and random bugs will pop up and probably get you unfairly killed more than once. But if you take into account the scale of this game these things are bound to happen. The developers seem to continually be working on the issues and adding content along the way. Even with all the issues this is the game most of my friends get together to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-18,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,After the last two months ive seen a decline in care with this game. So i've decided that I would re write my review and not recommend this game. In all honesty I love the concept for this game the military / Arma tone in a battle royale with pretty decent gun play. A lot of fun for the first 20 hours or so. Amazing concept. The main gripe about this game that is killing it is the lack of care from the devs. Not enough bug fixes server support half the time is awful because they are too cheap to pay for actual servers. A recent influx in hackers and now the battle pass that costs another 10$ over a 30$ game. Two months ago with the kind of constant and slow updating I had hope maybe they would fix the game and make it the game that we all want and at one point it was going in that direction. But ever since bluehole decided to sue fortnite and try and get more money it was appearent that all they had cared about all of this time was money. Ill say it again great concept and after two years its a pretty alright game to play half the time but with it still being in its alpha esq state and just a cash grab for the developers I sadly cannot recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-06,0,0,167,False,Not Recommended,I've had a long time to play have good times and a lot of bad times. Today I hit my breaking point. Played a game and right in the middle of a battle with a buddy BOOM! the game crashed! You can imagine the emotions running through me. This was after countless encounters in which my shots would not connect no matter how on target the reticle was. I also recently experienced a moment when I was running from the danger zone and bam! I was victim to kar98 headshot from no where. I'm thinking wow! someone has some skill. I followed by watching the deathcam. I was amazed by what I saw. A player way behind me catches a glimpse of me sprinting for my life. He proceeds to pull out the sniper and take aim. His aim was literally (at least) 15 20 feet behind me. Once the shot was taken my body falls to the floor. Split seconds later you see the player fling his aim to the right thinking oh that shot was off until he stood their for about 5 seconds. I would imagine he was stunned.Anyways here is how I really feel about this game. There is so much potential. However the game is so far from production ready. 1.) Why is this game so heavy into graphics?! I don't give two s# ts how good the environment looks. I just want a competitive and fun experience.2.) Please clean this game up!!!!!!!!! Countless times have I watch deathcams and seen someone clearly have a (I guess you could call) lag advantage. I don't have a chance if I'm literally spraying bullets in a controlled pattern around a corner and someone pokes their head out and gets to spend 4 seconds shooting to get the kill! WTF!!!!!3.) Weapon pick ups. Some games are clean but not very many. I should be able to pick a gun up instantly. The pick up abilities are terrible even when doing so in the inventory screen. I've lost many battles just because it would take 4 or 5 seconds to pick up a dang gun!Honestly I know I said this game has potential but this is a sorry excuse for a battleground game. Please either gather a team that knows what they are doing. This game should provide almost a perfectly even playing field for everyone. Right now it is very lopsided.Sincerely Robert,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The weapons all feel very different from each other with the esceptions of a few pistols the recoil is very easy to control and every kill you get feels very satisfying. Most of the bugs have been ironed out in the recent patches and the servers feel much better with the recent update they got. The only parts that are noticibly buggy are landing around many buildings/trees or trying to pick items up using the pickup key and not the inventory.

I can't stand trying to put my seemingly austistic screeching down in type (sorry if that offended you but its my honest opinion about MY thoughts sometimes). With that out of the way here I go...1. This game is AMAZING to play with friends and can really let you get involved in learning how to work as a 2 4 man squad. You can devise tactics flank oponets bang &amp clear etc etc freaking etc... With you and a squad of your besties you are gonna have a blast FOR SURE.2. You ARE going to need a therapist after playing this game for just a few hours. ""Why?"" you may ask... Imagine some of the most ludicris deaths you can that would just tick you off to no end... THEY WILL HAPPEN! e.g. Headshot death by crossbow from 500+ yards? Check. Self Inflicted grenade death from magic boomarang gernades? Check. Insta Teleportation to over 9000 miles into the air followed by the inevitable fall from heaven? Kablooey Check. No joke people if you can dream it up just give it time and watch the magic of imaginary physics take hold of your game.3. Do NOT let your kids play or play near you if the all channel mic option is on and you aren't wearing headphones. What noise will grace you or your kids ears? Single handedly the most vile toxic racist and hate filled sewer wateresque garbage you wouldn't dream up in your worst nightmare. Not that I care but if you tend to get hurt fee fees easy best to beware. (LOOKING AT YOU guy who chases darker colored characters around screaming... well... yea...)D. Lastly while this game has been some of the most fun I've ever had I am in complete agreement with all the negative reviews that have been spiking. HACKERS ARE KILLING THIS GAME! So I personally am putting this game away until I start hearing some amazing reports about these guys getting VAC banned or hardware banned.

But you know how the old saying goes if you can't beat 'em try and sue the hell out of them out of spite.When PUBG came out it was the big head honcho of BR games almost instantly dethroning H1 as the go to BR game. And if I'm going to be honest it was actually pretty fun for the first few hours. However it wasn't without faults. It uses Battle eye anticheat which is about as effective as using a window screen to filter water. So there's random hackers everywhere. Bullet hit registration (hit reg) is wonky at best having shot someone in the leg (with included blood splatter) only to have not even actually hit them at all. You can crash into a tree or a drop crate with a car and kill whoever's on the other side because the game de synches so badly. Shotgun pellet spread is so horrendous that you should just leave the game if that's all you can find. Landing fights while still a complete crapshoot are more balanced than fortnite's. In fortnite all weapons have set damage and specs based on rarity meaning if that across the street finds a rifle and all you have is a grey pistol you may as well disconnect. In PUBG however unless that person manages to find a helmet or body armor you actually stand a chance if you find a beretta and they have an M4. The PUBG devs are incompetent tools. They'd rather sue someone over ""taking their idea"" than they would implement more original content into their own game. This isn't the name you want for a company but it's the one they have now. Then they have the nerve to attempt and copy Fortnite's ""battle pass"" system with none of the rewards or incentives then wonder why noboby bought it. I'm not a Fortnite fanboy by any means I haven't even touched the game since season 4 but as it stands as the one of the only 3 BR games its really the only comparison to quality standards I can make. Fortnite is free unique and most importantly actually works. If Bluehole would just take the time to fix everything instead of adding new outfits crates keys maps and a 9 gigabyte update every week I'm certain that PUBG can become an exceptional game.There's an actual adage that goes ""Winners focus on winning losers focus on winners"" and that's exactly whats happening between Fortnite and PUBG Bluehole is so focused on the numbers that fortnite is taking from them that they're more concerned about trying to kill the competition than actually improving their own player experience.

2017-07-05,0,0,882,True,Recommended,PUBG is one of the most elegantly designed shooters ever created. Here s how it works up to a hundred unarmed players parachute down into a vast map. They find weapons armor and vehicles. As time passes the safe play area shrinks forcing players into the same region of the map. The last person alive wins.Basically anyone can jump in and have a meaningful experience. Everyone starts in the same vulnerable situation and every kill is significant. Winning or being the last person standing is immensely difficult but since the scoring system is so simple it s always tempting to try to improve your ranking next time. And PUBG isn t shy about including elements of luck even the most skilled player might find themselves landing in an area oddly bereft of weaponry beyond a frying pan and getting rifled in the back.Every time I ve managed to be one of the last ten players remaining has been among the most intense gaming experiences of my life. Everything you do becomes a small but profound decision. Do you wait inside that room and stay safe for now but risk having to blow your own cover when the play area gets smaller? Do you attack that other player now or hope she doesn t notice you and wanders into a more compromised position down the line? Do you draw attention to yourself by using a loud vehicle to cover more ground or can you make it to the safe zone in time while keeping quiet?#lowkeyaddictedtoPUBG,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,396,False,Recommended,"The people that give this negative reviews don't really know what they are talking about. People complain about how there are so many pubg. I rarely encounter bugs at all not nearly as often as people describe them to be. Almost all the time the bug doesn't affect anyone at all. They wont intefere with the game. Even if there is a bug that makes you die once in a blue moon that shouldn't make PUBG the worst game in the world.This isn't fornite either. There is little to no aim assist. If you died and the other person didn't well then it's not because the game didn't ""read your shots"". You just didn't hit the person. PUBG is much more realistic than fortnite. You need to be accurate and there is much more strategy than fortnite. Unlike fortnite all guns have ADS(basically scoping in). This makes aiming so much more important. And if someone is shooting at you you can't build a wall. You need to be able to aim or you're dead.Lots of people complain about FPS simply because they didn't look into the game enough. This game is graphics card heavy and you will need an ok computer overall to run this game. I have a very solid computer and max out on FPS on the highest settings. You dont need a 1080 ti to run the game but you can't use something garbage. I will admit there used to be a lot of hackers. USED TO. The problem today isn't hackers. It's the death cam making people look like hackers. The death cam and spectating are all messed up and it looks like the person doesn't have a line of sight even though they do. People see this and think everyone that kills them is hacking. You died. Get over it. At this point fortnite probably has more hackers than PUBG. When you first buy the game you can't expect to win. Most likely you wont even get a single kill. As you keep playing and playing you will get better and better getting more and more kills. Maybe even get that Chicken Dinner. Take the time needed to get better and the game will get addictive.There is still much to be done for this game to get better but it is still one of the best games i've ever played.

And with the incoming passes there will also be a lot more incentive to actually play the game.I thought the old ""reward"" system was pretty bad and I'm way more comfortable to hand out 10$ once and get a few skins that I can unlock through continous playing than buying stupid keys for stupid lootboxes which give me ugly at random.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-21,0,0,249,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Poor optimization and a money hungry developer make this game a piece of trash. Don't buy it it is not worth the money (anymore)When I first got into this game it was early access. I loved it. I didn't have problems with bugs here and there because it was early access. When playing some time I could buy and open a lootbox and actually felt rewarded ( even tho the items were always some boring crap it still felt like I was getting something.Now almost one year after I started this game is a sad heap of ****. You can't enjoy the game because of hackers (not every game but the frequency of hackers is too high). The performance is still even wit ha high end pc I still run into lag (not on my side my internet connection is godlike) and bugs. You still can't drive cars on normal terrain without suddenly dying (especially motorcycles). And the worst part is you get NOTHING there is nothing to strive for. You get this ingame currency for winning which you can spend on a lootbox a lootbox that comes from a pool of boxes more than half of which are locked behind a paywall (you need to buy a key). I already have 10 locked boxes sitting around ( would be a lot more if I'd be still playing this game). Furthermore even if you buy a key the drop chances are so abysmally it isn't even worth it most of the time it's just money thrown out the window. Now they'll introduce a progression system in the form of an event pass. BUT IN ORDER TO GET YOU HAVE TO PAY 10 BUCKS.This pitiful excuse for a finished game already costs 30 bucks . They already made so much money BUT THEY CAN'T STOP MILKING IT. I have lost all respect for this company they reside along EA and Activi$ion in my book. I always thought Brendan (playerunkown) himself was a gamer who had a vision and surely his creation wouldn't turn into this moneyhungry monster that gamers despise. But here we are. VERY dissapointed in you Brendan. And very dissapointed at everyone else making the financial decisions. Shame on you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Ha így halad a játék akkor egy darab szemét lesz ami játszhatatlanul tele lesz kijavítatlan hibákkal. Minden update ban több bug jön mint bugfix majd próbálják kicsi de sok update el kifixálni a bugokat de ezt a mennyiséget lehetetlen. 7500 Ft az ember pénztárcájából. A csapatról * Rendkívül undorítónak tartom hogy amúgy egy eddig 100% ig indie csapat sikeres lett egy (amúgy zseniális koncepcióval rendelkező) játékkal majd szentesítik le sem tervezik árazni (csak egy adott mérföldkőnél árazták itt Steam en én is akkor vettem meg) mondva hogy a játékuk túl jó és ezért örökre fullos áron fogják adni. Felkéne nyitni a Tencent szemét nagyon gyorsan. A közösségről * Egész jó ez mondjuk példaértékű. Összegzés * Maradok a Fortnite nál valahogy jobban tetszik a Dev ek hozzáállása a játékhoz és a Fortnite szerintem sokkal zseniálisabb.

They are now completely greedy and advertising their dumb invitational everywhere possible in the game! Biggest problem I have with this game now is that instead of trying to improve their game by listening to community feed back to better their game and surpass their competitors.

Im glad its somewhat fixed now.You do sometimes still encouter a cheaters but its better.I didnt like that u blocked the trading either it makes u seem more money hungry and wanting people to open more boxes( I think it was partly because the Chinese cheaters farmed BP and then sold them for earnings )I was really excited for Miramar from the videos it was beatiful atleast for me but then the truth hit me.So many houses with literally nothing in them i covered more house ground than entire RozHok and still had pistol and some bad loot. And the circle would fk me badly if i tried to go for ""Safe Loot"" Witch i dont really do but this wasn't fun and thats what this should be about I dont really like that u removed fog either i was really liking it. It brought whole another playstyle you could sneak up to players and stuff it was fun. Why did u add 6x scope? No one asked for them. They were what i call ""Useless Update"" simply because that time there was alot more critical things to address.Also i think you'r devs handled accusations by Mr.Grimmz towards other players unfairly.( This was long time ago )I love Shroud and so does alot of people but if you have rules you need to follow them yourself aswell.I dont think StreamSniping is allowed by rules and Shroud stream's literally everyday so why didnt u ban them?It was probably due to marketing trick. And that also makes u seem bad in my eyes. I know company needs money I do really. But rates on the ""Rare"" drops are insane aswell. Im most likely going to win lottery and fk Kim Kardashian in same day rather than getting one of those items. And now you cant even sell them.There was alot of good aswell in this game its fun with friends games CAN be fast paced if u land on "" HotSpots ""and when u die u are going to find new game almost instantly.

2018-08-28,0,0,249,False,Not Recommended,I would love to recommend this game as I have enjoyed it in the past. But I have gotten fed up with the greedy devs and the various other problems that come with this. I like a lot about this game. You don't encounter hackers often I have played this game a lot and have only ever encountered one. Most people that say otherwise are just salty that people are killing them. It is fun and difficult and you get a nice adrenaline rush late game that leaves your heart racing for 10 minutes afterwards. There is a lot to do and a good amount of content.But there is also a lot of cons. Terribly optimized to the point it can become unplayable at certain times. Devs do not care about players and are greedy pigs.These are general pros and cons and I don't really feel like sitting around for 15 minutes thinking of more. But let me be clear DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS IT IS ON SALE. It is definitely NOT WORTH the asking price. This game has a lot of potential it is already better than Fortnite and most other battle royale games out there. But there are just too many problems for this game to be worth 30 dollars.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-27,0,0,170,False,Not Recommended,"Oh PUBG... We've had our ups and downs but I think it's time to quit. This game really is a love/hate relationship. Do not buy it if you haven't already.After a couple months of initial infatuation with the concept and scale of this game the love part has definitely died down. It's clear this game has some massive core gameplay issues that are not being addressed and the studio is using time and resources adding other less impactful stuff to the game. I always see PUBG videos and it gets me stoked to play because of how good it COULD be and then I play and end up Alt+F4ing in frustration after a couple rounds every time. Conversely I can play Battlefield 4 for hours in a sitting and find it enjoyable.Pros Big dynamic maps that feel like you're really exploring and people could be anywhere Searching for weapons/loot is pretty funCons Terrible desync when being shot at or picking up items in the game feels awful and inconsistent. Guns still ""feel"" bad compared to other AAA games like Battlefield CS GO and Overwatch. Unreliable shotguns bad automatic fire etc. Weird sound bugs. Tons of useless cosmetic content being pumped into the game to keep people hooked. Right at the same time as community outcry about lootboxes these guys decide to go ALL IN on cosmetic and collectible items. They also ripped the ""battle pass"" idea from Fortnite probably out of spite. Hey Bluehole it doesn't fix your terrible game. Vehicles are still dangerous to use and can cause you to die unexpectedly. Unless you're totally stranded and need to MOVE I would avoid using them. Lack of hotkey/gameplay options for picking up loot etc.In short looting and the maps are the best part of this game. The actual combat with other players feels terrible when really that should be the part that is most enjoyable and fun in FPS games. Incredibly frustrating and unpolished and the studio is wasting resources instead of fixing the problem. Time to uninstall.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And the game runs very well on it Ultra 80 FPS High 100 FPS . I sadly can't test it on an older Video Card but from what I heard performance is getting better for older series cards.But still it is far from perfect there are still many bugs the Death Cam is basically useless the game is randomly crashing sometimes its freezing in loading screen not letting me access other programs (e.g. Task Manager to stop it you can create a .cmd in the Start menu to kill TslGame.exe ).But all in all after it got fixed in the official release I can now confidently recommend PUBG.)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Despite the fact that this game is a buggy mess and that the developers are more incompotent than they are greedy it is absolutely worth your money if you are into battle royale. You will spend hours and hours of this game angry happy nervous and in the midst of combat. If you see someone who has sunk in hundreds of hours into this game and continues to do so yet they give this game a bad review they're just angry about an issue within the game. Doesn't change the fact that they actually do like the game. PUBG isn't even that expensive. If you think 30$ is not worth 100+ hours of gameplay then there must be something wrong with you. It's not a great game but you will absolutely get your money's worth if you're into this game. The developers suck and so does the game but the value of entertainment that this game will provide you far surpasses those two setbacks.

I have had an overwhelmengly negative experience so far I cannot even play th game because of the insane ammount of lag on basically every server i have played on. It takes incredibly long to load the initial map and i cant play for a solid 5 minutes when i first land because of this and every time i enter a building the lag makes the game unplayable.

2018-04-30,0,0,246,False,Recommended,Definitely one of the best Battle Royale style games. More realistic gameplay better graphics and longer/slower games when compared to fortnite. However there are still MANY minor bugs. I wish the Devs would stop trying to add features/maps and instead fix the bugs and smooth over gameplay. That being said this is still very playable. Dying from bugs doesnt happen often if you know what you're doing. I haven't had any issues with hackers the people who complain about this game being flooded with hackers are probably bad players who are just salty.Over the last 8 months I've casually gamed PUBG and sold $40.2 worth of pubg crates which more than pays for the game itself.

It is a very cool concept and I think this game will go far with more touching up. The biggest problem with it for me right now is the amount of time it takes for the game to start.

I've always been the guy in my friend group that's on PUBG's side vs Fortnite but if I'm gonna be honest with myself now I can't stand behind it anymore. The reason I felt like I had to change this review is strictly because of one thing Bluehole did The Event Pass. I'll admit I bought into it. I ""fell"" for it. Bluehole came out with something I thought I might just be able to get behind. They finally gave me a reason to play instead of getting off every time I play. I go into the game and within 5 games I get the XP for a mission I definitely didn't do and I don't get the XP for missions I definitely did. Not only is the tracking of missions absolute garbage but so is the timeframe. They only gave us 30 days to do this. Unlike whoever dislikes this review I have other things to do than sit and scream at my computer screen all day. If you want to get level 30 and still have a life you might as well quit now because it can't happen. The missions aren't even good or rewarding either. They re weird and don t encourage you to play the game the way it's supposed to be played. It doesn t feel very rewarding to play on Miramar for an hour and a half to get 80 XP when I was supposed to only play for an hour. Here s an example of the absolute absurdity of the mission progression and how broken it is. Mission 1 Kill a player with the QBZ. Ok I can do that. *done*. Mission 2 Play 3 games on Sanhok where you get at least 1 headshot. Ok shouldn t be too hard. *done*. But here s the catch the game failed to register that I did it even once. Here s another one I have definitely done but it hasn t registered 60% of it Revive 10 teammates on Sanhok. It only counted 3. Another one? Ok. Play on Sanhok at least 10 times. Completed it after about 20 games. The next mission? Play on Sanhok for at least 5 hours. Do you really think I m gonna play a small map designed for short games for 5 ing hours when the time doesn t even register anyways? I haven t even mentioned the fact that there s a daily limit to the amount of XP you can get by just playing the game. I paid for this (it should have been free anyways) and I expected it to be good not some rushed cash grab. I guess I put too much faith in Bluehole. This Event Pass is a joke and a money grab from Bluehole to line their pockets to prepare for the eventual downfall of their game. I m sorry PUBG Corp. but based on your blatant disregard for what your players wanted over the past few months to finally deliver this steaming pile of horse I think I m done.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,I made a review for PUBG. I loved PUBG. I honestly did. But it really seemes like Sanhok was the falling period in the peak. Before in late 2017 was probably the prime for PUBG for me at least. Me and friends would sit down and enjoy a few games here and there we would spot a hacker or maybe we just were really bad compared to the rest. And that's how I saw the game up until about this month when it's become nearly unplayable with the sheer amount of hackers and cheaters. Leaping from a car and getting shot directly in the head immediately seems a bit too lucky to happen several times in different matches. I hate to trash the game especially since the older versions were so much fun. But not to mention the cash grab of the event pass although it may be optional it seems like a very weird idea to have in such a succesful game. I hope this review at least helped somebody realize that this game really isn't what it used to be.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-14,0,0,13,True,Recommended,"TLDR It's a fun and simple battle royal that can easily be played with friendsIf you aren't keen on early access game and have zero tolerence for possible (and honestly rare) glitches I'd say pass. But if you enjoy on the spot critical thinking a constantly changing battle and the rewarding feeling of knowing you are in fact the best than this is you're game. So here are a few main points that are critical for knowing when thinking of owning this game are The map is big plain and simple. Like most sandbox survivors it has scattered homes/building a handful of small towns and few large sites guarenteed to attract attention. It can get annoying trying to stay in the combat zones at first but to be honest you can easily predict where they will be (hint they are almost always within a mile of the flight path of the plane). There are a small sample of vehicles (cars mortorcycles and boats) if you need to get somewhere fast but mostly they just make lots of noise.The weapon selection is admittedly lacking (a few identical pistols 2 shotguns around 10 assault weapons one sniper a terrible crossbow and a handful of basically useless melee weapons) and can sometimes blend together in a grey blur. It doesn't take long to discover them. While there are attachments for most guns it doesn't really spice up the gameplay because are you really not going to add it anyways? And earning the in game currency ""BP"" takes an honestly too long commitment. Without winning everygame it takes about 7 or 8 games to open the first loot box. Then the price doubles... and then it doubles again (god help me)The combat is exactly like any other mainstream shooter. You can play in 1st or 3rd person you find gear and armor and shoot anyone who you find (It's killed or be killed Hanzi). The beginning of the matches can sometimes be quiet and feel like every other match but near 30 players left it begins to heat up. At the final 10 I'd say is the most fun part and seeing the words ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"" makes it all worth while.As far a glitches/bug/general issues I'd have to say most of the complaints are exaggerated. If you have optimal internet the suggested hardware and the mindset that this is a constantly updated early access game you will really have next to no issues. I've played on PC and even the recently released XBOX One version and have had literally zero issues. In most cases with these beta games people get one lag spike and rush to the negative review button. The only issue you may have is if the host of the game themselves leaves/disconnects but that's a salty player and can't be blamed on the game. As for the common notion that ""Guns are too hard to find and everyone else always gets good stuff"" this should just be tuned out. That is exactly what a friend of mine said his first game after he made the mistake of parachuting into a live firefight. Then 1 hour later we were one of the last teams armed to the teeth and having a great time. If you expect to be handed a SCAR L right off the bat go play Battlefield. No one in the Hunger Games was armed at the start and everyone else starts empty handed.In conclusion I'd say this game is a clean 7/10+High stakes combat+A large map with both wide open areas and stressful cityscapes+A variety of ways to play loud and mean quiet and patient the hermit who never moves the team of gun toating killers etc.+Enjoyable solo or with 1 partner or 3+Appealing gamestyle (sure it's been done but this is one of the only ones you don't have to gather resourses which is nice)+New experiences and constantly learning to adapt and use your surroundings (this games has me always thinking tactical)+It's only in beta and more is sure to come from this promising team Can be frustrating at first if you die immedately (it does happen a lot at first) leading to the ""this game sucks"" mindset Being killed without ever seeing who did it or from where is kind of just a ""Well that's it don't let the door hit you on the way out"". It can make the player feel as though it was all for nothing The players use any and all exploits possible (Constant reality breaking jumping teleporting into vehicles in a flash using prone/crouch to dodge bullets and the age old camp with you gun aimed at the door) and it just makes you regret even trying to engage sometimes",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-14,0,0,44,True,Recommended,To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer s head. There s also Rick s nihilistic outlook which is deftly woven into his characterisation his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature for instance. The fans understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes to realise that they re not just funny they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp Morty truly ARE idiots of course they wouldn t appreciate for instance the humour in Rick s existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

2017-04-19,0,0,626,False,Not Recommended,Revised Review after a year of playing First let me start off by saying that I am no longer fan of PUBG. There are things that I like and things that I dislike about the game. Most often I find myself in a position recognizing that I can be mad at PLAYERUNKNOWN and his dev team. This game was released as an EARLY ACCESS and under that alone I could not have a reason to complain whatsoever. However since this game was released and has become wildly popular the leadership and dev team have been dragging their f*cking feet. Each and every patch has so many new bugs and issues and rarely solve any problems that players have been asking to be resolved for nearly a year.This game was released as a fairly polished game with considerably good mechanics gameplay logic and balance. Since then nothing truly tremendous has been done to improve the game. The best upgrade was them changing the tick rate of servers from 20 to 60 and that was merely a switch of the servers and nothing technical done as a result of the devs that alone took months to get done. Now I am going to dive a little deeper into each of thsoe topics and a little more.Mechanics This game at times can feel pretty clunky especially when driving but for the most part looting shooting and running feel very consistent and smooth. The camera system is helpful and useful (considering you can't Alt + Drag in prone and limited in crouch and when looking around buildings). A complaint is that the driving mechanics are clunky when traveling over bumps and the parachutes can be unreliable sometimes don't ever drive a bike or you are 50% likely to flip and die by hitting a microscopic pebble on the road. The developers will likely take another year to either revert the bikes or make any improvement at all.Gameplay The shooting system is phenominal in this game just about the only thing that makes this game good. The Duo system is very nice. It leads to a very tactical and strategical approach to the game but the playerbase only knows how to drop hot and play like it's Call of Duty... so... instead of playing to survive and not play to get kills you end up playing to get kills and not playing to survive. I like intelligent kind of gameplay which is very rewarding for patient players that are capable of strategizing but at a higher level don't expect anyone to care. I consistently place top 250 if I play for the season.Logic Some things in the game just make sense and other things are just down right stupid. The scenery is right the locations are meh the loot spawns are complete RNG the plane routes can be complete and utter trash on Mirimar especially. The circles can lose you a game on Erangel. Too much RNG in this game for it to be worth a damn at a higher level of competition. The game just doesn't feel right anymore. Things such as bullet compatibility and attachments might seem fishy and I'd give this game a break if it were still a month away from release or launch but they've had more than enough time to fix critical issues and they have failed to even fix half of the issues within an entire year. I guess $1 500 000 000 isn't enough to higher a good dev team...Balance This the single most important thing that the developers have actually gotten right which is why the game is actually playable. Grenades can't be thrown 500 ft guns have accurate bullet drop accurate sounds (beyond popular belief) accurate damage and generally good recoil balance. The Zones don't do nearly enough damage but move at a manageable speed but can select completely a$$ areas. The loot is not really balanced because you can very commonly loot 3 4 buildings and not find a single weapon at times. Cars are balanced and each serve their own purpose. They actually removed lvl 3 helms from world spawns and balanced ARs SMGs DMRs and Snipers... which actually made the game a lot more balanced and was one of the actually decent patches the game released.Overall this is a good game but I can't rate it thumbs up because teh developers are very incompitent. This game favors the agressor due to desync and lag (which at times can seem like so during the first 5 mins of the game) it should be about playing tactical and being able to strategize and create a plan on where you are going to find the best loot. Where to loot and have the advantage over anyone impeding your immediate area. What part of the map to loot in order to give you most time to be in the first circle. What part of the circle to go to (where you think on the path of the plane and how likely you are to run into somebody at a specific location on the map) where to hide or setup where to scout and scan where to strafe and peek. Every single game you should be rewarded for being able to answer these questions and it used to be like that but not really any more. Don't get me wrong I love this game but it has too many problems. With the recent addition of the event pass I don't even think that I can stomach the stupidity of the developers. I wish they would have adopted a system of progression like Rainbow Six Siege or copied Fortnite exactly but instead they wanted to basically make their event pass cost 3 times as much. $10/month instead of Fortnite's $10/3 months. A lot of these problems aren't being fixed. The developers aren't good at acknowledging the community and communicating with the community. They don't seem to have any haste and they don't seem to care about improving the game. They make random inprovements and the only patches or improvements that are ever worth a damn are weapon and armor balances and nothing much else. This game has server issues (which are coding abssed issues that will never seem to be addressed) this game rubberbands (told it would be improved???) the sounds are inconsistent (seemingly always bugged) vehicles are scetchy (were fixed and then they managed to f*ck them up again) draw distance (not fixed bushes and brush don't load at 200m+ which is completely ) spectator issues (not fixed) revives issues (fixed) map issues (fixed) spawn issues (fixed) lagout issues (not fixed) BP issues (fixed) various other glitches and troubles (fixed/being fixed or address/scheduled to be fixed) desync (not fixed). &lt made this list over a year ago and updated it just so you can see a list of things that haven't been fixed and what has. To add to the list a ranking system was never implemented leveling system was never implemented still no challenges crates are pretty much all worthless and only openable with keys. It seems like they do nothing to cater to players that play this game at the highest level and it's so ing irritating losing a gun battle to a complete ter when on my screen I'm behind a tree and they still see me due to desync.Here are my adjusted ratings Gameplay 7/10Mechanics 8/10Logic 7/10Balancing 9/10Developers 4/10 &lt only team that regularly puts things out is the art team with PAID crates...

You can still earn items through the pass for free. Buying the pass just gives you more cosmetics and free BP. Not having to go through the crate system is great.You'll want to play on lower graphical settings for some but it is very easy to get 60 144fps. Server side the game has gotten much better. The start of the game still has some bumps in tick rate and stability but it's around 30 ticks/s (compared to 8 ticks/s 3 4 months ago). Once the game is about 2 minutes in it rises to a pretty steady 55 60 ticks/s.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Once you avoid conflict and get down to the final 20 or so it becomes a game of luck. Hopefully you got the SKS AWM etc with a nice scope so you can finish the other people off.

2017-10-15,0,0,73,True,Recommended,Game is good in its actual state the battle royale style is fresh and the gunplay is tight. Hand to hand combat needs improvement.Had some crashing issues (RX480 8G FX8350 4GHz 16G RAM) but after updating to last non WHQL amd drivers and following the forum official recomendations the crashes are gone.The major weaknesses are the lack of more maps and the need for greater mobility (being able to jump over fences through windows etc.).The crates are very cosmetic and only apply to the beggining of the game since when you start looting you will change your looks completely so it's not an issue at all. However devs should improve other things before adding microtransactions to a best selling game. Greedy people.If they add more maps and improve mobility the game will be very good.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is honestly a overall 7/10.The desert map really pisses me off more than anything as everyone hotdrops so there are like 30 people alive before the first circle even hits the gameplay is very slow and doesn't allow for me to get the number of kills I would like to.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is honestly the game for you if you're looking for a good battle royale wether you came from Fortnite Arma 3 Mods or H1Z1 this is the right game for you.At first you might thing that this game is horrible trust me I've been there and I'm still mixed inside of this stance but I think that PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS has really stepped up their game since the release of ""Fortnite"" I really expect great things from this game and it's honestly the best 30 dollars I have ever spent.Honestly the only con of this game would be dsync and other issues such as ping lag (for lower end computers) and other aspects of gameplay.If you're wondering what you should AT LEAST want to run this game DECENTLY i5 Processor 1050ti 4gb single fan 8gb of RAM.

2018-01-01,0,0,110,False,Not Recommended,This game is a great concept executed poorly even after 1.0 was released. The maps are still filled with glitches where you can get stuck and die outside the play zone. The main menu is still buggy and you have to 'restart the lobby' in order to get it to work again. Most frustrating of all though is the lack of anti cheat. Aim bots are very common and I have gone an entire day's worth of gameplay without having a single round where I wasn't killed by someone using an aimbot. For a multi player only game this makes it basically unplayable in any competitive way.

This game has sold 30+Million copies. 30$ a pop that is bringing in almost a billion with a damn B in sales. There is no reason why there servers should play like a bag of dead hamsters on a 3/4 spinning wheel. When leading a enemy with even a tad of distance looking down a scope is extremely inconsistent. Bullets seem to go through portals and end up going through the enemy with out a hit. Hit an enemy in the head with a 7.62 cal ak 47.. you is the response you're going to get from that. If you're lucky they will lose their helmet.. highly likely some Asian hacker with snap at you and instantly put you down b/ anti cheat measures are abysmol and they have a unsecured data feed that any Packet sniffer can pull up the info you are sending. Guess what they can pull from that? Item locations Vehicle locations Player location You want to talk about terrible anti cheat placement this game takes the damn oscar.Now they are coming out with a moblie lunch? Are they out of there mind? What time of donkey punching is this. Adding more content to a game that still needs tons of refinement? Who plans these type of moves.

I have moments of extreme happiness with winning and sorrow after making it to top ten with no action just to get headshotted by a Kar98 or get jumped by someone i could never have seen. I will continue playing this game because of those moments. I can relate this game to a drug. You know it hurts but the ecstasy of winning landing that moving headshot with a sniper running someone over and 1v4ing successfully is what brings me back. You need to be dedicated to have fun and I understand that many people don't want that. I obviously did and i have had a net positive time. Always play with friends unless you are really good or else it isn't fun. A review can't really tell you whether to buy in this particular game. One more thing this game is really buggy(though I enjoy the gunplay). Ok update this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,655,False,Not Recommended,First I would love to state that Pubg dev team should be stripped of their coding rights development ability and anything else regarding this game or games they may touch. Looks to me that the team is a bunch of monkeys throwing keys at one another like apes tossing poop in a cage.theyre foregoing hopes to bind a code that works temporary to only realize their capabilities are limited to peeling a banana and throwing feses at a pc rig. Secondly the game has a great direction to which the way the game is heading. I do applaud just dont get the monkeys excited or else they will roll out another update and make the lobby toss feces instead of fragsLastly im glad the monkeys are progressing their skills at trying to enhance a game but sadly we the people of steam are caged and being smothered in dev feces straight out of Po i bathrooms where the game is being made. ...SO all in all good concept worth the 20 dollars its on sale for because otherwise i would not buy this.

2017-10-22,0,0,291,True,Recommended,One idea I would like to put out before a basic review of the game The map currently has 3 different styles Sun rain and fog. What I would like to see and think would make the games more interesting would be to change this system so that all 3 weather types are mixed into one. As you travel through the white circles away from the blues this would definitely give the game a higher level of intensity going from sun to fog or rain as the playstyle would need to change.I think this would give the game a major improvement and is definitely something I am looking forward to seeing happen.This would need to be randomized for each game so that the same place is not always foggy.This game is very addictive! Not perfect but has so much potential. At the moment it is just a fight to the death battle Royale but you could easily add extra modes in like a headquarters type mode where a certain part of the map needs to be captured by a team and defended etc... PUBGs is quite difficult to get good at but has been fun the entire time. The movement is quite clunky and takes a little while to get used to. Shootouts are fun and exciting... Even hiding from people in a bush or laying in grass is intense! There has been a large increase in hackers recently which is starting to ruin it a bit and makes those chicken dinners hard to winner winner.I do however love this game even though it frustrates the hell outta me at times!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-22,0,0,105,True,Recommended,great game but can be boring once played enough. Its more fun if you play with friends and not by yourself.

Head glitching in first person makes this game beyond unplayable.4. Loot spawn rate is so bad it's unfathomable.5. Foliage makes everyone invisible (also bushes will looks like players) more so than the Ghillie suit.6. Crates will be dropped outside of safe zone which renders them unable to get.7. Hitting a tiny bump will result in your vehicle doing a 720 and dying.8. Response time in this game is very bad.9. Poor optimization is something I do not even want to touch upon.10. Things not rendering when I land.11. Desync and rubber banding12. RNG is so beyond bad with circle game turns into a running simulator and most of the time vehicles do not spawn so you can get to where you have to go.13. Top 60 25 is a drool fest due to the majority of players camping and hiding from any interaction14. Crates spawn Groza15. Your car will get stuck in a fence and then it will proceed to blow up.16. Getting out of your vehicle near a wall and then falling incessantly which results in death.17. Shotguns not one tapping people when you hit them point blank (could be desync).18. Vehicles hit boxes are so unbelievably large that even when you are around three body lengths away you will still get hit and die.19. Cannot shoot people while they are in water.20. Cannot reload gun unless I drop it and pick it back up.21. Cannot remove or add attachments onto my gun unless I drop it and pick it back up.22. Getting disconnected from a server.23. The Red zone serves no purpose other than ruining a deep run with annoying RNG.Until the awful freezing glitches and ugly server lag dissipates I would not recommend buying this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PlayerUknown's Battlegrounds has been officially released for just over 4 months and to this day conitunes to have issues that not only prevent the game from being considered a true E sports title but that should not be present in a game that is regarded as complete. I say this especially due to the fact that the greedy developers took it upon themselves to charge money for you to be able to access a large amount of the cosmetic items in the game.Aside from the well documented bugs there are also issues that affect gameplay in a way that prevents the player from being able to properly utilize some weapons in the game.Because of this I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS GAME. Not at least until the bugs have been fixed and even then i would be unlikely to do so due to the egregious implementation of MICROTRANSACTIONS IN A PAID FOR GAME.Steer clear and do not waste your money the game is enjoyable but cannot be excused of it's flaws based on this alone.

2017-11-23,0,0,236,True,Not Recommended,Why is this game popular?!The answer? Because its battle Royale.Why shouldn't it be popular? &gt One of the most poorly optimized Unreal Engine 4 games out there.I personally do game developement on Unreal Engine and I feel like I could have done a better job making the game look and play better. This game is undoubtedly attrocious when it comes to playability. Glitchyness poor animation system forgets to set playermodel hidden to the posessing player lag just lal these issues. Their main menu UI doesn't even work consistently and instead of fixing it they've just chosen to accept it and added in a little refresh button. Probably the second most clicked icon in the game next to the play button. &gt Poor gunplay Gunplay one should hope is skill based responsive and enjoyable. Here its seemingly none of these 3 things. Recoil is odd inconsistent and excessive Time to Kill at range is huge properly aiming with any zoomed optic on a gun you wanna use like a DMR is damn near impossible and it is evident that luck defines hit detection seemingly half the time.Furthermore due to netcode worse than... Actually I'm not quite sure if there's any worse example of netcode... Maybe BF4 on release idk...Anyways netcode is tied to gun shooting. You will literally have a random delay before the gun shoots after you click. It is so unsatisfying. SO UNSATISFYING. &gt Movement So this is supposedly gonna be fixed soon but regardless right now the movememnt is pretty bad. You can jump out of windows/ over walls but its very difficult to do so and some objects have odd colission boxes. &gt To be completely honest there's a higher quality IOS game that pulls off PUBG perfectly called rules of survival. Given it runs smooth 30 fps at least on ios its pretty incredible. It is well optimized and generally just the same thing but slightly improved FOR FREE on a PHONE. If thats not saying something I don't know what is.This game is popular because it hopped onto the battle royale bandwagon and with it came the swarm of people wanting to play this genre. Fortnite is a very different game in how it plays but in regard to quality and playability really any other game is better than PUBG right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,284,False,Not Recommended,UPDATED OVERALL 2/10 the game has progressively gotten worse with desync audio spam bots glitches hackers etc. The developers choose to work on $5 dollar skins DLC bs and suing the competition rather than fixing their game. The patches they do release are like 8+ GBs and literally nothing changes..... I know many people who are leaving this game due to the failed management. Original Review Overall rating 7.0/10 at this time despite any negative criticism I would recommend this game as long as you feel the positives outweigh the negatives and keep in mind this is still alpha though this will be changing soon and I'm not sure if all the issues will be fixed by the time it releases which is why I wrote this review. I hope this helps in your buying decision. Note I only have 12+ hours of game play due to a 2 year old gaming laptop not being able to handle low settings causing graphic lag low detail etc. (I was doing traveling work) and also playing on the test server. I was basically a mule/medic in my squad. Since relocating back to where my desktop was located and having a GTX1070 / 16GB RAM / Phenom 2 (3.4 Ghz) etc. I am able to play on medium high settings with none of these issues. Please note if you would like to enjoy this game you should have a pretty decent and modern build. Pros +Great team based game (can solo but definitely more fun in a squad)+Forces players to continue moving/looting (circle gets smaller and smaller) mitigates long term snipe camping. +Graphics are actually pretty decent if your PC can handle max graphics. However most can only run low medium without sacrificing frames. +diversity in weapons and vehicles (I would like to see this expanded on further). +There is a degree of luck that plays into this game whether it is finding the right gear or dropping in the right location which is a nice variation to standard shooter games. Cons Optimization needs work need a really modern video card to be somewhat competitive (lower graphics lower ability to see enemies). Rubberbanding major issue especially at the start of any game where finding a weapon is important for immediate survival. Random crashes not often but does occur to almost everyone at one point or another. Cannot heal in vehicles while they are moving which seems counter intuitive (I can understand why you can't gas a vehicle up while moving). However no reason you can't drink/use pain meds/heal in vehicle. There is only one map (second on test server) I would like to see more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-28,0,0,425,False,Not Recommended,I actually enjoy PUBG its a very competitive game with a realistic feeling to gun play and a challenging environment to master that being said Blue Hole's developement team and CEO are actively ruining this game. After publicly admitting thats its player base is rife with cheaters 90% of whom are Chinese players and after experiencing death in this game due to cheating multiple times when I have the advantage its quite disenheartening. Especially so when they do ban cheaters for said cheaters to literally just turn around and buy another copy of the game and continue cheating. Their proposed solution of banning cheating players has been proven to be ineffective and yet they continue to do nothing about it. I've been fully in support of a region lock for some time now not only to stop the blatant cheating but when I play on a North American server I'm hoping that I can meet players I can converse with and develope friendships and find more people to continue to play with. At the moment its almost impossible to be matched in a North American server with any players that arent Chinese and this hampers my desire to play with friends even more. In summation its a game rife with cheaters that the developers continue to merely offer lip service in their attempts to address the problem dont buy this game until Blue Hole region locks servers for ALL areas and continents.Update Whatever the new update that was implemented has drastically made this game even worse. Where as before the game ran smoothly now the first 5 minutes being anywhere near another player is a rubberbanding lag fest which devolves into extreme frustration as you become incapable of manuevering your character due to extreme latency issues. seriously Bluehole you have a popular game formula fix it and stuck being such lazy morons. You have an insane revenue stream put more than the bare minimum of it back into the product that made you rich in the first place.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,1088,True,Recommended,An overall great game that will give you your money's worth since you 're gonna be investing hundreds of hours of playtime in it. To be frank the specific game is a worldwide phenomenon in the gaming industry the likes of which i saw only when World of Warcraft was launched back in 2004. This game has made people who never really got around playing 3ps fps shooters to do it with conviction. Be warned though before purchasing/playing that the game has performance issues and bugs. Moreover to fully enjoy the game forget the minimum requirements. You 'll need a high end rig and a fast internet connection. Also if you' re new to the 3ps fps genre you' re about to get literally stomped by the player community that has already spent thousands of hours in games such as Call of Duty Counter Strike Battlefield etc and has now migrated to PUBG.Recommended.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Those shortcomings being (a) movement is horrendous (give us climbing for fracks sake) (b) you might grab an item 3x before it actually decides to be a part of your inventory (c) the mid game is lacking (basically early game has some action and late game as well) (d) the loot crates give you nothing good in the way of cool looking gear or customization (e) network lag make close quarters fire fights a crap shoot at best(f) loot spawning needs to be tuned upAnyways I have logged a ton of hours playing this game and I've come to love it in spite of its flaws but I can't really recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-25,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,As far as I like the gameplay the game is very random and thus unfair. You can waste a lot of time not seeing anyone getting pretty damn good equipment just to be headshoted by a bullet from nowhere by a guy camping far away. You don't even now what hit you. The game requires thinking and rethinking your strategies it's a not blind shooter and that's good. But still even after latest patches the performance is very unstable from 40 do 140 fps the amount of cheaters is overwhelming and that makes the play pointless. Oh and as usuall I'd pay and extra buck just not to be mixed with eastern players. Seriously.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've met maybe 5 people that do in almost 100 hours of play time. No one listens to communication even if they do speak english or dont have microphones.

2017-12-25,0,0,63,False,Recommended,New update for this game really improved the experience. Getting high 80s 90s in FPS vs. 40 50 in the early access stages. The new map (desert) is even better than the first in my opinion lots more action goes on. Most weapons are balanced (some argue the Win94 needs some nerfing some say it is fine I don't really care.) Is the game worth $30? In my opinion it really depends on your situation. If you have buddies who have/want this game it's worth it without a doubt. I've had some amazing times with friends playing this game. If you're going lone wolf into matches you may have difficulty finding as much enjoyment out of it.Overall I definitely recommend it.

In quality it's pretty much a cash grab.Now about fun. It's extremely boring. One match of driving simultator 'battle royale' that takes twenty minutes. Most of a match consists you 'farming' for weapons rather than actually shooting people btw the term 'farming' is used in rpgs. The other rest is driving your uaz or dacia or whatever to 'farm' or find a good spot. After you find a good spot you just hide there like a complete coward and wait till idiots run toward you then start shooting your gun and loot them again. I mean come on play mario kart than this waste of a time. There are many good playable games out there and you definitely would rather play them.

2017-06-09,0,0,406,False,Not Recommended,Player unknowns battlegrounds is quickly becoming one of my new favorite games with a little over 120+ hours into it I think I am at the point to give a pretty fair review so lets begin.Pros Graphics are decent nothing mind blowing but still beautiful. Variety of guns melee and explosive weapons to chose from if found while looting. So far seems to have a decent gun modification/attachment system. This game is perfect for you and 3 buddies to play togeather as a squad this game helps reinforce teamwork and cooperation with other players on duo/squad gamemodes. So far seems to be really trucking along nicely weekly and monthly updates 2 new maps in dev as we speak more weapons to come. I think this is a great game and I would def recommend to anyone who likes survival of the fittest competitive FPS games.Cons Lower end PC's will typically not run this game good at all it is system intensive and also in public access so it will take time before the bigger opimizations come along. Seems to crash every so often which isn't that big of a deal. Vehicles can be pretty buggy and kill you randomly at times if you don't pay attention to what your doing. Lots of running in this game if you can't find a car most of this game depends on where you drop and what you loot. I personally don't find this too big of a deal but I am sure there are lots of people who dislike the blue circle drawing in while it keeps the game fast moving and competitive by adding yet another danger some people might not like the constant necessity to be forced to run from something you can do nothing about.I AM NOW 350 HOURS INTO THIS GAME! UPDATE BELOW!All was well in the beginning now when playing on NA servers you rarely get matched with teammates who speak english this makes communication impossible. Chinese hackers are riddled throughout teamkilling is still prevelant aswell. The game needs some major updates to be considered a complete game. They just came out of EA but it didn't change anything they released a 2nd map which I love. At the current state I would not recommend this game unless you have friends to play with and have patience because of hackers foreigners on NA servers rubber band lag and de sync. I simply would not buy this game as of now.I went from recommending this game to not recommending this game. REGULAR PLAYERS STILL CANNOT HOST CUSTOM MATCHES THAT IS A BENEFIT ONLY GIVEN TO THE ELITE STREAMERS OF WHOM PUBG STAFF DECIDES.

The game run on Unreal Engine so there's no GARBAGE collector on it. This game need at least 16gb of ram to run while the specs requirements are 6gb. LuL2. Lots of bug stuck in place horrible bug3. Optimisation is a joke the in game model render still has a lot of texture size and file. Some other game only use less than 2gb ram to handle the game. While pubg can't do that at all. (PS there's a couple of game ported from mobile to pc and can handle better than this game).4. Best multiplayer game? the server tick are so great. You can see in your death cam by yourself where the enemy is shooting at and where's your character location PS I have a good internet even Dota run on SEA at 40 ping LuL. 5. Lot of cheater which use wallhack auto aim etc.6. The server can't handle the packet data really well lots of lag.

Death cam and replay system are so desynced its laughable.ALL this in a released! 25+ game is pretty shocking definitely as core aspects like hit registration dont work properly and they want this to be a Esports game good luck.NOT RECOMMENDEDUPDATE 7 13/3/18 They have fixed alot of things replay system now works and hit registration is fixed or really improved also server and general game optimisations have improved the game alot parachuting is still but that hopefully gets fixed i can now recommend this game as i see alot of improvments and also the future potential of this game.RECOMMENDED,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers have made their priorities clear with their latest patch asking a further $9.99 a month on top of the $29.99 price for the base game. It would seem that Blue Hole has placed making money over customer satisfaction. I understand that they need to make money they are a business but it is a real slap in the face to their fanbase to tack on a free to play pay model on top of the price of the game. The sad thing is I enjoy this game and have over 850 hours across the test and regular servers. I dislike being taken advantage of and the game isn't good enough to further charge more money for a product that does not even feel complete. Its been more than a year since full release and this game still runs like trash even after a 2 year beta. I do not understand is it ignorance toward the fact that the game doesn't run that smooth or is it incompetance and the development team is incapable of fixing issues that have plagued this game since launch either way it is pathetic and to top it all off you are suing a company that subjectively has a better BR game than you do and it was tacked on in an after thought. Your priorities should be delivering the game that you set out to make but it seems the devs are content with ""good enough"" and that from a customers stand point is simply not good enough.

I got sucked in to the hype in the beginning and the squad play was very fun to squeeze some hours out of but the insane amount of bugs and performance issues with PubG have forced me away from the game to never come back. Now they have the balls to charge $10 for DLC they said they would never release when there has been no noticeable improvement in the game.

2018-06-21,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,Yeah I know at the time of writing this i have a measly 7.5 hours on the game so take what i say with a pinch of salt.I downloaded the free mobile port of the game and loved playing it even if there are a bunch of super easy to kill bots and the controls are clunky as all hell its fun exchanging battles with the real players you come across every now and then and now i play it with my girlfriend and we have a great time.So i thought to myself it why not buy the real game? After seeing youtube videos of shroud tearing it up I thought hell this could actually be some fun. I was severely dissapointed.I wish there was at least something positive about this but in the time I've spent on this game I havent enjoyed a single minute of it. Any time i play on OC servers (in my home country of australia) im just flooded with Chinese players and when they're in duos with me they only ever know enough english to say that they cant speak english and they want to be my friend. I love the concept of this game and the idea of playing it with my friends and winning some games but i find myself just stopping playing after like one or two games in a session.

2018-06-21,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,I wanted to get into PUBG and have it be a worthwile game as much as the next guy. It was reccomended to me by a friend the enemies are difficult to see at first and it takes some getting used to. Most of the deaths you encounter are you plainly getting sniped and are more or less unavoidable. As well as an increase in hackers and cheaters PUBG is now a game I would not reccomend. Bluehole itself is so ballsy that they are pursuing lawsuits against Epic and not realizing that their game is losing players because Bluehole can (or doesn't want to) keep up with its competitors who release new items and balance changes weekly. PUBG has now hit the sale stage of a popular game meaning they are so desperate for players that they must decrease the value of the game to try and scrape in as many new players as they can.

And ontop of that they are trying to milk more money from the player base with keys and now a BattlePass?! t. They need to get their together as this game is broken in so many ways and asking people to pay for more is absurd.

The game looks a little better now and movement has been improved. The new guns are also great and I enjoy the new map. Playing solo or queued are both entertaining most of the time. The game is still heavily based on RNG so your satisfaction may vary. Now for the negatives there's still some stuttering you experience even if you have a mid or high range PC. It's been patched a little but it still is there sometimes. Also lag and rubberbanding do occur from time to time. The price tag to me still seems a bit off putting because of the content available but I think for now I would recommend it if you find it on sale.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Bullet travel times laughable you can throw a baseball faster than most the bullets in player unknowns travel.And your aimer is often your worst enemy because it deceives you. Your biggest mistake when playing PUBG would be to assume because your aiming at someone you're going to hit them. I've shot right at people with my reticle right on them at 20 metres away and watched my bullet fly off to the left or right on video replay. I wish the game would remain more about skill and less about the RNG when my bullet leaves the gun.Hopefully the devs will release a hardcore mode with features like more bullet damage higher bullet velocities more weapon accuracy and locked first person view.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-26,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,I am from Yogyakarta Indonesia. I think the minimal spec requirements too high for #1 top seller game. I use my expensive 600$ average PC with Core i3 and NVidia GTX750 and the game run so lag although I used lowest graphic setting and highest performance setting of my graphic card. Upgrade the graphic card is too expensive for me. At least for 3 years later I still can't do upgrade yet.

So now i am happy again!Update 25.12.2017I finally decide to give this game a bad Review....I hope that in future there will be a game which copies this fudging game and does it better.Cause I love the Concept but i start to hate the devs for not being transparent enough only doing a job and not fixing one bit....I hope a game like Scum gets it right with realism and actually something you can call a server. Cause a Battle Royale in that game would actually be realistic and nice.Pubg is definetley made by a company that doesn t know their stuff.They are 100% not proffessional.Server went well on Testservers for 1 Week until they Updated it and ed it all up once again.Now they Updated the Live Servers to that ed up Version. Game keeps rubberbending laggs Netcode went to aswell.So yeah instead of improving they ed it all up and wasted a good oportunity.But oh happy us at least they got the Crates rolling in soon.Priorities done well...I would say this game is the worst experience 2017... that price goes to you Bluehole.Edit (26.06.2018)After the new Shanok update i would like to give this game a double thumb down if it would be possible.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEOnce again the devs showed us that they are not capeable of doing anything than longing their shriveld old cumhands for money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

While the negative reviews aren't too far off the mark I don't believe a few crashes and a bit of rubber banding makes this game so bad it isn't worth playing. The test servers are a bit glitchy but the primary game has been fine tuned and actually runs very smoothly. As far as bullets not registering I don't believe I've ever had that issue and I have shot a lot of players. Perhaps they simply missed?THE GAMEPLAY IS FLIPPING EPIC. You can expect hours of fun with heavy doses of adrenaline and seizure inducing frustration to boot. Long time CS and Battlefield player love me some Fallout and Elder Scrolls I've even been known to dabble in some Civilization. PUBG is hands down the absolute best game in my library.

So if you want to learn how to play you'll have to either look it up online or just dive in head first and wing it from there.Overall the game is very tense and exciting throughout and keeps you on your toes the whole time. The guns do tons of damage and even if you manage to get the drop on someone and kill them you'll rarely leave a gunfight unscathed. Even someone armed with just a pistol can take down someone with a shotgun and sniper rifle if they're lucky. This can be a blessing and a curse as you can easily die if you so much as stop moving for a second to pick something up or look around.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They change way to much and are starting to become more like fortnite. with the event pass and making you have to buy keys. but whats worse is you probably will some work boots or some gun skin you already have after spending your REAL money on a key to open these crates. I am writting this review in the hopes that the developers see this and finally realize the mistakes they are making with this game. I already payed real money to purchase and play this game. I shouldnt have to spend real money to gamble on a skin if i want one. fortnite allows you to actually pick the skin you want and its free to play. so its more understandable on their terms. this game was much better when i first started playing then now. you guys have changed way to much and not fixed the problems that need to be corrected. like getting shot through walls? or gettting ran over by a vehicle that is barely moving that you are next to/on the side of trying to get in. fix your current issues before trying to become more like fortnite. this game was better than fortnite prior to all of the changes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I mean look how many people are online at a given time im hoping all that revenue gets invested well and i have full confidence that the devs will pull through with an amazing and polished game! i usually never purchase early access and i held my breath while i bought this one....but man am i glad i didProsan array of weapons from all shapes and sizes are present with semi realistic handling and loads of customizable gear you can find on the battlegrounds.Movement is semi fluid...well..atleast for me i know some may disagree and i feel like some improvements could be made of course (like being able to pull yourself up over a ledge that isnt even above your chest) but at the stage right now its solid. I also liked the idea of being able to roll in with a sqaud of people and try to make it as a team communication is rare but still its nice knowing i can loot with someone watching my back. Being able to drop into the map from a plane is great as well being able to pick the point in the map that you wanna start and seeing all the opposition falling in all around you its kinda exciting. And lets talk about heart pounding action!!! Try looting and then you hear a door open in the house your in or vice versa! You enter a house and hear a dude upstairs running around like a dying gazelle with tapdancing shoes on man the RUSH!

But the update messed up literally everything else. Whenever I finish a match the game will crash making me force quit it. But even after that the game continues to run in the background and can't even be closed by task manager forcing a system restart if i want to launch it again. If you do manage to play a game there's a 50 percent chance that it will just give you a message on your screen that says ""Lost connection to steam"". If i was having connectivity problems while playing this would make sense but i wasnt. I was in a long distance fire fight and everything was going fine. But then this window pops up. One you get that screen your only option is to hit ""ok"" which then instantly closes the entire application. But remember whenever the game closes it keeps running in the background and you have to restart your system. Honestly before this update i would have totally given a positive review.

Now with this latest update releasing the new map ""Sanhok"" This map seems less optimized than the already poorly optimized maps before it (even though this is much smaller). The UI is still laggy and full of bugs. It seems like they are trying the mimic fortnite's battlepass system which would be fine BUT this is a paid game. This costs $30 fortnite is free. These games may not be the same type of battle royale subgenre but we can clearly see which one is choosing the ethical route.

2017-07-15,0,0,1795,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly this game has been ruined. If you like playing with your team mates this isn't the game for you. When I first got this game i really loved it. I still love it but this game and it's developers have let me down and it's unacceptable.The first problem 95 98% of players on north american server are chinese. I have played roughly 25 games since i have talked to someone whose first language is chinese. Most people at least can say hello in english but there always remains a huge language barrier which gets them and often me killed in the process. It is awful and has ruined the teamwork part of the game. LOCK THEM TO THEIR OWN REGIONA SERVER OR THIS GAME WILL SUFFER.Problem #2 Chinese hackers tons of em. You should see the number that has been banned i can't imagine they've even reached the tip of the iceburg. The hacks are blatant and you hve no way of seeing if your reports are doing anything. If someone is clrealy hacking but another enemy happens to finish you off you are unable to report that hacker (really dumb devs have 0 foresight.)Problem #3 This game is way too much looting. It shouldn't take 15 minutes to find a SCOPE and sometimes a RED DOT! Yes you heard me! I've been unable to find them for that long before. Magnification is a fundamental part of playing the game just as fundamental as HAVING a gun. The nature of the combat garuntees you will need a scope if you plan on traveling any distance in anywhere that isnt a city. Scopes are just wayy too rare. The 2x at least needs to be a bit more common.... Every time someone i know quits this game it's because thy say th #4 Random bugs Despite nearing a billion dollars in sales in this game the devs still are going slow and suck at fixing and identifity MAJOR ISSUES. Just two games ago I vaulted a normal barrier with nothing obstructing and i was killed instantly from ""falling."" That is unnacceptable in my opinion. There were also people not thinking when they put together the map because there are many places you can get permanantly stuck. I was once stuck and after about 30 seconds I dropped dead. There also still remains an insane amount of unvaultable perfectly low barriers. There are also tree trunks to hide you body in and shoot out of without even being seen#5 To my knowledge smoke grenade patterns are decided clientside. I've been hididen in a smoke that's blowing to the right only to be targeted and shot then realising that on their screen it's blowing a completely different way that me and to him im just standing in the open. #6 This one is a huge joke/ The death cam and . When you see the crosshair it's not even on the spot you were aiming. The movements aren't fluidto a much much bigger extent replay system is basically a huge broken mess.i don't even know what to say. The crosshair isn't where it belongs the movements look like someone has parkinson's When you fire and moreso for first shots where it's nearly 100% that don't make a sound flash or show recoil.#7 This is a problem i have personally. They've made so much money off of us and they can't even fix the game. They're approaching 1billion in sales with all the copies they sold. There are probelms everywhere I can't mention them all because i don't know about more. The game is fun but if the devs don't make a big change this game is going to run into the ground.Yes I am mad.

2018-02-19,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,I really tried to like the Game and if I look at the Gameplay alone I do but it has a lot of flaws and feels unpolished. About 65% of the time you're not dying because of lack of skill you're dying becuse you ran for 10min without seeing anyone and then someone is behind you or as soon as you move in a bit more visible space there is already a camper with a sniper and 8x scope waiting 400m away. Another big problem is the loot system you can run through two big houses and the only thing you find are gloves and a extended mag for a pistol while the other person who is with you on the spot found a scar m4 lvl3 vest and a backpack. This makes Solos nearly impossible to play while duos and Squads are fun most of my friends already gave up on the Game.

2017-04-05,0,0,428,False,Not Recommended,This game is as if the DEV teams of H1Z1 and Arma got together and made a game.Except unlike h1z1 this game doesn't suck. And it's a lot more like Arma in the combat mechanics where you have to think tactically and not just run and shoot everything.UPDATED REVIEW 19/06/18 I made this review had only been in early access for a week or two which is when i bought it. And while making this review i accepted that an early access game would be buggy unoptimized and lacking content. I realized that when i had bought an early access game and looked past it.However now that it has been out of early access for a while now it is honestly shameful to see that they haven't much improved the situation in terms of the content and optimization. Granted they've fixed many game breaking bugs (which they HAVE to do may i add) and improved the optimization but for a game that is now fully released and has been for a while now the optimization and the sever lack of content is concerning. They rushed the 1.0 update in my opinion (maybe so they could add skins quicker without breaking their promise of not adding them during early access?). Honestly the game should be coming out of early access with the release of the winter map this coming November not when it did.And as someone who plays a lot of CS GO i know how important a good netcode low ping and high tickrate is in a first person shooter. Let me say this the net code in this game is a joke. The servers run on very low tickrates and as a result some shots that should register dont and because for some reason they refuse to region lock players you sometimes have players from Asia or NA running around on 200+ping shooting you while you're in cover simply because of this fact.Also region lock should be implemented simply because such a disproportionately high amount of cheaters originate from China (remember proportions matter). If the anti cheat can't always catch them i don't see why we should deal with cheaters from other regions who also use high ping to their advantage.My overall verdict is that if you do not already own this game DON'T BUY IT for another year or two. Let them get their s**t together and actually make this worth the 27 (or 18 as its on sale as im writing this).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-19,0,0,229,True,Not Recommended,TL DR at the bottom PUBG is an amazing game when it works. The combat is intense the map is detailed and lively your heart races when you get near the last zone playing duos and squads is awesome. If PUBG didn't have the following flaw it would be my all time favourite game.And what is that flaw?The game was rushed into early access.Bluehole was so desperate to get PUBG out there they esentially created a barebones game then chucked it on early access and decided to update it from there. I suppose that's not all bad. We get to play it earlier than we would've done without early access. And we get to contribute to development. Sounds pretty damn good actually.Or at least it would have been if they added useful updates. Most of PUBGs early access updates have been graphical patches new items sounds and a more frontend polished feel. But it seems to me that Bluehole have completely forgotten about the backend of things.Optimisation server performance and fatal bug fixes have all been forgotten about. I'll go into more detail.Optimisational Flaws It's very hard to get PUBG to run at a decent speed without turning graphics to the minimum and even then you can run into errors. This isn't just a problem with potato PCs though everyone seems to have this.Server Performance &amp Networking You will soon come to hate the infamous 'Network Lag' box that pops up about 50 times in a game. The black box pops up and stops you from doing anything until it's sorted itself out. Most of the time it goes away in a few seconds sometimes it can take a minute. And quite often you'll have to Alt F4 your way out and reconnect to the game sometimes killing you.Again multiple case studies show that this isn't a client side issue and that even people on super high speed stable internet connections are often disconnected from games. It's not blamable on the game engine either. Squad and Fornite both use Unreal Engine (just like PUBG) and their servers are flawless.Fatal Bug Fixes PUBG crashes. A lot. More than it should. And it goes without saying it's not a client side issue (99% of the time anyway).Overall On the frontend side of things PUBG looks and feels amazing to play. It comes across at first as a very polished game with no reason to dislike. But once you put a few hours in you start to really see the carelessness and lack of effort that was put into the core mechanics. Many games have small flaws. ArmA 3 has a lot of issues sometimes and it can be a real pain to play. But it makes up for it in other aspects. Unfortunately PUBG just doesn't do this. And more often than not you're left pretty dissapointed because you crashed out when you could of won the game.Example Earlier today I was in a game. I was doing really well full gear and a perfect spot. Last 10 players I had this game in the bag. Then up comes our friend the Network Lag. I patiently waited for about a minute then opened up my Steam browser to check if my wifi was down. Nope running just as it should be. Waited another minute still got this 'Network Lag'. So I Alt F4 out and rejoin. As soon as I rejoin I am killed by the blue zone. Great I guess I'll join into another game. But oh no PUBG wasn't done with me. I didn't get a 'You Died' screen after this so I couldn't back out to the lobby. Tried to Alt F4 and I get some crazy error which then corrupts my game files and I have to validate them through Steam.TL DR / Conclusion PUBG is a great concept and in some aspects a great game. However I feel that the development should focus more on the backend areas to create a more stable frame. The release was too early and the updates focus on the wrong things.I would recommend keeping updated with the game and purchasing it once stability has been improved so that you don't end up with Network Lag PTSD.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game needs these things to grow again.1 Add more weapons2 more animation i.e entring exiting vehicles 3 player must have more knockout stances. 4 player must be able to drag his downed buddy to safety or also option to carry . 5 bullets should pass through thin / light materials. 6 night mode will be a plus with flashlight / laser attachments and NVGS.

Other than that this game is absolutely amazing!Blue hole has done exactly what they said they would and optimized the game got rid of most hackers made the game far less laggy and got rid of most glitches. The replay system is really good now and there are new maps coming out all the time. There is a lot more cosmetic options for clothes and guns now as well.There is still some lag misses on your shots but maybe once out of 5 hours of play with a half decent computer(i run a 1050ti and do just fine). A hacker will pop up every now and then but less and less. There is a reason so many people have 500+ hours on this(even negative reviewers).

2017-12-27,0,0,455,False,Not Recommended,To start of with at first I loved this game and it's concept.However after 300 hrs in this game I have to admit that I dislike this game more than I like it in the end.This game is far from optimized and makes you swear more often than laugh. Today I walked into a house and when I went through the ground level door I got knocked down due to falling. The amount of frustration due to imbalance glitches bugs and general crappy performance (stutter and server lag) makes this game a ragefilled experience. I have had great moments and a good laugh but this game in it's latest development has gone down the drain if you ask me. Perhaps in the future but I doubt I will enjoy this game like I did when it was just the old map.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-04,0,0,273,True,Recommended,So I promised I would rewrite my review when my pc wouldn t crash anymore because of this game and it seems like the launch update did the trick. It plays much more stable right now and it even looks like the FPS has been increased a bit as well. The game however still crashes sometimes when returning to the main menu but luckily it doesn t happen often and it doesn t make my pc crash like before. It s also important to say that my friend doesn t have this problem at all which means that my problem might be rare and thus it might not affect you. The new desert map is really enjoyable and the vault mechanics work great. There are also a few new weapons and vehicles added and some of the sounds like the red zone bombs and engines of the vehicles have been improved. So since my main issue has been fixed because of the launch update and the addition of the new free content I will give this game a thumbs up now.Orginal ReviewI love the game it's fun to play yet I have to give it a thumbs down at the moment due to it's incredibly bad technical state. I had 160+ hours playtime before the last patch of 26 october 2017 the game worked fine. My system meets the recommended specs and I played with 45 80 FPS. Sure the game did glitch out a few times and it wasn't really well optimized but it still worked and it was fun. After this patch however the game causes my PC to randomly freeze / crash. I only have this problem while playing PUBG. This is why I can not give it a thumbs up at the moment the game is literally making my PC crash. When the problem is fixed I will change the review and definitely recommend it but for now it's a thumbs down for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-23,0,0,377,False,Not Recommended,Absolutely no reason to play anymore. Honestly I hate the building mechanic in Fortnite but atleast their game works and they aren't constantly trying to milk their players.If you want to play a battle royale without building give Realm Royale a try. It's in alpha currently but it run way better than pubg will ever run. It's a shame I had alot of fun with the game even when it was broken but I'm tired of their broken promises to fix the game and to not milk their playerbase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-23,0,0,493,False,Not Recommended,I love playing this game as you can probably tell from the amount of hours i have put into it. However the sheer amount of absolute t from the developers especially with this last update is just baffling. The vast majority of the platerbase hates playing on miramar and even very high profile players like jackfrags have publicly said that they do not want to play it. Instead of doing something about it they added the map select feature but now they have removed it again because it supposedly impacted the queue times. If nobody wants to play miramar and map selection messes with the queue time wouldn't the logical decision be to remove the map and fix the issues before forcing people to play it? Anyways. By far the biggest issue is the disgusting cash grabbing attitude of the developers. I usually don't have a problem with paid items in games as long as they are only cosmetics but when the developers would rather make a ripoff of the fortnite battlepass for 10$ on top of the initial **30$ price of the game itself** than fix big issues that a lot of people have been complaining about you have to wonder what the intention of the devs is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-25,0,0,639,True,Recommended,Since Ive played this for 300+ hours ima give a positive review. Its fun better with friends. When you get killed by a number tho for example NA 240 413 or as if its a code not like a name or anything chances are its possibly a hacker. Its rare to get killed by hackers or if you made it to top ten maybe u might meet one. Ive encountered two hackers when I've reached top 10 usually in the kill feed ull see it appear multiple times when it kills people. Usually a sniper would take two shots to kill someone one to see where the shot goes the other to finally hit its mark. But what if a sniper just constantly gets hit with just one shot in the head not a test shot. If you died by a number its probably likely a hacker. I have yet to encounter hackers in duos or squads.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-29,0,0,1097,True,Recommended,This game is absolutely fantastic. Yes it has bugs due to it's engine and early access status but it's clear they are working to update the game and iron out bugs. It's beyond me why the toxic community from CS and H1Z1 have the attitude towards this game that they do. Maybe when they grow up and learn how these things work they'll understand. Or not.It's a great 3rd/1st person shooter in a battle royale (think Hunger Games) where you parachute in look around for weapons and armour then procede to take down the other 99 players. When it was first announced I thought it would just be another of the cash ins on FPS games that Steam was cursed with at the time (asset flippers low quality games badly supported titles poor devs etc) so I didn't pre order it. I really regret that now as I like the look of the items you got with preorder!Still I've got nearly 500 hours in this game and while I'm not much more than an average player the game is so addictive. The worst thing about this game are the toxic players out there so it's probably best to turn off ingame world speak until Bluehole add some form of player identification so you can report players for racism etc. As for cheating it's rife in most games out there but if you look at the ban reports there are huge amounts of people that have been removed. Clearly the anti cheat and report feature is working. I'd defintely recommend this especially if you have a group of friends to play in duos or squads of 4. To my mind the group games are much more fun as you can add in communications team tactics etc. I can honestly say it's the best money I've spent in a long time. It's onwards and upwards for this game. Buy it. Buy it now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is in game currency earned through playing and you can spend real money. However most (I have heard most but to me it is ALL) of the loot boxes require a key to unlock and keys can only be bought with real money. After my first five hours of play i had not obtained a single new item. Not one. EVERY crate I bought with my in game currency had a lock on it. It takes a special kind of sadist (or unabashed greed) to design a system like that.

2017-10-04,0,0,318,True,Recommended,"This game is currently a hype. If you have not heard about it you live behind a rock. It is by far one of the most played games on steam and might break some console games in the top 10 this year so we pc master race can finally say its not just pokemon which is the most sold game. well except it comes out on consoles then probably the console version of it itself will beat itself dayum.It is nothing new however neither in mechanics nor gameplay. You can have the same game in thousand different ways since years but nobody until now cared. Since none of them mixed it so well together with the east european arma/dayz style the correct amount of cold war era weaponry and the good hommage to the original movies of battle royale.It is just a coincidence dayz got a huge amount of negative reviews recently for not finally finishing up while this early access game clearly can do it better with stock assets and stuff.I do not recommend you to buy this if you still read comments to buy it. I do recommend you to buy this if you want the game anyway since it's fun. But make no mistake it has pro's and cons... Pros map with different highlights and theme parks stuffed with weapons and a circle that gets smaller proven game concept straight execution literally start with parachutes only after game lobby burning people from lobby make nice effect on plane voice chat optional thank the heavens pan deflects bullets 100 player servers random teamups instead of trying to pimp one of those half baked 3d engines like arma or h1z1 into becoming a shooter they successfully nerfed the unreal engine into feeling slightly less smooth but still better than the other alternatives. no arctic monkeys or acid rain just plain good old artillery no rain in buildings your skill in this game is visible on the amount of viewers on your twitch account everybody in this game is a pro not a starving simulator so no food and drink and stuff so far no micro transaction based weapon drops good to make streams because emergent gameplay and people watch it no cover for your enemies because trees respect each others private space and grow far from each other or sometimes you even can enjoy that your building models do not load so you can just enjoy poor mans wallhack you can get into a car of an enemy since its not just a mod from another game where the modder didnt figure out how to circumvent teams because the modder didnt have to write code Cons no skill gameplay with little improvement curve first person might make you think you are a hamster some people are taking the molotovs and throw them away way to early in the lobby srsly first come first served encounters yes they said no microtransactions but then there was some and i include it but i dont care more hackers than they admit but luckily who cares as long as the worst get banned from time to time seriously who hacks in a game where no one gives a flying f* if you are good at it unneccessary to blame yourself if you fail syndrome inclusive ragequits eventual unwanted hunger on victory you could make the same game after a week learning any 3d engine and buying assets in a store but you will never get rich by it so you can try the next best thing and spend as much time in steam market as you spend in playing this game solo because you think you have to exercise a gameplay that is based on a books someone wrote about russian roulette because most people have voice off you cant play herbert the pervert dont you get stuck on a prop or get killed by a player whose houses didnt load refresh button is not the best solution for not being smart enough to integrate coherentui into your blueprint based UDK ""code"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In all honesty I don't know why people compare them that much but here I am. I mean yeah they are both a shooter you have to scavenge your gear and you fall from a plane of sorts into some island...yet that's where all similarities end. In PUBG you'll find the most reallistic scenario weapons and mechanics. Yet don't be fooled into thinking that bullets get affected by wind like in Sniper Elite.The good everything....when it works. Hell I find it frustrating getting stuck on some random piece of wood just to get my brain splattered all over the ground...or the car suddently deciding that gravity is just a meme and chooses to lift from the ground for no apparent reason....but the worst thing of them all by miles are cheaters. If I let myself go explaining that one my review and account would surely get banned due to ""some"" extremely accurate yet offensive words.So yeah thats about it. Great game it is still evolving for good but it has a lot of ground to cover while keeping new content coming in.

2017-12-22,0,0,279,False,Recommended,Game 5/5 Playing experience 2/5While the game itself is excellent in its simplicity (a bunch of people scavenging for weapons and going at it with the last one(s) remaining the winner) it would be even better if it actually worked relatively well. Small bugs that make you run while blinking back a couple of paces now and again are annoying but now not even that incomplete gaming experience is availabe as servers are offline.In short the game itself is excellent (at least during the early access phase it was). It does not run smoothly though and we probably have millions of patches (as usual) to look forward to... Yay...Anyone interested in buying this game would probably do well to wait a few months as the game is nearly unplayable at times at the moment. When it IS playable however it is one of the most exciting and addictive games out there.

2017-11-07,0,0,446,True,Recommended,Positive and Negative honest review Unfortunately i have to write this review in a negative tone not because of the game literally just because of the influx of cheaters i've come across... At first i'd accept it and move on the odd 1 or 2 cheaters in every 10 15 games i played but now its becoming a joke they are so obvious to someone who has alot of experience in this game in the last 5 games i've played i have ran into cheaters with a burst fire M16A4 downing me from 400 metres+ and watching them in duo's with a buddy who isn't cheating and obviously letting the cheater push first to kill us before we even have a chance to fire our weapons. I understand that the people at Bluehole Studio are doing their best to deal with this but in my opinion if you don't deal with these cheaters RIGHT NOW it will be the one and only thing to destroy the game thats gotten it so right and so good so far. I still play this game every day in a hope that I run into a cheater just to report them so i can help clean up the cheater infestation but for now i'd hold off on buying this game until its cheater free and return when its back to itself in full glory.TL DR I do recommend this game but NOT right now due to massive cheater influx.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-03,0,0,166,False,Recommended,I enjoy this game a ton. Its a different experience every time you never know what youll get yourself into. The gunplay is great and fun and you may surprise yourself about what situations you survive. But this game is underdeveloped the devs are focusing their resources on a lawsuit rather than updating and adding more to this already good game. There is a communication issue between the players and the devs and the players really need to know whats going on with the game. There are connection issues performance issues and many more. All these need to be fixed to keep its player base this game needs to be updated more often and more content is needed more often to keep its player base. I cant see myself leaving this game because i love it so much but its player base is drastically dropping and the devs are playing a very dangerous game of not fixing the game and going after other companies for pitiful reasons. Over all I would recommend this game but I also think you should know whats going on so you are not disappointed with what is happening. With recent things happening i feel the team is trying to turn around what theyve been doing and communication more often and they recently started a reddit thread that will hopefully be happening every friday for information on certain things and bugs noticed by the community.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-20,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a battle royal genre video game. It's enticing graphics and immense competitive gameplay puts you the player in a map (currently two) with 99 other players. It's up to you to scavenge the surrounding areas and find loot like weapons armor medicinal supplies and ammo to survive until you are the last man standing.PUBG was a unique experience for me. It was fun exhilarating yet slow and meh paced. Gun fights are really fun especially if they're quite the distance away and both players have scopes. Close combat gun fights are also really fun but not my cup of tea. It is especially easy to be picked off if you don't know what you're doing.I've only had about 3 hours of gameplay before I gave up for a while. The game is really fun really exciting and it lives to it's tale. I don't quite understand the issue with loot boxes and the need for keys. Accessories do not apply any in game advantages except for looking cool.PUBG is a really fun really worth thirty bucks to spend. I recommend it as the game is only growing more and more popular. It's fun exciting thrilling but can be slow at times. It's fun!Rating 8.3/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No random drops in the middle of nowhere YOU CAN DRIVE A BOAT People in the lobby are hillarious. You will here IM A SNAKE being shouted all the time.Cons Im not sure how servers are hosted but alot of lagging issues (I play squad alot with 3 other friends from around the country and when I have lagging issues they all experience this too) Few hackers. There is no spectate mode when you die (on solo play) so you cant see if people are hacking or not. You can litteraly walk in 2 rooms and get all your armor and 3 great wepons or you could walking into 10 houses and just find a crow bar. Loot isnt always well ballecedOverall a great game.

Love the adrenaline from top 10 situations. Love in game voice chat (after the game lobby) to talk to team mates or the random guy who got in your vehicle with you.Nothing more infuriating than running 20 minutes the whole game to be killed right when you get into the safe zone but if you can make it past games like those you'll start to see the magic of this game.Nothing more satisfying than melting someone with a suppressed automatic glock or getting a sweet headshot with a sniper rifle.Enjoy being invisible if you manage to get the ghillie suit or nearly invisible from being a bush wookie.Would definitely recommend this game to others!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-01,0,0,181,False,Not Recommended,"I think I've finally zeroed in on why this game is fundamentally unenjoyable to me.Although it's considered the ""father"" of Battle Royale this is the most generic form of the game mode. Out of the flavors of Battle Royale you have Fantasy Realm RoyaleBuilder FortniteMilsim Arma3 BR (My personal favorite)But what is PUBG? It's not milsim like its predecessor and it has no nuances. There isn't that much in terms of item variety... every round feels essentially identical. It has a few nice features (vaulting was well done) but for me that's the only thing this game does well over other games.They took something great and simplified it for the masses but now they have nowhere to expand. They're being outpaced by every other development team which can explore their respective flavors more and update far more frequently.I hope they can find their strength and make the game something that expands on their particular subgenre of Battle Royale before it ends up dead in the water. As my friends stop wanting to play I'll most likely as well. I used to enjoy ARMA BR solo but haven't had the urge to play this game unless friends coerce me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,It's an interesting concept but I'm not sure I really like it that much. Maybe it's just me but running around a large open map for 5 minutes before being killed in two shots by a player I didn't see with much better gear than me didn't really make for an engaging experience.On top of that the customisation options are laughably limited. Apparently there's more available through a lootbox system which is quite frankly a stupid idea. You buy lootboxes using points earned in game and get random cosmetic rewards from them. Why not just have a cosmetics shop and let us pick what we want to spend the points on? Or better yet don't start us off with such a laughably small collection of cosmetics just so you can stick a bunch of them in a token gambling system.The game seems stable enough. I heard a lot of complains about glitches and hackers but I didn't run into any during the three matches I played. What I did find incredibly annoying was half the time I tried to play the game refused to work because the servers were too busy. I didn't pay 25.99 for a game that I can't play if it decides it has a headache.Which brings me on to my final but by no means least relevant complaint the price. This is NOT a 26 game this is a 15 game at best and even that might be being generous. What you get for the ridiculous price is nowhere near worth it even if you enjoy the 100 player battle royale thing. I complained earlier about the lack of cosmetics and frankly I'd say any game that has the gall to lock half its content behind a lootbox system should not be charging this much as the base price. This is probably just down to my taste but if you like shooters there are better games out there and if you like survival games there are better games out there. This is really just an okay at best game that was massively overhyped by livesteamers and I wouldn't recommend buying it until the price drops considerably. It's not a bad game but it's certainly not worth the price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But it's sadly unplayable.Blue hole refuses to do anything about the chinese problem and dare to label everyone xenophobic for pointing out the obvious. Ignore the hackers and cheaters that have been and remain an issue. sadly this isn't even what's ruined the game. The latency is horrendous. Your hit box remains in place several seconds after leaving a window or entering cover. There's nothing you can do. i've droped from the top 1% to 6% in two days and almost every death is the same. 3 to 5 strides behind a wall suddenly you fall over dead.I know how the game should and does play. I HAVE 800 ING HOURS PLAYED.

For starters this game is absolutely FLOODED with just about every language spoken EXCEPT ENGLISH. It has a rough learning curve and how you work with your team if you're not doing solo games will either make or break you. All is fair in the hunt for the Glorious Chicken Dinner!Pros Extremely team oriented outside of Solo play. Wepons are significantly balanced. Player base is MASSIVE. Virtually no wait time for games. Character customization. Visuals look very decent.Cons Introduced microtransactions for Keys (gambling) Playerbase consists of everybody that doesn't speak english Optimization is very sketchy on lower end computers still Server connection issues are always causing trouble Black screens on loading into a match can cause you to miss your drop or even disconnect and crash your game This game is absolutely FLOODED with cheaters right now. Battleye is struggling to keep up. Working on your leaderboard stats is pretty much pointless as they are CONSTANTLY resetting the leaderboards due to hackersWhile the Idea for this game is very good. The execution is terrible. Theres no region locked servers so every other country in the world connects to US servers just to ""Troll the Americans"" and it just ruins the game. Trying to play the game solo is your only chance if you don't have friends that play. Attempting to find a team in solo play that speaks english is virtually impossible. The Cons far outweigh the pros in this game and I find myself only on it when i play with a full team of friends. That being said I give it a 4/10 and i would not recommend this game unless you have a fairly decent size group that plays it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Great game but not for anyone who rages a lot. You land with nothing but that doesn't make it equal. Different people find different loot and some loot is better than others.The biggest problem is the wait times. It takes very long from the time you press play to the time that the play starts flying overhead. This means that a lot of the time people wait all that time then die within the first few seconds of landing. This can be very frustrating and time consuming.The main other problem is lag and performance. There is server lag sometimes and you need an above average computer to run this game let alone well.Other than that the game is revolutionary and will completely change the gaming genre.

It's obviously a much different experience and a lot of PUBG purists sneer at that game but it's fun in its own way and it won't make your computer suffer to run it.

Although is was only in the event mode for the week I would really like it to come back in the game. Either as a option to play in or just in the game at all times.

Don't buy the stuff if you don't want it. It is all purely cosmetic. They ignore all the ACTUAL updates the game gets and about what it doesn't get. Everytime the devolopers update something that people wanted they find something else to about. People wanted more maps we have more maps. People wanted map selection we have map selection. People wanted performance improvements we also got that! Just not good enough for everyone apparently. I have had almost no performance issues in the past 3 updates.I love this game for everything it is. The realism the rush of getting a kill the waiting knowing someone is around and only having a pistol wondering if you're going to make it out alive.

2018-06-24,0,0,119,False,Recommended,Owned PUBG on Xbox had about 10 days played built a gaming PC and bought it again lol. Overall I think it's an awesome game that's just a lot of fun to play solo or with friends. Guess I'll do a quick PRO/CON of my opinions since that's easy.PRO Good gunplay Good graphics Good terrain diversity Good weapon variation(feels like just about anything is viable) Good communityCON Crate microtransactions(take that as you will I know they need developement money) Controls can be a little clunky(movement) both on PC and Xbox(but it's not that bad) Vehicle mechanics although they've improved Like with many games the Devs can have very poor communication about know issues/bugsAt the end of the day most of the issues I think are wrong with the game are more Developer related than actual gameplay so it doesn't have THAT big of an impact more like annoyances. Anyway great game would highly recommend for anyone interested in shooters both casual and serious alike.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-25,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,Poorly optimised at start gameplay repetitive and boring. Bought as soon as it was available on steam (all that time ago) and barely played.Over hyped for a game which is a running simulator and then an fps. (regardless of how good you are you get the same experience playing last man standing or some other mode similar in any normal fps you just avoid the loot/running simulator).Only bought due to hype and assumed there must be something behind it. I stopped playing ages ago and only getting round to reviewing now. I called the downfall of this monotone and reptitive genre almost on release. The only reason fortnite is still going is because kids play anything thats half decent and can be played with friends.

2017-07-18,0,0,263,True,Not Recommended,It will be a great game once the bugs are worked out. Honestly save your money until it's more stable. Some days you can play with no issues other days all you see is 'NETWORK LAG DETECTED' every few seconds. Buy it now and deal with the frustrating days or buy it later when they've got the game and servers more stabilized and you don't have to deal with the crashes laggy servers and racist children that fill the lobby.In a few months this game will be recommended highly.

2017-07-18,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,"I understand this is an early access but the lag issues in this game are atrocious. The jump mechanic needs some work too the other thing that i find agrovating is that a single gun shot sounds like its coming from all sides which makes it very diffucult to identify the direction it came from my final complaint about this game is the jumping punch or ""superman punch"" it is rediculose how much damage it does. with a level 2 helmet on my friend punched me and took half my health and destroyed 75% of the helmet.

I think this is a game of patience it will take some time to get used to how all the guns work the places to drop on the maps and the different areas that you are narrowed down to fighting on depending on the zone placement. This game can be very annoying but trust me after you get your first chicken dinner you will feel unstoppable.Edit There are a lot of hackers yes.

I just didn't find it fun.Let me explain I HATE the gun balancing in Fortnite I hate that you can be killed by glitched gun damage I hate that every gun has the ability to instant kill you even with full health and shields. That all said at least Fortnite is not boring.I played 5 rounds of PUBG and spent 90% of my time running through areas looting stuff and never encountering anyone. When I bumped into someone I killed them with little effort and then continued doing nothing for another 20 mins. Rinse Repeat until it gets down to about top 5 and I get sniped from across the map by someone who the death cam shows is clearly hacking. This was exactly the same for all 5 games.Fortnite is a pain in the in many ways but at least when I get into a game it's fast paced filled with action and things to do and anything but boring. PUBG felt like Day Z with no zombies and that came was the worst I've ever played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

How is it physically possible that your game is consistently at the top of the steam charts and yet it still has consistent issues with the servers? Whether it be lag issues in game or an inability to even get into the main menu something has to be done. These issues have been plaguing this game since launch and yet still they have not been fixed. What makes this worse is that this is a very good game if you can get into it that is.

2018-03-26,0,0,75,False,Not Recommended,I'm not recommending this game because the developers do not listen to the fan base and for the amount of money that has been made there should be several maps in rotation instead of just two and lots of new weapons. When you've made multimillions of dollars you should be making the game a lot better. It's sad when the mobile version of this game has features that the pc version doesn't. Also cheaters ruin games like this on pc and it's pathetic when even a pro player at a pubg competition was caught using hacks.

The test server was a massive improvement over the state of the game at the time of original review. The lags are now gone FPS is great optimization overall has improved a lot. Of all the stuff mentioned below if the cheaters are gone (I hope they will be thanks to region/ping lock) the game is overall good and will get better. So yeah December out of EA gg BlueBalls!Original review The game itself would be awesome if it wasn't for super laggy servers with silly low tick rate first half of the match (until there are like 50 40 players left) you have trouble opening doors picking up loot registering shots stupid loot placement system basically broken RNG sometimes you loot 3 houses to only find comsetics (pants shirts etc) and pistol mags or smoke grenades then you die to a dude that had 3 rifles and armor in his house hackers now you see cheaters everyday headshot punching people across the map speedhacking aimbotting all the good stuff terrible optimization FPS drops lag spikes memory leak very bad experience overall very bad audio quiet is too quiet and loud is too loud you need to have the volume up to hear footsteps then you are deafened by the plane nearby shot etc. and your ears bleed when you're driving a car this is overall tiring and harmful to your ears bugs glitches 50% of the time you'll die for utterly stupid reasons like your vehicle exploding or your full mag hitting tiny wooden railing on the stairs while the enemy loads you full of lead or getting stuck on the parachute when landing close to a hous or a treeThey are trying to add more features to milk it before it's dead but there a lot of old bugs that don't get fixed and brak the game.

2017-08-03,0,0,1558,True,Recommended,A lot of people hating on the microtransactions and i can definitely dig that but you dont need to pay for them if you dont want and the devs are doing whats best for the game so unfortunately that means break a promise or two to give us the best experience possible.That being said this game is outstanding for an early access game and i highly recommend looking into/trying it out if you have the means to do so. 9/10 at the moment but hopefully improves. if not oh well i got a great game anyways.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-25,0,0,614,False,Recommended,"This game had the potential to be the biggest game on the market for years to come. It's a shame the developers took their initial success for granted and did not give the players what they asked for.I've had countless hours (528) of fun on this game with my friends however towards their ""release"" the game went horrifically downhill &amp it almost turned in to a money grab. None of the games real issues were and still mostly have not been addressed. The engine that this games runs off of is f**ked. They need some serious work in the development part of the team.PUBG Corp have recently announced some good changes that should have been made many months ago (i.e map selection) that would have kept their playerbase intact. If they want to keep their remaining players and perhaps draw old ones back they need to keep up with these USEFUL updates instead of the pointless crap that is skins.Fortnite has become my game of choice over PUBG recently simply because the game works. You join you win or die and then you restart with little wait time.In PUBG you join you walk around for 30 minutes before seeing anyone and then you usually die to some stupid bug or chinese hackers. Don't get me wrong the game was fun before the hackers.I think the game needs to close out faster. I hope the new map will be so much better. I believe that as it is a smaller scale map the games will run faster &amp that is what this game needs. I rate this game currently 7/10. Please continue to work and bring out updates the players actually want to see. Don't be the money grabbers. Don't be H1Z1.&lt Only buy this game if you don't get tilted quickly &amp enjoy crushed dreams/broken hearts monthly&gt",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,150,False,Recommended,So I was waiting for the official launch to post my review and that day has finally come so here it is!PUBG is a solid Battle Royale / Hunger Games style game with you and up to 98 other people air dropping onto an island (Or desert!) to fight for survival in a last man standing deathmatch. It caters to veterans of more realistic shooters like Arma as opposed to Call of Duty since the distances you'll be engaging most people in is quite large. That said it does get a bit frantic in close quarters so run and gun tactics are totally viable when in those situations. Prior to launch the game was a bit clunky at times seeming to crash every 5th game on rigs that are not 100% up to snuff but with the 1.0 update there has been a large amount of optimization and (as of writing this review) I have not crashed once despite playing on some definitely dated hardware.The main thing I can recommend for new players is patience. It's gonna take some time to adjust to the game and learn its nuances. There's no aim assist like you'd find in other FPS games like Call of Duty or Battlefield so you gotta get skilled at hitting your targets by yourself and realizing that the guns have a more realistic recoil pattern than games like Counter Strike. An AK is gonna kick like a horse and full auto spray with any weapon is gonna be difficult to hit anything at a range greater than 50m. That said it heavily rewards those with the patience and ability to adapt to its unique style of gameplay.Definitely play this game if you like a challenging multiplayer shooter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-01,0,0,273,False,Recommended,Honestly had seen this game around for a while and thought it was just gonna fade away like most games that come and go. But then I broke down and bought it man was this game worth $30. I have only won 3 game and I've played nearly 100+ hours. Games are very often never the same. Do you go school military base prison etc. and fight it out 20+ people for better gear do you try to land somewhere out in the middle of nowhere and hope you can find gear. The circle concept forces the games to close the distance between competitors which helps keep games shorter and makes people move instead of trying to camp (though camping inside the circle happens all the time). I have played exclusivly FPP servers since they came out and honeslty hate TPP now I just feel it's gimmicky since you can just use the camera to peek at people around corners and trees without exposing yourself to fire.

2018-03-24,0,0,234,False,Not Recommended,I would honestly not recommand getting this game at its current stage. The game had some nice concepts decent execution but its a game destoryed by the devs. Pros and Cons Pros Interesting play style surviving based on killing others getting stronger as you play through. Decent execution the server problem parachute problem optimisation has all been fixed. Despite me hating the game there are times which i play with my friend and all shout in excitement when we do something awesome. Highly replayable Nice ranking system I would consider it to be friendly to both veterans and new players joining the game. Cons Vehicle physics. What the actual is wrong with your ing roads? if i drive a ing motorcycle on the road it shouldnt flip and kill all of us on it every other time. The buggy feels like it has a magnet stuck onto the ground the thing barely flips. The amount of hackers in this game. There are simply too many it runis your 15 minutes of hard work searching through houses jumping fences and careful looting. The system doesnt even have any response for reporting you never know if the guy you reported is actually being banned or not. Too many times does the lobby jam which we see one player being ready but he actually isnt or vice versa. The ready screen is simply a joke if you ask me sometimes we'd have random region changes or random mode changes for seemingly no reason at all. Instead of working on a reliable anti cheat system working on a better loading screen better vehicle physics better optimisation the game devs decided.. all of you here have some new skins not happy? have some gun skins not happy? alright alright have this flare gun. There should be an option to select which ever weather/day time you want some of us did like the fog. Instead they just deleted it. The emote system made me hate cheaters sooooo much more goddamn it . The devs really need to reconsider their priorities.. They are a small company but PUBG made big sales and they made a very large sum of money personally I dont think its wrong to come up with new skins or new ways to cash(keys and such) but i do think that they might wanna fix their game and make it smooth first.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

MY REVIEW WASTE OF MONEY.Ok Lets give a real review of the game. If you are considering to buy this game and have fun DONT BUY. Because you will not have fun at all. Game does not promise any fun. It tickles your nerves and makes you addicted this way. Not by providing any kind of fun. 1. You will start on a lobby where everyone is gathered and then you'll get a plane to land some playground on the map.2. If you are lucky person the circle will cover the location you landed but keep in mind that most probably you'll have to run inside the circle. 3. You have to find a shelter as your foot touches on the ground or you'll get killed in 3 4 seconds. 4. If you are a lucky person you'll find some armor and guns where you're hiding. Or you will not. You'll get killed either way. 5. If you have loaded your guns and still alive You'll get killed in couple of minutes or three. 6. Stay away from the airdrops. Stay away from the windows and stay away from the villages. IMO Stay away from this game. 7. If you're sure that you can get yourself to ""winner winner Chicken dinner"" you'll not. Stop dreaming.8. This game probably made by a company where only one person working and he's a lazy guy There are tons of optimization issues errors bugs and like all these are not enough there are cheaters who'll kill you from behind a mountain. They will always see you where you're hiding. And development team cannot solve it. I dont believe there will be a stable version of the game.9.

2017-12-28,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,"Updated Im not saying its bad it is not. The review will only have the cons i noticed (and thats all cons there is) because they made me delete the game anyway. It's not very optimized in order to get 144fps + epic view distance ""most"" of the time i need to lower the settings quite bit and that makes it look quite potato. (I like to balance performance and quality this wasnt possible.) Enemies are rather hard to spot and better headphones with good voice surrounding will be more than crucial in order to do well in this game I dont have those and did not plan to get that is the reason I never really played it that much. It's pretty slowpaced. I'm just tired in general about that typical ""as realistic as possible"" theme I've played cs go and other games for quite long time it isnt love to MY eyes this doesnt possibly affect you though. Bugs Not really that bad ones.Points to the team for handeling my bug fix report nicely answering and fixing it during the time of early access It felt really great. But now theyre trying to sue everyone to keep the whole competition away instead of improving the game which is ridiculous.To the players who had alot of hours in it admit it. When you play you play with friends friends are the fun here.If i were to be asked to recommend a battle royale game I know much better one and its free. You already know what it is.

I think the audio needs improvement in this case although you can tell where the shooter is if he is close at greater distances you can't rely on the sound anymore.I also don't like that you can't decide the map you want to play on the game does that for you I think there's a 50 50 chance regardless I want the option to play on the map I prefer.I also want to have my own private games and I can't see why it's too much to ask. Wanna practice? Wanna improve your shots? Yeah tough luck because you have to be some kind of content creator to have your own custom games. I really hope they make it available to everyone because it really feels like I'm being denied basic features a game like this should have because I'm not a god damned content creator. I want to warm up before my games I want to practice I want to experiment I WANT BASIC GAME FEATURES THAT FREE GAMES OFFER AT THIS POINT!This game made a lot of money like A LOT of money I can't see why it's not doing so well in terms of completing the game invest in some developers I don't understand how hard it can be.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-24,0,0,352,True,Not Recommended,This game is fun and challenging at the same time which makes it great! However there are some major issues that need to be worked out for it to receive a 5/5.My number one pet peeve is that every so often the game will freeze (usually during transitions either from looking at inventory for instance or loading the main menu.) When it does this the game permanently stays on the screen so I have to restart my computer in order to use it again. The sooner this bug is fixed the better.The second thing I want to mention is the amount of lag this game has. It isn't all the time but enough to take note. Also the amount of lag is so bad that it makes me jump a couple feet leaving me disoriented. I assume the other players may not have this same issue since one of them killed me while this happened but either way this is a big problem. Other than my perviously stated concerns this game is all around fun to play. It is hard to know where people are shooting you sometimes even if I know the direction they are shooting but maybe (it's just me?) that will change with more experience? Anyways keep up with the progress developers you have something of value here. I'll rate it a 3/5 until the issues are fixed. Thank you.Update It has come to my attention that the devs aren't honest people and went back on a promise. Regardless of what that promise was that is something you do not do. It's the principle of the matter! If people accept and brush off these broken promises like it was nothing then those people are giving them the right to lie again in the future and the right to manipulate those people because they know they can do it since they already have done it.On top of this the devs keep adding more things into the game when the properties and functions in the game still aren't fixed. I believe they have gotten worse tbh. The game freezes more then it has and the rendering has gotten worse. I literally have to wait a minute or two before everything is ready for me to interact with it where in the past this problem only happened rarely. The game lags a bit here and there even with everything set to low and it lags when people are near which is a dead give away.It seems to me that the devs listened and was on the right track then gave up half way after they got their money. If this is not the case then I would be happy to be proven wrong but from what I've seen this is definitely the case. As cool as this game was it's not worth getting until/if these devs get their act together.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-29,0,0,210,False,Not Recommended,With over 100 hours in the game I can now say I'm sad about the state of this game. When I purchased this game it was early access and we waited forever for the one update to hopefully fix the insanely poor buggy game. The game is fun and its a insane to actually win . But the combat works better with close quater combat rather than the games constantly wanting long range. Most of the guns you will find are close quarters with a splattering of long range guns (good luck finding a scope to use said rifle once you find it). Then we are lead into the cheaters and poor optimized game. At the current moment most cheaters are seeming to come from china and the developer refuses to give china their own region locked server even though that would solve and Unknown himself calls the players asking for that xenophopic for even suggesting it. The developer seems to priotize how the game looks rather than make the game not run like even with a rig with more than enough power to run it. Please fix the game. It can be fun. Please focus on the bugs and the preformance. Listen to the community on this one because we have a point sometimes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Seek out the enemy or hide in a bathtub until you are the last person alive. This game can be very exiting and tense because you know death is around the corner and you would have to start a whole new round if you died. Make sure you wear head phones and listen to every little sound to track people's location and find them before they find you.

Everytime you log in to play you will hate yourself more than you hate facebook memes. Yet you keep joining new matches like a crack addict just trying to get that fix. Are these analogies working for you? Well the game is more broken than my spelling of the word analogy. Baisically if the devs fix the netcode and region lock china and restrict the ping and fix the sound of the red zone and plane and lighten up footsteps and optomize the game better and add the ability to choose what map you want to play on and ban hackers harder better faster stronger then the game might be ok.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

FIX YOUR DAMN GAME until the hacks are fixed this game is not recommended.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-06,0,0,891,False,Recommended,Great game but frustrating for two main reasons communication and hackers. The game is full of hackers. I would say of my last 10 deaths at least 7 have been from cheaters. It is incredibly frustrating to make it to the top 20 or 10 then get demolished by someone clearly cheating (aimbot/wallhacks/etc). Earlier this morning there was a hacker shooting into the sky / ground and killing people halfway across the circle. Good times. The second most frustrating part of this game is the NA servers are flooded with chinese players that dont speak english. PUBG really needs to do some sort of location lock on their servers. In a game where communication is crucial nothing is more frustating than not being able to. Teaming up with friends is a must!Besides that this game has incredible potential and I would reccomend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I play this game with my husband and a few of our friends... pop a few beers and eat some snacks and die laughing over the sometimes buggy game mechanics. for one.... getting on a motorcycle under a bridge and it exploding and launching me into the bridge.

Four months after the official realease those things haven't changed that much except that the latency and disconnection problems are getting too frequent. The maps get boring really quick the two of them are too vast for only 100 hundred players. It's really easy to be completely alone until half of the people is already dead (unless you choose to land in the usual crowded areas). Maybe the game will get better over time maybe not.

2017-07-25,0,0,106,True,Not Recommended,First off all i love this game i really do. But i cant recommend it to anyone do to the condition of the game and the behavior of the devs. The devs told us that they were not going to add any skins for weapons of clothes until the game is done but then they go ahead and did just that. Further more they implemented a crate system similar to csgo where you need to buy a key to open the crate. Sure you could go for the normal crates but i find it stupid to allow players to buy premium crate using ingame money and then ask us an extra buck just to open it. Dont make t promise devs.Secondly about the game since the devs are sooo busy making new premium skins problems from day 1 still has not been fix. Texture poppins are more frequent now than they were then. Connectivity is also a major problem the amount of time i failed to kill a player due to lost connection is just pure t. How am i suppose to play good if i cant enter a house due to texture problem or even shoot for that matter.Until the devs get their together again and start fixing the game to make it run better i advice no ONE! to buy this game. Just go play some copycat roblox version because thats more complete than this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,28,True,Recommended,So after 13 hours of gameplay I have to say that I am really impressed. The game is a giant map where 100 players scavenge weapons and fight to the death. I am having an amazing time playing this game. It can be very challenging and hard when you first start but after a few hours of grinding youll be just as good as anyone. Its very easy to find weapons and find people to kill. Its very immersive and has a wide variety of weapons to choose from. A lot of people say they have issues with the game but I havnt encountered anything too bad. Sometimes i'll experience lag not fps drop but like the kind that makes you teleport. Other than that no problems what so ever. I would recommend this game. I love it and I will put a lot of hours on it. I love the shooting animations and gun mechanics. They really did a good job with that. The sounds are cool and the guns and sights look legit. When you fire your weapon and head shot someone youll ejaculate in your pants. Its better than Arma's battle royalle. Like when you shoot someone they will die instantly and not like 10 seconds later. I havnt played H1Z1 but judging by the videos ive seen this is the perfected more realistic version. The co op in this game is really fun and easy to use. I also love the driving. Its very easy and it doesnt require any building or missing parts. Just dont jump out of it while moving or youll die.Pros Edgy Good graphics Immersive Fun Great weapon mechanics Great matchmaking and co op system Good driving mechanicsCons Buggy Stressful at times (youll rage really hard when a dude with a pistol one shots you when you got a whole tone of rare I highly recoomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the whole battle royale scene.

2017-04-20,0,0,165,False,Recommended,"* The game runs good now *How the game runs for me 90% of the time https //www.youtube.com/watch?v HNaN98Ows cYes it's early access and there can be lags and performance issues but in 6 hours of playing I managed to finish only two matches. On the rest I get ""Lost connection to host"" either while I'm still in the parachute or after around 10 20 minutes. In around 90% of those matches I was teleporting around a lot constantly (every few seconds). Every action I want to perform takes arounds 5 10 seconds (like opening doors switch weapon or pick up items). That's not exaggerated.So at the moment the game isn't ready for early access and it is not playable at all. Patches don't seem to address these problems. Support sites are flooded with similar problems and thus have high response time.I really wanted to give this game a chance but as long as the servers and netcode aren't good I am not able to get this game to work properly.Edit Got 27h playtime now and the problems above are still present. I'll change this review when the netcode gets better. Just fyi I can play other online games just fine. Even though my internet connection is bad this games networking is worse.

2017-09-09,0,0,877,False,Not Recommended,"So first I want to say that this game is a must buy for those who like FPS battle royals looting or dying to cheaters. It is great. The game feels smooth (though there can be latency occasionally) the weapons require skill to use with their recoil and the gunplay is quite fun. Buy it and try it. You won't regret it.Now to the bad side. It was made by an indi developer (which is awesome) but they seem to be having a lot of trouble keeping up with hacks (which is not awesome). I've read that they are banning tens of thousands of hackers yet coming across someone shooting through buildings jump headshotting or just not making noise as they run is while not frequent fairly common. In fact all you have to do to find a few cheaters is to look at the leaderboards where some players have k/d ratios slightly higher than their IQ's. It can be incredibly frustrating to work your way through the game gear up then get to one of the final circles where some 12 year old with his parents' credit card bought a handful of mods and is headshotting a player after player as fast as his Kar 98 can fire....while inside a building. Again it doesn't happen often but just enough to really make you want to question playing until it gets fixed.That said it is well worth the money and to be honest....it's still in Alpha. I'm hopeful better cheater preventions will be in place once it reaches release. As for now if you can handle little buying their way to the occasional win give it a go. You won't be dissapointed.RELEASE VERSION EDIT Okay now that the game is released I just wanted to update my review. So some new things like a really detailed new map and several new weapons. Those are great. Also the game seems to run much smoother than it did a few months ago. Now to the REALLY bad part. Cheating has gone through the roof. It's now to the point where you WILL see cheaters....every game. People running faster than cars one shoting you with guns that don't do near enough damage to one shot plus the classic ESP and no recoil hacks. And the frequency is INSANE. There seems to be a common thread to most of the hackers/cheater. They all have Chinese names. Now this is a recent occurance because at release Asia now has access to use NA and EU servers. It seems the new ""Gold Farming"" is in full swing. They use hacks to win games and farm point to sell crates. I've been seeing posts where people who speak Mandarin are hearing other chinese people in the lobbies telling others where to meet up to team against non asian players. It's to the point where you just can't play a fair game. If Blue Hole doesn't do something about requiring region locks this game will take a big nosedive. You can't release a really popular Early Release product have a bunch of new people buy it at release then have them see that you almost MUST cheat to win. It will be the end of PUBG if it isn't fixed and soon.So for now avoid buying the game. Hopefully things will change until it does DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs of the game hardly listen to the community when it comes to things that they want or things that should be removed. The headshots and hit registration in general is screwey most of the time. You can drop and not see anyone for the entire time up until the top 10 then get headshotted by a Kar98 for that split second you stop behind a tree or rock. You can get stuck in the map stuck in vehicles stuck in objects and stuck in buildings. You can be driving a car and hit a pebble which sends you flying into outer space or nudge your teammate with it and knock them out. As well as everyones favorite trying to drop on the rooftop of a building but your paraschute gets moved by a ghost and stuck on a railing then be forced to cut the rope and lose 50% of your health.

2017-04-02,0,0,431,True,Recommended,the most rewarding game I have ever played as far as how you feel when you come out of a gun fight alive.. dying especially early in the round after chuting in can be very frustrating.. I wish this was first person only or at least they had a first person only mode im not used to the third person it does help new players if you can get used to it cause you can rotate the camera all around you like in arma. but i never played those games was too klunky for me and the inventory and stuff was not very intuitive for my liking.. this game gets it right but i would still rather everyone be in first person so you could sneak up on people better.. yet it could also happen to you being inside a house camping and being able to see all around the building while your hiding is cheap in my opinion especially since the stakes are SO HIGH in this game.. a few shots and your dead. That being said.. its VERY addicting and I am getting better and better the more I play it. I also wish there were other game modes.. one where u could die spawn back in and keep playing. like TDM or something.. it would help with getting to know the game better w/out being sent straight to the character screen over a mistake,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-05,0,0,218,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is decent. A lot of people complain about performance issues I have not had those problems. I can't run it on absolute max settings but I run it decently enough. There is a high learning curve to the weapons because you so rarely get an opportunity to USE the weapons. The recent changes to the circle speeds have been great. There are still a fair amount of issues detailed below that should be resolved. Also there are still more than a few hackers/cheaters. Things like mouse macros that fire a semi auto gun at a high speed with very little recoil is still a problem. I report when I can but I can only do that if that person ended up killing me. There is also the problem of increased microtransactions for this game and they don't seem to be ready for it. I and a lot of other players according to a google search have purchased keys for the locked crates and never got them more on that below. Overall its a good game it could be optimized a bit more for better frame rates and it needs to either make some changes to the microtransaction system (keys) or get rid of it and have locked crates be a rarity rather than the norm again. Until they fix some of these issues no I don't recommend it. Things I like No chat system. I can just play a game without having to see a bunch of slurs scroll past me in a chat window on my screen which is an annoyance in most games. Until recently the guns were realistic not balanced. I wish they hadn't of made that change. Some guns in real life are better than others. There is a reason why the army doesn't issue tommy guns any more. The replay feature. Its nice to be able to go back and record funny moments or see what happened to the person I was shooting at that disappeared. Things that they need to add An offline shooting range so you can get experience with the weapons and figure out what you are most comfortable with.The loot algorithms I play a lot of games where I will search 15 buildings and find only a red dot sight then games where I find 3 4x ACOG scopes in a single room. Yes I know it is random but maybe pure random isn't the best option. More support or less microtransactions. I bought 5 keys a week ago never received them. I put a support ticket in and it has yet to be resolved. Unfortunately since most of the crates now require keys this is a problem. Microtransactions are supposed to be impulse buys with no hassle and instant gratification. If you don't have the abitily to do that maybe don't have microtransactions.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-30,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,Probably the worst battle royale game to date developers are lazy and rather add nonsense and sue a superior developer than optimize their game. You basically spend 30 minutes looting just to end up dying by something you can't even do anything about. Oh and if you have a suppresor just do what everyone else does and camp... you're guaranteed to win especially cause you can't tell where you're getting shot from if someone is shooting at you with a suppressor. I find it so ironic how this is the worst battle royale yet the only one you have to pay for as far as I'm aware of. You're honestly better off playing H1Z1 or Fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-13,0,0,278,False,Recommended,As far as games go PUBG is as simple a concept as it gets. In this online multiplayer shooter up to 100 players are parachuted onto a large map and start off with no gear aside from cosmetic clothing options that don t impact gameplay. On landing you ll have to scavenge for guns grenades items and armour which are distributed at random killing players as you come across them. You can switch between first person and third person perspectives and i preferre the latter as it allows for a wider field of view letting us spot enemies faster.Sounds simple enough? Well there's an added complication. The game map shrinks every few minutes forcing you to relocate to a new area and damaging you until you do. Failing to enter a new safe zone results in death. If you re the last player standing you re greeted with the phrase winner winner chicken dinner . You get in game currency at the end of each round that you can use towards purchasing cosmetic gear to kit out your character.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No roadmap to fix known issues or introduce new ingame items. The solution to the hacking problem is simple and i cant believe it hasnt been implemented. You NEED to introduce Verified account match making. These hackers are ruining the game. You can put in a region lock.. You can put in a ping lock on.. but really it won't work! The only solution to this is for long term account holders to play against eachother and the hackers and smurfs battle it out against eachother. Also if someone is reported for hacking and proven to be a hacker just remove their name from the leaderboard it's such a simple concept and easy to implement. Devs need to pick up their game LITTERALLY.Other than that the graphics maps game play are all okay. Just FIX THE HACKING ISSUE PLEASE!!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Every game since the start of 2018 I can hardly get kills. The bullets do not register on players when shooting. I have gone through many tests on many different servers and it seems to be a persistant issue. What will happen is I will load about 20 30 bullets on a player before they die. Around half of the shots are headshots. However sometimes I am only able to get 5 or 6 shots on them and 2 or 3 are head shots. And they end up killing me. Once I watch the replay I see that I hit them 6 times but on their screen I did not hit them once. This game is so F**KING broken it literally ticks me off. It's so sad that the mobile version is better made and optimized than this trash. This issue has existed since the launch and they still ignore the fact people complain about the 17tick.

2018-02-27,0,0,341,False,Not Recommended,The specs that the game says you need is just wrong because i have way better stuff than what it need and I only play the game around 40 to 100fps (Avg of 55) I'm not joking. The game is terribly optimized and need to be fixed. I recommend a Core I5 6th Gen and up and a GTX 1060 6GB better. Fair warning that this game will make your PC scream because this game makes your PC very goddamn hot. LIke I play most games at 65c and this game never goes play 78c under minimal load. So basically only buy this game if you are a rich person because you need a beast of a PC. This game also has many glitchesLike I don't play Fortnite but like I know understand why people like Fortnite better. One you don't need a beast PC. Second of all it's free. Last of all the game is less serious and more to have a fun time. There are also many cheaters and also be prepared for people with either hacks or a beast PC to flick on you when you are only playing at 40 fps. In summary only buy this game if you have a beast PC and also that be ready for many glitches and bugs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Just to name a few constant client crashes FPS issues constant lag rubber banding horrible network code (sync) looting with TAB vs F ignores animations so it is fast car model broken (driving does not make much fun) and the bike kills you for now reason lobby is still horrible no shooting range for weapon practice parachute landing bugs bullets not hitting shotguns suck in this game headshots not counting pistol aiming in particular but some other crosshairs also are so useless and confusing yeah ... and so on.A positive thing is they got rid of the cheaters on the desktop version which were a constant issue when i was playing last. Also funny to note that the mobile client which was done by a different company does not crash and friends enjoy the games while the desktop client is still horrible.Totally annoyed by this so i stopped playing PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-08,0,0,611,True,Recommended,A lot of people are hyping this game. Playing it a lot and uploading videos about it and reporting some very positive reviews. My issues with this game don't come at the heart of the game itself. The idea of the game isn't new though. PlayerUnknown's last game H1Z1 was very similar and although it plays a little different the mechanics are generally the same. But for having the same mechanics and roughly the same graphics the game runs so terrible. Melee is the most unreliable thing in the game. Machete crowbar....it doesn't matter. Hit the guy four or five times? Nope. The lag is definitely real in this game and topple that with random freezes and a limited FOV and the game isn't worth the cost for pre release gaming. Wait for the game to mature because it's frustrating playing an unfinished game that has tearing glitchy graphics dropped frames and random drops.EDIT So the game has had a lot of work done on it and I like the direction it's taking. It still hasn't been optimized so a lot of times the game is twitchy and glitchy and just generally laggy. Servers seem like they can't keep up with all the input from a hundred gamers especially early game. I think this is an issue that can't be solved with brute force as the map is too big and you only need all that raw horsepower in the very beginning before half the server dies and then things really smooth out. So it might take some time before it's really honed but as for the state of the game in pre release it's gotten a lot better and I love playing this game now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's very upsetting when you're on a bike going over a bridge and crash for no apparent reason or are running for zone and get shot through the wall by a hacker with mini and a 4X. I don't understand what keeps this company from introducing a better anti cheat system that clearly everyone is asking for unless they are getting money from the hack creaters themselves. This is insane that a game that was once amazing has turned into something no one wants to play.

After playing 700+ hrs of that I thought that I would be done with BR games. After seeing the downfall of that I was nervous to give PUBG a try. Now 900+ hrs later...... I have played few games as much as this one in my time. Not much regret at all. From the intense gun fights that force you to make split second descisions. To the sniping long range watch the bullt drop for the headshot. This game proves heart racing final fights as the zone shrinks around you. Great to play with friends have had a lot of fun playing duos and squads with many people. I consider myself a very good player at this game as well so seeing the progress of this game has dissapointed me. The future could be bright with new maps and added content but so far the lack of optimization has been a big factor with my decline in playtime for me.

2017-05-07,0,0,461,False,Recommended,"More than often seeing a $30 early access game leaves you thinking ""why the hell would I buy another trashy survival game for such a high amount when it has so many issues "" PUBG is not one of those $30 early access survival game. Many of the other early access survival games lack content and/or depth on top of the bugs and/or poor optimization. While PUBG does suffer from the latter (more so poor optimization than bugs though they do exist) its gameplay is tense and exciting which makes it worth suffering through the lag and desyncs. If you want to competently run this game you're going to need a NASA computer but hopefully that will change in the near future as the devs have been focused on fixing lag and what not recently. I was also really worried that $30 would go out the window as I was afraid that after the streamers stopped playing two weeks in the game would drop off the edge. Luckily for me (and the devs) there is still a constant player base of both the public and of the streamers keeping promotion up. This game is amazing with friends but still fun without. 11/10 would recommend possibly the best $30 I've ever spent.Edit 11/23/17.

2018-05-21,0,0,331,False,Not Recommended,This was one of my favorite games when it first came out. Was over the COD/Battlefield BS and this game was very hardcore with 2 3 chest shot kills and 1 2 head shot kills. Unfortunately recently they have made changes I'm guessing to appeal to the COD crowd to get them to play. So now just like COD you can shoot someone center mass 6 7 8 9 10 times hell dump the whole mag in them and somehow they are still alive and well then turn around and shoot you in the head 1 time even though you have a level 2 or 3 helmet and down you go. So unless they go back to and more realistic hardcore 2 3 shot kill game like it was in the beginning I can't recommend this game. Not to mention the sync and lag issues which may be contributing to above stated. If you are a COD fan and want another game like COD that isn't in outer space or whatever they are doing now then I guess this is the game for you in its current state. If you want a different game that was suppose to be more realistic like I think the way it was intended to now is not the time to buy. When it first came out I felt like everyone pretty much had a chance. Now if you don't spend 50 hrs a week playing it you are screwed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-04,0,0,42,False,Recommended,"PUBG is a ton of fun when you're kicking and getting kills. For me getting at least one kill satisfies me. There's free crates and you don't need to spend $3.10 on keys unless it's the ""Game's con invitation crate"" which the key for that costs more than $3.10. But that's besides the point. It's a little bit heavy on my PC per say and I get a rough 30 45 fps but I feel so achieved when I get kills.I honestly love this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-04,0,0,664,False,Not Recommended,Cheaters every single game if not every other game. Until Blue Hole implements a better anti cheat DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. sure it looks fun in videos and streams but believe me it is not worth it right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-04,0,0,240,False,Recommended,To get the most out of this game play with a team with mics. (Communication is KEY) There is a PUBG Discord server where alot of players meet and play together.(Just google PUBG Discord servers) Yes most of the game is Chinese so have a premade team before you go into game. I love this game I am playing at 1080p and get about 75 90 fps. with my EVGA GTX 1060 SCHIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PLAY THIS GAME 11/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
