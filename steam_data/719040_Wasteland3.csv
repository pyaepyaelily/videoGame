Denver was hella funny though.

Interactions: there are nice easter eggs littered throughout which does make the game enjoyable, and some of the dialogue is funny, but mostly it is jarring, dialogue is not context sensitive, e.g. a doctor returning to his default calm text when all hell is breaking loose around you when you ask him to patch you up.

Gameplay: i came across 1 or 2 bugs, but nothing game breaking, the gameplay is excellent, however again, nothing groundbreaking that makes it feel significantly different or fresh to wasteland 2.

Level Design: levels are much smaller and linear than wasteland 2, i dont really know why, but it felt uninspired, with the odd ""use your high level skill"" to unlock a more favourable vantage point, or sneak in and destroy a generator to get rid of some turrets, it was very uninspired.

Navigation: poor, i cant even talk about the world map, its hideous design, but the biggest crime is colorado springs, youre constantly moving through different areas unnecessarily, they knew this, and added in a paper boy that shouts out current events, but that doesnt go far to break up the monotony.

7,77044595,english,"TL;DR: 60 Dollars is far too steep of an asking price for what genuinely feels like an Early Access title.
Great game gets bogged down by several bugs, glitches, and poor design decisions.


- I've run into several bugs both in SP and Coop, be it characters unable to move, text being stuck on the screen from previous saves to whole quests bugging out and having to load a previous save.
- The tutorials are nice but they don't pause time (gets in the way when sneaking), even in SP and become redundant very quickly. An actual tutorial section would've been much better, as I will get tutorial popups for concepts players will have already been introduced to.
- Can't pause time pre-combat
- One thing that is extremely annoying is that there are many instanced encounters that you can't sneak or position your characters in advantageous positions. You can't even move characters into cover before they start, and you can't set up a specific formation (I.E. 3 tanks in front 2 ranged mid, 1 medic rear) and this is made worse when enemies usually get the first turn in these situations. I think this may be a bug, as the detection cone IS there and it DOES appear but only briefly after the engagement already starts.
- Coop feels tacked on and according to many players, seems to be the most buggy part of the game. Plus it's only limited to 2 players sadly and lacks any way to ping or mark locations or enemies for other players to aid one another (like in Divinity OS:2)
-Long loading screens, even when ran on an SSD.

Almost everything else about the game, save design decisions and some balance issues, is top class, be it the soundtrack, the audio, the gameplay etc. but it's all severely dragged down by the lack of polish and the high price point.

Ok, maybe you didn't want the bugs, but they are at least actively patching, so that will improve over time. I didn't personally have any game breaking bugs in my first play-through and running on a M2 SSD the loading times are not that bad either. If you have slow storage it might be worse.

The game looks like it will be fun, eventually, but ooof do not buy it in its current state. Wait until you hear news of some more meaty patches. 

This game came out the door poorly optimized and really buggy. Mechanics, like ambush, just don't seem to work with certain characters or certain gun types. I don't know, it just doesn't work 100% of the time with a character that started with a pistol. 

The loading between zones is a nightmare, or when you need to reload and press the quickload option thinking it will quickly load the last save... but it doesn't. It loads the last quickload save so then you are stuck double waiting a really long loading bar. And the save was probably before the zone transition so there has been times of three massive loading bars to get to the right place again. Which is so draining is usually end of the session to go play something else after making a new save in the right zone.

The game feels like a tarantino movie (which is one of my favourite directors), i ve looked it up and that seems to be no coincidence: the devs used the person responsible for the great music in Tarantino action movie scenes (Mary Ramos).

The good and the bad for me:

+ Fun and really good music integrated in many parts of the game, even combat has great music choices now!
+ Nice videocutscenes & good voice actors.
+ For adults (unlike RPG's like f.e. Fallout 3 wich is more for kids)
+ Great artwork
+ Good humor
+ Improved combat
+ Meaningfull choices, not just a good/bad RPG game choices like too many RPG's out there
+ Interesting quests: the game is less of a grind (fetch this, ...), good use of writing stories into the quests.

- Some minor bugs at this time. For example Jodi Bell loses all her weapons and armor
- The game feels shorter than Wasteland 2 which had 2 big locations, but this game feels more quality for the shorter time you get.
- The fun music stops in the loading screens, maybe it would be nice to have music that was playing continue during the loading screen.
- The game is not well balanced from the launch, if you max out charisma for all characters you can turn hard mode into easy mode.

[b] The Good [/b]
It's one of the few gems that let's you actually control the story. For example, you can try to kill a main character the first time you meet them without asking questions, but it's a matter of if you live through the encounter. (Meeting the Patriarch outside  of future Ranger HQ for example).
The game hands you all the mechanics for managing your fame and reputation and let's you go wild. I didn't notice any problems with the game not pointing me in the right direction during my playthrough.
Combat is fun and fairly well balanced, melee seems to be lacking but that could be due to me not gearing my characters for some good ole' CQC.
Leveling is handled very well, with the game explaining to you in full what each perk, skill, and trait does as you level up
Genuinely just all around fun, kept me up way later than it should of far too many times.

[b] The Bad [/b]
Only two really bad things I picked up on, The soundtrack being utterly wasted and the game seemingly unable to get a handle on how much comedy is too much comedy. Starting with the soundtrack, only some combats trigger something besides the usual lackluster combat music, when these few combats occur, that one battle feels much more significant than any of the others around it. This comes at a cost of most combats being just a fairly enjoyable battle of you using your squad to survive or shred against the enemy depending on the difficulty you chose. It feels like a huge waste, having some really good songs but keeping them constrained to important battles, especially when the default music is so incredibly weak in comparison, it's genuinely like comparing a city apartment to a mansion. (Big spoilers)> [spoiler]The fights with Victory and the Patriarch don't even get this special music treatment, they're the biggest fights in the entire game and they have generic combat music #5 [/spoiler]. Second is how much trouble the game has taking it seriously, I'm fine with everyone game having a joke here and there to give you a chuckle, like running into a goat in a brothel with a bucket and a note reading '10$', or (Spoilers)> [spoiler] like Victory accidentally throwing a frag grenade instead of a flashbang when you choose to attack to kill him, killing himself. [/spoiler]. But it takes it and runs waaay further than it should some times, the goat cannon you can get for the truck being a perfect example, it's a fairly solid weapon, but it shoots an actually goat. It's hard to get into the ""We must complete our mission or our home is screwed and doomed to fail"" vibe when you're firing goats at your enemy in a gorilla costume while your character is smaller than the weapon they're holding. You can avoid all of this sure, but they are just examples for a general theme the game has.

[b] The Ugly [/b]
This game is less and less stable the longer you play it. It's not bad enough to warrant being called bad as a few bugs here and there aren't world ending, but the game will soft lock combat or crash once you get near the end of the game.

I realize now the bad section is a lot longer than the good, don't get me wrong I love this game, I just feel strongly about the two major flaws and I feel they constantly degrade the rest of the experience by being what feels easy fixes if the devs would let people mod the game.

As for some advice, wait for the game to drop to $20 or what a year or two as that is all this game is worth. As for me, InXile is on my do not by list with the patch 1.1.1 release. Why add a game system like skills if they are going to be made useless? On top of that why limit and restrict players in a single-player/coop that has no real PvP mode?

This game was very fun to play, lots of story to dive into and very well done combat system.

Amazing voice acting and some very compelling and funny characters. Music was 10/10 for sure. 

The down sides of the game were one, the difficulty. I played through on Hard as first time wasteland player. I kept hearing supreme jerk was insanely hard and not try it as new player. I am sad I didn't play on Supreme Jerk. I found Hard to not be very difficult at all and I doubt the difference between Supreme Jerk and Hard is that much. There were also a couple of bugs: Some crashing, some prompts not working, characters freezing in place and areas with dead corpses not being able to move in. I also felt the story was very short.

There is some humor, but parts of it seem like they tried too hard to be quirky and funny. The factions and voice acting is a bit over the top in its stereotypes and often pretty cringeworthy. Companions are fairly shallow characters, yet to have a full team you have to include two of them.

Super easy to create new builds to fit your style as you can just create new characters for your merry band, which I really liked. It was a variant of the ""buy the potion to reset stats"" thing which I appreciated because it could really be done at any time. No real fetch quests which is probably my favorite thing about it. While there are ""side quests"" they are minimal, contribute to the story, and are evenly distributed. I felt this was well-balanced and considering the load times, too many unnecessary side or fetch quests would probably doom this game. The load times complained of are not a joke. You really feel this in a few quests - I am thinking of one in particular which involves going into a building (load screen), doing maybe 20 minutes of combat, leaving the building (load screen), walking to a character and then having to return to the building (load screen) to finish the quest and then having to leave (load screen) as there is nothing else to do there.

94,76802371,english,"Game is definitely worth buying, but holy hell should you expect to run into bugs galore. If I were to compare the numerous and endless bugs in this game to another game, you should expect Fallout 1 types of bugs. They will be everywhere, and you're probably going to be annoyed. OG fans of this game point out that bugs have been a core mechanic since the first game was released back in 89, but for the rest of us playing 31 years in the future of 2020, we expect 60 dollar games to not be rife with bugs and feel like we're play testers. 

The random bugs I've encountered have ranged from being unable to arrest a character that tries to surrender to me when he reaches <40% HP, an infinite money glitch found in the Bazar, and having enemies become untargetable. Now these glitches don't break the game, it's playable and a hell of a lot of content/fun. But the glitches are irritating.

Assault rifles: Honestly probably one of my biggest problems with the game: assault rifles and SMG's are going to feel damned near useless, I didn't realize when I first started the game, but you as a player will realize very swiftly that the automatic weapons class isn't good for much, they're very inaccurate, every bullet every time you fire will roll to hit, instead of being a burst of hit dmg. Example: you fire 4 times with a single attack, each bullet has a chance at 30-60% chance to hit (or greater) and each hit will do between 20-35 dmg, the computer will roll to hit and if only one of those bullets land will it deal a weak multiplier 35 x 1 dmg. Conversely all other weapon types will deal high damage and be incredibly accurate. Example: I have a character with a pistol that always has nearly 80% chance to hit and each hit does 100 dmg. In theory the 4 x 35 will do more damage than a 1 x 100, but the assault rifles and SMG's are both so inaccurate that they hardly hit and not only that but the pistol can be fired more often as it costs less AP than an automatic weapon.  

As if the damage output wasn't bad enough, the accuracy is pathetic. The closer an enemy gets to you, the less accurate your Assault rifles will be. There's a sweet spot between max and min range that you're going to have to figure out in order for a assault rifle to be even remotely accurate. The SMG's will become more accurate the closer an enemy gets which admittedly is supposed to incentivize you to switch between the two automatic weapons types, but really it's just annoying.

I would be willing to take the automatic weapons more seriously if they were inaccurate but also dealt lots of damage as well. the pistol, shotgun, sniper, heavymachine gun, literally every other weapon will be more accurate and deal more damage. It's weird watching my character with a pistol run around killing enemies left and right meanwhile my two assault rifle classes can hardly put up a fight against a single enemy even when using their skills. learn from my mistake, avoid the automatic rifles class. 

hacking: Currently I have the hacker perk, with added bonus of overclock (gives a bonus of +2 AP to the hacked computer). For some reason the developers made it so that I buff the enemy with overclock and then I'm told if I succeeded or failed in my attempt to hack. I wouldn't have taken the overclock perk if I knew that I would always buff the enemy even if I failed to  hack into enemy equipment. 

Fighting enemies when I'm entering a room: really annoyed that most times I'm outside a room and I know there are enemies on the inside of the room, and the door is open, I can't see the enemies on the inside. leads to some really weird camera mechanics and I have to wait until I fully commit someone to go inside the room to fight enemies. This wouldnt be a problem except that if my characters get locked fighting melee combat at the entrance of the room, my charactrers can only hit the people at the entrance and can't see/therefore can't hit the enemies on the inside even though they can hit me perfectly fine.

Now that I've gone over some of my gripes, let me say that this game is fantastic, the humor is on point. The writing is fantastic. The voice acting is great. The lore is deep and rich. The graphics and sound track included in the game are all things that  I heavily praise the makers of this game for.

10,76782771,english,"TL:DR at bottom
Played through wasteland 3 (Co-op) on the game's hardest difficulty (Supreme Jerk) after giving up playing halfway through on the second hardest difficulty (was literally too boring). From my experience, the game has a great base framework and holds lot of potential, but its frankly somewhat ruined by a bunch of poor design and balance choices, as well as a myriad of bugs and long load screens. Patching for the game is also horribly slow, our promised day 1 patch came out a week late, and after 1 month since release, only 2 patches total have been released. 

There's a crappton of bugs and broken mechanics throughout the game, ESPECIALLY if you play co-op. An example of some of these bugs include broken perks such as stormer (move 5 spaces with an smg and you get to shoot for free) only working if you have enough action points to fire normally after you move, and not working at all in co-op if you aren't the host.

The thing that worries me the most for the future of this game is the horrible balancing, resulting in the game being braindead easy. For example, the in-combat revival system is practically free, resulting in dying being hardly punishing (Especially true for co-op). Healing is frankly overpowered and overabundant, a single medic will provide your entire team health boosts as well as massive heals over time, all the time. Weapon balance is atrocious, with some weapon classes being blatantly overpowered, while others being so bad that they're nearly unusable. 

However, one of the biggest offenders for me was critical hits. Idk what they did with the formula, but crits have an INSANE multiplier and completely ignore armor. The endgame revolves completely around these crits, with both players and enemies relying on crits to deal damage. Normal hits were effectively useless (outside very specific builds), while crits would often see the healthbar of an enemy or ally eviscerated in a single hit/burst.

Initiative is also team based (your entire team goes at the same time). This horrible, horrible design decision very often leads to encounters instantly ending after the first few turns.

TL:DR: Wait a year or two till they fix all the bugs and overhaul major aspects of their combat system. Maybe wait for a definitive edition or something, though if they don't fix the balance issues then just avoid it entirely.

So I completed Wasteland 3 after several weeks. My ending is one that was bittersweet,(warning spoiler alert) [spoiler]siding with Angela Deth but I go back to Arizona instead of asking the rangers to take over.[/spoiler] It's been a rough ride getting to the end let me tell you that. Here are the pros and cons:

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great game play
- Engaging Story
- Impact filled choices especially on your character build choices

[b]Cons:[/b]
- [b]Frustratingly long load times,[/b] no joke I wait on average 2-4 mins every since time I try to load from a save file or even just to transition between locations. I spent more than [u]33% of my total gaming time WAITING FOR IT TO LOAD.[/u] For those who are curious, I am running the game off my 500GB Samsung Pro 860 SATA SSD. From reading other people's reviews, a PCI-E Gen 3 NVME SSD still takes about 30s - 45s to load the game. Besides from my heavily modded Rimworld with over 70+ mods that takes 10-15 mins to start, Rimworld actually takes only 10s-15s to load my save files or to load a transition from location to location.
- [b]Many bugs resulting in a crash to desktop and losing my progress,[/b] I lost count of how many times this game has crashed to desktop for me. [u]I typically quit my session in frustration after 4 crashes in a row,[/u] it often happens in the middle of combat, during dialogues or even when completing a quest objective. This game has been so frustrating that I can't bring myself to do a 2nd play-through.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] Unless you run the game off a RAID 0 array with at least 2 x NVME PCI-GEN 4 SSDs or equivalent, or you are a masochist who loves spending their gaming time waiting for the game to load instead of actual gameplay, I would recommend that you stay away from this game.

P.S. I'd do my 2nd playthrough after I build a new gaming rig next year with 2 x NVME PCI-E GEN 4 SSDs in RAID 0, maybe then the load times may finally fall under 30s.",1601278007,1601383791,False,2,0,0.457486152648925781,3,True,False,False,76561197970845623,225,3,3050,0,3050,1600512165,,

Great customization and a great array of skills makes sure that every character has a purpose, every kind of weapon has its use so there is never a wrong choice of weapon for your Rangers.
The story is great with many ways to approach each and every milestone with clear ""best"" ways to resolve if you have the skills and try hard enough.
For a great and long game (my run took 45 hours) it never felt like an endeavour like many other RPGs, it was always easy to get back into if I didn't play for a while!

The only nitpick is that the game for its 45 hours didn't feel that long, I think if you only go for main quest you can get through it in half the time. 
Also towards the end some enemies are simply super strong, if they get the first turn of combat you can expect half your team to go down no matter how good armor you have.

and despite every reply i give them, telling them that i already tried it, it didnt work, any other suggestions, they just keep writing back with that pre written non sense of ""we understand, please try this url of steps that is just exactly what has already been done.""

I'm still playing through it, because I love isometric RPGs, but it's lacking across all fronts.

It's the usual trope of ""you can't wear armor unless you get strength"".
Most of the perks are unhelpful unless you build the way they want you to build.

Weapons are okay. There's a handful of them. I liked Weird Science stuff... at least it's creative.

There are some charming moments, like the Commune and Reagan area, but ultimately every single faction is unlikable. I ended up just killing everyone for XP because it was so awful.

The overworld is slow and clunky and feels empty. 

The bugs were so bad I lost hours and hours of progress due to glitched character stats. Multiplayer was almost unplayable with all the crashes.

Turrets are overpowered. I felt like I couldn't win most of my encounters without one.

I don't understand why games won't let you fill out your full roster with custom characters.

The ratio of buy to sell is insanely disproportionate. Barter skill is useless.

Vehicle customization is almost non-existent.

Pathing is awful. AI is meh.

Encounters sometimes cause a cutscene, so my time preparing and lining up a sniper shot gets canceled and all the enemies go first instead... stupid.

I'm not a fan of ""only use the highest skill from your party"" mechanic for skill checks. If everyone is level 9 First Aid, and one is level 10... all the level 9s are wasted points. Skills from party members should at least partially contribute to some total (like Divinity did)

Anyway... it's a game. I played it. Ultimately forgettable just like Wasteland 2 was for me. I'm just a sucker for the genre and really needed to scratch the RPG itch.",1601251561,1601251561,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999327250,695,34,1934,362,1714,1601343136,,
54,76049338,english,"I am editing my review but I won't change the original review, as it still stands. I want to add to it though as I have recently finished the story. While my feelings of this game are mixed I will say the combat balance and skill system in this game are way off. Maxed out characters with power armor should not even be capable of being 1 shot killed by a normal enemy. That said it is possible to build a team which will get you to the end but it requires a lot of health and you probably want to have 2 characters with high first aid skills. 

This is one of the most frustrating games I have played in a while. Not good frustrating like a hard to solve puzzle but more like a car that won't start. The combat is just not good, you take cover and click an enemy to shoot, you shoot into your own cover. So accuracy is the issue? Nope, max out awareness and the weapon skill in question and your still missing more than you connect. Move in closer for better chance, maybe flank around their cover? Great idea, try that and you miss more often at point blank ranges, this I do not get, accuracy should be a factor of range and skill. If a maxed character misses 3 out of 3 with a handgun at point blank range with no cover then their is something terribly wrong. Now this wouldn't be the end of the world if it was like this for the NPC's but no. They hit every time they shoot, unless your behind cover. So this makes you a team of elite rangers that can't hit the broadside of a barn and soak up bullets like a sponge does water. So predictably, most of your combat turns are spent trying to keep your team alive. So essentially you are constantly trying to balance the health of your team and if you use any characters with high AP cost attacks, well they won't get much use. Pile on top of that weird performance issues that I don't see in any other game. Overall the game looks nice, the lore is good the missions fun but the combat just ruins the entire experience.

2 hrs in and so far it feels so GD familiar. I've played many games in the past 6 years waiting for this to come out and none have done it better than Wasteland. I'm so glad they waited to polish the game while keeping the great turn based combat I've grown to love while adding a few nice new touches. Ill review more later once i'm further in but so far if you're a fan of the series and turn based games then this feels and acts like a $60 game. I'm already a fan and cannot wait to bring Arizona justice to Colorado.

edit@30hrs:

I'm loving this game, certainly what i expected from the series and the story is still unfolding. If you are a fan of the series buy it NOW if you're hesitant, i'm sure it'll hit in the Winter Sale so buy it then. There are bugs (I'm sure they'll be patched out soon), none of which are too bad. Although I have had to reload once or twice mid combat due to characters being stuck in walls and chests not opening and the game freezing, these occur too far in between to knock the game.

edit@50hrs:

Welp, just about to beat the game and ive found myself in a game breaking bug. I lockpicked a chest with one character then opened another chest with another character and now the game thinks im in a menu thats not there and i have 0 control of anything but alt+f4. I have restarted the game and i can move around but when i go into my menus to level up/inventory the game locks up on me and i am forced to alt+f4. Great job on breaking the game y'all. It started out very fun but got quickly boring and now is broken beyond playing. I am SOOOdisappointed.

Edit after update:
fixed my UI issues and the game is now playable.

64,75083228,english,"After playing through the game a coupe times I wanted to revise my review.

It is a solid sequel to Wasteland 2, but it needs to address a few questionable design decisions.

Currently, combat comes down to who goes first. If the enemy goes first in the opening round of combat, typically 2-3 of your units will go down. Then, it is a matter of whittling down the enemy health while avoiding taking any damage at all. You will typically be one shot regardless of armor or stats. You cannot get your health or armor high enough to absorb even a single crit. Your animal companions have 10x more health and serve as bullet sponges. Also, reviving a downed Ranger costs no resources so you are almost unkillable. Similarly, on the world map, calling in for a tow (aka fast travel) costs no resources and heals your group. Takes a lot of the risk out of the game. 

Balancing is off and some perks and builds are worthless. Assault rifles are extremely underpowered. 

One month in and the game still seems like it should be in Early Access. Too many bugs to name, poorly optimized, and many missions seem poorly written or just incomplete. I'm sure Covid-19 hurt the development process, but the game really should be in Early Access right now.

+ Great storytelling: The story revolves around a very normal, mundane, human problem; but the way it is presented draws you in and tugs on your heartstring.

+ Americana theme woven and told in a good way with great soundtracks to go with it. Has the very essence of America in a good way of the good old days, not the memed America of today.

+ Some side stories are very very weird, pretty funny, and bloody hilarious. Yet somehow, believable and relatable in a surreal way thanks to good writing.

+ Streamlined gameplay. Easy to get into, but will punish you hard for not using your head; both for combat and decision-making.

+ The game doesn't shy away from letting players ruin themselves by making decisions that will cut off storylines. The tale is what you made it and the game will have you take it. A true RPG experience.

Cons:

- Tons of gamebreaking bugs as of the time of this reviews writing. Had to start over at least twice now.

- The game feels smaller than WL2 in some department.

- Coop is broken and unplayable as of the time of this reviews writing.

- Lots of loading. Normally isn't much of a problem, but in a large hub area with many sub-areas which every transitions has a loading it becomes very annoying, especially when turning-in quests and backtracking from sub-areas to hub and onto the world map and vice versa.

Conclusion:

Wait for the bugs to be fixed and you can have your excellent Americana wasteland adventure without all the fuss. Not counting the bugs, and judging from the contents: a solid 8 out of 10.

Remember. In this game; you are not here to save the world, you just try to save whoever you can and whatever remains or just take it all for yourself.

81,75511459,english,"I'm posting a new review after some of the multiplayer fixes, as I did finish the game in co-op mode. I still think that it's unacceptable to have released the game in its initial form.

And I'm still not sure that the game doesn't need another four months of development time. While some of the game-breaking bugs have been fixed, there are tons of bugs. In multiplayer, the game still freezes on load screens, will boot you out of a fight if your partner has an eighth of a second of lag (costing you half an hour), and occasionally keeps combat on after a fight is finished, preventing progression. I suppose it's a testament to the game that we kept pushing through the game despite losing an hour every night to this sort of nonsense. One easy fix would have been to allow in-fight saves to hedge against disconnect issues, or allow for hotjoining or persistent hosting, but the multiplayer just isn't up to that.

The minor bugs pile up too. Use a healing item? It inexplicably goes back to your inventory instead of your quickslots. 

By the way, what is the purpose of the quickslots, anyway? It is costless to move items from your inventory to your quickslots, yet you are limited to two quickslots - this simply produces busy work as you toggle items into your quickslots so that you can use them during battle, making using items incredibly onerous for no reason. Like, it would make sense if you had to predetermine the items that you would use in combat before combat and otherwise be locked out of them - your medic has chosen to hold a medkit and medical turret, and that's what you're stuck with. But that's not how it works - you can swap at will. So, then, why not just allow 10 quickslots to save me the effort of shoving things around? This is all the more galling when you consider that you can use a Perk to buy a new quickslot! Why in your right mind would you pay for a QoL improvement that has no other benefit?

I mention this because it is emblematic of the overall design issues that are fundamental to the game. Before I list more, don't get me wrong - this is an excellent game. The voice acting, story, combat (to a point), atmosphere, music design--amazing, tension between horror and humor--it's all exceptionally well done.

But one can't help imagine that the developers ran out of time at the end and rushed a release, intending to rely on patches. Setting aside the bugs:

- The endgame is badly balanced. Once you turn a corner somewhere near 2/3rds through, the enemies are trivial. We played on Super Jerk the whole way through. 
- You hit your progression cap for gear and items around that point as well. Your turrets stop improving, you stop finding exciting items, your gear can't evolve because it's pretty well capped, mods are no longer needed or useful, etc. So it seems like there should have been a host of available items and tricks that never came to fruition because the endgame is so lame (we finished at level 23, btw, and were pretty assiduous about clearing most everything).
- The end boss is a joke. A joke! Didn't even get the same cool music as many previous bosses, either. Something didn't get finished.
- There is no respec. I get that. However, this is severely limiting because you will make mistakes in development at the start of the game, and then feel unduly penalized near the end. It doesn't really matter, but since the tooltip and support systems are weak at best, the assumption must be that people will look everything up and optimize from there. Again, beat the game on Super Jerk, but it was disappointing to see my insane killer sumurai clown who had grown out of his occasional use of rocket launchers to still have to keep those dumb points in Heavy Weapons instead of doubling down on the fun. Like, I'm glad to pay a huge cost for the respec, but it would have been a lot of fun to get his swordsmanship up a level or two at the cost of other stuff.
- Also, money becomes useless about half of the way through the game. You spend the start scavenging for bullets, carefully considering which of your party members will wield what kind of ammunition, and even switch weapons because you're out of the expensive .50 cal or whatever. And that's great - very much in the spirit of the game. However, around halfway through, I clicked 'sell junk' and suddenly had more money than I would ever need. Bought all the ammo possible, all the armor/weapons that mattered (almost none), all of the consumables, and still had a huge amount in the bank. Again, the endgame isn't properly balanced. 
- With Animal Friendship (or whatever it's called) on all of your characters, you have a horde of rabbits, dogs, and deer at your disposal that render most fights trivial. And on Super Jerk, even the rabbit will usually have more hp than most of your party. They need to look at the scaling there.
- The time it takes the AI to make decisions (at least in multiplayer) is ridiculous. There are some fights where you get 20+ allies who you don't control. This is awesome in concept! However, on two gaming PCs with a LAN connection, the AI takes **forever**. So add 20 allies who are stupid as heck, and you have to walk away from the game for ten minutes while they take their actions, which don't matter much anyway. Does Private Randname really need ten seconds to decide that they will walk two feet and fire their ineffectual pistol at an enemy and do a tiny amount of damage? Does Private Randname really need to wait a few seconds between shots of useless pistol, even when already in position? Multiply that out by 20 allies and 20 enemies, and you have one heck of a slog. And (at least in multiplayer) since you're constantly chasing the clock of 'when will this game freeze again,' losing so much time to inconsequential and otherwise easily-optimized absurdity feels unneeded.

Basically, this game is exceptional until 2/3rds way through, then it falls apart at the seams. Even the creativity in the fight setup, dialogue, and story start to collapse. It really feels unfinished. Does an unfinished masterpiece deserve a thumbs down? I think so. The pace at which it unravels, along with all of the bugs, don't justify the pricetag. Gold Edition or whatever they call it in a year will be great! However, that doesn't change the fact that I paid sixty bucks to beta test.

Which is a shame, because it is otherwise a wonderful experience. However, I spent the last week just wanting to get it over with, and deeply terrified of the next major freeze.

I think my experience could be summed up like this: the last few hours of the game is very much on-the-rails. It was a trivial slog, and I just wanted to finish it and see how the story ended. I felt like my decisions had weight, and when the credits rolled, I was excited to see how the world would change. And the game delivered a focused epilogue. It made me laugh and nearly cry as I watched how my decisions mattered. I felt so bad for a certain AI, for instance. And then... it froze. After the last fight and halfway through the epilogue, my partner was DC'ed. End. Game.

Utterly unforgivable to launch a game in this state. Co-op is unplayable, entirely. If you intend to use it, you're basically just paying for an advanced beta. Every thirty minutes we have to look up obscure workarounds on reddit - hardly a seamless experience. Example: moving from one area to another sometimes causes the game to freeze, and the game will FOREVER freeze until you load it single player and then move to a new area. Then you can save, turn it off, load it in multiplayer, and play until another bug hits. It is obscene that a studio would release something in this shape. Sure, patches will come - but did nobody test these utterly game breaking bugs? It's a shame because there is a cool game here - but these days, players are treated like beta testers. Devs - don't release half-finished crap. There is no way you missed these bugs.",1599347971,1601177146,False,2,1,0.483221471309661865,0,True,False,False,76561198064151159,70,6,5320,533,5320,1601086738,,

OLD REVIEW:
----------
This game is not in a playable state. It is not worth 60$. 

Game breaking bugs, keybindings that does not work and a whole bunch of inconvenient bugs just leaves this game in a sorry state. It is very fun when it works, but I've gotten stuck. I can't return to the HQ without getting stuck. The minimap has disappeared, combat is desynced and skills do not work properly in co-op. Eternal loading screens and random disconnects. Double money gained when playing co-op.

The game is also blatantly a console game ported to PC. Some of these issues can be overlooked, but not the game breaking ones, especially not in a 60€ game. 

Writing is good, gameplay is very fun, but the game does not work.

DO NOT buy it in it's current state.",1598719992,1601153673,True,0,0,0.544273436069488525,0,True,False,False,76561198012838998,224,19,996,498,857,1601211356,,

However, as it is now, multiplayer on PC (the platform I play on) is so incredibly busted that there is no reason to even try playing.  Infinite loading screens destroyed any attempt I had to run a multiplayer campaign. 

Outside of that, some features like companions are jankily implimented. Melee companions yeet themselves into danger with no input from you, which frequently gets them killed if there is a suicide enemy of some kind with nothing you can really do about it. Companion bonuses seem wildly unbalanced - the cat is pretty mediocre as a companion but gives 6% crit chance to the owner, which is miles better than a lot of the other perks. They also all do their attacks one after the other, which makes waiting for your companions to finish attacking frequently around a minute or longer. 

EDIT: After two patches through September 2020, many multiplayer issues were fixed such as the infinite loading screen (the main one I had issues with). However, they managed to introduce a new bug where using the high level Sniper perk Chain Ambush locks the game. I'm somewhat impressed that the game is still filled with bugs like these weeks after release.

[b]Positives:[/b]
Good writing - Quite a few difficult options to choose from in your story which will affect your characters and your ending. 
Gameplay - Allows you to move around to set up how you see fit for most of the encounters before you are spotted or make the opening move.
The World - Traversing the world is nice for hunting resources and taking risks in exploring some other areas that are not required for the story. 

[b]Negatives:[/b]
Bugs - A bit buggy on release, there are a few annoying bugs that you will notice but nothing that is game breaking. 
Skills - The skill system isn't explained well early on and if you try to spread out skill points on your characters, you are punished for it later on when you need the higher levels on the skills. 
Skill System (again) - Many of the skills feel redundant like Survival and Weapon & Armour modding. It just doesn't feel like it has much of an impact apart from range and hit chance for your weapons. 
Pet System - This felt rushed? There are a few pets you can pick up later when you are at max rank, there is a way to get two to follow you which shouldn't be allowed (according to how the game works) but then if you try to recruit a new one, you have to drop the two you already have in order to take the new one. This resulted in me leaving the Honey Badger in favor of the Young Bison and Growler Cub which I already had even though the Honey Badger is meant to be the elite pet. The pets also love getting in your way in combat and when you're just generally trying to move around. 
Multiplayer - From what I have read, it looks like it is a bit broken with a few too many bugs. I cannot comment on this as I played through this solo.

Pros:
- Good story/world building
- Huge number of choices/paths
- Memorable characters
- Amusing writing (if you don't mind sexual innuendo and somewhat agressive humour)
- No inventory weight limits

Cons:
UI/general
- Loooong load times
- Interface is janky, even levelling seems harder than it should
- Same memory leak as Wasteland 2
- Map is awful, can't click to move, can't fix minimap orientation to North
AI
- Squad movement is bad, starting fight because squad members have moved stupidly
- NPC ally movement is bad, 
- Move orders path through dangerous terrain (poison clouds, etc)

BUT if you're not someone you can tolerate technical faults, I'd recommend waiting a couple of months before purchasing (As of late September 2020), because there are a couple of bugs although I haven't run into anything in major.

But personally I really have hard time holding that against it, especially given that patches seem to be becoming a relatively fast.

Gameplay: A mix between XCOM and ATOM RPG (and some of the earlier Fallout series), which is great. The options are quite limited.
Audio: Decent, a gap between two different things could be a nice addition so that radio chatter and statics does not overlap each other.
Story: It's very rational and balanced. Never have I been so stunned that a Dorsey wanted good ol' elections and the Gangs survival methods to ensure their offspring lived without having to do these brutal things.
Balancing: It could be more balanced. If you have a squad with four Troopers with SMGs (plus Toasty perk), a Sniper, and a Heavy Gunner -- I think it would be slightly overpowered as the Stormer perk with high Luck allows those troops to shoot multiple times before ending the turn.

38,76523298,english,"I am pretty torn on whether or not to recommend this game, so I am giving it a thumbs down at its current price.

Coming from the perspective of someone who loved Wasteland 2, it's a mixed bag. Combat has been sped up and streamlined in mostly positive ways, as has character progression. There are many things which show a new level of production value, such as the fully voice-acted dialogue and soundtrack. What really disappointed me, though, is that the amount of content and the complexity of the quests and story decisions seems to be about half that of Wasteland 2.

Combat and character creation have been somewhat simplified; some skills have been combined, and instead of each character in a battle acting in turn according to their initiative, each side goes all at once. The paring down and combining of combat skills actually works pretty well. Whereas in Wasteland 2 each weapon type had a correlating skill, in Wasteland 3 each combat skill encompasses two weapon types. This allows each character to use both weapon types for their chosen and switch between either one as the situation dictates. Many non-combat skills have also been combined, such as safecracking and lockpicking. The only place where I feel this streamlining really falters is in how statuses, healing and revival are handled. The number of different status effects and enemy abilities has been drastically reduced, and there is no permanent death for any ranger character, so combat overall seems much more trivial even on higher difficulties. You hardly even need healing items at all besides food and medical items that all characters can use on themselves, which drastically changes the balance of the game in favor of being easier. 

There are many nice new touches, such as the upgraded world map in which you drive around with your Kodiak. The soundtrack is also pretty cool. The graphics are much better than in Wasteland 2. Overall, the level of production value is much higher this time around. Unfortunately, I feel like this, as well as the general streamlining of the mechanics, must have been a main area of focus in order to appeal to a broader group of consumers, and that quest design, writing and the general amount of content took a back seat. 

In terms of writing, tone and player choice, the developers did a good job. The general plot is good, most of the characters are good, and the characterization of the different factions is well done. You are free to make many choices which for which the developers aren't smashing you over the head with which one is morally superior, and you are forced to make compromises as befits a wasteland survival scenario. The main plot is interesting and flows pretty well from one part to the next. Unfortunately, the world itself, and the factions within it, are not all that fleshed out. Each area basically has one quest line associated with the main plot, which may feature a couple of decisions to make but is otherwise uncomplicated and straightforward, and then you're done with that area forever. There are very, very few side quests compared to Wasteland 2.

If I were to give a rough estimate for the length and volume of content in this game compared to Wasteland 2, I'd have to say it's about half as much. Basically, by the time you're done in Arizona and moving on to LA in Wasteland 2, this game is over. The world map is about the same size, and populated as densely, as only one of the maps from Wasteland 2. What's worse, the level of complexity both in level design and quest design is also very much reduced. There are very few, if any, large and complex quest lines such as the ones seen in Rail Nomads, Rodia, Angel Oracle, or Hollywood. The only settlement on the scale of any of those is Colorado Springs, and almost all other locations are either a small outdoor courtyard of some kind or a combat dungeon. There is also very little environmental variation. Where Wasteland 2 was packed with all kind of NPCs, random encounters, and totally optional content and locations in addition to its several major hub settlements, Wasteland 3 is pretty barren and sparse. It's not that Wasteland 2 had an intricately woven story full of decisions that significantly impacted the main plot, but it did have many complex side stories with a very high amount of choice. It also had a high amount of detail that made most locations interesting or memorable in some way. Unfortunately, that is basically missing from Wasteland 3, and that is a really bog let down for me. 

So as far as my subjective tastes go, and as a fan of Wasteland 2, I can't recommend this game at $60.",1601020979,1601022761,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198072745585,125,7,3685,1881,3628,1601784417,,

53,76509991,english,"OK, I'm going to preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of Wasteland 2.
I'll also say this at the beginning: This is inXile's first attempt at a multiplayer game.

With that out of the way, I am very sad to report that this game is simply not finished. It is littered with game-breaking bugs, terrible co-op connection issues, and generally gives an impression of being an unfinished product.

I know they are aware of the problems and are working hard to fix them, and maybe down the line, when the software is stable and playable I'll update this review to reflect that.
But for now it's basically an unplayable mess that I paid a full $60 to own, and convinced my friend to do the same.

Had inXile released the software in this state under the Early Access banner at a reduced price, I don't think I'd be writing this review. I would accept that there was still work to be done, and would be happy to contribute to bug-reporting and making it the best game possible.
But they didn't... They put a full price-tag on it, and shipped it in a state that makes we wonder if there was any QA done at all before release.

So yeah, I'm sorry to say this as a huge fan of Wasteland 2, but please wait for this mess to get sorted before purchasing.

At this point, my biggest fear is that the game will never really get truly fixed and polished, and instead, in a year or so they'll announce a Director's Cut version for another $60... If that's the case, I will not be supporting them at all in the future.

As I stated, if the game is fixed I may update this review down the line, but for the moment I see no reason to praise this software or the studio that made it. 

I thought the whole purpose for the Wasteland series was to create a better alternative to Bethesda's Fallout series, not to copy its shitty development methods.

Some of the NPCs are also more bland than Wasteland 2 and I'm not sure why you have the opportunity to recruit some of them as you do because they really haven't influenced any of the interactions or decisions made.  Would like to have seen in this area more opportunities to interact with your NPCs more than you can.
The World itself is nicely done though it feels a whole lot smaller than Wasteland 2, so I hope we shall see some world opening DLCs as currently the exploring is pretty bland.
Overall a recommend but not quite up to the previous games in the series.

I think it's a fantastic game with a very fine-tuned difficulty curve and which allows players to play the yay they want to. 

The combat is great, the story is great, the music (sparse though it is) is great (when it's present). They simplified some of the systems, but in a good way - for example, instead of having a separate medicine and surgery skill, they are combined as First aid. 

They took out the ridiculously annoying ""separate inventories for separate character"" nonsense, which is fantastic.

It IS a bit buggy. Some quests are VERY buggy. And you can tell they ran out of time on the bug testing, because the beginning areas and quests are largely bug free, but as you get further and further on, more and more bugs start popping up. There's one side-quest I had to completely abandon since, on completing it, the game just.... froze up. No matter what I did, when I got to the end, it just didn't progress (The Quest is called Elf on the Shelf). A couple of time the enemy AI just froze up and refused to move.

I suppose this is meant to get you thinking about your choices, but when all roads lead to suffering, what choices do you really have?

Combat is serviceable, but lacks any interesting dynamic or punch.  This is XCOM if XCOM only had guns.  Poorly balanced guns, at that.  Pistols and shotguns outperform other weapons by an order of magnitude.  Worse still is the enemy:player balance.  A maxed strength character at level 14 had 350 health.  Level 9 normal enemies were showing up with over 800.

Technical issues are still prevalent.  Be prepared to sit through a flurry of load screens to travel anywhere, deal with the occasional enemy shooting through walls, or lose 30 minutes of progress because the game enabled combat mode with no enemies around and wouldn't end it.

78,75461408,english,"Wasteland 3, as of 9/4/2020, is a fun game that gets bogged down by bugs and other nagging flaws for me. I considered for a while whether I'd recommend it in its current state and, after finishing the game, I'd say it depends on whether you're OK with [i] largely [/i] benign bugs and other small frustrations. My biggest gripe is the load times - 30 to 40 seconds or so for every area transition or save file load. This may not seem like much, but it added up. Some more issues I noted are as follows:

[u] Bugs and Performance Issues [/u]
- VERY often, the location name from the world map (in big, bold, white lettering) will stick on your screen once you've loaded into a location until you save and reload your game
- Some generic NPCs will switch from a male voice to a female voice and vice versa
- Some UI overlaps
- Progressing to the next line of dialogue in some conversations causes the game to freeze for a few seconds
- Certain VFX cause large FPS drops, once to the point of crashing, though most areas are just fine
- Ambient noise can get very loud and annoying to the point where I don't think it's intended
- I couldn't speak to a particular NPC vendor
- [strike] The displayed skill point cost of skills that you're boosting with gear will incorrectly show higher costs and will prevent you from purchasing higher ranks if you don't meet the displayed number until you take off said gear (though it will deduct the correct number of skill points if you are able to afford the increased cost) [/strike] [b] Reportedly fixed in 1.1.1 [/b]
- Combat music may continue playing out of combat
- A particular animation didn't play that made a puzzle confusing: [spoiler] At one point you can try activating an array of robotic ballerinas at the same time, but some ballerinas won't play a dancing animation though the game counts them as dancing [/spoiler]
- A very important AOE ability sometimes had no effect (other than eating your AP), possibly tied to whether the caster was crouching
- Once, a character repeatedly played a ""getting into cover"" animation which caused constant screen shaking in combat
- Reducing the spread of one cone-targeting weapon causes the targeting area to be engulfed in pure black
I'll try to update this list if patches come out that address these issues

[u] (Probably) Non-Bug Frustrations [/u]
- If you hit neutral factions in combat, even with a missed bullet or a non-damaging attack, they may immediately turn hostile (though they're more than happy to hit you with poorly placed AOEs meant for your common enemy)
- It's sometimes unclear where hazard (radiation/fire) areas are on the world map and in combat
- Equipped weapons may not automatically be loaded with ammo (not sure if this was intentional)
- You can't see through doorways until you've entered them, but enemies can aggro through them (which once led to combat starting and me not being able to see any enemies)
- I was reluctant to try different named squadmembers because their skills overlapped with my created characters' skills
- Combat towards the end of the game felt like I needed to sneak attack and kill/disable everything in one turn or enemies would start oneshotting my team (though perhaps some of that is down to random crits and me not investing enough in tankiness)

[b]There are a lot more gripes I could list, but the point is that the game is rough around the edges at this point in time. That being said, there is a lot that I really liked:[/b]
- Combat largely feels fun, like when planning out attack strategies, ESPECIALLY when that strategy involves running across the battlefield with a really fast character to whack the sniper on the other side or hacking a giant robot to fight for you
- The indicators of who you can target from a particular position are REALLY nice, I'll miss them in other turn-based RPGs
- The setting is pretty cool, this is my first Wasteland game so the 1980s/1990s retrofuturistic tech was fun to take in.
- There are some nice rewards for exploring everywhere (e.g. unique armor/weapons, weird stat-boosting dolls), I think I ended up clearing out nearly all of the locations on the world map
- I enjoyed talking to people, there are some fun lines on the player and NPC side, especially the charm/intimidate lines for the player

83,76452759,english,"Almost amazing, wait for the first major patches.

First, let's start with the good:  
-Game is very pretty; armors, weapons, characters, all well designed.  
-Scenery is great.
-Voice acting cast is very good.
-Combat movement animations are quite decent.  
-World feels alive and the setting is very appropriate.  
-The quests offer lots of morally ambiguous choices that actually required me to stop and think.  There was no obvious 'good guy' or 'bad guy' choice, save for the option to be a murdering asshole at all times.  The ability to play your character is definitely there.

Unfortunately, all those good points are almost totally eclipsed by the bad:
-Buggy as shit.  Like... Unacceptably buggy for a $60 game.  Items simply don't work, and sometime skills don't either.  I told my gunner to move and hack an enemy robot, he just shot it instead.  Some areas have bugged traps that you can't disarm, like the laser tripwires in the Monster Bunker HQ.  My options were to throw grenades at them to blow them up, or sacrifice someone running across them.

-Team member AI is moronic.  Even with visually identified traps/environmental hazards, you need to manually move each team member through because if you move as a group, your team members will just walk over mines and traps.  Tedious, unnecessary, and frustrating.

-Your non-player allies (yellow health bars) are a pain in the ass.  They take up space in combat, and often block where you will want to be.  Can't control them.  Also, they lag behind or go wherever on the world map.  Frustrating as shit when you trigger a trap and suddenly your allies are hostile to you because they were standing in the trap radius.  Time to reload the save, I guess.

-The options for diplomacy are limited.  More specifically, you can be penalized for talking before combat.  Typically, if one side attacks first while the other is unaware, it counts as an ambush, and that whole team gets to go first--that is fair.  If your team is spotted, it goes off of the initiative system, and that is also fair.  However, if you decide to [Attack] with a dialogue option, or something you say triggers combat, whoever ""initiated"" the attack gets their whole side to go first.  That is not fair.

For example, I walked into a gang members hideout, hoping to talk the gang down.  Story wise, my team knew this was hostile territory, and would be ready for a fight.  However, because I didn't pick the [Attack] option, and my dialogue choices led to combat, the AI got to go first and alpha struck my team with everyone.  That's idiotic, in terms of design.  In a situation like that, where both sides are squaring up for a fight, why not use the initiative system.  Why is the side that basically says 'Okay go' allowed to get a whole turn and free shots at people who probably haven't taken cover yet.

You can try to position your team members before a fight, but it's often impossible due to clunky controls and the fact that there will be patrolling enemies who threaten to reveal you while you're trying to get set up.

The good parts of the game are really good.  REALLY good.  Unfortunately, the bad stuff is just as bad, and it takes away from what would otherwise be an amazing experience.  It almost feels like they needed a few more months of polish and bugfixing before release.  Don't pay $60 for this right now.

I love a lot of the writing behind the game's dialogue and quests.  Xcom-like combat doesn't ever feel stale, even though I thought it would with a lack of  things to do outside of attack, move and ambush.

There are issues though:

Loading screens are way too long.  This is painfully evident if you are playing co-op.

There are bugs here and there, but nothing seemed too terrible.  

Biggest issues I have are some of the design decisions that just leave me scratching my head:

Why even have quickslots at all?  They can be quickly changed during combat--no cost or fuss.  The game randomly takes stuff off your quick slot after you use them. It is a hassle when you constantly have to put them back on.  Seems like you should have either added some action bars or just allowed all item use from inventory.

The Interface is a bit upsetting at times.  Want to see all a certain rank of an attribute offers? Good luck seeing the whole description before your mouse accidentally drags over another rank or skill/attribute.

 Want to find a specific utility item? You are going to have to dig through your entire inventory.  No sorting for Utility items.

Want to see the status of an enemy unit more in depth than it's hp?  Click the almost unnoticeable question mark top right of the screen and mouse over a unit.  Hope they don't have more than 1 or 2 effects.  Sure you can cycle through them with left or right arrow, but it also moves the screen, which moves your cursor off of your target, which means you can see the status of the enemy anyway.  Maybe this could have just been standard for mousing over a target-- the amount of info you actually glean could even have been governed by something like perception or something.

Are you hosting Coop and your friend is controlling the sniper, so you decide to let them open the combat encounter?  Have fun not acting the first round of combat.  If your friend who joined initiates you count as surprised. If the host initiates, the combat rolls as normal.


Despite this game having some of the most fun/creative re-imaginings of classic songs I've heard such as ""Monster Mash"" ""Blood of the Lamb"" and my favorite ""Battle march of the Republic"", they are woefully underused.  Most songs you get to hear maybe ONCE during the entire game.  And then there are a couple that you hear nonstop, such as ""Green Acres"".  Jukebox or custom playlist would have been a nice touch?

There are more gripes that I could bring up. Notice that none of these are truly terrible issues, but they all add up to take a toll on the overall experience.

All in all, even though I feel the game could have waited longer in favor of polishing up the few rough spots it has, I DO love this game.

There are too many bugs don't even try this in co-op (right now there are no fixes) -29.08
1. Bugged quests - after some time you have 0 quests (0 completed/ 0 to do)
2. Lost all cash after the loading screen
3. Your character all the time is busy and can't do anything
4. After 4 - 7 Sec you can't hear a radio voice (You hear only beginning, then you have to read text)
5.You can't sell some junk items
6. You also have ""stuck in dialog"" issue and there is only one solution - reload the save
...
The issue is with saves, after the tactical mode, there is auto save (no matter if you disable it in the settings) and often after tactical mode and auto save the game seems don't remember anything you did before and everything is zeroed.

After an update and one week of waiting this game is officially unplayable. You can't load any  locations, it's just stuck on 30%. I don't want to be salty but this game is the worst 59.99$ release of this year. 05.09

New update and new bugs ... Now in co-op you can't join to most of the conversation, at this state this game is unplayable(if you want to know something about the lore etc .) 23.09

- Great characters

- Combat is improved from Wasteland 2
- Less bugs than Wasteland 2
- Graphics are much better
- The UI is improved from W2
- Tons of awesome leveling up stuff to get lost in
- Your decisions actually matter
- One of the best soundtracks in modern gaming
- Best voice work I have ever had in a crpg

The Bad:
- There are some bugs, mostly smaller ones we have ran into, along with one big one in coop (which was fixed in the last update thankfully)
- Loading screens could go faster


Just got finished playing over 4 hours of Coop with a friend. What a wonderful game!! Well done Inexile! Take a nice well deserved break and get back to making more awesome games :)

I am a Wasteland veteran, Wasteland 1 was one of my very first games (Wasteland 1 and Early Wizardry and Early Ultima). The 2nd game was great to, wonderful to see it in more modern times. Now comes the 3rd game and boy they have improved ALOT this time around!

I am talking almost everything has been improved! From the pretty graphics, to the wonderful voice acting, the improved animations, its less janky and the writing once again is fantastic. Not to mention the coop is a blast and the game is much more polished compared to Wasteland 2, Bards Tale or something like Pathfinder.

A little over 4 hours on the game and I am just blown away by what Inexile has done, I was hoping for a 8-9/10 but so far atleast after 4-5 hours, this is a 9.5/10 for crpgs. Your decisions matter and this game does it oh so well, also customization is fantastic! This game has been crafted with such love and talent, well done to the devs!

Go buy this game ASAP if you enjoy any computer roleplaying games, Post Apocalypse rpgs, Baldurs Gate, Wasteland 1 or 2 or the Fallout series. Brian Fargo is one of the main creators of the Fallout series and also Wasteland, a genius at work and everyone at Inexile has done such a great job on this game. No negatives at all so far, this is improved in every singleway from W2 and many new features.

Also lastly, the change up to the snowy Colorado area is just wonderful, gone from the desert looking areas to a more beautiful and immersive game world! Such good writing to for the characters and dialogue. Thank you to MS to for giving Inexile more money and time to make this game the wonderful treasure it is. Up there with Flight sim 2020 and Doom Eternal as my favorite games of 2020.

I can't wait for my friend to get back online for more COOP, get online bud! :)

A wonderful mix of Wasteland 1/2, Fallout 1/2 and coop that is like Divinity Original Sin 2.
Game Of The Year 2020 for me personally!

**Update after 15 hours, game gets better and better the further you get. As far as bugs? The odd one but not much! The worst we have had was a bug where in one fight some of the enemies you could only see there weapon*

**50 Hours later and we are both loving the game. After the latest patch the game runs even better, GOTY, get it now**

31,76401859,english,"Huge fan of the series dating all the way back to the original Wasteland.  However, I'm not sure I would recommend this to anyone.  Honestly, you could just watch videos on the internet and be as happy with money in your pocket.  I can't feel that the game was hit hard in development with COVID....

That being said... 

The Good - Music soundtrack is pretty good.  (Prob my favorite part IF I have one)   The story and how you can impact the story is Fair to Good.  If you've played the others in the series it feels a bit SOS.  A bit disappointing if I'm being honest.

The Bad - Where do you begin?  I played it rather quickly through the hardest version.  It seemed RNG was the worst of it, just loading from a previous encounter actually changed the outcome from decimated before it was ""your"" turn to why did I die on that encounter anyway?

Something is WAY wrong with the stuttering, I have a SSD Samsung PRO this is on, load times seemed a lot for a very ""A"" game.  There are triple A games that are more intensive and seem optimized better.  Do special attacks the game would look like it's having a heart attack.  I hope it didn't go on the consoles like that...  but here we are.  

Loot is horrible to most of the time ridiculous.  Random vendors were lackluster...  Rewards were just terrible.  I accidentally got some of the best armor and at times I felt like you would have no upgrades for a while, then get three variations and the first two would have been useful earlier.

Some of the quests you don't get a clear what do i do.  About 75% cleared content in, I started skipping encounters because they were a time sink with no real benefit unless you were leveling.  Because of how the UI is, seemed more of a pain to do the quests.  The radio would give you clues to somethings to do; but, it never displayed who was saying it... You mostly kept looking on the map and cruising around.  I think I missed out on things like the antenna; but, I mostly didn't care because of how poorly the game feels optimized.  

This is a 3/5 Game, the IP makes it a 3, because this really should be a two.  Similar to playing XCOM series which I enjoy and again, but plays really bad.  Divinity and prob the new runescape will be similar.  I have owned those and the genre bores me when it's like this.  It's a 20-30 dollar game at best.  I didn't bother to see my total play time, but I think I was away from the game as it idled.  It wasn't very engaging.  

Finally, it lacks content.  Pretty sure I could have played this under an hour an skipped fluff.  I played it on the hardest level and wasn't impressed.  It's pretty empty and REALLY needs more content.  Maybe they're banking on additional play throughs; but, naaaaah.

43,76208510,english,"So, maybe this is just an early take, but as of 18 September I wouldn't buy this game to co-op.

The good: it's fun, well-written, and challenging. Basically a mix of Borderlands/Fallout story and X-COM combat.

The bad: stability. I play on a network with my wife. Loads take 2-3 minutes, area transition loads fail at 33% approximately 1/5 times (even after disabling auto-saving), sometimes skills don't proc (leadership's rally just sometimes fails). About 20% of the time is spent loading or redoing content due to these glitches.

Just had the first quest bug at 25 hours: tried to arrest an NPC, had the radio toggle down (as if it was about to start some dialogue), but nothing happened. Radio stays down, quest stays open, starting dialogue with the NPC gives a canned talk and ""goodbye"" option.

Anyways, I would wait a month or two. No need to rush on this if you're looking at co-op. Single player might be more stable.

Edit: This game gets worse as you progress. Loads fail in coop at about 33% loaded more often, the quest writing degrades ([spoiler] Oh, ""a gang is heading towards Denver"", that totally means go click on your truck - as if to leave the map - in order to start that encounter. [/spoiler] ), and it all just becomes a drag. My wife and I just spent 30 minutes loading, having two failed area transitions, and one crash, and all the reloading in between. It's just... too much.

Also, the coop ""lobby"" has almost zero QOL design. Lots of pointless clicking (like the pop-up when someone joins the lobby), a set default to New Game (instead of last co-op save, or even ""select something""), and a ""manage party"" every time you load even though the game remembers what your party layout was last time. It all just ends up taking time - and it's not fun.

Almost expected, those can be fixed.  The flaws are in the way choices are presented.  Some of them just don't make sense.  Some of the character reactions to choices don't make sense.  Others are kind of forced to make some sort of dilema.  

I'm pretty sure, I could have better ideas in the given situations than the ones presented.  For example, and a little spoilery (without spoiling what actually happens as a result of the choices) :  Eventually if you keep refugees around, things come to a head between them and your ranger recruits.  You are made to choose between kicking out the refugees, moving them to the brig or keeping things the way they are.  Well...we have that huge eff off room containing a museum...  don't really need a museum much anyway.  Get rid of that thing.  And it's a HUGE room.  Hell, let my troops bunk there.  We can museum up later when things are better than they are.

But, combat is fun.  And challenging.  Originally did an easy run just for the story.  Working up to do my normal/hard runs, now that I have an idea of what to expect and can focus on how to build proper rangers.

1.) AI characters shooting through walls.
2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)
3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat
4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.
5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design
6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.
7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat

As I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.

Completed my first run through recently plus starting a second one too and I enjoy the game a lot. Although this is my first time playing this franchise, I enjoyed the Xcom like gameplay, characters and overall story in this game. I'ts quite like Fallout when choices matter but I would say only certain ones do, not everything (which is quite obvious, even for a casual player). This didn't put me off as I enjoyed killing motherfuckers with my sniper girl plus the addition of npc comrades being sick so it didn't bother me too much lol. 
Story wise, the game has a lot of cut content just by looking at it which sucks since it could of been an even better game if it had more scenarios plus weapon classes imo. I give it props for implementing the lore from the second game well. Even though I haven't played it (yet), I understood the overall story and how it got to this point. 
The only massive problem with the game is the bugs. I didn't encounter any huge bugs myself apart from some audio issues and being stuck in a fucking fence but for the average player you'll probably encounter atleast one during a full playthrough (especially co-op lmao).

I still have some gripes with the system here and there, but overall I've come to terms. 

I'm only halfway through the game, but I can confidently say that the game is good. I can't say it's the best in any field, but I'm going to have a second playthrough so that should say something at least. I can't speak for the co-op component, but singleplayer is definitely solid, despite a few non game-breaking bugs that I've found.

Some balancing issues from 2 have been rectified from what I can see, new ones may have been created though. Strength is no longer just a dump stat for any character that's not a sniper. (Don't make the same mistake I did, give your starting squad some strength early on.) Assault rifles are no longer the main workhorse weapon, shotguns and pistols are way more useful than they were before, and heavy weapons are no longer fried bird anus.

The soundtrack is pretty good, sometimes they throw in a cover of a song and those are done really well.

The one notable problem that I still have is the lack of being able to choose to walk outside of combat like in Wasteland 2. Not only did I like the imagery of my squad walking up to enemies like nonchalant badasses, but I also used it for spotting landmines and other traps. I've heard that using a controller lets you, but I don't see why it couldn't be like in WL2 where you right-click once to walk, twice to run.

73,76201160,english,"UPDATE: So this game in it's current state is a mixed bag. Originally I gave this a thumbs up, but after completing the game I'm giving it a thumbs down until it gets seriously patched. My experience was seriously disappointing at the end game due to bugs that ruined the story by not completing the links in the story chain and leading to overall confusion, compounded by confusing and bugged NPC placement during the final battle. I also ultimately ended up receiving the wrong achievement.

Before I sink my teeth into the bad I'd like to start with the good and preface both by saying that I wanted to give this 5 out of 5 stars but I'm struggling to give it 3 and what's silly is that all the problems are things that are easily fixable. 

Good:
1. Engaging primary story, and the side stories are fun and laced with humor. 
2. Gritty and unleashed dialogue 
3. Surprisingly fun to play. 
4. Co-op mode (playing with friends is a feature EVERY SINGLE GAME SHOULD HAVE)
5. Challenging difficulty levels that feel meaty and provide replay value
6. Thought provoking decisions at every corner

The Bad: 
1. The game is Laced with bugs. In some cases I had to reload a save 20 minutes prior because the game wouldn't let me progress. This really is a game that is in a BETA state. Much more testing was needed before being released to the public. Things like NPCs firing through concrete walls, visual errors, UI bugs, incorrect verbage in parts of the UI, it's playable and I wouldn't quite call it a train wreck but it's definitely at least a car crash. 
2. Character customization can often feel a bit tedious.  

If they would fix the bugs I imagine I would have given this game a 5 of 5 star review.

I am not running into many bugs at this time - there is a tremendous amount of content and quests, items and customization and almost 60 hours into the game I still have only scratched the surface of the main story plot. I am really enjoying my time in the game. But there's one thing that pi**es me the heck off! 

The fact that - unlike its prequel Wasteland 2 - you can no longer retrieve weapon and armor Mods from your gear. The impact of this 'small thing' ruins so much for me. It causes a constant shortage of mods while you permanently find new and better weapons to play with and that you want to switch over to but can't because - well - no mods ready. It automatically makes you feel bad for improving a weapon or armor with a mod. And as a direct result of this nonsense I am spending more time in the freakin' load screen stripping the same weapon over and over and over again hoping to get a useful mod than actually playing the game now. Right now I am literally sitting here re-loading the same quick save for 2 hours straight to get a mod back I used in my previous sniper that I would like to replace with a newer better one.

Not only does it make absolutely ZERO sense that I can mod a scope, grip or tac-light to a weapon but somehow cannot remove it again. Its also missing out on a great opportunity to make very attractive high level skill-perks for wepaon & armor modding. Why the heck is this not a level 8 or 9 Weapon / Armor Modder Skill Perk to learn? WHY? 

If I knew how to cheat those mods back into my inventory - I would gladly do it without feeling like I am cheating at all. Because it should be a perk or feature of the character development to get there. And by the way... The Load-Screens are unusually long in this game, too which makes it all the more horrible to try and work-around this.

Other than that - I can just say: I love playing the game - developing my characters and moving on always driven by the fun combat and the need to improve my party and see the plot evolve. But if I were the Devs... I'd quickly patch in the option to recover mods from gear by making this a high level perk.

well... now i have that fallout from my childhood dreams back.
Sweet!!
upd. aand 60 hours later I did complete the game. Pretty nice amount of fun for the price, if you ask me.
All in all the game is loads of fun. And has plenty of skill checks. And weapons. and weird things. And funny weird things.
Only had one bug. And one freeze.
loading times are pretty fast in the begging and veeeery long after the second half of the game (installed on SSD). Also the game is veeeery poorly optimised. Grafics wise it is not super duper advanced and I have no idea why it runs only at 5-60 fps (those 5 fps parts are rare yet they DO happen) instead of 144 I was expecting. Kinda meh. 
And the balance is ... not stellar either. On normal difficulty most combats went in one of two ways (at later part of the game).
1) I initiate the combat with aoe shotgun blast that kills 2-4 enemies. then clear out most of them upon combat start (turn 1). Most of the firghts ended by the end of turn two.
2) enemies initiate the combat (either my mistake of story based interractions). this was valid for scar collectors. bam bam. 2-3 dead rangers. others are heavily damaged. Then I proceed with rezzing people. And my cats / goats etc kill enemies >_<. Like seriously...4k HP goat that hits for 200-300 hp. EEevvvil. 
And again - this is on normal difficulty. In some cases I literaly had no chance to make any move and had half the team dead.
the rest of situations - most of the bad guys were killed before they had any chance to act.

Pros:
Good story
Great voicework
Impactful choices
Excellent character creation
Good Combat

Cons:
The load times sweet JESUS the load times
Few coding issues that caused the game to get bogged down despite my GPU/CPU not getting over 50%
Minor bugs that would result in needing to restart the game. 
2 achievements are as of yet unobtainable. 

Thoughts: You could buy this game now, but you might run into some issues, nothing gamebreaking but slightly annoying. Not enough to put me off from 2 playthroughs obviously, but it might be better to wait a bit until another patch or two has been released. 

To the devs in the off chance they read this. 2 minor things that would VASTLY improve the game. 
1. Put a ranger stash in like in WL2 so we can dump collected items that we don't want cluttering the inventory, but don't want to sell to a vendor. 
2. For the love of all that's holy, give an option to travel straight to the world map from any zone exit.. Having to cross through multiple load points just to get to the world map is just painful.

- After playing for a time between 20 min to 1 hour game starts to struggle with memory leak that causes game to drop to 5 fps and after you have to restart the game. not even gonna mention have many problems this issue has made other than me restarting the game.

- UI is not complete, stuttering and shallow. if you played sniper elite 4 or divinity 2 you know what i mean. these 2 games i have mentioned has the best UI. when you click something you dont wait there is even smooth transition on sniper elite 4 its great. but in this game its very clunky and there are categorized tabs on items menu that doesnt show specific types of items. for example books that can be read to gain skill levels doesnt show in any of those categorized filter which you are forced to scroll down all of your shit to find it.

- graphics are out of date like 7 - 8 years. its definitly not looking like this game is released in 2020 yet there are huge performance problems. game needs huge amount of optimization because right now it feels like they just got free asset from x website and threw in there without even openinig it..

story is very linear and decisions you make in this game does not affect much. i mean only decision you make in this game is to kill or not to kill.. thats all what do you expect ?

item progression and unnecessary skill complexity;
- Weapon Modding
- Armor Modding
- Barter
These should be completely removed from the game or remove the required skill level for modding and fix the economy issue. Game allows you to recruit as many rangers as you like. this means i can recruit a ranger that has maxed weapon modding for only that purpose and re-recruit my fighting ranger again this feature makes these 3 skills unnecessary. only disadvantage is that everytime i want to do this i have to go back Ranger HQ.. its not fun.. just remove it.
Barter has 1 perk that gives you %5 chance to sell junk at 10x price. well lets just say i never had lesser money than 30k even tho i had every item x100 in my inventory i got all my items for free if you look at this way.

The game takes forever to start up. (and what feels like 5 minutes)
Highlighting certain objects and lockers or items pauses the game for at least 15 seconds. (you can move your mouse away the object to return to normal but does it again as soon you highlight back on).
Combat in turn is great with allies and enemy's (when you have simultaneous action off),  it stops for 5 seconds when going onto your turn and taking action takes another 5 seconds and then killing enemy it also pauses.
Going into speech the game pauses.
Loss of sound during pauses.

Other wise looking good I would certainly say this is now in alpha. Love the animation during talking scenes makes a great difference for an RPG

But i didnt buy a game in early access or alpha I bought a full price game lets hope i do get a refund because it was running smooth and ive passed the 2 hour mark.

I have 32gb/s of memory ram plus RTX 2080ti 2 terabytes of space on SSD's plenty to run this game.

Main issue is the strategy aspect, very one dimensional, completed the whole game without really doing anything else than running up and shooting. The perks were boring and didn't really add anything to the gameplay. The attributes were pretty much the same for all characters.
Plotwise it was boring as well, I don't really care who runs Colorado, didn't feel any stakes at all, Wasteland 2 was at least about Man VS Machine, that was a high stakes situation.
The driving around with the car and clicking two inches in front of the car every two seconds was a pain as well. Nothing happens other the occasional ambush, the scorpion thing was fun but that was just two times in the whole game.

Conclusion: Not a fun game, boring and bland.

(Please ignore my hours, I am a chronic walk-away-from-PC-randomly-for-a-day-without-closing-my-stuff'er)

Combat is fun and challenging, and I didn't feel as railroaded into certain builds as I felt in Wasteland 2. Story was great, and I did not encounter any bugs that were game breaking or un-ignorable, and I am not so obtuse as to not expect a few reloads and crashes in these types of games. (I did randomly lose my Bison pet? which was sad, he stood by my vehicle and wouldn't rejoin the party) I am not normally a fan of ""Frozen/Tundra"" etc type environments but this was easily my favorite iteration of that. 

As far as criticisms, I would say the balance feels a LITTLE off, near the end, when I realized how powerful animal whisperer was, the challenge disappeared. I also got like 100k off some random barter auctioneer proc and never had to worry about money again which like, IDK, felt like cheating in hindsight. 

With some data and a balance patch I think this will be a great game to come back to later and try for Supreme Jerk.",1600608661,1600608661,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042291677,252,4,10973,1,10972,1601082656,,

There are quite a few quality of life improvements that could be made IMO. The inventory system is crap. You can't write bio's for your PC's (something I enjoyed from 2). Crouching, overwatch (called ambush), and prepare (save 2 AP's) all have a separate pop-up button that's annoying to use. The game goes from dark and gritty to over-the-top clown humour so quickly it ruins the whole effect. Fallout was not a funny game but occasionally you would meet a whacky NPC or read a funny description of a weapon that made you smile. For example most of the merchant NPC's in Colorado Springs are incredibly obnoxious to speak to. The writing and voice-acting are painful for these and many other NPC's.

14,76278001,english,"The quick summary is that I really enjoyed this game despite the bugs and other annoyances.  I would recommend that you buy it, but hopefully wait a few months until most of the bugs are fixed.

The slightly longer version:

The good:

The story is really well done.  There are a lot of grey choices in which you really have no idea what the right choice is or what characters to even trust in the game.  This is a nice difference from other games where you are simply given the obviously good or obviously evil choices.  The characters definitely have real dimensions to them and it is rare to find someone who is just evil for the sake of evil.  Even the good guys have to do some evil things sometimes.

You can make up your own character builds for your squad and use your own tactics.  The turn based combat is well done.  There is also a large variety of loot to be found and quite a few places to explore.


The ‘meh’ part or things that could have been done better:

I didn’t care much for traveling around the world in a tuck.  It just seemed like a time waster and there isn’t much to find by exploring.  There are a  lot of points of interest, but these become mapped for you when you have a quest for them.  Overall traveling around just bogs you down with random encounters which are not particularly interesting, although they do give you some XP and loot.  I personally would have avoided them all if I could.

There are these kinds of companion followers you can’t control.  Like tamed pets or other NPCs that just join your group.  Because you can’t control them, you can’t stop them from doing stupid shit.  For example, you see some group of bad guys and so you decide to pull and set up your group some distance away from the enemies.  Maybe you want to use one character to pull the enemy group.  If that character has a pet or something following him, then that pet will engage and die.  You can’t tell the pet to stay put.

Shops do not upgrade their inventory as you level up.  Supposedly the ranger base shop does, but in my play through it never had any new gear. It only restocked ammo once in a while.  Maybe this is a bug.  Other shops also never upgraded their inventory. 

Quest reward loot is sub-par.  I do not think I was ever rewarded with a good item.  Every time I got something worse than what I already had.  One example of  this is that I got a briefcase early in the game that I was not supposed to open.  So I make it to the end game, and then this odd npc shows up and asks for the briefcase which then fabricates a set of armor for me, that was worse than the armor I was wearing. 

The bad:

Slow loading times.  I have an M2 drive, which is a super fast kind of SSD, but still this game could take a good while to load a level or quick save.

Bugs.  Lots of bugs.  Some that particularly annoyed me.
 Snipers have a skill called chain ambush which is an awesome skill, except that its bugged.  The idea is that when your sniper is in ambush mode (overwatch), if he kills a target, then he can shoot again, and this repeats until he is out of ammo or doesn’t kill a target.  The problem is the game can bug out and then gets stuck on the enemy turn and the only way out is to reload an old save.  Also if you take the perk, then you can no longer use overwatch again without risking this bug happening.
I had a doctor character and there are these medical darts he can throw.  They keep disappearing from his quick slots.  In fact, no matter what I put in his quick slots, when I go through a loading screen, his quick slots will be reset to a first aid kit, a frag grenade, and a wound treatment kit.
I can’t change my party order and have it stick.  I can re-order characters, but go through any loading screen and they are back in the original order.
There are a bunch of other bugs too, just minor annoyances though.

Overall, the game is good, so just wait for the t-day or winter sale, and maybe the bugs will be fixed.

17,76267120,english,"This game is good. It looks like X-Com in terms of combat and plays like a core RPG (think: Pillars of Eternity/Tyrant or Divinity: Original Sin II which it actually stole some ideas from) and does both excellently.

Firstly, the combat: In truth, I never like X-Com 2's style of combat, from it's dice rolling hit/miss system to its line of sight system which often seemed to work in unexpected ways. Wasteland 3 does it right. Single-fire pistols require a small amount of AP allowing gun slingers to move and fire multiple shots on the same turn. Automatic weapons fire multiple times so even a 30% hit chance with 10 bullets is still decent odds. The combat in general feels rewarding and smart with many strategic variations and serious consequences for bad decisions. It can feel unfair and punishing at times, and yet doable.

Characters are not locked into a specific class, you allocate skill points into different weapon types or combat skills. Any character can wield any weapon, but will face a penalty if they don't have, for example, enough ""Big Gun"" skill points. This makes the strategies one can derive from a pool of characters very wide as they can progress in very different ways than what the designers intended. 

Combat skills can tie into social and exploration, too. For example, ""Toaster repair"" (a surprisingly useful skill) can grant a perk boosting fire damage which a ""Big Guns"" character will benefit from since they can use flame throwers.

That was combat, now for story and writing: The main NPC protagonist or villain (depending on how you play) is a man calling himself ""the Patriarch"" who wields a giant hammer with an American flag wrapped around the shaft and an iron fist for the head. He literally rules with an iron fist! I knew pretty early on I'd like the writing and the voice overs a great, too. 

There is a lot of room for moral ambiguity where the player has to either decide what they think is the most politically convenient solution to a problem, or morally correct. In many ways, I feel that the tensions between politics and ethics are at the heart of Wasteland 3's themes and how you resolve this tension will guide you through the experience. There are numerous people and factions with interlocked relations to each other and nuanced decisions to make. Many of the people you meet will have ideas worth thinking about, life philosophies, religious doctrine, and a lot of referential humor.

This game has my highest recommendation, but I want to list a few of my complaints at the end. Loading screens are too long and too frequent. There appears to be a memory leak and after long sessions of play, the game can go from max graphical settings at 144pfs to just a handful in short order.

24,76258667,english,"This one is a mixed bag.  As a franchise, Wasteland 3 is probably the best they've made yet.  It certainly feels more like the original Fallout 1/2 than other recent titles I've played.  And while the production values are higher, the primary issues I experienced come from the writing.

Early on, you're told that you need to rescue some teenagers.  One of them is responsible for the deaths of everyone in the village.  He admits to his guilt, but shows no remorse for his actions.  So, after executing justice on the perpetrator, the remaining teenagers presume (falsely) that you're going to kill them too (you're not).  Problem is, because they didn't consider writing for this outcome (kill one, and not the rest) it is impossible to both execute justice, and not commit a crime by killing the rest of the teenagers.  You cannot talk your way out, or exit combat, or flee.  You are required to commit homicide on the remaining teenagers.

Later on, you're told that settlers in the plains are being hounded by gangs.  While the city does have defenses, these refugees are being turned away due to a fear over insufficient space and food.  In response to this, some people are helping to smuggle these refugees into the city.  You are told ""you can deal with this how you see fit"", and you might assume that means ""kill the gangs so that the refugees can return to their homes""... but no.  In fact, there is only one solution the game was written to accept: kill the people helping the refugees.

""Perhaps I'll just talk to these smugglers and convince them to stop"" you wonder.  Alas, you get one warning before crossing a bridge that if you cross it, they'll open fire... and they will fire.

""Well then, I can afford to ignore this quest"" right?  Mostly wrong; they don't unlock the radiation protection for your vehicle until after you commit this genocide, and you absolutely [i]need[/i] that protection if you're going to wipe out the plains gangs.  After doing some reading online, I found that there is an energy facility up north which had a level 3 radiation shield... if you could somehow make your way through severe radiation.  It was a feat I managed by having stacks of food (which instantly heal your character to 100%) available for my one character driving (the rest of the party were knocked-out/dead for the trip).  Despite this solution, there are a number of other nice ""upgrades"" that you'll never get to see for your vehicle because the genocide mission also unlocks the rest of your garage mechanics.

Near the end, you're told you need to either get in the good graces with the other gangs so that they fight with you, or simply incite a civil war between them because there are too many of them to face alone.  They also have a slave pen with (and I quote"") ""a few hundred slaves"", except this misrepresentation of scale pervades the game.  There are visibly only about 12 slaves; likewise, all of the gangs are probably only about 60 units (or 10 separate firefights).  Why in the world would I align myself with the plains gangs when they're so easy to kill with a party of 6?

Finally, when facing your nemesis at the end, you are told that if you kill him, the plains gangs will no longer be held at bay and [b]you[/b] will be the cause for the suffering of the people.  Apparently he missed the memo where you wiped out all of the gangs, and brought permanent peace to Colorado.

This game felt.... oddly short.  For $60, I felt like I got a $25 worth of value.  Upgrades came popping out left and right faster than I could make use of them.  Some mechanics seemed sketched into the framework of the gameplay, but never fully hashed out.

Whatever happened to the refugees you were protecting in your base?  Why weren't you given an option to expand the facilities, or find a new home for them?

What happened to the people you get to imprison.  You're told you have a brig, and people go there, but nothing happens after that.

What was beyond the basement door of your HQ?  It never opens.

Early on, you're told ""oh, you gotta keep room in your party for extra companions you'll find!""  And yet, there were only about 5.  I went through a large stretch of the game with a party of 5 just [i]waiting[/i] for this mysterious abundance of companions you had to leave room open for, but to no avail.

It seems to suffer from a lack of balance.  Especially early on, money was extremely hard to come by.  You're selling things for 5% of their value, and after fully upgrading barter skill, that goes up 500%... or a 5x increase over your base sale price; literally 25% of its original value.  No one tells you that getting the Antiques Appraiser perk is absolutely required and has the potential of netting as much as $10,000 for one random junk item.  Conceptually, these are going to some auction where ""one man's junk is another man's treasure"", but this lottery approach to managing your revenue is just... gross, annoying, and unadvertised.

Beyond all of this, the overall atmosphere of the game was taxing.  It is never sunny.  There is no greenery. Most people are foul-mouthed.  There are almost no likable characters to be found.  The one I liked the most ended up accusing me of being evil, and is immediately murdered by your companions before the final fight.

The soundtrack features a number of Christian hymns sung in the darkest, out-of-context way imaginable.  They portray Ronald Reagan as a communist maniac.  I really can't take most of the messages in the game seriously due to its ridiculous nature.  At one point you listen to a tape recording of kids speculating what it was like to live before the bombs ""it was impossible to stay in direct sunlight, it'd kill you!"" and (my favorite) ""everyone knows you can't drink pure water; you gotta dilute it with some uranium dust before you can drink it"".  So, how self-aware are they at the misrepresentation of morals/behaviors/values if this kind content is lumped in?  Does it even matter if you don't enjoy the experience in the end?

Sigh... and that's the problem.  It was ""well done"", but I didn't enjoy it.

The Devs are constantly fixing things and updating things so I think as time goes on it can only get better.
_________________________________________________________________________
-We also identified the reason why quests can disappear / progress can be reset: this can happen if the host participates in the dialogue with the NPC, and the second player did not enter this dialogue. Then, after the end of the dialogue, with some probability (we have about 20%) all quests disappear in the host's log.

-This happened to us in conversations with different NPCs, in different locations. We have not identified any specific sequence here.
Now we always ""talk"" together =)

-As our team continues to investigate the various issues reported in co-op (and singleplayer), please be aware that one suggested workaround which has reportedly been helping players has been to disable the autosave feature. Saves will continue to happen with scene transitions (when your party moves to a new area), but they will not happen as frequently. As such, we recommend making sure that if you set autosaves to 'off' that you are mindful of saving manually throughout the course of your game.

Original Review:
___________________________________________________________________________
First off, game is really really fun.

Some things to note
_______________
-I only played in co-op mode
-Ranger difficulty

As far as I know single player has no issues

Good points++
_______________
+Amazing story and choices matter
+Very in depth weapons customization
+Great player customization in terms of skills and abilities
+Graphics are nice, some are better than others
+Able to play Co-Op  Big +++

Bad Points
______________
-LOADING SCREENS FOR DAYS (even on an ssd)
-Unoptimized
 -Fps varies significantly one moment I am at 70fps next I am at 40fps, although I do only have a gtx 970 and 6 core 4.4ghz CPU
 -Heavy lag in menus, precision strike mode, pressing shift
-MAJOR GAME BREAKING BUGS IN CO-OP
 -Many Many times we had to reload back to previous saves because the game took all out money and removed all our quests and reputation
-More auto save slots, please please make this a thing, Divinity Original Sin 2 did this really well

Minor things I didn't like
______________
-Wish I could swap out weapon and gear mods, I really dislike how they are destroyed if you want to swap them out
-Co-op voice options right now it is just defaulted to on


Final Thoughts
____________
The story and character are great, voice acting is pretty decent too.  I never played the original 2 games, but I loved fallout New Vegas and DOS2 and this game fits right in with them.  Once they fix the game breaking bugs I would highly recommend this game, but in they state I cannot justify $60 for a broken product.

I really hope they can fix them soon so that I can finish it before Cyberpunk comes out.

I had hopes of co-op after i beat it a few times... no friends of mine should buy this game (until it works). 



---- some spoilers below -----






- my companions are stuck in a loop - any battle i do (mutants, robots, frogs etc) ends with them being disgusted and leaving.. i'm late in the game here... this is the most egregious of issues because it's unwarranted. i'm getting attacked while driving the tank in the world map and there are no civilians out there.  
- fishlips doesn't work for me, even after the patch.
- way too many missions where you can walk into the location before doing the prerequisite missions. 
- battle bugs - at the start of the battle, 2 of my characters magically moved through the walls and outside the building quite a distance from my core group, and were immediately surrounded and killed , 
- there are +18 pages on a forum of public submitted bugs 
- google for the pc-bug-forum and you'll see..... it's dramatic. 

 if you remove a companion at HQ to swap for a different person, that companion loses all skill tree perks (and gear vanishes) and they revert to their skill set at the initial introduction with them  -_-   that's a waste of time . Jodie isn't a ranger, even though she journeyed with the rangers. she's a companion. 

 you have to play missions short-handed unless you google for spoilers to figure out which missions yield a character. If you don't have room in your squad, they can't join. It should be allowed to send ppl to HQ to join later, since you can swap rangers at HQ, and HQ is a well known location adjacent to a big town. It's stupid.  

the story line and gritty comedy was completely degraded compared to wl2. it's not part of the 'core' of the game. that grittiness is reserved for those who search, but should be front and center. 

sound track DON'T BUY - who really wants to listen to the monster mash? that should be playing on juke-box or something so the gamer can turn it off. everybody have fun & wang chun? C'MON! where's an original song? Everything else is a rehash of terribly cliche and over-played music.... or religious hymns .... the hymns were well placed but are also repetitive. Takeaway: everyone can rebuild society but can't write a new song? 

there are _some_ pros: 
- there's no more 'chance or odds' in opening safes/lockpicking etc , if you have the level, it opens. 
- the battles (when there's no bugs) don't allow you to save between turns like xcom does, so i like that - makes it harder , and if you see a 90% chance to hit, it's a real 90%, not like xcom. so that's good too. can't save, but, the percentages are real. 
- able to have 3 quick-saves so you can accommodate the bugs 
- major Tom Cat - looking forward to Mods to include cat trees and allow you to leave 'major' at the HQ to be safe at home. 
-.... that's all folks. 

if you play as 'bad rangers' and kill everyone, then i think you can probably finish the game. but. don't go explore and enjoy...bc that just triggers bugs and you lose your progression with companions or you'll just get stuck.

[b]Wasteland 3[/b] (WL3) is the third installment of an iconic series spanning more than three decades, with WL1 released back in 1988. In this direct sequel to WL2, players once again impersonate a team of Arizona Rangers: this time around they're sent to Colorado to secure a vital supply contract with the Patriarch, the current Head of State. This dangerous mission in uncharted territory becomes even more arduous, after they are ambushed. From there, Rangers will have to struggle and seek allies in their perilous quest to save both Colorado and Arizona from looming dangers.

🟩 [b]The Good Side[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Cries of a Broken World[/b]
This third entry does not disappoint about writing and roleplaying variety, quality. The Colorado wastes are home to the most varied situations and individuals: ruthless cannibal gangs, radioactive monstrosities, cultists, ancient technology... all this and much more awaits. Every location is peppered with dialogues, challenges and skill checks waiting to be discovered, they often have more than one way to be resolved. The way in which you decide to handle a situation will have meaningful consequences on the world, your companions and faction reputations. 

[*][b]A Truckload of Pathos[/b]
WL3 does succeed in creating atmospheric, detailed location and situations consistently. Each place you'll visit has its own identity, the same goes for factions and NPCs, each with their own ideals that are markedly reflected in all their actions, even in combat. The soundtrack is extraordinary, uses perfectly fitting songs at the right moment, to bring a whole new level of emphasis when needed. Voice acting, sounds and effects are all of good quality, dialogues fully voiced as well. 

[*][b]Crossroads of Destiny[/b]
There is no way to experience all content in a single playthrough. Many choices will be drastic, and lead to markedly different situations or quest objectives. Furthermore, the amount of build possibilities is simply too great to fit in a single run. This fact dramatically improves replay value with multiple endings and faction-specific questlines that often mutually exclude each other. Only the most dedicated will see everything the game has to offer.

[*][b]Tooth and Nail[/b]
Battles in WL3 are always dangerous and enjoyable. Unlike many other RPGs, enemies are and stay dangerous throughout the whole game - even the most experienced Ranger can be taken down after a careless move by your part. The game balance in this aspect is good, as it keeps up the challenge. The gameplay offers numerous good additions compared to its predecessor, though some will not be liked by veterans of the genre.

🟥 [b]The Bad Side[/b]
[list]
[*][b]A Mountain of Bugs[/b]
At this time, WL3 is plagued by severe technical issues, ranging from random FPS drops, crashes to game-breaking bugs, interface glitches and quest breaking. There really is a huge amount of issues ranging from minor to serious. In my playthrough i did have some game-breaking bugs, luckily backup saves were there. This is not a state a 60€ game should be released into. These problems severely worsen the experience.

[*][b]Earth calling Balance. You there Balance?[/b]
There are major issues with ability, attribute and weapons balance across the board. Some weapon classes result underpowered, not convenient to use compared to others, while certain consumables, combat utilities and passive perks create insanely potent combinations. All these factors spiral into extremely broken builds and cheese fests, that can make encounters more trivial or break the game altogether in some cases. A major balance overhaul is needed for combat and skill progression alike.
[/list]

[i]It took me around 48 hours to complete a playthrough on Ranger (Hard) difficulty, while doing all the side quests and optional things I could find. For the price of 60€ and very good quality, I'd say the game is worth the money BUT only after several bug-fixing and balance patches, [u]I suggest waiting for fixes before buying.[/u][/i]

[h1]In-Depth Breakdown[/h1]
🎮 [b]Gameplay Analysis[/b]
Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Combat and Character Management.

[b]Exploration[/b]
Plays out on foot in most locations, having one or multiple party members move wherever you click. Each location of the world has many secrets, containers and skill checks, testing the abilities of your squad, from bomb defusal to lockpicking, hacking or diplomacy. Having a varied team of specialists is fundamental to take on a wide variety of situations. Locations often have NPCs and Enemies roaming around, many giving quests or local tasks for rewards.

World exploration is done using a vehicle, has random encounters that can be avoided with the proper skills, and also its own secrets such as Roaming Traders, Hidden Bunkers and Secondary Locations. Most areas at first will be walled off by Radiation, and only after unlocking the proper protection you will be able to pass. Radio communications in the background constantly chatter.

[b]Combat[/b]
Plays out in a turn-based fashion, though you can select any of your Rangers at any time, and they will use Action Points both to move and attack. Each weapon has different special abilities, some unique, that integrate with specialization into a particular weapon type (Melee, Sniper, Small Arms...) - while also sub-classes of the same category, like Semi Auto and Revolver pistols. The introduction of Strike Skills, charging up after dealing damage, is a good novelty and gives more variety.

Combat uses a cover system as well, most being also destructible. Vehicles also join the fight in some cases and result extremely overpowered on both sides. Enemies are challenging and competent, though the amount of cheese builds and broken balance can seriously throw proper combat feel in the trash sometimes. Enemy variety is very good, as is weapons and equipment.

[b]Character Management[/b]
Is done in a series of menus where you can upgrade your squad, assign skill points, and equip them with gear best suited for their role. Many unique and legendary pieces of equipment are out there, while modding allows improving all weapons past their original limits. Progression is satisfying and includes many Perks for each discipline, attributes and skills to unlock. Some attributes however are much more useful than others, and this further creates unbalance with min-maxed builds.

I would recommend to buy it only if you are interested mostly in RPG and story-telling aspects but not so if you are here for turn-based tactics.[list][/list][list][/list]First PROs:[list][/list]- The non-linear storytelling is one of the best I have ever seen in games. There are non-trivial choices everywhere and different options to pass the same quests.[list][/list]- RPG system is really good, lots of attributes, skills, perks, and most of them matter. Also less important skills cost less skill points, which makes total sense. Good variety of weapons and instruments as well.[list][/list][list][/list]Then CONs:[list][/list]- NPC AI is terrible. It is just unbelievably bad for a year 2020. All enemies behave in the same way, and they either zerg-rush to your location or just sit there and shoot. AOE effects are totaly ignored, any NPC will mindlessly run into fire including your pet animals. Enemies never use ambush but always get trapped into yours. Many smaller games has better AI, for instance Mutant Year Zero.[list][/list]- I expected a lot of fights with robots, at least not less then I had in W2, but they are practically not existing. Robots were like 5% of enemies in my playthrough, and most of them were either weak or easily stunned.[list][/list]- And there were 0 (ZERO) vehicles or synth enemies, even though they are listed as possible enemies in weapons stats. Particularly vehicles are a huge wasted opportunity. They are a nice addition to the game, but your own vehicle is OP and I have never seen any other vehicle on the road.[list][/list]- Shops' inventories are leveled in a weird way, which is very limiting. You can't see better items and so you buy some trash, then instantly better items appear and you regret it. But you can't sell it back as they propose you just a few bucks in return. Even leveling Barter doesn't help much.[list][/list]- Covers system is weird, even slight height gives enormous advantage and covers are practically ignored for shots from above, even when characters are standing behind a wall. Enemies are not using it purposely (because of dumb AI) and this doesn't make a game any harder, it rather feels like cheating in some areas.[list][/list]- I expected some epic and challenging fights in the end, but it was the opposite - short and easy. They have added ""epicness"" by simple adding more dumb AI-controlled fighters on both sides to watch. Really? I couldn't believe my eyes. [spoiler]Even fighting Patriarch himself was a joke, so easily beatable.[/spoiler][list][/list]- There is a communism propaganda in this game. When you are making a game about choices you are not supposed to take sides. But not here. Everything related to communism and Soviet Union is smart, positive and friendly, not a single joke about this topic, unlike any other. But it wasn't enough and they included cosmetics item with a Soviet Union-emblem. Seriously? You wouldn't do it for Nazi symbolic, would you? But for Soviets which also killed millions of people this is suddenly ok?[list][/list][list][/list]I am not even mentioning bugs, slow loading times etc... Technical issues can be fixed or worked around. But bad design choices and dumb AI will remain.[list][/list][list][/list]I would give it 6/10 just for the looks and storytelling.

Unfortunately not.

- First of all: it's INCREDIBLY buggy. I've played for 12 hours so far and had about 5 game breaking bugs requiring a reload
- Which brings us to: load times. I'm not sure how loading an area with 5 rooms can take a minute on an SSD, but it does
- Then there's the camera, which is REALLY ZOOMED IN, even at its most zoomed-out
- And everything is blue and black, really boring. Makes me miss the desert
- Then there's the fact that loading saves doesn't even remember your squad's positions
- And the fact that sometimes it just stops responding to input

Full thoughts:
Wasteland 3 is an absolute masterpiece of an RPG and is very easy to find yourself lost in with fun and challenging combat mixed with well written characters and interesting dialogue choices. If you're a fan of the classic Fallout games but more importantly RPGs as a genre this game is a have. My favorite part of this game is that for the most part there is no right answer with who you choose to side with and what you decide to do within Colorado. All your options have significant impact on how the world changes even before the end game and its refreshing to play a game where your environment changes with your choices. One final take away you should know is that in true CRPG fashion this game has some stiff difficulty especially if you want to play on supreme jerk difficulty. The game rewards being smart with combat and you will often feel at a disadvantage in combat unless you can use your wits to get a leg up on your opponent before combat starts. 

What holds the game back:
I really wanted to give this game a 10/10 but couldn't bring myself to do it as there are some major technical issues plaguing this game. First and foremost I have heard that the co-op is filled with bugs that kill mission completion and can potentially crash the game. While I haven't experienced the co-op myself I would definitely take this into mind if you are considering playing through with a friend. Next, load times within this game slowly became an issue as load screen can take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute consistently regardless of how well of a machine you are playing on. This slowed down and already long game and at times where I had to switch through 3-4 loading zones quickly I became frustrated with how long this was taking. Missions can become bugged out easily it seems I had a mission bug and would have left the mission incomplete forever if I hadn't quicksaved directly before the mission. I cannot emphasis enough how important it is to save often with a mixture of hard saves and quicksaves. I tried to make it a habit to hard save anytime I was in Ranger HQ.

Closing Remarks: All in all I love this game, I bought it full price and feel that I got value beyond what I paid for this game. I just finished my first playthrough and i'm already getting ready to start a second run. This game is addictive and has deeply immersive story telling which will get you hooked within the first 30 minutes of playing. If you love RPGs you owe it to yourself to pick up Wasteland 3.",1600436919,1600436919,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198060506862,117,3,3628,36,3212,1600910803,,

Of course there are some non-likeable bugs, huge map loading times, sometimes retarded group AI (e.g. running into mines or through a fire for no reason), etc., which don’t impact the game fun too much. 

What I don’t like about W3 are some bad solutions or the lack of thinking things through, intended or not.I’m not referring to the three endings, of which I like none, but most exemplary to the Denver oil fields solutions. 

Spoiler-Warning!!! 

You have three options, to leave Denver to the Reagan fascists (Dippers), to give it to the crazy fanatics (Godfishers), or to the cannibals (Hard heads). The first option is the least bad I guess, but disables a good solution for the robot community, the third seems to be okay with the robots, but ewwww… cannibals, no way!However, if you kill all three factions, Denver will remain empty and no more oil is produced and delivered. But why was the most obvious and logical solution left out? There is a huge refugee problem in Colorado City and on the other hand we have an emptied Denver with nice oil fields. To obvious for lazy script writers or did they intend to leave us with 3 bad options here? Why not offer the refugees to live and work in Denver at the oil fields and let them be guarded either by a Ranger outpost, Marshall outpost or even Monster army outpost? At least the first one would also allow useful cooperation with the robot community.Also, this way we would remove the refugees from our base (or in my case, the brig) and could get Mama Cotter over there. So, this is quite unsatisfying...

Combat. Want to get a jump on someone from outside the zone they can detect you? Nope. The Boss will have dialogue with you which will result in combat.

More on combat. And if you carry on with combat, all characters may possibly start to uncontrollably snap to combat and humping the walls, air, comrades, and enemies alike. The camera will keep shake, an annoying noise will keep playing, and you may lose your mind.

Saves. Six save slots for a buggy game. This I assume is to prevent save scumming or undoing choices by loading prior saves. You'll be doing this anyways.

Most Annoying Bugs:

Squad manager is broken.  Moving your mains in and out of squad with either give them free points or make points negative.  Holy shit! Move character out of squad, confirm. Go back to squad manger move back your member into squad.  Magic!

Clicking bugs using mouse or controller. Sometimes you will not be able to click things or your UI will disappear.  Also some weird bug where your weapon placement randomly switches (primary and secondary). I think this happens when you dont have enough ammo to fully reload a clip.

Quest bugs.   For example, in Denver I killed all 4 camps (maybe 3 camps) of the crazy kite people.  Game would only register 2/3.  Broken.

Provost glitching.  This guy follows you around.  Sometimes he gets stuck then just reappears in battle.  Can't tell if he died or just glitched somewhere.  Same with pets. Holy shit.  Charm a pet, un-charm him.  He will stay there until you charm him again.  Right... Save game. Reload, Pet disappears.

Wasteland 3 had huge boots to fill coming after the success of wasteland 2 and I feel it doesn't so much as fill them as just kind float around inside one of them.

Objectively, wasteland 3 isn't a bad game at all, but it is a huge step down from wasteland 2.

Combat is your standard xcom, turn-based style combat, pretty fun and easy enough to understand. 
The graphics are pretty, a significant upgrade from wl2, but honestly thats about where it ends.

The game starts of solid, a clearly defined path and objective, you must arrest/kill the patriachs 3 children, in order to get to a point where you are capable of pulling this off, you need to essentially go round the world doing different tasks until you are strong enough.

It then begins to pitter off, the game starts to become stale, throughout my whole playthrough, I only changed guns on each of my people twice, since weapon variety feels relatively small and you rarely find anything better than you're already using. Enemies become samey, and the biggest thing is areas really don't feel all that fleshed out, most areas are literally just, speech check, depending on outcome, have fight, leave, that is all.

It feels as though they have actually taken the complexity a huge step down from wl2, which is probably great for new players, but makes the game feel somewhat basic to returning players. It feels like if you swapped the graphics, this game should have been made BEFORE wl2.

As I said, the game itself isn't objectively bad, the areas/groups are relatively interesting, the story is decent and the combat is fun, it's just not as good as what i'd have hoped.

The game feels smaller than its predecessor, there are less areas, less enemies and less quests, there are really only a handful of optional areas to go through and most can be resolved in 15 minutes. 

I would recommend the game to new comers and perhaps some returning players as long as they understand it is a simplified version of the first game, even down to how combat happens, in wl2 everyone goes in a specific order, in wl3 you can move anyone in any order, making fights significantly easier, some of the perks are also, quite frankly, broken, they are incredibly overpowered, a level 10 sniper perk means that ambush (basically instead of attacking you can tell your unit to attack the first enemy that moves within range) happens infinite times as long as you kill the enemy, intelligence is still (imo) the most unbalanced stat, I gave everyone 10 intelligence as it meant I could easily max out every skill I needed as well as having high crit rates on all my rangers, barter is also, unbalanced as a skill, it makes you incredibly rich very quickly.

The game did have some not so insignificant teething issues at launch, with a whole host of bugs, some completely locking peoples game, annoying in most cases but in a game that you have put 30+ hours into feels a fair bit worse.

The devs have said that they are working to patch out the bugs, I would wait until everything is fixed and recommend it to fans of the genre",1600209017,1600209017,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198018656531,265,41,2388,0,2388,1600017149,,

A lot of this info is given to one when the game ends, and tells you what choices had which effects.

One would have imagined that she could have seen their flaws and would help make it a better place when building a new future. Best recommendation is to not only make 4 units for party, but simply make the extra 2, you will have less of those interesting ""world dialogues/interactions"" But you'd have much more control of skill checks for encounters, and some can be really big and very important.

I'm going to say that right out I loved the soundtrack for this game. From the first song that caught my attention all the way to the end. The covers were all well done and added to the flavor of the game.

I want to also compliment the story. I played through to two different ending and I can see where my choices had huge impacts on how things turned out. Often subverting expectations is hard to do, and do well, but the storytellers for Wasteland 3 are able to do so superbly.

18,76029674,english,"This review is specifically for co-op play.  I have not experienced a single player play through so it may be better.

As co-op it is a hard 5/10 right now.  Would be higher if not for lack of QOL, growing list of bugs, extensive loading screens and other horrible design choices.

The game is fun when it works.  Unfortunately, the game is a massively buggy mess that also lacks a lot of quality of life things that could simply make the game better without delving into the bugs and stuff.

Audio:
There is voice acting which is great, I'm not the best judge of voice acting but they sound alright to me.  The music sounds good too.  However, there are parts of the game where you use a radio or a cassette player to listen to tapes or to other folks calling you.  I have only been playing a few hours but half the time, either myself or my co-op partner will not be able to hear this radio.  We know it's playing because we can see it activate and we can (sometimes) see the text the NPCs will say but we occasionally can't hear it.

Crashing:
The game occasionally crashes.  There are two types of crashes.  One being that it crashes back to the main menu and the other crashes the entire game.  It crashes back to the main menu frequently, especially when we're loading into the game for the first time that day, say after work or something.  Often times, this type of crashing would KEEP happening until we both restart the game.  It also crashes whenever I try to exit the game to desktop, after our gaming session.  I would have to open task manager to manually end it there.  

Joining multiplayer:
Is a hassle considering you need to go to the ""Multiplayer"" option then to the lobby selection.  From there you have to host a game.  You cannot load a game and have your friend join.  You cannot simply ""start a new game"" and choose the multiplayer option.  This next one took us like an hour to figure out since it sounded the most straight forward.  You cannot go to the ""Multiplayer"" option and then go to ""Direct Connection.""  This last one implies you can just go directly to the lobby you want, if you know the IP address and game room.  Imagine needing the IP address to connect to a lobby in this day and age of gaming.  However, even if you know the IP address and the game room, no one can join because the game is set on private.  So you would need to do the first option which is ""Multiplayer"" > ""Lobby Browser"" > ""Host Game"" and invite your friend that way.

I don't really feel like talking about all the bugs and issues there are in the game that I've experienced.  It mostly feels like in my ~18 hours I have logged in this game, around 6 of those hours were trying to deal with bugs or the stupid hassle of joining multiplayer.  Thankfully, I have not yet experienced the actual game breaking bugs of deleted saves or deleted quests and stuff I have seen floating around.

If you are considering getting this game and getting it for co-op, I would recommend waiting probably a year or so to let them fix the bugs.  Hopefully they'll also add QOL things like the ability to ping a location or to let us make our movement key and ""cancel action"" key different.",1600191906,1600192114,False,2,0,0.527338087558746338,0,True,False,False,76561198120993434,74,4,5300,2559,1099,1602078005,,

Edit now that I've finished one EXTENSIVE play through on the hardest difficulty after about 65 hours of play time. 

I highly recommend the purchase. In it's current state you WILL see bugs if you do an extensive play through, but through those bugs you will experience a fantastic story that will take you through many different morally grey areas and have you questioning the path you take at every turn. You will as time goes on see so many opportunities where you could replay the game and make different decisions that have real impact. There is no clear cut good and evil, YOU play through trying to navigate what decisions you would make and hope that your plan for Colerado is what's best. 

Or... Maybe you're out for your own interests? The game has that covered too, you can make your way through making several decisions that will impact the world in a variety of ways and you may even see a lot of reward in doing some horrific things, and may see no reward in doing the ""just"" thing. That's the beauty of this game, nothing in life is black and white (especially in a post apocalypse)  and it has developers behind it that understand that. 

I'll end my review with this... The soundtrack. It's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game, it really sets the mood and during key battles when that soundtrack kicks in, it can really give you chills and get you pumped.

That said, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys CRPGs, especially if you're a fan of Fallout 2 or Wasteland 2.

I was not entirely happy with my ending slides and that's ok because it was a result of my choices throughout the game. 
 I did feel like some of my choices shouldn't have had certain outcomes.  That said, I can see what I could have done to get a different outcome.

Loading times can get a bit long, especially if you're a filthy save scummer like me.  Not unusual for compiled crpg save files but it can be annoying.

Several people have reported technical issues.  I played this on a 9900k/RTX 2080ti and didn't run into any major technical problems.  There were patches as I played so it's possible some of the major bugs were patched before I hit them.

The journey is worth the price tag.  The destination depends on what you're expecting and what choices you made.  Just remember, there is a lot of grey area in this game.

Combat is a lot of fun.
Plenty of choice in how to build each character.
Mostly great voice acting.

However, if you can wait until more patches come in, you should do so before buying the game. While the it is playable and finishable without MAJOR issues, there are still annoying bugs at the time of writing this review. 

What I liked most about WL3 was the story and the faction play. At the start of the game, the Arizona Rangers are still devastated after the events of WL2. They are offered help and resources by ""The Patriarch"" who rules over snowy Colorado. In turn, he asks them to get rid of his three children who are either gullible, insane or want to usurp him. 

In classic Wasteland/Fallout-fashion every character, every faction and every decision is completely void of black & white morality. You can attempt to be the good guy, sure, but you'll seldom feel really ""right"" about your choices. The game lets you shape the story with your alliances, decisions and actions and you will feel every consequence - this is a true cRPG and not just a glorified turn-based tactics game with an RPG overlay.

Gameplay-wise it's very similar to WL2; turn-based combat that resembles X-Com (now with environmental and elemental effects!), dialogues, character development, picking up loooots of loot, crafting to improve weapons and armor, and exploring the game world. You also have a vehicle to traverse and explore a world map and sometimes use in battle; it also needs to be upgraded since some areas are inaccessible due to radiation if you don't upgrade your chassis.

Your party will consist of at least two characters; you can either pick one of the suggested pairs at the start or create your chars from scratch. Soon, you'll have the option to pick and/or create another two characters, so that your main party consists of four chars. Additionally, you can add up to two NPC to your party who can be developed just like the others. But beware, these NPC characters might leave you if they are not ok with the decisions you make. 

Your party can grow even larger with certain story developments or skills (Animal Whisperer). By the ending, I had my party of six as well as a bear cub, a robot, a cyborg chicken and a bison, which of course was absolutely awesome. However, on more then one occasion my animal/robot friends chose to stand around and chill five meters away while the rest of my party was involved in deadly combat. Of course, they are more of a bonus, but the AI could certainly be improved here. 

The skill system is really deep and satisfying. There are attributes, skills and perks (the latter are unlocked by raising certain attributes and skills). You can read books to improve character skills and find ""Dolls"" in the world that have permanent benefits for the whole party.

I clocked in at around 50 hours on normal difficulty and was really OP by without doing much min-maxing. It certainly felt easier than WL2 but I can't speak for the harder difficulties.  If you can deal with long loading times, small AI issues, some slightly bugged quests and some glitches in the controls, you can get it now, but again, I would advise you to wait for the next updates. 

Aside from that, this is a great post-apocalyptic cRPG that every genre fan should play at some point.

34,76009835,english,"I will start by saying that I am openly subjective when it comes to reviewing this title as I am/was a die-hard fan of the original Fallout series.

I will not go into dissecting the game graphics wise. The isometric view I find more permissive when it comes to pixel peeping. I will just post post my impressions from a user perspective.

First of all THE BAD:
- long loading times
- occasional lagging - contextually driven, and not because of poor hardware resources
(an example: In ranger HQ, whenever I try to approach and talk to the mercenary leader, things slow down horribly, for what? a dialog box...)
- a had a couple of CTD's - actually only one CTD, the game eventually un-froze by itself after 5 minutes of staring at the screen :)
- graphical glitches (like invisible traps, trip wires, etc)
- a bit shorter that I expected - not that content and depth is lacking, compared to other titles
- and yes, although complex, it seems at the same time somehow shallow and rushed into deployment -  as I understand they will expand the story via DLCs, still...


THE GOOD:
- beautiful soundtrack - it reminded me somehow of the impact Fallout 3's soundtrack had on me 12 years ago, although it is in a different style.
- simplified inventory management (I spent days in Wasteland 2 carrying/ hiding/ redistributing gear across the wasteland :) )
- interesting perk system, including some ""hidden/archive"" bonuses
- Great character customisation 
- re-playability - I payed the good guy (team) this round. I'm still thinking what role to assume during my next run

- an assortment of east-european cars from before 1989 - I properly identified Gaz trucks, the Lada 1200, Moskwitch 2140, a Volga - all soviet vehicles.  And the cherry on top - the Dacia 1300 from Romania; now what these cars are doing in the frozen wastelands of Colorado, only the devs that put them there know... :)

- ah, and did I say the soundtrack rocks? literally

I fully enjoyed the game. The glitches and bugs didn't overall break the gaming experience for me.

38,76007193,english,"The long awaited continuation of the saga. Wasteland 3 is a worthy successor of the series.

Story is really interesting with a lot of planning that you have to do, a lot of variables to consider. The main reason for this is the Patriarch, an amazing character that kept me guessing my choices until the very last minute of the game. What i didn't like was that most of the factions are pretty evil and you don't really care on what happens to them, not to mention that they are all just crazy murderers/cannibals/psychos and while they all wear different attire in the end they come as the same the only gang that was actually interesting and unusual were the ""Breathers"" that i really-really liked, yes they were mad maniacs but they had a very interesting explanation to why they do it and not just 'because they are crazy evil raiders'. Characters are also not too deep in comparison to the second game where both factions and characters and factions were better written, with a few exceptions  of course.  The choices you make are hard and you see very real consequences of them, you rarely like the choices you have, but you have to make them, that aspect was amazing, as expected of a Wasteland game. Writing in general is really good, dialogues are well written and quests are interesting.

Another thing I didn't like that much was a general tone of the game, it's a lot more wacky, over the top than the second game that was a lot more grounded and serious. I liked the seriousness of the second one a lot more and while this game gets better in the late game it still was a bit off for me. I would'v liked if the game took itself more seriously.

Gameplay is similar to previous title but in my experience less tactical, armour does barely anything, you die in 1-2 shots, skills were simplified and talents got a lot less interesting. I was able to pretty much much power through everything in my way almost all the time on the second highest difficulty. Gameplay is solid but nothing special.

Soundtrack is really good. From ambient music to combat music it is all good but nothing special. Where the OST shines are the certain encounters and situations where you will hear some of the best songs in videogames. Mostly covers of old songs but they are a billion times better than originals  and really set the tone for the situation you are in, whoever made those is a genius, those moment will be stuck in my head for a long time, amazing stuff.

Bugs... this is a major concern, bug are everywhere, on every step, on every turn, from massive performance drops to me finding bodies with description 'the 'X' you tried to save' when I never tried to save any 'X'. This will be fixed of course but for now bugs do impact the enjoyment of the game quite a bit.

Also loading times, they are really, really long I just alt+tab every time there was a loading screen, which happened a lot as you have to travel to different locations a lot.

The length of the game is on the shorter side for the genre, it took me 57 hours to finish every side-quest I found and the main story (+ long loading screens), I would have liked if it was longer than that. 


Overall this is an awesome game, that delivers the Wasteland experience, albeit a bit differently that what I was expecting after the Wasteland 2 but I still enjoyed it very much and will definitely replay it at some point. I recommend this to all CRPG fans that play them for the story. I will be waiting for Wasteland 4 for sure. This is one of my favourite franchises.

I've been in love with the Wasteland saga for many years and I still think the episode 2 is the better one, way above all the others. This “chapter 3” is for sure a well expansion to the main story but the feeling you get while playing is of a cartoonish one, not a real Wasteland game. It doesn’t succeed in sucking you into the story. I recommend to get it and play it with full price only if you are a huge fan of the series, otherwise wait for a price drop and discount.

- Too many bugs for a 60 EUR game, and game breaking ones.
- Terrible User Interface that feels like torture. There's a max of 3 skills you can use, why have them in a hover button and not 3 directly accessible ones? it's not like there is no space in today's screens
- Inventory sucks, too bored to create a filter for utility items and sub-filters for weapons?
- Why can't I open the map, click where I want the camera to go, and then right-click to go there like in every isometric game?
- Why can't I arrange the order I see my rangers and save that order? I mean you can but it is lost every time you reload or go to a different location
- Why can't you move the vehicle after combat? or have it move to it's original location on it's own at the very least.
- The game is small, I guess DLCs are planned, or some enhanced edition which sucks big time
- Loading screens take forever, performance degrades over time and again lots of bugs. Can't mama Microsoft lend some talent to take care of these asap?

Beat the game now that the bug where you lose all your progress is gone. However, the progress through co-op was still marred by a number of bugs and potential bad design decisions that soured the playthrough. The story was short, and fairly good, but dealing with bugs every 5 minutes and 1 minute long loading screens every 3 minutes sours the taste of playing this game. I would have been just as happy had I been able to refund this buggy game at the 4 hour mark as playing through this game.

Overall Time to Beat 55 hours Completionist for 1 playthrough (I'd say 5 hours lost to bugs, another 5 to loading screens, and 5 afk hours)

- Decent Gameplay, Not as complex with alternate fire rates and gun complexity as other Wastelands, but it's faithful to the series.
- Good Soundtrack
- Awful bugs, especially for coop
- Good graphics for top down combat

Overall, I think the game could have been an 7.5/10 without the bugs, but with them, its a 5.5/10. If you want to play this with a friend, make sure the dev's patch ALL the coop bugs before doing so.

---------------------- Original Review --------------------------

Coop (and possibly the entire game) is completely unplayable right now.

I want to like the game, as a fan of the other Wasteland series, but like the other Wasteland games this fails the most basic QA testing possible, especially for the coop mode. Simply put, the game is extremely buggy right now.

Examples of bugs we've hit in 3 hours of coop mode:

Clearing the Colorado Springs map, leaving the map, and coming back to see all the progress reset
Losing all quest logs
Other player can't interact with map until you restart the game
First player loses first turn when the second player initiates combat via dialogue
Starting combat near a door sometimes pushes you into the door and you can't move anymore

And all this happened within the last two hours. Story alone, from what we've seen, is passable (except we haven't been able to see much with these bugs). Overall, wait on purchasing this until the bugs are fixed (and if).",1598672783,1600148333,False,20,1,0.540534317493438721,0,True,False,False,76561198001609042,276,6,3209,0,262,1600147688,,

49,75793028,english,"I've only played for 40 hours so far and the game, despite being a bit clunky with longer than 'normal' load times, is a great game. Sometimes the game doesn't transition smoothly or when panning it lags a bit, but despite this I can get over the fact that it's got a few quirks. I initially had the game as recommended, and would say anyone who loves Fallout/Xcom should give it a shot, as I haven't heard of Wasteland prior to Wasteland 3. 

As of right now I would NOT recommend anyone buy this game until it gets a few more patches. I just got to the area where you are supposed to meet up with Liberty and was going to get off for the night. Game was saved as normal through 10 minute autosaves as well as a quicksave I always make prior to getting off. As I hop on to play the next day my ""continue"" save on the main menu loads me into an immediate screen shake, with game over. Weird. So I load my most recent quick save, same thing. All of the save files I have in the game, no matter the location result in a Game Over. So as of right now 40 hours wasted, which sucks because I really enjoyed the gameplay. 

I haven't seen any others with this bug so I'm not sure of a fix. I've tried some fixes that others mentioned with somewhat similar issues to no avail. At this point I have no desire to start over because I don't want to waste my time when this issue arises again.",1599827815,1600142087,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198043506606,134,5,2405,0,1544,1600308524,,
50,75685344,english,"I would love to recommend this game as it really has so much potential, unfortunately I cannot as it is simply a bug ridden mess in which nothing works properly at all. 

The biggest issue for me is the use of player created characters which are so bugged as to be unusable. 
At present the skill points per level are not working and if you swap any player created out at all then when you get them back they have been reset to have the stats of a level one character, but at their original level. 
This would not be a problem if the pre-generated characters were not deliberately badly optimised, as to be useless on anything other then the easiest difficulty.   

Combine this with long load times and endless crashes to desktop and you have an unplayable game.
Graphics and Audio stutter do't help with the overall experience either. 
All in all the developers have released a bug ridden piece of crap with no regard to the customer. 


Edit : After finishing the game I really am split 50/50 with this review.
The patch fixed some problems but the load times and crashes to desktop are still pretty horrible and the stuttering and game freezes when switching between screens still make it so much less than it could be. 

The game itself is a good RPG and if it gets fixed to the point where things actually work i wouldn't hesistate to recommend it.

As it is now if you can pick it up 50% off and live with the bugs it is worth a buy. 

With regards to the 100 plus hours playtime around 30 % of that was spent lagging and on loading screens as well as during lock ups, screen freezes and general unpleasantness. 
Also a friend has played around 20 hours it too. 

The game itself will take about 30 hours or so to complete maybe 40 - 50 if you really want to do everything. 

In summary when it works well it is great fun it would just be nice if it did that more often.

51,75409958,english,"People keep giving this game a pass because it's 'unpolished and buggy.'  That's a cop-out because we want this game to be better than it is. The reality is that even if this game were polished to perfection,  it'd still have systems that don't function well, pigeon-holed character creation, and what little role-play you can accomplish is unrewarding. What is left is fiddling with the worst aspects of RPG mechanics.

You can build a few archetypes the creators had in mind or your character will be broken. Full-stop.  You'll recognize this right away. Every choice in the game is like that. You can use an assault rifle, or you can purposely handicap your characters to save ammo. That's it.

The healing system; massively flawed. You can only have 2 quick-slot items. So, probably an explosive and a healing item right? It makes no sense to keep various status-effect cures there. So if you get bleeding, poison or whatever damage over time, your ranger is 100% going to die after battle while you flip through menus trying to find the item that removes whatever status. Only to get rezd by your medic and now suffer from an injury, which takes another healing item to remove. This issue alone makes me believe no one who had the power to change this game actually played it. Anyone who had to deal with this absurdity would have. 

Stealth, in the current form, does not work. Most of the non-random battles start with dialogue. So you rarely get to use it and the times you do it doesn't give much advantage. Every enemy has 360 vision and stealth gives you literally a second  inside that vision before combat starts. There's no reason not to just stand outside that circle and shoot. It takes your character like half a second to do the attack animation. When your stealth times out first before you get the sneak attack in, the enemy gets a full turn putting boots to one of your rangers who's standing in the open. For ranged it's basically impossible because you have to position the character in the vision radius, then scramble to give the attack command, and still leave time for the animation. So in summary, stealth is rarely applicable, has no effect when applied, is riskier than just not using it, and basically doesn't work if you do decide to use it for mere role-play reasons.

The only plausible use for this entire skill in combat is to give your sniper a damage boost on his opening shot. The devs, just like... clearly never thought of using it on any other character.

Combat system is garbage. I think even in WL2, if you were on the same piece of cover as the enemy, they would animate shooting to the side of the cover and give you a flanked bonus. In Wasteland 3 your character just stands up and shoots the crate they're behind. The system of angles makes no sense, slightly broad angles give 80% hit, more broad angle gives 30%.

Melee isn't even it's own thing, its just a gun you use from one square away. Well, turns out, guns work better from far away. It's the same AP to stab as it is to fire a pistol, and for one more AP you can get three shots from an automatic weapons. There's just never a reason to use it. The bad guys immediately behind the one you're melee-ing have no qualms shooting right through that dude. So, and this definitely [b]becomes a theme[/b], only one type of character can really play melee. If you thought you were going to be Riddick,  instead get ready to  weld a steel bucket on the head of a roided up linebacker who wacks people with an old street sign. Literally the only reason to do this is so the other three rangers don't have to share AR ammo. 

A lot of stuff comes down to that issue really. One AR user is enough to put down most enemy squads, so why not diversify ammo consumption.

 All the weapons play the same and are simply relative to AR's. Melee is a 1-square gun, a pistol is a 3 square gun, an SMG is an AR that sucks, an MG is an AR that wastes ammo, and a sniper rifle is an AR you can only afford to fire 5 times. That's it man, this combat system is not complete. Energy weapons are now literally an AR they labeled a Pulse Rifle and slapped a 30% buff against bots. Sure, you can whiff a bunch of buckshot at some dudes and eventually destroy their cover....or you can just walk around the cover with an AR and mow them all down. 

This brings me to my main complaint: your squad can't be the squad you want. You basically have to assemble this basket of unrelateables. You will have a trick-shotting, sixgun-toting cowboy leader, your very own Sloth to wack people with a pipe and accidentally set himself on fire, a cool sneaky (i assume lady) sniper,  a savant medic who does everything technical for the whole team, and then a John Wick type who basically serves out 90% of the team's damage.

If you deviate from the molds the devs made, in creation or development, you will be punished.

Perfect example: within the first few missions you'll get access to the starting AR Rust Bucket, the Battle Rifle and the Swat Rifle. It's just the same weapon tiered up three times for no reason.  If you made a character that wasn't laser focused on putting 7 points in ARs, you're now going to be stuck with an under-powered weapon. That's not a case of missing due to lack of skill; it's literally doing 1/4 the damage while dumping your squads reserve of ammo, because you didnt click the right skill arrow every single level. It's a role-play choice the way it's a choice to brush your teeth every day. Yeah you can not... but...

 The character doesn't play any different, the gun doesn't function any differently ITS JUST WORSE. The damage is just scaled down. To quote that guy from Community ""Bullets just kind of kill ya,"" this WoW-ification was so unneeded.
 
Wasteland 2 is basically the idk, contrapositive (?)of this experience as far as it concerns character creation. I would start new quirky characters and actually get jealous of their cool advantages, and next play through incorporate some of them to my 'mains.' 

The storyboard is just hollow this time around. this will sound extremely abstract, but there was one part of Wasteland 2 that broke my heart in disappointment. In order to save some prisoner at the Mannerites you had to have found some dandruff shampoo earlier and just not sold it. There's one way to avoid blood-bathing the place, and it's to have this totally uh, meaningless, fixed-location junk item. So what do you do? Its a videogame, you can't go back to the store and buy another bottle. You sigh hard, and start scrolling through your saves, and go back 3 hours of play before you sold it.  

That's not role play, its re-play, it's not choice, it's meaningless technicality. This whole game is that fucking dandruff shampoo quest. 

You're skills are nothing more than non-functional wickets. As the player you're just clicking through exposition menus, You click on Kiss Ass +3 to get some more exposition, having no idea who in your squad even has that skill, and knowing it's going to have no bearing on the story. Everything from character creation to combat, you can either do it the way they thought you would, or fuck it up. First example is right in the beginning with Jodie Bell. Sure, you can deal with the hostage taker 3 different ways, and they give you the illusion of three different outcomes but the reality is you either figure out a way to do what the developers expected or you're punished and she doesn't come with you.",1599200014,1600139904,False,8,0,0.541458547115325928,0,True,False,False,76561198172151083,54,8,1686,0,1686,1599180957,,

i can not recommend this game because of how it works with what i call the Trinity of a game .. 3 points of a game's bases that are in every non Sports game (Story, Graphic, Gameplay)
and saddly this game fails in all 3 catagories
starting with Graphics the problem with Pure white snow is the blinding and Straining Effect it has on one's eyes 5 mins of snow in a game is enough to give me a head ache and cause my eyes to barely see ""items of intrest"" such as dig points Loot boxes and corpse drops and this is with my Gamma setting down to recomended levels
Next up Gameplay ...the game is Still being worked on but many of the bugs make my head hurt as i listen to my characters Taking cover ..over and over and over and over and over ((you get my point)) another thing that bothers me is the Sudden unexpected NO way in heck to avoid it ((in the later levels)) enemies get first strike ambushes now this isnt a bad thing IF done right but in some events ((spoilers)) like the Scar collectors Bar/tavern its not even logical that you dont get a chance i lose 3 of my people in the opening event because for some odd reason ((wearing power armor with Energy weapon damping mods)) they are still pumping out 300+ Damage ...PER SHOT ((before anyone ask i had max Con and Luck on 1 character and he was still gutted in 1 round))
lastly Story ..ok at first i liked the Story ..i even thought about a few Theories like ""Dead Red"" wasnt who she said she was but was ""liberty"" hell that would have been Golden in my opinion but the Story ..doesnt make sense and it didnt leave me feeling like i was questioning my choices but rather it made me Question Why the heck should i care from the wasteland refugee's betraying me regardless that they LOVE me and AD's belief that every ranger Death at HQ is my fault ..i felt like the game was trying to hard and instead just ham handed everything all it was missing was AD saying at the end ""I AM THE TRUE EMBODIMENT OF THE RANGERS YOU ARE ALL TRAITORS!!""

Good - Music is great, although the twangy version of Green Acres theme song is a odd to say the least.
If you like X-com style games/RPG it's mostly there.  Good choice mechanics for the most part to branch the story a bit.
Pretty customizable charcters, although the thumbnails only match if you make them look that way to begin with.  The stats are very fluid though allowing for a lot of builds.
Good dialogue/ambient music fits.
Enjoyable, with a fair enough replay value.

Bad - pets are nigh worthless.  They definitly add combat value but have very animal brains, as in they will rush headlong in situations that are fairly terrible.  They also like to block you off sometimes.  IMO more hassle than value.  The cyborg chicken quest is a very poor reward in the end.  Funny yes, useful no.
Loading screens - good lord, who wrote how to load transitions.  I feel like I'm back in the 90s with the load times.
Shotguns/Snipers are far more valuable that other weapons with the exception of the mini gun.  Wierd science is hit and miss.  Assault/Melee are not nearly as powerful, although brawling late game can pack a punch (pun intended).
Both LIberty and The Patriarch fights were phoned in.  After all that run up, it just lost all the momentum and ended with a whimper, not a bang.

InXile need to reflect on the biggest problem which is technical issues. They had the same problems with Wasteland 2 in the beginning, and recently The Bard's Tale, the failure on The Bard's Tale is a serious warning that how broken optimization can destroy fantastic ideas. If they had problem using Unreal 4 or Unity, then probably need to hire a more competent team.

It will probably get a director's cut edition within a year just like the Bard's Tale and W2, and that is when this game is playable.

------------------
Update after finishing the game:

Despite of all the annoying bugs and bad optimization, W3 still fulfills its mission!! RPGOTY!!!",1599390707,1600114012,True,0,0,0.537572264671325684,0,True,False,False,76561198006324352,1295,16,2866,0,2866,1600113869,,
80,75226558,english,"Recommended ONLY and that is ONLY if the game is $20 or less. This title is NOT worth $60. 
Here's why.... and yes..there are good things too...at the bottom.

1: Combat mechanics are just terrible, buggy, and typical of modern game releases that have little to no quality control before being put onto the market. Enemies detect you whether you are in another room or not..this is because of a detection radius around each NPC that ignores cover. Combat just feels very cluttered and overly busy (mostly due to the terrible camera controls).

1a: Enemies ALWAYS know where you are when combat starts. If they are in range, they shoot through walls, throw grenades through walls, and even explosions hit all in the radius whether you are in another room or behind a building or not. Cover is only effective as an armor and acc stat. A terrible bit of bugs and mechanics for a tactical, turned based RPG like this. Compared to other Wasteland games in the franchise...I would say this is the worst as far as combat is concerned..... And 85% of the game is combat.

2: Graphics are about 10yrs old and not well optimized. For me, graphics aren't that big of a deal. I would play it if it were an 8-bit version. I am about the game play. However, they ARE asking $60 for this game right now. It averages barely 70-80fps even on an RTX 2080ti Ryzen 7 2700x, B450M board, etc. etc. While this is smooth operation, there are brief hangs that drop the FPS to 15 or lower for a half second when transtions occur in the game due to events (like dialog popping up, transitioning to combat, etc.). I would expect more for the price. The game utilizes about 2GB of video memory at max settings.

3: Map and camera controls are utterly disgusting. My mind is still blown as to how horrible it is. The large map (M key) is essentially useless in both the world and in-zone. There is no zoom, there is no panning, there is no marking, there is no right-click to move or ANYTHING other than a legend. I would have expected this map to allow you to move your squad (or vehicle) to a location already explored by clicking on the map....NOPE. The mini-map is really all you need for 90% of the time. This all means that you have to EDGE-SCROLL across the entire map (zone) just to click and get your squad moving there. No clicking on the main map or mini map to at least place your view to that spot...You have to manually scroll around to walk across a map you already explored. In places like Denver and Colorado Springs, it is absolutely abysmal to have to work the screen around like that.

4: Camera controls feel like you are playing in the days of 1024x768...Even with full zoom out. Which makes me wonder if the engine really IS a good 10-15yrs old. 4K is barely tolerable. Being able to rotate the map IS nice... but there really needs to be a toggle or setting to switch from isolinear to top-down. Another MAJOR oversight (IMO), is that THERE IS NO EDGE SCROLLING ON THE WORLD MAP!! I have run into radiation storms and even a massive Scorpitron early in the game because the field of view is so small while moving. Come on guys!!

4a: Walls and buildings often block half the view or require you to constantly rotate (especially in a room) to see your characters and walls. Other titles allow you to ""step"" a level down (or do automatically) in a room so the walls aren't so high that you have the view blocked.

4b: The auto-zoom to every stinking enemy NPC whether EVERYTHING in camera controls is turned off or on is almost sickening. It's like you can't just stay centered on a view at all in this game. There is ALWAYS something taking camera control and snapping the view to somewhere else. It is as bad as Battletech (PC)

5: Load times. I have an SSD and 2 HDD (7200rpm) and keep most of my Steam library on the HDD and OS only on the SSD. For the sake of the review I reinstalled the game to the SSD and found that the load times between maps etc. did not change. They are still a good 1-2 minutes per transition... Which, IMO is more evidence of poor optimization of either the engine or the file structure. The game alone is taking up about 4GB of RAM when running...

6: Don't worry about spoilers....the game spoils itself without any outside help very quickly. My jaw hit the floor early on.

7: Lack of direction and/or tool tips. The game seems to be very light on details in missions..Especially when you have multiple things running. Telling the player to ""meet in the ruins"" in a post-apocalyptic setting is like telling someone you will be waiting for them next to the tree in the woods. Also, buffs and debuffs on enemies that show as icons by their health bars have no tool tips!! You don't know what their buff/debuff is!! You have to hope you have seen those icons on your own squad to know what they mean. No hovering the mouse here.

8: Sooo many clicks just to get to trading with a merchant. 

9: The gangs or factions are all so generic to me now. Good guys are organized.... Bad guys are in some cult, gang, or faction that mutilates and dismembers other humans to serve their existence. Like... does every villain faction in the game have to mutilate others as their main theme? Just a good ol' crime syndicate with an established city etc. would be nice. Instead, everything just seems to be about savages vs. savages vs. the civilized player faction. 

10: NO..and I mean NO single or burst fire modes?? Seriously? Everything is just full auto all the time?? And no ""all-crouch""? There Is single fire perk with a cool down? Sigh

GOOD STUFF!!?? .... Yea..there is a little. All the attention to detail went into the story line, the soundtrack, and the cut scene/interaction animations. 

1: The story line is immersive and fun...and as it should be, affects the overall condition of the people and cities in the game.

2: The soundtrack is just awesome. The very first song you hear during your first big battle ""Washed in the Blood of the Lamb"" just has this eerie, old-school Marylin Manson vibe to it. I actually caught myself humming the song a few times at work. Other songs and background music is also top-notch in my opinion. 

3: The animations of the faces  during interaction scenes is very very well done. Their face expression match their demeanor and what they are saying...and are very life-like. Some of the best detail I have seen...even with the older graphics (like Civ4 leader interaction). Screen shots simply can't do this justice.. It is very well done.

4: Voice acting work is superb. It really puts things together nicely when good voice acting effort is applied. So far, none of the dialog seems to be read to me...It has all the emotion and drive it should have..just like a real conversation or moment would be. The only down side is that they used a lot of the same people for most of the game... Although I hear the same female voice often...she plays the roles of the characters very very well and has an excellent range of accents and voices. same goes for the others who voice acted in this game. 

All-in-all... I am not happy with the $60 I paid. I feel like the game was released and sold of its franchise name only...and quality control was the least of their concerns. Game feels very rushed in development...and it is already looking like the community of fans will be the ones to mod the game to remove many of the flaws and bugs it has. However, if I had paid about $20 for Wasteland 3...I would be ok with most of the above...

To me, Wasteland 3 is the worst of the Wasteland franchise... It is to the franchise like Command & Conquer 4 was to the C&C franchise. I guess back when developers had to pay for publishing, manufacturing, and distribution, quality was much more important as there were all those costs involved in a release... Now days, it is about uploading to their store (same price I might add) as fast as possible to start raking in that money.

89,75966150,english,"Wasteland 3 picks up right where we left off with Wasteland 2. The gameplay and everything else about it is fairly similar so if you played the previous title, it will take you about 5 minutes to rocking here. In my experience, the combat was great fun and there is quite a bit of character and item customization to keep things interesting. The game is presented in open world style but it is not that big of a world, unfortunately. There is a decent amount of quests and side quests to do but I found myself running out of things to do, minus the last mission or two at the 40 hour mark. There were some bugs encountered but nothing that made the experience too bad and they were not numerous in my play through.

Pros:
1. Combat is fun and satisfying. If you played Fallout 1/2, Wasteland 2, or even Xcom, you are right at home here.

2. Character customization is solid and allows for a variety of builds. Perks are interesting and can make for some unique gameplay.

3. Setting of the game is cool. Winter fallout was a nice change of pace and the detail of the gameworld was quite good. Game engine does a solid job.

4. Story is pretty dang good. There is quite a bit of choice in dialog and how it impacts your game world. There are missions that really do impact the your experience from the time you finish it until you end the game so that was cool. 

Cons:
1. Weapon and gear choices were fairly uninteresting. For me, a game like this needs to have a lot of varied items and for those items to be useful in some way. That doesn't happen in Wasteland 3. You may have 6-7 items per category and they are pretty boring. As you go along, it is clear that if you don't put your crew in one of the two ""end game"" armors, you will be reviving a ton in game. Assault Rifles are useless in the game, until that is fixed, avoid specing into them.

2.  Mission Journal needs some work. There were a few missions that were limited time and I was not aware of that. I payed close attention while playing and one mission in particular was only available for a limited time. The text of the mission DID NOT indicate this and after doing a side quest, the mission concluded for itself. Highly upsetting since it impacted my end game.

3. Not very open world. I say this because while you can drive your truck around the snow and do missions, there is very little actually there. Only one real city and a bunch of instances to encounter. Denver is in game but relegated to a side show. I found that the game felt much more on rails than it should have been. No real game world development to make it feel alive.

Overall I am giving this a 7/10. It is in no way a bad game. However, for a $60 game of this nature, I expected a lot more. I didn't list the reported issues you may see in other reviews like bugs because I didn't have many but there were a few glaring ones or multiplayer being hot garbage because, others have covered it but keep it in mind.

I was really expecting to see a bigger game than what this turned out to be. It was fun, told a compelling story, and gave the the reins enough to tell it myself but did so while leaving out the colors of the surrounding world. I would love to have seen more useful settlements and places to explore. I wish items in game were more varied and had more choices on how to outfit my crew.

93,75135931,english,"Game was great at first but then i started finding my elite squad of Rangers getting wiped out on their first turn after visiting like three areas against enemies with inferior armor and weapons. Even my heavily armored vehicle with a devastating weapon got taken out in one turn when the enemy just bum rushed it as its main weapon which was shredding enemies into nothing before was now barely putting a dent on them.Not to mention they totally ignored my squad as they did so as if they were not even there. Using healing medication only prolonged the inevitable as they just got one shot into unconsciousness when it was the enemies turn again. This was on normal difficulty.

After seeing similar situations over and over in different parts of the map i finally gave up in frustration at what seems like the usual one sided overpowered setup of the opposing side which crops up many times in these kind of games.

Its too bad since i love the top notch atmosphere, voice acting, fantastic music and audio work, crazy story line and excellent pacing of scripted and random events. What's the point though if its instant death in combat where there is no chance to win most of the time not to mention annoying design issues such as pop up windows showing up during combat totally ruining a perfect shot i had lined up and during out of combat situations not being able to select the same member easily when moving the whole team to another part of an area as it always jumps to another team member to lead instead of the one originally selected. 

Oh and there is also the unbalancing my whole team goes and afterwards your team goes in combat instead of having individual units based on initiative going from both teams. This allows the entire opposing team to attack first totally wiping out my team before they even get a shot in.

Unfortunately for myself this game has more bugs then a seedy motels mattresses.  They were all very minor at first.  Simple UI issues that were easily fixed by backing out of a menu and going back in.  Nothing that detracted from my overall enjoyment of the game.   Then I entered Little Vegas and things got really bad.  The sound cut out and would only return if I zoomed in at a specific angle.  This problem persisted throughout the club, causing all dialogue to be completely silent.  Thinking maybe it would fix itself if I went outside I attempted to leave the club only to be set upon by the dreaded Never Ending Load Screen.  I then tried restarting the game entirely and loading into a different area only to find that both the sound bug AND the loading issue had persisted even when I loaded into Downtown Colorado Springs.

There are several keys that cannot be rebound. 

Your party doesn't follow you when you hold-move; UNLESS you click-moved first and all 6 of them began movement (if one of them didn't begin moving when you began holding your RMB then they will remain stationary).

Load screens are EXTREMELY long. Doing a quickload takes roughly one minute on my SSD that loads all other games very quickly.

Highlighting objects causes a severe stutter. Currently there is no way to fix it. It's hardcoded into the game.

There are many more issues I've experienced. The game itself is a lot of fun. It would be more fun if these issues were fixed. Some of them are sheer laziness from the developer. I feel bad about rewarding them with my $60 when they clearly just don't give a shit.

7,75948733,english,"An absolute blast to play! 

I sadly can't speak of the multiplayer considering I couldn't find anyone playing it. That being said, the game was so much fun from start to finish. Anyway: pros and cons:

PROS:
A fantastic story that allows you to dance in the moral gray area like a sociopathic ballerina
A satisfying combat system with a LOT of options for how to turn the other guy into a fireworks show
A lot of collectible and secrets scattered around Colorado

CONS:
The campaign felt a bit short (but, to be fair, I did end up playing this game for 4 straight days so that might be on me). 
A LOT of bugs. This is not a game of polish gentlemen, and you should be ready for your characters to reset, get stuck, and sometimes, the whole story can bug out. Thankfully, many of these bugs have workarounds.

Anyway, where wasteland 3 shines is its campaign. the gameplay is pretty fun admittedly and reminds me a lot of XCOM 2, but the dialogue and voice acting is what you stay here for. There are a lot of really great performances given by the voice actors they hired, and in a couple scenarios, animated dialogues as well. My only gripe with the story is that I REALLY want more of these animated dialogues, but I can understand that would probably have exponentially increased the workload for the team so I understand why they didn't do that. That really doesn't matter to much though, because even if you aren't a hard ass or a kiss as (the games way of delineating between tough guy and nice guy), you can still say different things that will change the course of the story one way or another. What you say matters a lot, so be careful when you're conversing to people in clown makeup or you might end up with a shoe up your ass in the shape of a bullet.

Combat is fun! not exactly formula breaking by any means but it does the job! You have a bunch of different combat skills that can help you in the game so you're not exactly locked to one archetype if you wish. Looking for someone who can do both assault rifles and snipers? You can put skills into that! Want an explosive man who also is really good with animals? Yup you can do that too. Want someone who is completely worthless in combat, but has a silver tongue to make up for it? I don't know how much I'd recommend it, but YUP! you can do that too! You can use special robots in the middle of combat for fire support, and mod your weapons with upgrades that you find in the field. All in all, each of your party members is pretty custom made, so go crazy!

Anyway, that's all I really have to say on the good front of the game. As for the bugs, there are a lot of them. Some sections of the story can bug out completely and lock eachother off, and sometimes your characters levels can just, reset. Oh, and there's this really annoying bug that happens in combat when you have auto-end turn on. Sometimes, when you throw out turrets to help you, the game will skip your next turn and let your enemy take a second turn. This can be really annoying when you're in a high stakes battle (and on supreme jerk mode, where every battle is pretty high stakes) so you'll get used to save scumming quite a bit. Thankfully, a lot of these bugs have fixes: Turn auto turn end off, remake your rangers into new rangers at the base, etc.

Anyway, Wasteland 3 is a blast, and I heavily recommend you go buy it. If 60 dollars feels like a lot to you, then go ahead and wait for a sale, then purchase it. For the record, I bought this game at 60 dollars and I don't regret it one bit. Fantastic job devs!

The pros: 
The storytelling and voice acting are both solid.
The character creation/level up mechanics are true to classic turn based games.
The potential to min/max, swapping in trinkets and waiting for that elusive skill book to get that last expensive point is also in the old school category.
The endings (I have not seen every possible combination yet) all seem satisfactory.

Both good and bad: The game is of relatively medium/short length. Sort of artificially inflated by endless loading screens (pls give us a counter of how much time we've spent in loading screens, just for fun). However because of being shorter it also feels less grindy than Wasteland 2 felt once you were past let's say the halfway mark.

The (minor) con: 
To put it bluntly, the game is glitchy.  Attempting to have characters do different things simultaneously while out of combat often leads to weirdness, random crouching down tooltip not going away and many other relatively minor issues.

However, here's a brief excerpt that I think captures why I love this game so much:

There’s a scene in the game where I had just negotiated a deal with a local mob boss to secure the release of a town Marshal from his nightclub. Word had apparently spread to a segment of Marshals who had secretly been looking the other way when it came to this Boss’s business dealings for their own personal profit.  However, in the wake of a recent terrorist attack on the town, everyone was looking for blood, and it had been assumed that my crew and I were going to off the mob boss due to a possible connection between him and the terrorists.  

When it became clear that I had opted to make a deal instead, the Marshals marched into the nightclub and presented me with an ultimatum.  Give up the mob boss and renege on our deal, or face the full military might of the Marshals.  

And you know what I did?  

I called him a hypocrite.  

And I killed every single Marshal who was present at that club.  Immediately following the shootout, I had an audience with the Chief Marshall of this town, who told me in no uncertain terms that I was no longer someone who could be trusted.  A sentiment echoed by her subordinates.  

Now, I could have elected to let them take the mob boss and his crew, killing everyone at that club.  I would have been in better standings with the local law enforcement, but I would have also cut off a new supply line and a potentially valuable ally in the criminal underworld.  Either way, nearly a dozen people were dead, and my involvement could not be denied.    

So.  Did I make the right choice?  

Well that right there is the beauty of Wasteland 3.  In a world where human life is as cheap as the Colorado snow, there are no ‘right decisions’.  Only ‘decisions’, and the consequences that come with them.

You’ll look back on how you could have done things differently.  Maybe caused less pain.  Maybe saved a few more people.  Hell, maybe they didn’t deserve to be saved.  You’ll feel like you’ve hit an 18 carat run of bad luck from start to finish.

Just be warned - it is a VERY good rpg that is currently plagued by a plethora of unnecessary bugs.

I really don't want to be this harsh - but man... a few bugs I can deal with...but npcs showing up alive and healthy when you've killed them hours earlier in some quest just completely breaks the immersion. And that is just 1 of the hundreds of bugs (yes, literally hundreds)  I've encountered.

It isn't that apparent early game (1-20 hours) - so you might think you're good. You're not...trust me....shit will break down halfway (for most people not 'game-breakingly'  but definitely immersion wise. Last warning- do not buy as of patch 1.10!

-More bugs than can be counted.
-The slowest loading scene changes in modern gaming,
-Many scene changes, often unnecessary, and frequent.
-Random timers on some events to prevent leisurely enjoying the game, or exploring anything not directly related to the newest quest.

The game is not all hot-steaming-garbage. It is very well put together in most ways. That just makes it a big tease though. 
This should have been the game of the year. But things like adding a clock to events is really poor game design. It is a cheap fix for dealing with a lack of pressure. That is not needed in a game of this type. The pressure comes from pulling the player by quests, and exploration. No pushing is required, and only lessens the game for many. It ruins the game for completionists who like to explore every inch of a game.

If scene changes were rare, it could be lived with. But scene changes are very very frequent during some parts of the game. When running errands in the city, I spend more time staring at a load screen, than playing the game. That could be significantly lessened with some kind of fast travel in city sections you've already explored. But they didn't.
So much good work, ruined and made unplayable by some game design errors that any introduction to game design class would have taught you was dumb.

But at a lot of moments it feels like early access, not sure if it totally worths its money

But, i think game is inferior to Original sin, and that's why:

[Technical]
- minor bugs (nothing critical yet)
- memory leaks - crash  once per 2-3 hours (not sure if related)
- infinite loading screens: on my SSD it takes 30-60s for EACH load (location change, quickload, etc)

[Battle system]
- its basically XCom battle system, and i, personally, like it

[Progression, skills, battles]
- and here it becomes much more inferior to Original Sin
In OS you have plenty of opportunities, which really feels like ""make your own style"", and here that whole progression/skills system feels.. flat and random
Its basically ""you should guess in advance, which skills you will require in hour or two"", and if you guessed wrong- it's your problem
so i think in that part they have a big ""miss""

Battle preparation is also as flat as: ""if you guess correctly will skills progression - you will be able to start battle from behind"", but that's it
Also there are couple of bugs around it.
So in OS i could prepare carefully, there was a meaning behind placing all characters carefully. Here it is mostly ""just start the battle and shoot""

Some skills feel unrewarding at all, for example ""toaster repair"" should be like treasures in the game, but they don't give you any significant reward at all, lockpicking will give you x100 of that

[roleplay]
- generally like it, i think they thought through that part pretty well

[story]

Gameplay: XCOM like tactical placement and shooting. Fully voiced NPCs. Close-up interactions. True decision making with benefits and consequences. Plenty of options for weaponry and modifications. 

Survival Tips: (a) Save your games often (F5 is your friend); (b) Never treat an engagement lightly which means scroll down to see all your verbal response options; (c) Write your Team's skill on a 'notepad' to ensure you do not overlap (i.e., a multitude of skills is needed to avoid frustration in this hellish Wasteland); (d) You are going to require medicine, ammunition, patience, and stamina in getting through this game (i.e., I have restarted several times because I am not imbued with patience); (e) Do not build an average characters - focus your dynamic duo's build into 2 categories: close combat and ranged combatant (initially) - see YouTube recommendation on character builds - ammunition is expensive and the mindless and astute NPC antagonist shall either charge for toe-to-toe combat or remain annoyingly out of range while picking off your characters; and (f) Arrange your Team to take advantage of cover all the time - If you want to survive and not restart the encounter - look for cover (either partial or full), check the angle by which the enemy can fire, move your Team into position by using your mouse pointer to determine the best location. When getting ready to take a shot, look to see if it can potentially be blocked, and then put steel or laser on target.

Quests disappearing entirely from your quest log and reseting progress, money disappearing into thin air, quirks not working properly depending on if you host or not and much more. 
I can tell that this game can provide a very good experience, but it's not very fluid in it's current state if you want to enjoy it with a friend, thusly I recommed you don't buy this game if you intend to play with someone for now.

EDIT: As my friend and I decided to put the game on the shelf until most of the major co-op bugs are patched, I decided to start a playthrough of the hardest difficulty on singleplayer and play up to the point we reached in co-op.
To inform you, most of the bugs that are present in co-op simply don't exist in singleplayer. Now, the game still has its flaws beyond the gamebreaking bugs, and I wouldn't recommend the title even now unless you are bored and or like xcom-esque games. It's a nice game, but it leaves you wanting for more at times. If the devs don't manage to fulfill this craving, at the very least the modding community will eventually. I know this is rather abstract, but that's what I've got to say for now.

EDIT 2: As of just a couple of hours back the co-op fix hit, after a couple of hours of gameplay the major bugs seem to be indeed gone which is nice. The devs just needs to wack out the minor ones and other inconveniences, after that I'll give a proper take on the game when we've completed our co-op playthrough and my singleplayer one.

EDIT 3: We ended up just minutes ago finishing the game, I had to check other more recent reviews and spotted one that sums up the game pretty well. ""It's a BETA, wait a couple of months."" . For all of the great things the game has going for it, there are many poor things that really hurt it too. Much like how I mention in my first edit, I feel the same now after finishing the game, apart from the issues, it feels like there is just a good bit of stuff that's missing. I'm not going to deep dive into all the bugs and problems I've noted down here, as the list is VERY long.

The game has a lot of potential, but it's not quite there yet.

Eventually I found a game that resembled Wasteland 2. Not as much as I hoped. As far as stats go, you've got a whole new system to learn. If you use old build techniques, they will likely fail. My first couple did, until I began to figure out that luck matters slightly more and intelligence is far less useful. Coordination and Strength more so for every build. I'm happily playing with a Leader type and Sniper, switching out the others as their skills are needed.
It's almost too slick.
There is a mission tracker that works so much better than Wasteland 2, but makes one feel like it's not so much a Sandbox as a more directional game disguised as a Sandbox. So far, not a lot of good loot from searching through every nick and cranny. The loot is right out in the open, conveniently placed just when you need extra supplies/improved equipment and after a combat. 
I'm enjoying it. Do I wish it was more like Wasteland 2? Yes, I do.

35,75860649,english,"To everyone that loved Wasteland 2 and its Directors Cut, I'd say this game is a winner......with some exceptions needing to be ironed out. 

I have completed this game in 48 hours, from start to finish, and got the ending where you capture all the Buchanons alive and side with the Patriarch. Let me tell you know, there are a few bugs in this game. Here's a list:
-I believe memory leakage is causing 1 minute area loading screens while the game is on an SSD, 1.5 minutes on an HDD 
-Weird camera issues when the camera zooms in on events incorrectly, like the Camera will zoom in on the opposite side of an event, or the building its supposed to zoom through not going into a see-through state, blocking everything happening
-Rockets seem to have an issue where aiming them sometimes doesn't display correctly where they hit and who they hit
-Sometimes the maximum ammo for a weapon shows 0, but is fixed when switching lead characters and back
-Some dialog is VERY broken because it is delayed by 10-20 seconds, and your response has a delay to it also.
-Doctors seem to not work correctly sometimes. Iv'e noticed several times Doctors will not heal the 1st time if the Ranger they are healing has a condition caused by being downed. The 1st time will clear the condition, but wont heal, the 2nd time will heal them. 
-Sometimes, randomly when shopping and moving around armor and weapons, Ill notice some of my Rangers health will be dropped for some reason. No idea why as I have my inventory up when it happens

These are Some of the bigger bugs I have noticed. Know this, this game just came out, and Wasteland 2 had issues of its own when first released, which is why the Directors Cut of it made it so good. In my opinion, I think a Directors Cut of Wasteland 3 is on the horizon. There was A LOT of cut content that I believe needs to come back. Heck, there's plenty of dialog of a place called Steel Town, yet it doesn't exist.

I changed my review now a few times and here are the reasons why.

The game is great! I love the combat the story is pretty good! There are some interesting decisions to make and nothing seems obviously easy to choose!

Now the reason why this is still a negative review is the insane amount of issues and bugs with the coop mode. Even their newest patch which actually made the game playable in coop left a lot of problems still in the game.I just spent almost 1 hour reloading, restarting and redoing stuff just because every time another issue popped up.

I'm just going to name a few that I remembered on top of my head:
- Pets disappearing (My robot chicken that I collected all chickens for gone... and other pets just randomly disappear sometimes, still leaving you with the buff it would provide oO and yes you can stack pet buffs that way xD)
- Switching out your characters in the hq and when you take back your ranger all his stats are scrambled and he has -7 attribute points to spend)
-Infinite loading screen (and on that issues there are way to many loading screens that take way to long)
- Conversation in coop sometimes force you to swap who has control of it or just don't pop up at all for you or your partner (especially in the world map)

42,75856548,english,"Wasteland 3 could as well be the ""real"" Fallout 3

If we skip all the first person Fallout games and look at the original Fallout 1-2, Wasteland 3 could be named Fallout 3 and I wouldnt complain. Ok, it lacks Vaultboy and vaults, but the overall mood, weird humor, brutal violence, VATS shots, turn based combat, multiple endings, good/bad choices for quests etc. are close to what original Fallouts had.  While Wasteland 3 is not as vast and free as Fallout 2 was, this is still the closest thing to it we have seen since those in my opinion. 

Bad things are similar too; Wasteland 3 is full of small bugs, a few game breaking bugs (easy to avoid though due game saving automaticly to many slots), weirdish balance game design choices, poorish skill balance between good skills and bad skills, and poor late game balance. Call me weird, but some of those are part of the charm (not the bugs obviously), as due to many design/balance things this feels more like an old school rpg where its fun to be overpowerful and fun to do things your way, unlike in most modern rpgs where you get boring +2% perks at level up and character building is straight forward progression with no jumps.

Battles are quite varied, as you dont need to face same enemies more than a few fights each, there is variety in gang styles even though their AI and tactics are pretty much the same. At world map you have plenty of more repetitive ambush fights, but those you can skip with survival skill if you want. Enemies on the hardest difficulty level are a bit of bullet sponges, but if you utilize your perks and weaponry as intended, they go down fast as VATS to the eyes in Fallout 1, so this feels like those in that aspect too. Enemy has 5x more dmg than your weapons base dmg seems, but you still one shot them all the time, go figure, but to me that feels rewarding. And the weapons, oh the weapons... full of weird weapons and full of gun porn too, you can play your favourite sniper with 0.50 anti-material rifle, your huge guy with super sledge hammer, your shotgun hobo clearing the room with automatic shotgun, your nerd guy freezing everyone with frozen ferret launcher and finishing the battle with a tactical nuke, BOOM. Actually you can play all of those, since thanks to the 6 team members you get to enjoy all the crazy and sweet weapons the game gives to you. 

For an isometric cRPG, the graphics are very good. Combat is full of breaking objects, gory high quality animations, and nice visual effects. And man, the music is great! They went REALLY creative with the country/gospel songs coming out of nowhere, burning bandits with a flamethrowers and while gospel chorus sings at the background has very unique atmosphere and feels awesome! Marvellous creative choices, and the sounds are great quality too! Other music is also quality work from the composer of Fallout 1-2 so you feel at home for the ambient too. 

I also love how everything is voice acted, as its fun just to listen to what people talk to each other in cities. Dont rush, let yourself be immersed in the world and conversations, there is plenty of fun stuff happening everywhere if you pay attention to it. There isnt nearly as much neverending conversations as in Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, etc, but there is plenty of dialogue that happens next to you if you want to listen to it.

Storywise Wasteland 3 might be disappointing to some due its simplicity, but I think it nailed the feeling of a ""mission"" perfectly. There are some twists in the story but nothing that made you feel that the twists are there just for the twists sake. Its a cowboy story set in the future, where you in the end decide where to pull the trigger. Doesnt need to be full of twists, simple stuff like this works perfectly for this setting and feels natural to the world. Even if you spend only a few minutes with some characters, you learn to respect them. Conversation skill trees are a bit lacking, but still used in every location of the game at least a bit.

Thanks to all the backers and InXile team for putting together another winner.

Update: 52 hours in, (and two restarts) still good fun, story is branching out without being tedious.

seeing a few QoL issues with LMB/RMB commands-not a big issue...just a little annoying

Character leveling and mods are well fleshed out, perks are little thin (compared to WL2-but not as necessary).

100 hours and story/game completed on easiest level.

I really did not encounter too many bugs however may I suggest you read 
Purple XVI review linked here, it's  very well written, comprehensive and covers a majority of the issues without all the OP/ED that most negative reviewers give.  i agree with just about everything stated with the exception that i still recommend the game.

My personal observations:


Speaking from a ""fan'boy"" position, i've enjoyed the series WL (1988) WL2 (2014) and all the FO games.  Honestly....i was a little disappointed with WL3, it's not a bad game, it just should be better, inXile removed too many of the WL nuances of the game (prob for console users) for instance all the ""skill"" checks are pass/fail vs. a % to succeed. and it's unnecessarily vulgar and crude (language).  However the story is good (so far) 80+ hours  and I like the artwork there are some glitches, bugs (in the perks/skills),  there are a few QoL/GUI annoyances but it's very playable (even re-playable). if i knew this at the time of purchase., i'd probably wait for a few more patches and some kind of sale.  Also,t this is may be perceived as a""continuation"" from WL2..there are many  lore references and characters from WL2  that could leave one confused as the story unfolds.",1598590098,1599924185,True,2,0,0.517374515533447266,0,True,False,False,76561198032193791,59,15,7929,1158,6003,1601995708,,

- The bugs (wait for tons of patches)
- Not using my awesome Wasteland 2 ending
- Too short/small in scope (where did all that dev time go? Certainly not in QualityControl or content)
- The main choice/conflict isn't interesting
- People say the small choices really matter. I didn't get that impression.
- The combat isn't all that good in my opinion. The maps and encounters/fights are really tiny.
- The main base feels boring to me.
- The writing, humor and atmosphere could have been better. The game just taught me early on not to care about anything. It's so superficial and small and didn't provoke any emotional reactions.
- The companions (not rangers) aren't interesting. Seldom has a game managed to make me care so little.
- Why can't I re-skill my team?
- It seems to me that you have to do terrible things in order to get good stuff in the game (for example to support slavery. Why didn't they drop the code, when I killed the slavers?) Why should I support cannibals later on?

Buy it on a sale after most bugs are gone and you'll have an okay time. Be aware that this is a very subjective opinion. I just expected much more and I must say that I liked the previous game better.

80,75824460,english,"The first thing you need to know about this game is that it is quite buggy, especially in co-op. I experienced an enormous variety of bugs, glitches, and other issues while playing this game. Partly this was because I was the co-op partner and so received many additional bugs, but a great many of the bugs affected both myself and my co-op partner.

Our joint bugs included:
1. Randomly losing all character progression, exploration, and quest progress, although this bug stopped appearing after the first patch came out.
2. At times save files would refuse to load, getting stuck at approximately 33% of the progress bar. This was also supposed to have been fixed with the first patch, but it continued happening for us.
3. Animation glitches, most especially with characters and enemies moving while still stuck in the crouched or in cover stances.
4. Some random encounters were quite buggy and had glitched cover and glitched enemies,
5. AP glitches where not everybody would get the ability to go like the should, most especially when sneak attacking.
6. A quest-related companion (The Provost) vanished from us and left for parts unknown and we were unsure when or how. 
7. A prebuilt character (Zeus) being unable to hack robots and machines like he should have been able to. If you pick him, you might want to choose someone else to spec for the nerd stuff skill.

Co-op glitches (glitches I experienced as the co-op partner)
1. The radio on the overworld not properly functioning - I would be unable to hear the radio broadcasts, with the last piece of dialogue I heard playing instead. This was fortunately fixed with the first patch as well.
2. Floating dialogue boxes persisting for the entire period that we were on a map. 
3. Late-game, the Kodiak became glitchy for me, with it not moving on my screen when it was doing things.
4. Weapons randomly becoming unequipped from two of my party members.
5. Sometimes being in a glitched conversation where both of us were in separate conversations with the same NPC at the same time.

Even keeping all of these problems in mind, I massively enjoyed this game.

The world was deep and broad, and the usage of an overworld with more detailed locations gave the game a sense of scale that similar RPGs sometimes lack. The location variety is good and keeps you guessing, and there are a good variety of enemy types and factions to make sure combat doesn't feel too samey. Random encounters did get old pretty fast, however, and perhaps a greater variety of them could be added in the future.

My co-op partner and I both became engrossed in the story, and I thought that there are a good deal of interesting choices that have to be made throughout the game that substantively impact the game world and the ending. When we were first setting out we made some choices that would come back to bite us (Little Vegas), but I think that's part of the experience of these games. 

The gameplay is very good. It uses a cover-based shooting system most comparable in my experience to X-COM, with there being chances to hit, full and half cover, etc. In our party we had people using every class of gun, and it definitely seems like the different types of weapons are not equal in usefulness. Snipers and assault rifles were good the whole game, and pistols and shotguns got better and better as the game went on. Heavy weapons, especially machine guns, seemed to get worse and worse. The late game does have a bit of a problem where enemy health scales massively where yours does not, but the incredibly forgiving revive system in this game meant that it is actually very difficult to have someone die. Crits also became more and more important as the game continues since you'll be needing to deal more and more damage, and by the end of the game dealing crits is vital to succeeding in combat. We were playing on the second-highest difficulty, so I am unsure if that is related.

This game contains a variety of skills that are utilized to pass skill-checks, whether to accomplish tasks in the world or convince someone in conversation. Skill management is on the easier side; with proper planning, you can have nearly every skill in the game covered by someone in your party. I do not see this as necessarily a bad thing, since that just gives you greater freedom to see the game.

The companions you find along your journey come in a variety of flavors and backgrounds, and I enjoyed having them in our party. Not every companion has a quest or story that you can help them with. I did really enjoy the stories of those companions who did have quests, so I do wish more companions had character quests.

Inventory management is one of the weakest parts of the game in my opinion; your inventory space in unlimited, but the combination of console-style item squares and a lack of good filtering tools make it a real hassle to track down items. I have no idea why the game didn't launch with a utilities tab, which otherwise have to be tracked down somewhere near the bottom of the overall inventory page. There should be additional filters for classes of weapon, and additional ways to order the items on different pages like damage, level, or value. It would also have been nice to have a vault or storage of some kind at the Ranger HQ. Merchants also do not restock, which was a mistake in my mind IMO. It was also annoying to see that junk I sold to merchants never vanished.

The music in this game was amazing, and all of the different covers were great and very atmospheric. 

Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10, even with all of the bugs. Once the problems are ironed out, especially in-co-op, I think this game will be a masterpiece.

 - The game has a small bug if you kill the slaver at HQ, you will never get the code, and the quest won't go away.  Found a good bug lake in the game, in the lower left hand corner of the map I found a scorpion wondering around.   I dragged several crates from it and went to battle  and killed it.  It was still there when I went back to the map, so I did it again about 6 times and got tons of goodies.  

- make sure to Max one guy in demo, one in lock pick.  
- Weird Science is worth every point if you want really cool, one shot kill stuff. 
- Be nice to the arms trader in gipper-land 
- Everyone should have at least 1 point in first aid 
- brawl weapons don't run out of ammo
- Its good to have team members with both short & long range skills like sniper / shotgun
- Animal wisdom is great, you won't believe how much damage a normal chicken can do
- some traps need high nerd skill 
- some weapons can shoot thru multiple targets

Small bugs make me wonder if the game was even playtested. For example, if you go to a healer you can get all your status effects removed and your health filled up. Standard RPG stuff. Problem is, the game logic heals you, then removes status effects. Some status effects reduce your max health. So you have to visit the healer twice to get fully healed. How did no one catch that?

The UI is also laggy. On the main menu, it's easy to accidentally click ""Quick Load"" instead of ""Quick Save"" because of that lag. There's 20 minutes of gameplay you need to repeat.

It seems to be meant for replayability with a lot of skill checks, build variety, and impactful choices. However the below issues and others I've probably forgotten completely kill any motivation to do so for me.

- Load times are the absolute worst I've seen in any game in years, and these aren't massive open world type zones or AAA graphics. We're talking 30-60 seconds between areas, and there is a whole lot of transitioning between areas for no reason. Towards the end was spending more time Alt-Tabbed waiting on load screens than actually playing.
- Pathing is absolutely abysmal. If you're moving as a group and come across a group of enemies, expect that at least 1 person from your party will aimlessly wander off ahead of your leader and get everyone attacked. Especially in indoor zones or tight spaces.
- Supposedly permanent pets and party members that you spend hours acquiring OR that are essential for quests permanently despawn when you switch out party members. Will also bind to whoever you happen to have selected at the time. So if a non-custom NPC gets it and decides to bail, everything goes with them.
- Inventory system is pretty cluttered with no search or filter functionality and the built in filters don't work for every item type.",1599867534,1599867534,False,2,0,0.482786238193511963,0,True,False,False,76561197982905260,171,3,5632,0,5632,1599634693,,

91,75819241,english,"This game has an awful lot of potential but it falls short in pretty much every area, lots of things feel like they are only half finished.  

-Characters generally feel rushed: there's a substantial lack of dialogue and exploration vs Wasteland 2.  This is relevant because at launch Wasteland 2 was only £35, Wasteland 3 is £55 so I expect to play a larger, higher quality game.  You aren't going to get that at the moment.

-Bugs: just so many, nothing game breaking per se, some e.g. npc animal characters vanishing, sections of story are skipped (second playthrough they were present but others were not - I kept the same choices to make sure), really bad ui interface, when battle starts I lost count the number of times the screen would just move to the corner of the map when it was my turn, characters getting stuck in cover, sometimes my turn would just skip for no reason whatsoever.

-The illusion of choice, this game makes a big deal on reputation having a huge effect for the player, it doesn't.  You have rep with certain factions, and then individuals have their own allegiances towards you.  I found the latter was only affected by 3-4 main missions, and the 20+ optional quests I undertook had absolutely no effect what so ever.  There is supposed to be this feel of building something from nothing but you're just left feeling underwhelmed.  The reputations are supposed to affect the ending but even those fall short.  They don't do much besides getting you a few free items and a discount when buying for your squad.

-Poor item & squad management: inventory management is just awful, having a storage box would be helpful, not sure why no one thought to include it, perhaps on the transport used.  You also can't respec your points but you can delete the custom character and redistribute the points that way, less the xp you gained in that level, as well as any skill books you've read.  Frustrating.  Attributes per character are also badly designed, a couple of areas aren't worth investing in because they give nothing back, whilst others are ridiculously over powered. 

-More clarity on missions: what I mean by this is that some missions are on a timer and some are not, and whilst it is often fairly obvious which ones are, it would be helpful to know just how much time you have.  It feels like the game punishes you if you want to do chunk of story first and then the optional stuff later.

-The final 1/3 of the game just drops off: it's like they ran out of time and just finished with what they had.

-Online Co-op:  It's broken, doesn't work.  Needs to be patched asap.

-The ending: I won't put any spoilers in but in my play-through the end summary contradicted itself which boils down to poor story telling.  It also felt rushed and poorly told, from the choices I made I had this build up for a large showdown and it was over in 2 minutes, I already have that with gf, I don't want it in the games I play too.

I want to like the game, I do like it, but I can't recommend it as it is.  Not unless they make some big changes.  It's a game that has some genuinely decent moments of voice acting and story/character development, and it looks good too.  However, all of these areas are hampered by a plethora of bugs and the feeling that everything you encounter feels unfinished, rushed or poorly designed.  And it's £55.

********************************************
Ts;wr 
1) Graphics.
  + Good enough to have a good atmosphere.
  -  Somewhat outdated. Feels strangely off at times. But it's nothing you need to tear our eyes out from. 
-------------------
2) Sounds, music. 
  + Actually pretty damn good! Surprising even.
-------------------
3) Gameplay. 
  + Quite the memorable characters here, interesting and believable dialogues, inspiring sci-fi post-apo  environment and lore, pretty well done humor. Just take the prisoner for example. Just rofl. 
  + Hidden niches, hidden pathways with a treasure. Different approaches to the quests or the situations. 
  + Plethora of usefull combat and non-combat skills and abilities and perks.You can even redo your characters or create new ones or similar ones.
  + There is some basic crafting. 
  + There is a thing called an asynchronous coop multiplayer. Has this ever been even spelled together with the word RPG?! I don't even know how this could work. It apparently can.
  - Although the game is pretty much ok the way it is, a comparison to the 1998 Fallout 2 is sooo viable. Could've been more awsomely complex as the mentioned. Doesn't have to be though, it's quite alright the way it is.
-------------------
4) Story. 
  + Not bad, not awsome, is alright, sometimes is inventive. But the rest of the game and some sidequests are so frikkin cool, I don't have to care about this topic and nor should you.
-------------------
5) Technicalities. 
  +- FPS is pretty ok with most of the graphical ticks ""on"" throughout the game except for fights. Fights tend to drop to 5 FPS aiming in special attacks. Still playable, though annoying.
  - Loading times slightly too long to begin to be bothersome.

I was really enjoying this game up through the initial portion in Colorado Springs.  It can be very challenging at times, the combat is really good, and I enjoy the stats system which is mostly copied over from Wasteland 2.  I did enjoy the initiative system from wasteland 2 over this one however.  Too much save scumming... your party can get completely decimated if the enemy moves first.  It also devalues speed and other attributes on your character.  I also dont like how you just get 3 skill points per level now, regardless of how much intellect you have.  They balanced it out by making intellect your base crit stat, which is fine.  However the explanation of how it works is not clearly laid out in character generation.  If you make a 10 int character, you do get a few extra skill points, but ONLY at that first level or when you add int through the game.  Only once.  I restarted about six times thinking it was a bug before I did some research online.  You get many more attribute points this go around so I suppose it balances out.  However the idea of a 'skill monkey' this in this game is rather pointless since a 10 int and a 2 int character all get the same 3 skill points during a level up.  I have found some very bad bugs however in the warrens under the bizarre.  I am to the point now where I think I may just have to restart the game.  Every combat I initiate bugs out.  Characters get stuck, I move two characters during my turn and the enemy then moves... enemy characters get stuck on cover... etc.  I have quick loaded one fight about 5 times then I restarted the game and still the same problem.  Didn't have these bugs in colorado springs but the deeper into the game the worse it gets.  And then there is that increasing load time the farther along you go...  I think its a very good game, but if you're looking at buying you may want to wait a few months until the patches come in and fix some of these bugs.

The gameplay itself is fantastic, the story and voice acting are better than I would have expected, the graphics are total shit, and the performance... My God the performance. I have a 4.6ghz i7, 32 gigs of ram, an OC 1080ti, and a 970 evo SSD and this game is barely playable with graphics set to low and medium. Constant stutters and frame drops, FPS will drop from 100 down to low teens during random battles. FPS locks are constant, requiring reboots to fix. All of these things are tolerable except... 

The LOADING TIMES are fucking insanity. On a Samsung 970 SSD, loading between maps is taking upwards of 30-60s. The game itself also has multiple areas and no fast travel so trying to go from just the main base to a segment downtown can take 3 minutes just staring at a fucking loading screen.

If the game was a piece of garbage I would write this off as a bad buy, but it's brilliant and that makes it so much worse because you are slogging through a wasteland of technical nightmares instead of the actual post apocalyptic scenery. 

Under no circumstances should you buy this game, I would have refunded it but I am an idiot and walked away during a particularly long loading screen and 2 hrs elapsed before I returned, no refund for me.

80,75758072,english,"This game made me angry, and not in a good way. Let that be your one-sentence review if you don't read the rest.

Also note that this game is played on the difficulty labelled as ""Intended,"" the ""Wastelander"" difficulty.

For the long-form review, I always prefer to start with the good. 

When it comes to Wasteland 3, the good is a pretty short list. Firstly, the presentation is more or less uniformly excellent. Great soundtrack, solid art direction, moody lighting, competent voice actors and generally good writing. When the writing lapses it's usually in the sense that you're left without some very common-sense replies to things, not that the options you have and the responses to those options aren't good. The writing is at its strongest when it doesn't try to be too serious and has a bit of fun with things, enjoys a bit of satire and such, dives into some of the sci-fi elements of the setting.

The section with the bad is a much longer section.

First, the technical issues. This game loads like playing Baldur's Gate on your old Win 95 machine. Every area transition and quickload is incredibly interminable. I have no idea what the hell they did, but I can't believe it can't have been done better. Mind you, this was on an SSD, you might suffer even more on a classic HDD. It also chugs noticeably during larger fights, and this is on a PC which was built from scratch a year before Wasteland 3 was released.

Secondly, the bugs. Oh the goddamn bugs. You've got the usual ones, like characters' weapons being visible when they aren't, so you can see ghostly floating guns in the fog of war, and stuff like some obstacles not actually existing for purposes of targeting so you have overwatch fire getting blasted out through walls. I completed a quest 100% in accordance with one faction's wishes, and at the end the game assumed I had killed them all instead. I made one decision near the start of the game (to free a prisoner) and at the end of the game, he was suddenly back in his cell and everyone was acting like I'd left him there all along. Mysterious floating boxes. Quirks/perks not working as intended, like Medical Marvel, it's supposed to make your character un-revivable during combat, but sometimes they don't revive at the end of combat either. Occasionally they revive at the end of the next fight, or the fight after that, instead, other times they don't revive at all and only limited-use consumables can pick them up, which can softlock you in an area if you run out of them since you need the entire party at the exit to leave. At one point all my recruitable PC's left me because an allied NPC had gotten hit with a bleed condition and died after the fight ended, which they blamed on me. NPC's will cry out when their allied turrets get blown up like it's a human being you just killed. Sometimes temporary float text also remains burned into the screen while you explore areas which is somewhat annoying.

Thirdly, and probably worst of all... are the design sins. Now, keep in mind, this is not an exhaustive list. Because I probably forgot some and did not encounter others but... let's take it from the top. My first encounter with their dubious design was spotting enemies in the distance and deciding I wanted to get the drop on them. I tell someone to fire and... the enemies' dialogue trigger kicks in as soon as I shoot, interrupting my ambush shot. This happens multiple times, some enemies you just aren't ""allowed"" to ambush. Often this also leads into them getting the first round of battle against your not-in-cover guys and a not-in-cover character is usually dead in one round if all the enemies are alive to act. You've also got issues like an NPC enemy begging for mercy in the middle of the fight which technically interrupts the fight and thus wipes all conditions, including the ones you passed a hard skill check to set on her drones to get them on your side. The encounter design also sucks in other places, like... in most turn-based games if an enemy ""activates"" a suicide bomber companion on one turn, then that means you have X turns to take them out before they reach you or to douse them or something. In Wasteland 3 they act on the same turn and have enough movement to cover the entire battlefield in one move. Also even though they're activated by just lighting a fuse, you can't light them prematurely with, say, fire damage or a molotov to turn the tables on the other guys. Don't want to get creative or anything now.

The game loves to give you options for DOT(damage over time)-effects, but everyone's so paper-tissue fragile that they never have a chance to matter. A lot of skills and weapons are trash useless, like, don't even make a melee character, ever. In fact go pure submachineguns and maybe a single sniper and a small arms guy, that's where 90% of the good damage options are. But hope you actually find them, since the game's shops rarely upgrade their stock(in fact not even when you get radio calls saying they have). Unique named weapons found in the wasteland also tend to be worse than common weapons you buy in stores and get as random drops. Inventory sorting sucks since there are multiple item types that don't fit under any subcategories and thus only exist in the super-cluttered ""show all"" tab. Weapon and armor modding are largely ineffectual since the game designers have the hilarious idea that sacrificing action points for a piddling bonus to armor is a good decision(it never is, more actions is always the superior option). I say I think maybe a half dozen options to use Weird Science and Animal Whisperer during the game, so don't pick them either. Hell, even the dialogue skills don't see an awful lot of use. Mostly you're disarming explosives or traps, picking locks, hacking computers or disabling things with mechanics.

Also the only effective character is a specialized character, but the game hides this from you for as long as possible. You start off making two characters(figuring they're probably your only ones for a while, you probably make them jack-of-all-trades), then you get an option to make two more a bit later(having wised up a bit, you probably specialize these appropriately) and then lastly you get to recruit two. But since your NPC recruits are badly designed(skills spread all over the place), it's pure luck whether they can actually be specialized to be useful(and whether their specializations drop right on top of your existing ones). Plus near the end of the game some of them may betray you. No speech check to keep them on your side, no way to really know they were planning it(since they more or less just mutely accept everything you do even if it apparently clashed with their very deeply held worldviews), and also they take all their expensive gear with them. Oh and you can't respec either PC's or recruitable NPC's, ever, so hope you don't pick anything poorly or specialize in a subpar weapon type.

The game gives you a prison and the option to try to arrest people, but I want to say that three out of five people I tried to arrest just screamed ""NOOOO, I'D RATHER DIE"" and forced me to either kill them or let them go, making the option feel really vestigial. Overworld travel feels extremely slow and tedious, it's a chore to put up with.

The gameworld also feels more dead than Wasteland 2. At least in Wasteland 2 there were multiple town/community areas to visit, and most of them you didn't even have to genocide. In Wasteland 3... I can think of literally two locations to visit that you don't leave more or less depopulated and which actually are places people/things reside in, where there are businesses and homes and such. The rest of them are just dungeons full of wasteland orcs to blow up. 

Don't get Wasteland 3. Definitely not for 60 bucks.

EDIT2: Issues have compounded further and further. It took me and my friend about half an hour to get our co-op working again, and then once we did things went really poorly from there. Characters having no AP for no reason, characters being moved at the start of combat for no reason, connection drop outs and boxes being 'busy' and unlootable.
No matter how much fun you CAN have with WL3, right now it is a broken and buggy mess that needs a hard patching to be even close to release quality.

EDIT: After looking through the forums, it seems that my relatively issue free experience is an exception to, rather than the rule, so i feel the need to change this to 'not recommended' until they patch it down the line. They definitely will, let's be sure of that, but that doesn't excuse things.

As someone who has never really touched a Wasteland game before (though being somewhat familiar with what they are), WL3 is quite a good bit of fun in the first few hours i played it so far in co-op.
It isn't perfect, by any means, and there are a number of smaller bugs (fps drops in town at times, heavy fps drop when pressing shift to highlight objects around you, armor visibility settings being reset on just about every screen change, etc) but overall the experience is quite satisfying.
It's a lot like a very fast paced and brutal Xcom game, in that stuff dies super fast, explosives are crazy powerful, and the enemy units take their movements all at once.
Another huge plus is that it uses a skill system as deep as the pre-4 fallout games did, so every choice means a lot.
One major nitpick, though, is that when you try to use a skill if there isn't anyone in range the ""no targets in range"" popup appears over your character, not necessarily in view. So its one of those things a new player might have issues with early on. Also despite interacts/attacks being on the left click, you can right click on a barrel to attack it when walking about. Not helpful.

One massive thing which this game does well is that when moving your mouse around to decide on where to move, mousing over a square displays who you can hit from there and what % chance it will be if you were to move there. While i'll agree this is possibly a little too much information for the more 'hardcore' folks out there, its better than the Xcom thing where you move somewhere only to discover that a shot isn't as reliable as it looks, despite all the elements giving the impression it should be a good one.

Obviously this is an early perspective, and it will adjust down the line, but for now i'm enjoying the game.",1598625941,1599756315,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197992587371,480,103,890,0,890,1599755963,,

I had to restart 2 times. One time My saves were gone, one Time my char lost all his points ( -7?) and  NOW, after 50 Hours of gaming, i stand in front of a door that does not exist - and does not let me interact with, so i cant progress in the game..

Just wait a Month before you get it.. and you will have a blast!

Players that liked previous Fallout Games, or games like Wasteland 2 or Baldur's Gate will feel right at home with this title, and will have the opportunity to try X-Com like combat. For the amount of content provided, 60 USD is a very good price, and fans of the genre should get more than their money's worth.


I would personally like to see an improvement in both combat and performance, but I think that those issues can be tweaked or fixed by InXile in future patches, and they are not so much of blemish that I didn’t enjoy my time with the game. If you are a fan of the original Fallout games, or if you are looking for an RPG game to invest a ton of hours into, I would definitively recommend Wasteland 3.


Best buy this year for me and speaking of bugs, I rly don't had a lot. I would say it ran about 90% smooth. Games with such massive depth and scale will always have their little problems, that's the price we have to pay for a masterpiece like this one. One thing what rly pissed me off been the loading times, but that's it !

A. Love Wasteland series, but have no patience en dont't give a fuck about bugs.
Then yes, go go go. But be prepared, most annoying for me so far: 
- long long loading times (and sometimes just to load a map to say one thing to a  NP an backout to anouther long long loading time). Save times are fast, so no worries there, make as many as you want.
- Clunky interface, but there are some improvements for beginning players (1 inventory for all party members)
- items dissapearing, when dropping items from character to inventory sometimes items dissapear. Keep an eye on that one, you'll want to reload (long long time)

B. Love Wasteland series, but can wait
Then wait! The company making this game has a good enough reputation/history to be confident enough to say ""they working on it"". So wait for a better experience out of the box (and probably cheaper price).

C. No idea about Wasteland or RPG and can or can't wait.
No choice here, wait.
If you can't wait you probably gonna be annoyed by the bugs and unable to appreciate the game/genre.
If you  can wait, then Wasteland 3 is the best of the Wasteland series to introduce you to this game genre.

Fresh from finishing to game so my opinion might change as I digest it, this game does improve upon things from Wasteland 2 but falls short at times. For plot and ending I'd recommend WL2 first but I wouldn't say WL3 was bad; I certainly recommend it above recent Fallout.
I was disappointed team Echo couldn't ride again, just used the same concepts though, and while former followers were in the game there wasn't much time spent with them since after they appear the game is pretty much wrapping up. 

I guess my biggest issue was the morality, it's made out as a twist that our benefactor did under the table dealings to maintain peace, which I was annoyed I couldn't make a sarcastic comment about stating the obvious after having to fight through frogs and mercs to find out. In the end only one choice seemed to matter, old guard, new blood, or the status quo.
Overall it's fine certainly a bit more complex then most just back to WL2 some of the moral questions were forced but was still bittersweet in the end, some good and bad, even trying to have the best outcome possible was still left mixed feelings.

56,75712896,english,"Well, I loved Wasteland 2 and thought it was a great merge between XCOM and Fallout. This game is definitely XCOM in nature and the setting is still on point, but the game is literally unplayable. I sank 30 hours into the xbox version before I decided that the crashes every 10 minutes were too much. Then I bought the PC version, like a fool, and have ran into so many different bugs and issues that make the game unplayable. Here are some of my top issues, in case any of you would prefer to not waste 60 bucks on a broken piece of garbage.

1. Combat is absolutely ridiculous. I say this because XCOM style combat implies a level of stability and calculated actions. This is not possible in W3. Anything between units moving randomly around of their own free will (on my turn) to deployed robots (on my side) attacking one another. I have experienced so many bugs with such a simple combat system that I can honestly say, it can be boiled down to luck if you win or not sometimes. I played on the Jerk difficulty and so combat was already supposed to be challenging. I found that even if you prepare for a tough combat, you could accidentally win or lose based on a bug. I've had deployed robots never take a turn, which wastes both their power in combat as well as the item. From problems with reviving team mates and turns auto-ending too soon to ""focus"" abilities not giving a clear indicator that they are or aren't being used, this game's combat is rolling dice and just kind of hoping.

2. So many quests are bugged, many to the point where you can lose a save because of the inability to load OR just to the outcome you specifically didn't want. Examples being, one quest you have to rescue a prisoner and then he talks to you. Well, my prisoner had a damage over time on him and so IN THE CONVERSATION, he died and the game assumed I had actually talked to him, causing the entire quest line to assume information I don't actually know as a player. Super lame. Another quest example is that certain areas just don't load right, like the two women quest in which you decide to save or sell them. This quest isn't accessible anymore because the entire area is unable to load. Many scripted events are also pretty wonky. An example being there is a fight where extra people come in from the back and support their remaining enemies BUT you are also allowed to sneak into the back of the fight before it starts and SIT in the area they spawn. I did so and was pretty pissed when I was suddenly surrounded. Just things like this all over the place. It's as if no one play-tested anything in this game.

3. The leveling system is pretty garbage. Not to say that you don't feel like your character's advance or that the progression is poor. The Feat system as well as the ability score system is pretty lame. For one, the ability score system makes some scores just seem ungood. Like... why would I want speed on literally anyone who isn't melee, AND to top that off you still need strength and coordination before you need speed so what, I'm supposed to dip into speed once I'm level 14? By that time, the equipment you have carries you farther than any additional stat points. That's not even the worst though, because the Feat system is trash. Sure, some feats are good for synergies and one or two, like robo hack and mark target, are helpful but that's like... it. There are some Feat trees that implicitly support multiple weapon types, which is interesting, but it ends up meaning that half of my team has EXTRA feat points just laying around and the rest of my team just DOESN'T have a Feat tree that matters. Like stealth! Sneaky Shiz is super important to disarm alarms and sneak a little better, but you don't need the Feats it provides AT ALL. You are plenty sneaky enough without them to access anything you want and yet the tree has stuff that makes you marginally better at sneaking. Makes no sense at all.

4. The overworld map is a huge disappointment. For one, driving around at the speed of snail, sucks, and that is all you do for the first 12 hours of the game. Drive around this tiny patch of ice, surrounded by radiation that acts as a barrier to the rest of the game. SO, after you spend a good chunk of your money you are allowed to explore the rest of this tiny frozen wasteland. There are literally around 20 overworld areas in which you can enter and most of them are small, short, or for a single part of some quest. There is no grand exploration like in Fallout/Baldur's Gate/Divinity. No large mazes or bunkers, no grand scenes of epic flora, nothing at all that makes me feel like I'm really ""exploring"". The largest ""dungeon"" I've encountered was like 6 rooms. I cannot fathom how they thought this was fleshed out enough. In addition, they scatter these random camps and vans across the map that you can encounter. Neither does anything more than potentially endanger you, add +1 rep to someone, get yelled at, or find some scrap. The map doesn't visually change, ever, either. You will always see that one patch of snow and that one tree every single time you drive by it. After driving around in it for 10 hours, you get pretty disenchanted pretty quick.

5. The economy is terrible. It is so bad that even with the Barter skill I find myself still making decisions on weapons based solely on how much ammo they consume. This doesn't seem all that bad at first BUT when you have gun A that does decent damage and consumes 6x the amount of ammo gun B does, when B does slightly less damage and only consumes one bullet each shot... Then you take this mindset across all 6 characters who each have different weapon skills, it becomes a chore that doesn't ever feel rewarding. Bullets, injury kits, and nitro spikes are going to consume the majority of the pathetic amount of cash you find. The thing is, too, that people get downed ALL the time. The NPC Lucia is made of paper and if she gets attacked by anything, she goes down. Every time a character gets downed they receive an injury and if you're using an injury kit or two every combat you start to run out of cash, quick. Now, I wouldn't even care if it were just hard to keep money around and it was a struggle and the game was hard, BUT NO it goes beyond that. There are things you have to BUY in order to KEEP PLAYING THE GAME. These items are upgrades to your car so you can SEE THE REST OF THE MAP. Absolutely ridiculous that we are expected to: Have a good barter skill, use as little ammo as possible, be as safe as possible to stop from being downed, AND expend all of out excess cash on needless plot barriers that are mixed up in the economy.

6. The loot system, while not breaking the game and making it totally unfun, is bad. You, essentially, will always have some number, 1-6, chests to open after each combat. In these chests are mostly what the game calls ""junk"". If it isn't junk, it's most likely a weapon or set of armor that you have 5 copies of already or some pathetic amount of ammo/meds. Every... single... encounter... This never changes, through the whole game. You will always have some crazy number of useless items labeled junk and then a bunch of total garbage weapons and armor. Every now and again you will find a BETTER weapon or piece of armor, that's nice but it happens about once in a blue moon and it's always scripted when you get a unique weapon, which is mostly what is good and used. On the whole, lackluster looting system, super predictable weapons with basic stats and abilities, and a lot of random trinkets that you sell for near nothing, each.

This game was on my wishlist and in my mind for MONTHS before it released. I loved W2. I thoroughly enjoy this genre, setting, and the XCOM combat style. This game is trash in it's current state. The fact that I bought both copies for xbox AND PC enrages me. I thought I could finally play the game here, on the PC, but no. They released, for FULL PRICE, a game you can't play.

+ As a red blooded american, I cannot recommend enough a game that allows you to side with robo Reagan.

This alone and the bewildered looks of foreign streamers/youtubers when being confronted by the party of Reagan virtually shows that America is the best Dystopia ever.

81,75695607,english,"Still have quite a bit to go on my first run but I've played more than enough to be able to recommend.  Different from Wasteland 2 in a few ways (graphics are MUCH nicer)- lots of difficult choices that will lead to multiple playthroughs.  I can already see SO many ways I could do things differently on a new run (just like Wasteland 2) and am very excited to see how all the pieces come together when I finish the game for the first time.  Not since Fallout: New Vegas have I thought early in the game ""I know who I'm going to side with and why"" only to later sit staring at the screen for 15 minutes to decide certain major decisions due to the sheer complexity and possible ramifications of those decisions.  When I met the main factions in New Vegas I found that they all seemed rational when fully explained (Caesar is one charismatic SOB if you take the time to chat with him)- your choices in Wasteland 3 can be just as tough for all sorts of reasons.  I just had to make a REALLY big decision and I had to leave the computer and walk around for a while weighing all the pros and cons before finally pulling the trigger.  Still not sure if I made the right choice..... on my next run I'll likely take the other path...... or that path might not even exist due to my decisions next time.  I think it could easily take me 5+ runs to see everything when you consider how many factions there are and the idea that many of them are not fans of each other.  

If you liked Wasteland 2 I think you'll like this one.  Lots of side-content, lots of funny writing, lots of weapons/armor/builds/items/etc.  There are entire CLASSES of weapons I have not messed around with, skills I have barely touched, perks I haven't been able to grab..... there is just a LOT of game here.  When I looked on Howlongtobeat.com I noticed that the average play-time as of this writing is less than I would guess but don't let that dissuade you- I think there are a lot of people like me that are still on their initial run and just haven't finished yet.  I'm at 50 hours as of writing with a TON of places left to go and quests left to do.... assuming I'm over the half-way mark BUT I could be wrong...... I thought I was at the end of Wasteland 2 only to discover there was an insane amount of content left.  If I remember I'll update this review when I get further.  Already feel as if I've gotten my money's worth (and I'm cheap) even if the game abruptly ended right this instant.  

Oh- and there is a Ferret-Launcher.  This game can get dark but items like the Ferret-Launcher and characters like Major Tom, Party-Bot, Flab can provide some good laughs.  This and Wasteland 2 (never played Wasteland 1 but intend on doing so since all 3 games connect together in some ways) I consider to be along the lines of the original Fallouts 1 and 2 if they had been made more recently with better graphics and whatnot.  Reminds me of Fallout: New Vegas in quite a few ways, too.  Will probably start a new game right when I finish my first one because I REALLY want to see how else the story could have branched so far.... and this is the type of game where you can pretty much kill anyone and you won't get a ""Game Over"", the game will simply branch into a different direction.

--Great difficulty setting that allows anyone to pick up and enjoy the game or rip there hair out trying to finish a encounter.
--A fantastic soundtrack that compliments the game's atmosphere perfectly, and truly spices up encounters.
--Visually character creation could be more impressive but under the surface the varying builds and playstyles that the C.L.A.S.S.I.C system offers allows for an ocean as deep as it is wide.
--The many many different ways character build's factor into progressing and carrying out quests. An example of this would be almost all the lockpicking skill doors could be unlocked via computer terminal if your Nerd Stuff skill was high enough.
--The quest system is wonderful allowing for player exploration and ingenuity to play a big role in how any quest will pan out. 
--RPG's are about decisions and Wasteland 3 lacks none in this department you do have a large impact on Colorado, and Arizona's future.
--Wasteland 3 lives in the moral gray and at the end leaves you to decide if your decisions we're right or wrong.
--As in any post-apocalyptic game with Bryan Fargo as the lead there are plenty of references and humor hidden throughout the world.
--The reputation system plays quite a big role allowing for different outcomes with different factions based on your previously established standing.
--With the way quest's and decisions work the replayability for this game is off the charts and finding motivation for repeat playthroughs shouldn't be hard at all.

Cons-
--The Bugs there is quite a bit of polish that can still be done to this game. I never personally ran into anything gamebreaking except for something I'm calling Reagan Hell which I will touch on below.
--The pathing is quite janky and poor, there were quite a few time where you will have to wait for your team to cross a large map where if they are not baby sat through it they will take the shortest path leading to things like walking through fire ect...
--While it's in the pro section as well the classic Bryan Fargo comedy can hamper setting a correct tone for the story at points.
--While the game had a great soundtrack throughout I wish the final boss I fought would have had a unique song as well.

My personal thought's and experience:

     Here I'll start with the Reagan Hell I mentioned earlier. There comes a point where you interact with a stature of Ronald Reagan as part of a story quest. The entire area around the Reagan Stature was riddled with gamebreaking bugs for me from NPC's dropping off the face of the Earth to suddenly going invisible, Factions in that area turning hostile for no reason, and that was the only area where the game crashed at all. With all the resetting due to bugs I would say it accounted for around 10 hours of my playthrough. 
     Through Reagan Hell and all of Colorado I saw my character builds thrive in the many diffent ways, and enjoyed a very competent turn based combat system. I saw my decisions have long reaching effects, and hardly ever fall into a black vs white category. At the end I was treated to a great peace of music and left to decide for myself if I had done the correct thing. Wasteland 3 is a buggy and beautiful game that I will gladly start a second playthough of as soon as I post this review.

edit: (after finishing)
It's a little buggy and maybe needed another month in the oven, 100%. There are some bugs I've seen that would have been caught with a small amount of testing. This game obviously had none. Consider this a beta for the remainder of the review.

Thinking of this like a beta, the bugs get super more forgivable, and not any less frustrating. I had to skip at least 2 zones because of them. But there's a VERY solid core here that has room to improve (and not a lot) and the bugs once fixed will make this game a very solid piece of work. 

However: that's going to be down the line. If someone came up to me and called me an idiot for playing this game now instead of waiting for 3-4 months, or even the Director's Cut, I'd tell them to calm down but I wouldn't tell them they were wrong. 

Ultimately, I had a few friends jonsing HARD for a CRPG. This delivers. If you can't wait, the bugs are fine enough to get around.

18,75673882,english," Did you enjoy Fallout Tactics or Wasteland 2?   Then this is the game for you!   

The game plays quite similar to Wasteland 2 in that you make up to 4 of your own Rangers and then can recruit other people that you encounter in the game world that have their own personalities.  This time around however the recruited characters don't go rogue and shoot you in the back repeatedly (looking at you Schootmo).     Overall Wasteland 3 is much more forgiving than it's predecessor ever was.   Every level now you gain 1 stat point as well as 3 skill points and a perk point every 3 levels to assign as you see fit.  This lets you fairly quickly specialize your team in whatever way you see fit.   
 
 The combat is still a 3/4ths top down overview of a grid based map, which can be zoomed in and out (though not out nearly enough) as well as rotated as needed so that you are able to see everything that is going on.   Combat plays out with you giving each of your characters orders to move / shoot / heal / take cover etc.   Setting your party up to ambush enemies is a must as you are frequently out numbered and out gunned.   Those darn exploding pigs and psycho clowns will make quick work of your team if you wander into them unprepared.   Instead it's beneficial to place your party around the map and then have someone take a potshot at the nearest enemy to initiate combat.   Overall the combat is pretty basic, and is nearly identical to Wasteland 2, with the exception of vehicles and perks that were added this time around.  Perks can be anything from oh look my explosions are bigger to ha I just sprayed half the map with 100 bullets and mowed down anything not in cover. 

 So the combat is decent and a good chunk of the game, but where Wasteland 3 sets itself apart is in the way that the world is written and reacts to you.   About half way through my first play through of the game I managed to end up in a world where most of the major factions you earn rep with had been completely destroyed.  Some by my hand, some by my utter incompetence.  It was great, until I realized all the best vendors weren't able to be looted.   How dare you not let me pillage?   
 
The premise of the story is that you are headed from Arizona to Colorado to help the Patriarch regain control of his territory in exchange for food and supplies.   As soon as you get to Colorado everything falls apart.   After the initial briefing whatever happens in the world is largely up to you.   Every bit of the world oozes with moral shades of gray.  Nobody is innocent and nothing you do can save everyone.   It comes across as a well lived in and realistic world through which your journey takes place.

36,75644322,english,"Wasteland 3 is a Diamond In The Rough, that should have had more time grinding out the bugs and polishing. That's the truth of the game as of September 8th, 2020. Don't come in here expecting a AAA Quality from the 2000s back when QA teams were actually worth something. Temper your expectation for that though, and I think you'll find a gemstone.

So, let me tell you about what I liked:
- Skills matter. Mechanics will let you walk up to someone who wants to keep you on the other side of the room, First Aid will let you fix people up who will then let you into their compound, no questions asked or shots fired, and Toasters... Toast, but also carry Power Armor? Everything is useful!
- Animal Friendship is a thing, and one hell of a thing to be. I'm pretty sure Major Tomcat will retire with more kills than my Sniper.
- HOW you end a character's turn actually means something. If you didn't use all of your AP, you can Overwatch (with a bonus to accuracy for how many extra AP you have) you can 'Prepare' (transfer up to 2 AP to your next turn) or the traditional Hunker Down (bonus to Dodge depending on how much AP you spend)

Now, for the bad: (Disclaimer: None of these gripes were enough to make me put down the game, but you have to take the good with the bad)
- Terrible, Terrible Load Times. Do not be surprised if your 3000$ rig still takes three minutes to load a save file... including 'Quickload' which... it isn't.
- Character Building feels terrible. Not enough Strength? A spark from a firepit will kill you. Not enough Coordination or Speed? You can either shoot or move, not both. Not enough Intellect? Have fun trying to learn anything, including how to handle your gun. It hurts to lose anything, but it also hurts to *not* have everything at max. Baseline growths need to be improved...
- Speaking of Character Creation, not enough tooltips to explain what the hell things are. Penetration? Sneak Time? Toaster Repair? R&D is never explained properly...
- Perks. Are. Broken. I'm using a Medkit and Toasty activates... MY BANDAGES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HEAL MY ALLIES [b]JUST SET THEM ON FIRE![/b]
- Can't live without those perks though. You HAVE to take Weird Science to 6 because of Microwave Research. If you don't do that, then Scorpitrons will be using your rear end as a new holster for their minigun turret tail.
- Oh... Scrapping anything sucks. I don't even know what Scrap is supposed to do... And no, Scrounger's Touch will NOT get you that scope on the Megascope.
- Should REALLY be an option to sell or scrap weapons below a certain grade while I'm on the subject. I'm running around with ATOM DESTABILIZERS, I DON'T WANT ANOTHER CRAPPY 3 WEAPON SKILL REQUIREMENT.
- Pistols? Never use them. They have crap range, crap damage, and honestly are just outperformed by every other weapon type. Which also makes...
- Lucia Wesson, for all her story hooks, may well be the most dead weight companion I have ever seen. She WILL die if lit on fire, even when I'm using my medkits. Her abysmal strength makes her dead weight which is a damn shame.
- Companion Weapons... what exactly is the point again? These really need to get changed so they do elemental damage, because Pizepi is the only one worth investing into considering her default is an energy weapon so it doesn't get screwed by anyone wearing a wool sweater.
- Stealth? in MY Wasteland? Nope, enemies have 360 degrees of vision, even if I'm crouched behind cover, they will still spot me. You CAN abuse patrols, but those were clearly designed that way.
- If you don't have a select all squadmate hotkey memorized, you WILL have situations where you left one person on the other side of the MAP, which is especially annoying in battle.
- Oh, and those Animal Companions will PUSH YOU OUT OF COVER AND BLOCK YOUR PATHING. I couldn't win without them, but damn it I have had to use far too many medkits on my allies because animals forced them to stand in a terrible spot.
- You ALSO need to use Medkits on them. Why don't they heal out of combat? Hell if I know, but they don't, so you gotta heal them yourself. ESPECIALLY if they are on fire or poisoned, they will die if you don't heal them through that.

Finally, some things I'd like to see:
- Character Creation Screen and loading systems. I'd like to make my Ranger and then just be able to load that appearance and set-up in the future.
- More use of the Animated Character Cutscenes. Every time they came up made the conversations about a hundred times more lively. I don't expect every character animated, but maybe I'd like to see the Patriarch react (or not react) to things when I go to report to him. It was always great when it happened and I'm really disappointed it didn't happen more than once for any character.

Innovation is something you will not get. There is nothing here you have not seen before and frankly, I think that is why the game is so popular. The game is chicken noodle soup. Nothing special but makes you feel warm and fuzzy. 

What makes me hot and angry rather than warm and fuzzy is when one of the many bugs essentially breaks your roleplay choices. In several fights, I had allies switch sides and become enemies. Sometimes this is by design, but often, it is just because of bad programming. For instance, a turret that you put down will be considered an enemy. Or maybe an NPC ally.

53,75655152,english,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]

This game in particular have me at a crossroads. I am a long time fan of the Wasteland series and I really enjoyed how Wasteland 2 Directors Cut (From here on out DC) played. It was a big improvement over Wasteland 1. The reviews are mostly positive and everyone seems to like this version of the game but I feel like I may be the only one that misses some items from the previous games. So I may be a voice in the dark. 

However, this game however feels watered downed from a game play functionality and is missing what I feel made Wasteland 2 DC so great. But I'll start with what I liked from Wasteland 3 and move into what I think was gotten wrong. Also there are a lot of comments about BUGS I myself haven't hit any or if I have I haven't noticed........yet (28 hrs as of this review). 

[h1]What I liked[/h1]

[b]The Characters:[/b]
This time around the Characters are much more alive and I really like how the dialog works and its much more engaging over the other games. Why? In wasteland 1, 2 DC it never zoomed in on the person you were talking to. This one it does for the ones that it supports. Others its still top down. 

[b]The Story:[/b]
Really good. You can really get lost in all the lore. Pick up right after the end of Wasteland 2 DC.

[b]The Graphics:[/b]
Boy oh boy does this thing shine compared to the other games. Much more polished this time around. Its not a grimy as the other games but that's not a bad thing. The Griminess of the first two did have its own allure/theme. 

[b]Carry weight: [/b]
Nice that inventory is shared between all party members and there doesn't appear to be carry weight.

[b]The World Map:[/b]
The Rescue Radio option is super nice. If you are about to die and are not near a safe location you can radio up and you'll be taken back to your starting point and your party will be fully healed and tank repaired. Though this option was not in the previous games.

[h1]What I didn't like[/h1]
Now on to what I didn't like. A disclaimer I am a big fan of Wasteland 2 DC and kinda Wasteland 1 but mainly 2 and the play style of that game. 

[b]The UI:[/b]
Unlike in Wasteland 2 DC this time around they've removed conversation and action log that was in the first two games and now tucked it away in a menu somewhere. This makes it really annoying to have to keep opening it up just to find what someone said. Also, you miss anything that may have been a perception check as well since that no longer logs. In my option this should at lest be added back or an option to have it added to the UI. 

[b]The Combat:[/b]
Kinda the same but kinda not. Has a bit of a different feel to it. I do not like the quickslot limitation in comparison to the other games. It doesn't make sense, since that anytime during battle you can open your inventory and swap items with out any penalty. Yes, there is a perk to add more but what a waste of a skill point. It seems that it was add simply to add difficulty to the game but its really more of an annoyance.  

[b]The Skills:[/b]
One thing that I really liked about the other wasteland series is that depending on the level of your skills affected the success rate of executing that skill. So if you had Level 6 lock picking you and you tried to unlock a Level 10 chest/door/etc you would have like a 30% success rate and a 50% critical failure rate and the opposite was true if you had a Level 10 lock pick and tried a level 6 chest you pretty much had a 99-100% success rate. In this version of the game it's a either or; either you have a high enough level or you don't. There is no option to roll the dice to see if you can pass the check. Same goes with all the other skills. I can't ""risk it for the biscuit."" The Hard/Kiss A** rolls are still the same from the previous game. 

[b]World Travel:[/b]
I hate that I cannot scroll around the map and I'm locked to my truck/tank. And there is no option to open the map and click where I want to go. Maybe that later in the game but right now it sucks. To navigate you can right click the far end of you map and you tank will move to it but destinations are far and you'll be doing that multiple times. Or you can click and hold and your tank will follow your mouse. In wasteland 2 DC you can just click a map or destination and your unit will move on its own. But if you play with a controller I guess you could ""drive"" your tank around the map...

[h1]My overall option of the game:[/h1]

I like it. I don't think that this should be called Wasteland 3 even though it follows the same story. it probably should be called ""Wasteland"" or ""Wasteland: Reloaded"" since this feels like it was released for a wider audience (general console players) which makes since why some of these changes were made. And console players will not have any idea about 1 or 2 DC so it kinda-has-to-be its ""own"" standalone story.  But, I feel that it watered down the wasteland experience and this makes it feel like a reinvention of the game. And that's not a bad thing I do enjoy playing this version of the game but I am always reminded of the features they got right in the previous Wastelands that are not in this game.

[list]
[*] 7/10 - If you liked the older series and how they played (myself included). 
[*] 8/10 - If you didn't or weren't a huge fan of how they played but like the game anyways.
[*] 9/10 - If you are brand new to the series and never played a wasteland game before. However you may not like the older series if so - buyer beware if you're thinking of picking them up. Watch some YouTube videos first. 
[/list]

Somethings I would change if I could that would make this game a 10/10 for me are in order of importance:
[olist]
[*] Add back the option for the action/convo logs on screen (even if that has to be a checkbox in settings)
[*] Add back the skill check rolls 
[*] Let me move the camera around the world map 
[*] Add back the quickslots

Load times were not as bad as complaints would make them to be on a mid-range recently built rig with SATA SSD. Your mileage may vary but I didn't run into any issues there. 

Definitely the Fallout 3 I actually wanted instead of the Bethesda series.

The goofy tone of the E3 reveal trailer is severely toned down in the actual game (what the hell was that, for real? nearly threw me off the series entirely) but there is still a lot of attempts at 'we want to be Borderlands' in the non-critical corners of the game. Felt like one of the writers was on the wrong game design team more than anything. 

Too spoilery to discuss further but the plot takes the same kind of terrible 'kill-your-heroes' turns that's all the rage in popular media these days, personally not a fan. But there's enough done right throughout the game to keep you playing through to the end, even if you don't necessarily like the outcomes ultimately available to you to choose from. 

TL;DR - good, maybe wait for a discount, but also worthwhile if you need a fix during this in-between big releases period we're in currently.

I'm playing solo on pc, I believe the worst bugs are on coop and consoles.

It does load slowly, using an ssd and fairly good computer and a load can take 30 to 45 seconds, which is silly for a rather low graphic-intensive game to have.  Considering how often you start to zone in and out of places after the first part of the game, this is tiresome.  Again, consoles have it much worse.

If you want an outstanding RPG to play with a friend, look no further. I bought this with no prior experience to any wasteland game and I'm rating it a whole $60 recommendation. I'm even going to get the deluxe edition right after i get done typing this review. Let the 'Day one launch version' of this game be placed in the library of congress so that my descendants may enjoy this masterpiece as their ancestor once had. 

I don't do reviews on games often and i haven't even beat this game yet. I'm pretty sure my bud and I haven't even left the first area. I've been playing this game for a total of 26.1 hours (all co-op) and this is my undisputed favorite RPG so far. I've played many RPG's but none have made me more happy to play with a friend until now. 

Yes, there are game-breaking bugs right now, but I cant imagine playing without them. Playing the game in its current state is not only still enjoyable, its an EXPERIENCE I have been BEGGING for. I love the absolute chaos the game has laid out for us. Even though the game itself is absolutely wonderful with its good story, OUTSTANDING writing and amazing XCOM-style combat, I absolutely wish I could play this game forever with the amount of outrageous bugs that leave me and my friend gasping for air with how funny these experiences are. I know the devs are good enough to patch the game, but i revel in the thought of going back into the day one version of this game and playing a chaotic, buggy mess. 

For example, when you first reach the world map, A man named Erastus calls you saying he will slaughter a family if you don't arrive within the hour. My friend and i didn't care and decided to explore. He calls you after some time saying he will kill the family now since he is tired of waiting. My friend and I shrugged after hearing the screams over the radio and continued to explore. Since this experience, he has called us over 20 times saying he is tired of waiting and shall kick down the exact same door and slaughter the exact same family. It has become a running gag and continues to leave us in tears with how he keeps somehow finding new families to kill in the same house. 

Other large mission have also repeated themselves with the amount of intense sequence-breaking we have done accidentally and, for any other game, we would be upset. Although, this game is too fun to stop there. I knew this game had an intense post-apocalyptic story, but to think this game has alternative timelines is a thought I like to exercise.",1599555496,1599555496,True,1,0,0.500756382942199707,0,True,False,False,76561198079977656,934,6,3253,601,1568,1601940380,,
75,75637665,english,"I've recently stopped playing Destiny 2 and for the past few months I've put over 500 hours into Fallout 76 (which I didn't buy until they introduced NPC's in the Wastelanders update). I've grinded hard for some of the best end-game gear in Fallout 76, so I now find that I've not been spending as much time playing the game. I've since been itching to get hooked on another game and potentially relive some of the more OG Fallout experiences.

I bought Rage 2 on sale (I loved Mad Max), played it for an hour or so and just couldn't get into it. I bought Control on sale, and whilst it's a super stylish and visually quite stunning game with great gameplay, 6hrs in over a few days and I just haven't quite gotten hooked on it. I tried a new Fallout 4 play-through but just couldn't get past doing Preston's dirty work. I tried to replay New Vegas, started to mod it a little, got a bit into it but stopped as soon as I hit the strip. I tried replaying Fallout 1, but it just felt too old school, then I found out about Wasteland 3.

I was initially hesitant to buy this game as I read up on a lot of people having issues with hard crashes, bugs and slow 1 minute+ loading screens on both consoles and on PC too but I bit the bullet and man I'm glad I did!

I'm on PC (built my machine in 2017 with a GTX 1080 on Windows 10) and got the game through Steam. I installed the game on my SSD as I wanted to try to mitigate the slow loading times. I've put just over 40hrs into the game and I've had not one single crash and no bugs at all. Loading screens are AOK at 15-30 seconds (yet still quite immersion breaking). I'm definitely hooked! I find myself emotionally invested into the characters at such a fast rate (which I love) and I also find myself laughing out loud at the dialogue at times which is awesome. I've also just started playing co-op with a mate, and whilst I definitely prefer playing the game solo, we've been at it for 2 days now with no issues at all (looks like the last patch might have fixed a lot of co-op issues).

I didn't want to chime in that I'm not having issues with the game to rub it into the faces of people who are, but sometimes people who are not having issues don't chime in at all (as there's usually no reason to) and all you read are the negatives.

I've been a fan of Wasteland ever since I played wasteland 2 about a year or two ago and ended up loving it more than I had any right to. When I heard wasteland 3 was coming out I was thrilled, and ended up buying it as soon I could. After clocking almost 60 hours and nearly beating the game I think I'm ready to share my thoughts

PROS -

-Choices

Every choice seemed to be cohesive and almost every one impacted other relations and factions throughout the game. having each decision you make having consequences down the line really forced me, as the player, to think about what I was doing even in seemingly menial situations.

-Factions

While some within Colorado Springs tended to be a little bland, the factions outside were all amazingly fun. From tribal communities that fashioned corpses into kites, to a group of people worshipping a digital version of Ronald Reagan, learning about the groups that inhabited the greater Colorado area was a joy to do, with some hilarious dialoge to accompany.

-Music

I'm shocked more people aren't talking about this. The music in this game ranges from good, to phenomenal and is in fact how this game really hooked me. When I was fighting the Dorsey's in the opening sequence the musical number just took it to another level that I find hard to describe. To my pleasure the game has several moments akin to that. It's something I struggle to describe and would recommend you experience for yourself

-Voice acting 

The entire game is voice acted, which, outside of being impressive, is welcomed.

NEUTRAL

-The writing 

 The writing, especially in the beginning of the game has a very juvenile tone, that can be very jarring at times. While this did improve with time, it was difficult to get around.

-Combat 

I want to preface that the combat is good, but towards the end of the game started to get stale, with the ability to almost ignore tactics all together. However when you did have to think, it really shined.

CONS

-Bugs

 There are a lot, Two that stood out was text remaining on screen and an infinite money glitch with the dye merchant in the Bizarre. There were also issues with models disappearing and some abilities missing cooldowns and being non functional for seemingly no reason. Also while I'm sure it's improved with the 1.1 patch, Co-op was unplayable when I tried it.

-Complexity 

 This won't matter to most people but throughout the game I felt that there were areas that were dumbed down to make it more accessible to audiences. While I understand this move and really don't mind it all that much, and doubt many people would even notice or care about it, I do miss some of the cRPG mechanics that are notably missing from the game.



In all it's an 8/10 game, at least when it's played solo, that could easially be 9/10 with patches. I would recommend to any fan of RPGs. A worthy successor to Wasteland 2.",1599546673,1599546848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999413246,237,3,8409,0,3457,1600535650,,
85,75633724,english,"I think most of the negative reviews are in response to a shoddy co-op implementation, which is fair. This review is for the single player game:

The game is excellent. Its super well written, and has plenty of strategic and tactical depth. Its not nearly as demanding or difficult as wasteland2, which I think is a good thing to be honest. I liked what WL2 was trying to do, but I never got very far into it because of how slow the combat was, and how unpolished the experience felt. This solves both of those problems. Systems are streamlined while still offering depth, combat feels punchy and faster paced without being brainless.

The writing is *mostly* does a good job of walking the line between wacky and serious, and it pulls both off well. As an example, there is a clown worshiping cult that at first seems like its a surface level wacky joke. The more I interacted with them though, the more they seemed like an actually interesting take on the joker cult trope. The manic forced laughter mixed with fear and doubt as they remarked on their friends getting dismembered, and eerie depictions of jesus in clown makeup actually turned this otherwise unremarkable faction into one of my faves.

4 quacks out of 5

Before I get into the game... !!BUGS!! as of today(Sep 7th 2020) there are still plenty of them! I have ran into quest bugs, occasional crashes, enemies throwing grenades through walls, and plenty of UI bugs ranging from annoying to game-killing. I never lost more than a few minutes of progress since I saved after each battle... But I hear multiplayer is a lot worse. The load times are also long. I can deal with it on my SSD, but I would NOT recommend running it on an HDD, at least not unless that gets fixed.

Now to the actual game. I am a huge fan of Wasteland 2 and played through it twice when it came out. So I have been waiting for over 5 years for the sequel, and my expectations were very high. Thankfully those expectations have been met - mostly. Wasteland 3 gives the same heavily story-driven RPG experience, with the emphasis on weighty player decisions that have lasting effects within the story. (And on the gameplay.) Reading several dialog choices over and over trying to decide whether and how to kill someone, is a common situation in this game. Combat is top-down, grid-based, and turned based, quite strategic, very similar to the previous game.

It is NOT similar to Fallout 3/New Vegas/Fallout 4. They are post-apocalyptic, that's where the similarities end. In terms of tone and atmosphere: If Fallout 4 is Star Wars, Wasteland 3 is Blade Runner. It is darker, more gritty, coarse. There is some humor, but it's always delivered deadpan. Seemingly aimed at an older audience, there are a few cultural references that might fly above younger heads. However, that kind of thing makes up a very small part of the game. Mostly weird stuff you read in item descriptions. Oh yeah, make sure to read all of those.

The skill checks work the same as in Wasteland 2, for example you might run into a door you can't open unless someone in your party has their lockpick skill raised to 5. You might run into a thug you'll either have to fight, or you can scare him off if you have someone with Hard Ass raised to 8.

The character attributes and skills seem broadly similar to Wasteland 2, however there HAS been some simplification. Item weight/item size has been done away with, which means you don't have to manage your inventory at all. I feel like there are somewhat less pieces of equipment in the game, and less ways to organize them. You can still mod weapons and armor, and with weapons in particular there are plenty, allowing for lots of different character builds. There are several categories of weapons I didn't use at all, that I will explore on my second playthrough.

Another simplification taken was dividing the battles into a player's turn and an enemy's turn. In Wasteland 2, the Initiative stat would determine how often every character moved, and in what order they got to move. Now it's divided into your turn where you get to move them all in any order, and the enemy turn where they all get to move. I'm not sure if they had to do that for multiplayer, or just did it to simplify things - but it does create slightly less variation in the battles and less variation between builds.

These simplifications are minor complaints though. Not nearly as bad as what happened to Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age. The spirit of Wasteland 2 is still very much in tact, for the most part. But there are some balance issues...

I bumped the difficulty up one from the default to Ranger (3 out of 4). I was expecting that this would have me managing bullets on the same level as Wasteland 2, which was survival-horror-esuqe in that regard - meaning you need to think about every shot, because you die from running OUT of bullets just as much as you die getting HIT by bullets. But they never really felt that hard to find. Medpacks were even more plentiful. I think I only had to buy medpacks two or three times throughout the *entire game*, by the end I had a stockpile of 50 without even trying.

""Maybe I'm just a pro at Wasteland and need to try the highest difficulty."" Well, throughout half the game I was regularly getting one-shotted, even my tank with the heaviest armor. Even though I'm several levels above recommended for the quest... So I imagine that issue would become very annoying at the highest difficulty.

There was a cyborg body-mod feature that seemed to come in at the very end of the game, like the last 4 hours (of 65) that I did not use at all. I managed to beat the final battles on first try without using any of it. Seems like a weird thing to introduce at the very end of the game... almost like they plan on expanding the late-game section more later. 

The bottom line with this game is: I spent 65 hours playing it, and enjoyed each one. I definitely plan a second playthrough to explore other branches of the story, and a couple new character builds. Replay value is huge here, but I'm waiting a couple months. Hopefully, all the bugs will be worked out and the combat will get some fine-tuning. That would easily take this game up to the coveted 5-quacks rating.  🦆",1599542535,1599542535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561199064524486,17,2,4043,0,4043,1599535448,,

This CRPG, hand in hand with DOS:2, will be loved as the masterful classics they are. They will be credited with revitalising the genre and bringing it into the moderna era.

The morality and humour of this game will also stand the test of time. It provides a nuanced view on grey moral issues whilst also remaining apolitical. It is completely up to the player to choose what you think as well as the world your actions leave behind, instead of being pigeon-holed into 'this is the good choice' and 'this is the bad choice'. Life is more complicated than that, and the writers have gone to a lot of effort to include these truths of relative morality into their game - and i'll stress to say it again - whilst remaining apolitical.

98,75627548,english,"TL;DR - Probably one of the best CRPG's of all time. Beat the game on ranger difficulty at about 50 hours. Gameplay and story are a+, although sometimes the game stutters and has excessive load times between scenes. Early on this gets tiring, you can also optimize the game by putting it on fullscreen. Battle system is a blend of xcom, divinity original sin, and fallout. Customization in this game is pretty entertaining, loot systems keep you interested in side quests, and decisions made in the plotline actually matter. Characters are rich with interesting back stories, graphic cutscenes is similar to Borderlands

Gameplay: Battles - you can tell the developers put gameplay in mind first. It's an absolute blast, the gameplay mechanics are a mixture between xcom2, divinity original sin, and fallout. It's most similar to xcom2. You start with 2 characters, but end up controlling 6 later. There's a player phase and an enemy phase, similar to most turn-based strategy games. Each character is given a number of AP (action points) per turn, where they can move, shoot, use skills, etc. The game encourages you to diversify your characters, because ammo is scarce in the wasteland. So you want a well balanced party, e.g. a sniper to pick up far enemies, a shotgun expert for close range combat, etc. There's terrain obstacles on the field like explosive barrels or generators that control gun turrets, so you need to prioritize what to take out first

Gameplay: Weapons Customization - If your a fan of shoot-n-loot games (borderlands 3), this game ticks off all the checkboxes. There's plenty of unique weapons in the game, and lots of ways to mod it however you want. You can turn your shotgun into a sniper if you want (which I totally did!). Sometimes you get creative and create a combination that just destroys everything and it soooo rewarding when it happens.

Gameplay: Class Customization - Classes in this game work similarly to Fallout. The developer is an ex-fallout developer, so go figure. It revolves around two core mechanics - Attributes, and skills. Attributes control your characters base stats like HP, combat speed, crit, etc. Skills control the ability to wield guns, disable traps in the world, lockpick, etc. If you ever played baldur's gate, never winter night, or more recently divinity original sin, this will feel right at home. It's DnD at it's core. You can mix and match skills that best suit your party. Want to be a stealth shotgunner? Or a heavy flamethrower dude who also tames animals? The choice is yours

Gameplay: Open World. You get a vehicle pretty early on in the game. You use it to drive to different cities, and sometimes encounter random battles along the way. Managing your vehicle and expanding your base are things you do along the way, recruiting allies to your faction. It can be a bit tedious though given load times here

Story: Decisions. Throughout the game, you need to make tough decisions. An early one is whether you kick refugees out of the base or let them stay, these ultimately influence how the game pans out later. You might even find those refugees out in the wild, angry at the decision you made and leaving them out to die. That's how this game is angled, there's no right decisions just less wrong ones. Some dialog options are blocked off unless your party meets certain criteria (like how skilled they are in first aid, etc)

Story: Character Development. There's a bunch of companions you can recruit in this game. About 8. But your party can only have 4 of them at a time, and who you choose in your party actually matters. Different factions react differently to certain members in your party. And those options affect what choices you make, which alters the ending. Some of the characters have backstories that tie into the main storyline, so be sure to take them along.

Story: Plotline. If you like Fallout New Vegas, you'll like this. Your tasked to build back the Rangers and bring order to Colorado. You get ambushed and your squad gets wiped out, and you start to uncover the secrets of Colorado and who rules it.

Graphics - It's blend of fallout / xcom. The environments are well crafted and tell a story about what's happening in the world. For instance, you'll see people that are homeless in huts and campfires, and those that are rich that live with servant bots. Things make sense in this game, and it only adds to the surrealism. Some of the major characters have flavorful personalities, and the animation styling during cutscenes reminds me of Borderlands

Sound - Not much to write home about, the voice acting is OK sometimes, but it's not as bad as english translations from Japanese RPGs.",1599533031,1599533031,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197983959492,250,10,4361,0,4337,1599533124,,

2,75118103,english,"Hello,

My review on Wasteland 3 will be based on the game itself when compared to other games of similar play style such as XCOM, Fallout 1 and 2, Wasteland 2 and the Divinity series. I will not include how I think they should have shaped their story or how I would have changed any perks and such. I only want to review the game as it is.

Sound: 8/10 
The boss music is superb. The remix to these noticeable tracks is outstanding and really some of the best I have had the pleasure of hearing. It is the normal battles where there is no music that can be a bit disappointing. 
The voice acting is on point. Each character has flavor and personality. Even the gangs are distinct in how they speak with the Payasos and Gippers standing out to me. My encounter with Victory is one I will not forget for an awfully long time.

Graphics: 7/10
The visuals in this game are awe taking. The shadows, explosions and blaze detail can be spectacular when you zoom in and look at it. But that is when the game is not have stutter issues or slowdowns. I am not sure why it does this since I have a beastly desktop, but it is what it is. During cut scene, I enjoyed seeing Liberty stare into my eye and Victory have a moment of sadness to lose his buddy.  I will note though that is the very same cut scene with Victory, his beard was noticeably not attached to his face.

Character Creation: 7/10
The character creation feels a bit simplified when compared to Wasteland 2. It is more in-depth than XCOM but pales when compared to Divinity. I feel as thought there could have been more effort put into the body composition difference between male and females. The voice choices are nice and the outfits themselves were also enjoyable. Not being able to include a typed in back story was something I was a bit sad about as well

Over world: 6/10
So here is where the game takes what I believe to be its biggest hit. The over world is large and detailed…. Detailed with a lot of empty space. There are very few side missions that involve you getting distress calls or finding a point of interest. In fact, most side quest are thrown at you during the main story and do not require you to go searching for them at all.  This was disappointing. There are Vaults that do not respawn after you find them, but I only counted 6 of these. 

Game play: 8/10
There are so many things to interact with and so many more way to use those things to approach an encounter. Do not have enough ammo to take out an enemy unit? Clear the mines in this secret path and activate a solar power3ed beam cannon to wipe out 3/4th of the enemy instead. See a heavy armored enemy? Sneak attach to increase your damage and critical hit chance. There were so many options to handle any situations that it is almost impossible to not find a way to get the upper hand without having to go for a direct attack. 

Replay-ability: 10/10
The mixture of character creation and how to approach each situation, this game possesses so much to offer. I beat the game but while I did it, I wrote down notes for future character builds, how I would approach them and with recruitable character. Want to create a support character? Mix mechanics and nerd stuff with small arms. You can toss turrets and then unload with a pistol or shot gun. Want to be an assassin? Mix Sniper rifles and blade weapons for both close and long distance combat. You can create a fire crazed psychopath who uses explosions and flame throwers to set the entire battlefield into a blaze.
This can also be carried over to Fame. Want to uphold Ranger law? Arrest and lock up criminals in Ranger HQ. Want to Earn the support of the Marshalls? Send detainees into them instead.
Want to rattle the Patriarch? Kill them kids.

Final Score: (7.6) 8/10
While the game has bugs such as the character reset bug and moment where the game stutters and slows down, I had no game breaking bugs in either my normal or ranger difficulty game plays. I did crash to desktop 3 time in 144 hours of game play. The quest journal is also a confusing mess at times. 
This game has flaws, but it also has love and attention to the story and options there of that inXile Entertainment is known for. This game is a must buy for me. I hope it is the same for you.

If you need any help or want to toss ideas back and forth about builds and play throughs, message me.

All of my hours of this has been played in coop, and I dont consider a single one of those less then great. The devs truly do a fantastic job in making sure that the game is optimized for two players, and both can feel like they matter in this great RPG storytelling of the Rangers. 

Combat feels gratifying, and all the combat options feel good. There are some improvements that could be made to turn order and clarity in why things happen, but these dont detract.

The story feels great, conversations with minor NPCs feels alive, and those first person major NPC conversations just shine in memory for giving the characters life.

The options and free agency you feel are great too. I feel like what Im doing is recognized, and my actions make a difference.

Overall I give this game, from a coop perspective, a 10/10 now that they have fixed a lot of the bugs and crashes. Though we do see the loading screen hang a bit every now and then.

17,75129456,english,"Update:
There is a real gem of a game under a heap of performance issues and an obviously pushed game release.
Just completed my first single player run on Ranger difficulty. I must say I really enjoyed this game for its CRPG elements and world building. The quests, character min/maxing, and late game skill and ability synergies are where games like this really shine. I thoroughly enjoyed some areas more than others and the random quirkiness of the characters and even some bugs added to the overall post apocalyptic vibe that I love. 

HOWEVER:
I still cannot recommend it at this time until it goes on sale for $40 and until they have patched it the hell up. I really thought I'd have the choice to go about the game ending in a fashion that fit my ideals cause of how you spend the entire game building up your forces and learning about the factions. Then the ending was supremely underwhelming to say the least and any illusion of choice while completing side quests and building rep with factions is thrown out the window by a A or B choice ending..  The biggest thing holding this game back is performance. The laggy performance made this downright infuriating to play at times, with the game simply grinding to a snails pace with constant long loading screens, waiting for the game engine to stutter through every AI's combat plus the ridiculous number of followers I had by the end, and in general the poor pathing of team AI that would initiate fights with the squad stacked on top of each other cause they were waiting for the followers to move before them. (These are just a few of the many performance issues) Every battle performing less than ideally and stuttering throughout made me just want to rush through to see how the story panned out by the end of the game. 

Initial mid-game thoughts: 

PROS: 
Intro and the potential they created with Ranger HQ really hooked me in.
Environment and voice acting for the most part is solid.
XCOM esque tactics are familiar and ok, not solid yet.

CONS:
Where's the payoff from that intro?
Why is it that the people we hire to work at HQ dramatically change the base. 
I was completely wrong when I thought that introducing the run down HQ meant that we could organize the base layout, invest in aesthetic/functional upgrades with junk/money. Instead thats all done whenever someone gets hired to fill a single position? It's jarring to come back and each time the base is more and more upgraded when the game starts with 2 survivors. Suddenly we've got the place staffed at 100? 
And this is just after I've completed the quest to staff up HQ. I haven't even finished all the quests in Colorado Springs. 
Why can't we craft ammo, turrets, or robots? Whats the point of all the junk we pick up other than selling?
Payasos are a really cringey faction that I don't find interesting at all. Latin psychos with the most blatant gringo accents? Satire? Or bad voice acting? I can't tell. 
Minute plus waits to load any area,.
The clunky movement
Too many fights start with your team coming out of a hallway with very limited cover to get to. So one person usually has to be the sacrificial lamb and draw AI fire. 
The ""boss"" fights Ive been in all stutter horribly once half the map is on fire, and doing a precision strike almost always stutters/freezes momentarily. 
Why is it that a hacker has to stand right next to a turret/robot to hack, which almost always results in that hacker getting downed cause they usually have to expose themselves to the entire AI's line of fire?
Why is there no fast travel? Aside from the tow. 
Lots of bugs affecting stats. Utility items are broken, perks don't work correctly. 

Final thoughts: I really want to like this game. I'm a huge fan of this type of game world. But the long wait times, the really really clunky fights and stuttering are making me consider putting this down until it receives some heavy patching.

35,75616292,english,"FOR CONTEXT: Completed the game on Ranger (aka Hard) difficulty, and have completed all but one side quest (because fuck you, Karen Wong). Started with William and Li Tsing, and ended with Lucia, Jodie, and two custom Rangers. I had not encountered any progress-blocking, or game breaking bugs.

OVERALL: To paraphrase a certain space DJ, death comes not from a single stab to the heart, but the hundred cuts about it. My overall enjoyment of this game simply died early into the game (before Denver, thereabouts) due to all the minor flaws, bugs, and general unpolished feel of this game. Even with my past experiences and expectations of a Faran Brygo game, a large part of me is simply annoyed I didn't wait at least a dozen patch cycles before paying full price for this.

MECHANICS: Combat and character progression is absolutely shallow, and largely unbalanced. While there is a wide variety of weapon types that allowed unique playstyles for each specialist, the upgrade paths were boringly linear. It was all about looking for the next item with higher damage numbers, and little to no unique interactions with the various stat lines, like accuracy, ammo count, etc. There was an inkling of potential when I picked up the legendary Red Ryder. Too bad 6 AP to blind at that point of the game was simply outclassed by 6 AP to one-shot an enemy. Here I was hoping to relive my Fallout 2 days of blowing craters through Advanced Power Armor with the same gun.

Combat was mostly fast, and brutal. My longest engagement was the Godfisher attack on Denver, although only because I was stalling for them to destroy the Reagan statue; otherwise, the final battle with Angela's Rangers lasted a grand total of two and a half rounds. This meant statuses like Poison and Bleed ended up being more of an annoyance for the player (cost of healing items), than any significance for the enemy.

Tying max health progression to Strength is one of the most inconceivably stupid decisions they made. Not only does it make no sense in a role-playing perspective, it literally breaks said experience by forcing builds to go full Strength just to avoid getting one-shot. Want to make an agile rogue with blades or a shotgun? Nope; gotta choose to be either a muscle-bound titan in Power Armor, or a mobile blood splatter.

Then there's Animal Whisperer. By the end-game, Major Tom and the Crawler Cub each had around six times the health pool of my max-Strength Ranger, could run across circles around the battlefield in a single turn, attack five times, and crit like nightmares in cuddly fur. My animal companions have literally survived attacks that would Down most of my squad. Simply astonishing.

Traits and backgrounds were largely inconsequential; most were simply stat numbers to min-max, and played no part in the general role-playing experience. This was very disappointing having just replayed Divinity: Original Sin 2, where the importance of the same two character-defining attributes were totally reversed, and thus made them more interesting.

The Perks system is an empty husk of an unrealized dream. Not only were they oddly spaced, but the inconsistency of availability could even lead to situations were one of my Rangers (Li Tsing with maxed Sniper Rifles, Kiss Ass, and Lockpicking, i.e. her base skills) ended the game with four extra Perk slots, simply because two of her Skills had no traits associated with them. Then, because inXile decided to alternate Perks for two weapon types for each Skill (where available), it meant that half my squad hit their ""power spike"" far earlier, and there was simply no feeling of anticipation and excitement for their subsequent levels. For example, I had two Rangers max out Small Arms to specialize in Pistols and Shotguns, respectively. While my shottie was eager to hit level 8 Small Arms to get Devastation, the pistolier (Lucia) was simply capped at level 5 after getting Trick Shot; after that, the skill points were only meaningful for weapon requirements.

Also, special shout out to one of the most ridiculous content-gating mechanics around. Despite Brian Fargo's portfolio, it's as if nobody in the team knew how radiation works...

ENVIRONMENT AND FACTIONS: I've seen many instances of games set in single-setting zones make their setting beautiful, if not dynamic. Heck, even in Wasteland 2, the sparse deserts of Arizona had more locales. This game was a trudge from one building to another, with nary a chance to even venture in a cave or other.

As for the various factions throughout Colorado, they felt pretty bland, with the highlights being the Monster Army and the Godfishers, both featuring some interesting themes. The Scar Collectors were as two-dimensional as the Hundred Families, while the Payasos simply sounded like a white guy writing Hispanics.

As for the main villains, Valor didn't even warrant a talking head, Victory was a cut-and-dry psychopath, and Liberty was just as single-minded. And it's just that: they were all written as villains, with no greys, no questions, no depth.

Conclusion: In the end, it was nigh impossible for me to feel enraptured in the Wasteland/Fallout setting of Brian Fargo as I did in my earlier life. I suppose it may be largely be attributed to the looming shadow that is Divinity: Original Sin 2, due to the broad similarities of both games. It could also been the sour aftertaste I still have of Torment: Tides of Numenera, after I rage quit the game after hitting a progress-blocking bug, umpteen years after its launch.

Then again, even if I ignore that comparison, this third iteration of the series didn't really feel more developed, or advanced than the last.

pros: art looks nice.
cons: forgot what art looks like. went shopping several times during a load screen. fell asleep multiple times.

It may look like I have 60+ hours of game time, but I've only played the game for about 8.

Review for Wasteland 3.
pros: story, music, voice acting are great.
cons: a game made by people who have no idea how computers work. waste of time. buggy. UI is garbage.
most recent annoyance: even if you recruit all the companions, you have to switch them into your party or else they don't show up on the party management screen. Yeah I invited VicB to my party because I want to shove his face in his dead mother's grave, but since i didn't immediately add him to my party I have no idea where he hangs out. Not in my base apparently.

This is one of those games that should be amazing but will never live up to its potential without better talent developing it. The unity engine is good. Other people use it to make great stuff.

78,75262861,english,"While the basic gameplay itself is fun, the co-op mode (haven't played single player yet) tends to be awfully broken at some points, wiping your questlog emtpy and resetting your base of operations to 0 progress. Unfortunately, you also cannot regain that HQ progress again, which means that most things you need like fixing your truck etc become unavailable, rendering the game almost impossible or at least very annoying to play.
If you never played Wasteland before: It basically is Fallout 1&2, but with a team. This includes the sometimes weird humor as well.

Pro:
- Intuitive skill system both allowing and requiring specialisation of your team members.
- Interesting quests and storytelling, spiced with twisted Fallout-style humor.
- You get to meet old acquintances.
- Sex with robots (and potentially goats).

Con:
- Lack of a actual crafting system. You get to put a few mods on guns and gear as well as your truck, but there is no real crafting system in place, as compared to Divinity: Original Sin 1&2
- Multiple issues in co-op mode. While some are just annoying (doors appear shut after picking the lock but can be passed), especially the removal of your active quests and the reset of your quest progress, that has happened multiple times to me now, is absolutely killing the fun on this game.
- Floating speech bubbles also tend to remain in the guest screen of a co-op game every now and then, after the conversation was completed minutes ago, blocking your sight and also annoying you.
- Loading screens of doom making up 20% of your gameplay time.
- Both enemies and you can shoot directly through walls, rendering the X-Com-like cover system sometimes useless.

Overall, in it's current state it is not worth 60€ and frankly, some more testing wouldn't have done any harm. As of now, it tends to feel like a late-stage beta rather than a full release.

Note: If have 30h of played time while writing this review, so maybe my mind changes to one side or the other in the future.

Update: I checked the single player mode as well and while quest and progress weren't deleted/reset here as well as faster loading screens, some major issues with the game itself remained. A tactical shooter that ignores walls renders the idea of tactical gameplay kinda useless.
A patch was released as well that fixed the quest loss/reset progress (at least for us), but the other issues remain active as of Sept 9. Also, the ending felt kinda rushed :(

Comparing it to Wasteland 2, story in this part definitely is more engaging; I haven't finished W2 because it became boring in the middle, with lots of tedious and not so interesting sidetasks, while W3 has much more to offer, but in a more compact way so that you don't waste your time on things that could bore you to hell.

While graphics are not the best in this generation, RPG elements and plot give you chance to completely ignore the visual part of the game and enjoy the game itself.

Combat is done better than in W2, in my opinion — it seems to be faster, and with a right team you can have multiple ways to win, sometimes without any shooting at all, if you invest in your specialists skillpoints.

On day 1 there were some bugs, but I can say that compared to some other RPGs I played this one looks rather polished (for instance, Pathfinder: Kingmaker had so many game-breaking bugs with important quest flags and so on, that I had to completely stop playing the title). Some bugs that I still encountered even after patch 1.1.0 (at the time of this review): sometimes name of the map/encounter stays on the screen (but you can hit ""Esc"" to go to main menu and then get back to reset this label), and there's a problem with one quest flag about the prisoner you encounter on your first visit to Ranger HQ; in the ending mission he reappeared in his cell as if I never released him.

Game breaking bugs aren't much TBH, except it delete your save files, or you don't have old save that can let you get back the lost mission item from inventory bug. 

You will find that you will need to load save often when the dialogue chosen frozen, some interface won't disappear blocking your button press etc, not game breaking but annoying.

You will find difficulty don't matter, all it does is just give enemy HP boost and nothing else. Don't bother with exp farm or perks about exp gain or lost either. Enemy will simply spawn according to your level making this totally irrelevant. Yeah much to destroy progress and RPG element.

You will find you editing the save files to do developer's job for them, because there are bugs that don't apply correct stat and perk to your new customized team member. Not game breaking, just incompetent developer.

You will find you avoid putting team member into inactive, and would consider them dead once do that because there are bug that would randomize their stat. Giving one of my guy a -7 on a skill for example. Surprise the game don't crash.

I've never played a wasteland game before, but I am a pretty big fallout fan, and wasteland 1 is basicially what fallout came from. The setting is somewhat similar to fallout, instead of the apocolypse happening in 2077 in a retrofurisitic time, it happened in 1986 i think. except we were more advanced since we have laser guns and robots. I'm a little fuzzy as to why the bombs fell but it doesn't really matter anyway. 


Lets start off with the pros
If you are a fan of fallout 2, you will most likely enjoy this game. It isn't as humorous as fallout 2 was, but there are plenty of references to other things in here to keep you satisfied. The combat is very reminiscient of XCOM 2 which i really like as well so it was easy to get ahold of it. There are also quite a few good covers of songs in this game too, washed in the blood of the lamb is my favorite

now for the cons, since it isn't a perfect game (close though)
for starters, its suprisingly buggy, even after being delayed at least once and extra money from microsoft. while this will probably be fixed soon, and i never crashed or encountered anything super memorable there were enough where it got annoying. my other major complaint is when starting combat, there is no way to engage turn based mode (since when exploring it isn't turn based) to make it easier to set up your squad in cover before starting the attack on the enemy, so you have to guess at what may or may not be cover. then you have to try to click on an enemy who is keeps walking away to try and target him to get hit. this isn't a major concern since as you play more of the game you get used to it. Another con i have is there isn't an endgame lightsaber unique weapon, but the best sword is a chainsword from 40k? while i understand not wanting to have disney breathing down your neck, laser swords are in everything! Come on! Let me have one in the dlc! that you guys are hopefully making!

Overall this is so far my game of the year, and if your a fan of CRPGs then this is a must buy. this really scratches that itch since pillars of eternity really never could do that for me.

13,75574812,english,"for 2020 It started with Enderal(free) which was  a fun 40 hours - well 35 hours of great fun and 5 hours of torturous cut scenes. 
Then I switched to  Path of Exile league(free - I buy tabs for 10-20$)-  100+ hours -
after I got bored of POE i was unfortunate with game selection and 
I spent  a good amount of hours and $$ on some  games that weren't fun .  Most i refunded 
but some i gave a chance(over 2 hours). .
I finally found  The Forest(20 dollars)  which is  a masterpiece, for another 100+ hours.
And then I got lucky because the next game was
this one , wasteland 3, which will be  over 60  hours of fun  I'm sure. 
 This is the most expensive game I've bought in 2020 but worth it regardless.
It potentially saved me  hours of unhappy game play.  

You can see that I am price conscious. That I worry about cost. And you can see that I like good games.  
And  I think WL3 is worth the 60$ price it. I don't pay 60$ for a bad game. I'd pay 60 or more for POE if I had to,
and probably 60 for the forest(knowing what I know now but I wouldn't have paid it to play) . 
So make of that what you will. 
The story is compelling and fairly easy to follow.
the writing is extremely efficient. It's easy to follow the lore if you want to.
Interactions with NPCs are fun. I'm actually reading the dialouge not just clicking through. 
The combat has enough elements to keep it interesting and the skill tree is interesting  
and level progression is rewarding and fun.
The characters are fun enough. Sort of a  Bad Lands and WL2 fusion. The voice acting is OK
You feel the snow and cold which is a good thing. 
And party building is superb.

14,75572750,english,"At it's core the game is really good.  Unfortunately it needs another year of development.  I say a year not just because there are lot of bugs but it's also clear that the second half of the game was cut out and replaced by one large multi part ""dungeon"" and a very minimal finale.  

Without getting into spoilers, there are many decision trees that should exist but don't.  Right as the game starts getting into the meat of the story, progression, consequences, etc., they just short cut everything to the end.  The gear progression is good up until the mid point too.  Has a good curve but then spikes from middle tier to top tier in a matter of a couple hours.  Everything points to half the game being cut out. 

This is not to say there isn't a lot of content, because there is.  You'll definitely get your money's worth.  I try and do everything I can in a play through.  It's hard for me to say how much time in the game there is, as out of my 100 hours, at least 40 were due to bugs and awful loading times.  I would have to regularly kill the game and reboot it because it wouldn't finish a loading screen.  That's also to say how much I enjoyed the game, as I was willing to deal with that many issues and soldier on.  

There are NUMEROUS bugs.  The issues are exacerbated by it being on Unity, so performance is horrible (I'll post my specs at the end for those who care).  There was a part in the critical path that would freeze up for ~10 seconds and then play a few frames then freeze up again... then eventually just not unfreeze.  I had to repeat this section for hours until it I got lucky enough to finish the 2 minutes of game play/conversation to continue the game.  Graphics settings seem to have little effect on performance (at least for me).  Going from 4k-ultra down to 1080-very low settings will have a ~12 FPS improvement.  There many other bugs ranging from annoying to game breaking that you'll read about in other reviews.

15,75138677,english,"This is a fun and funny game. Its has more pop culture nods and plays on itselfs then any 20 games out there. With the amount of ways to build a character and different ways to beat encounters and multiple endings it has a ton of replayability as well for the money. 

**Pros**
1. Humor. Locked in on our own version of a boring apoc, this game lets you get out and explore and laugh.
2. Fun turn based combat, a bit more stream lined then Wasteland 2 but lots of more options in deployables and your own person APC.
3. Dialogue, You want to explore all the characters. The voice acting is great top of the line and litterally makes you think
4. More Skill points and diverse ways to build. unlike in Wasteland 2 were you had to build characters certain way, I have learned you can really make some goofy fun builds that work. Each has a unique play style. From a Bust their heads in tank, to a sneak sniper, a gunslinger with two six shooters or a standard Special ops assault rifle type. Each has a place to shine. Oh yeah even the grease ball mechanic. 
5. Visually much more appealing. The game looks pretty, plays pretty and no shades of brown every where. Glad to be out of the desert.
6. You have to beat the game just for the song at the end. The music in this game is so awesome, in some of the key battles the music with lyrics make the encounter even more dramatic and fun

Cons
1. Character advancement screen is wonky, and some of the controls changed and are not quiet as user friendly for pc's as previous Wastelands.
2. Chat system is odd without numbers choices. Easy to click wrong dialogue.
3. Easy to job the Weapon mod system by creating a ranger just with those spec's.
4. Would have enjoyed more companions slots and less create your own slots. The companions I have run into so far add a really nice bit of life to the game. Your own team of 4 kinda leaves it role playing light. Honestly would have loved making one ranger and 5 unique companions. 
5. Load screens really slow down later in game.",1598749086,1599439701,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198030615965,75,13,3242,13,3142,1601425850,,

- Great game - Fights like XCOM but the rest is pretty RPG focused. 
- Nice setting, story and characters - pretty funny at times
- Decisions made matter (to the point where you might wanna quicksave before starting dialogs)
- Fights are challenging and fun (most of the time)
- Mechanics reward versatility in your team (e.g. opportunities for extra loot or easier fights all over the place; using different weapon/ammo types because its limited/expensive)

Con:
- Some technical problems - single player worked fine for me - the worst thing was stuttering that randomly starts in some fights and continues until the end of the fight (patches will probably solve these issues in the long run)
- Loading times are pretty long even with an ssd

Okayish (might annoy you if you're picky):
- Menus: They mostly work well, but could be more responsive and quick; There are some cases where it takes effort to see relevant information (e.g. perks unlocked by picking skill levels)
- Inventory: No sorting options but you can filter by type
- Traveling: Fine in general but can be annoying for some locations (denver airport, anyone?)

23,75568339,english,"Just finished this game on Ranger difficulty in roughly 40 hrs. While I did not explore everything, I did get the Achievement for having a lvl 25 character. 

All in all solid gameplay, even if the UI can be a little finnicky and some abilities aren't as intuitive as they could be. I've shot my own people more times than I'm comfortable to admit, just because I was looking at the hit percentages on one character and then, wanting to switch to a different character to see theirs, I clicked the sidebar only to end up killing my sniper with a salve of automatic fire. But I digress. I doubt there will be much about the gameplay that I'll remember. All in all, I don't recall much variety between the fights. This may be due my relatively save playstyle and I did not experiment much with the weird science weapons until the last 10% of the game's story. In terms of enemy variety and interesting abilities, XCOM 2 comes to mind as better example. Or Divinity Original Sin 2 for the mixing of environmental effects. While you can discover some fun weapons for sure and nothing beats the satisfaction of that 5k sniper one-hit kill on a boss, gameplay isn't what made this game stand out to me.

Its strong suit is the dialogue, the voice acting and the soundtrack. I really have to stress the good work of the audio department on this game. The way gameplay and sound worked together will definitely be the thing that I will remember about this game. It reminds me a little of the original Red Dead Redemption. Sure, I finished that game because it was a good. But I played through it 5 more times after that, just so I could listen to Far Away by José Gonzaléz while riding my horse along a river. Not spoil anything, let's just say I have a feeling it will be similar with this game.

To close, I've had some bugs that added about 3-4 hours to the playtime due to a garbled up save game where a faction I aided would treat as though I hadn't.

Yes, there are technical issues. Overall the issues are, in my opinion, very minor and did not get in the way of my enjoyment of the game. I never got to a point where I felt that the game was unplayable. The only issues I had were quest errors and performance hitches.  Two of my quests wouldn't complete because I killed a particular person prior to finishing it, though one was fixed.  One interaction with a minor side character during a Side Quest would cause a bug to occur preventing me from progressing the encounter, which they have fixed already and you could have worked around the issue by choosing another option during dialogue with that character.

Pros: Good character customization. Many ways to build your characters. Diverse equipment. Interesting world AND story. You are constantly being pelted with moral questions that don't necessarily have a correct answer. Voice acting is very good.

Cons: This game cost 60 bucks and has the polish of a 20 dollar game.

The indicator for action points in a fight is mildly bugged. Action point estimates don't update between switching weapons unless you try different actions first. The loading times are terrible. Random bugs where quests will start over or you receive the beginning dialog again. Feels like the devs didn't playtest parts of the game, otherwise they would have realized they have to spend twenty minutes running and sitting through loading screens to leave a dungeon with more than one area.

My biggest complaint is that there is just a really shitty menu. Like, why can't I view a stats page about my character? I can't see how much damage they do, what their resistances are, or even what exactly these skills do. Does melee damage count toward brawling damage?? I don't know because the game doesn't explain shit. Also no area to see interesting stats like how many sawpups or los payasos I've killed. 

Lack of interesting stats or even detailed attributes about the character makes the player characters feel pretty replaceable/meaningless. Game is just missing a huge amount of polish that was present in the games it borrowed heavily from (XCOM and Divinity Original Sin)

EDIT: I just wasted 45 minutes in a very long fight only for it to bug out near the end. I revived a unit with my last AP in the turn. The character revived, but I couldn't switch to them. I couldn't use the end turn button. This character had 3 AP but I couldn't use their action points. I tried using the escape menu, inventory, etc. Nothing triggered it. THEN, the inventory bugged out. Equipping items to this bugged character began to disappear items. The ultimate kicker was that I couldn't even close my inventory screen by the end.

- ""Normal"" mode was way too easy.  I didn't die once even when I played very sloppily.  I usually start on difficulty level 3/4 in CRPGs, and I regret not doing that here.
- Lack of depth in character builds.  You basically choose a weapon for your guy, 2 random exploration skills, and that's it.  The attributes and perks I picked for each character felt like non-choices to me.
- You can easily ""have it all"" with your characters where you have all relevant skills at all times in your party, and you also have all perks on each character individually that you'd want.
- It is a little buggy/unstable. I crashed a few times.  Once the camera got locked in a zoomed-in state.  A few times the game would slow to a crawl, and I had to save and restart.
- The state-graph is so complex that sometimes I did things ""out of order"" and the dialogue from NPCs I was supposed to have interacted with earlier wouldn't make sense.

Wait for some bug fixes (it's a bit of a mess). Damn fun if you like the original Wasteland games or Fallout 1 and 2. Update: Still some bugs, lots of little annoyances, but got a lot better. Needs a little bit more time for some polish patches. I loved it, but I am a biased dangerously soft muffin.

This is one of those games where the more you play, the more you appreciate nuance. Trying to be good does not guarantee a favorable result. Being bad does not always come with punishment. Doing something, anything, may not result in any feedback that something actually happened. Taken on its own, these may sound like bad things but used like colors from a brush, it paints a much more layered game with depth and perhaps even a questioning of one's own morals. Do you save a person because it's the right thing to do, even if there's no reward or even a thanks? Would you sell your soul for a shiny gun or to get on the good side of someone powerful for future favors? Depending on the gamer and playthrough, this may all change and some of the consequences are only seen by the player and not the world because sometimes, no one's watching but you.

Having certain skill checks result in bad results is great. Instead of mindlessly seeing 'I have the skeelz to do the thing' and clicking that option, context matters. In a hypothetical, I may have the skills to kiss ass my way into not being shot in the face and become a minion but were I to continue another line of questiong, may be able to have them shoot their own face instead and have all the clown cakes for myself.

The companions are another wonderful example of nuance. Rather than having set companion quests that all of a sudden throw away all their principles and follow all your orders without question because of loyalty, each character has their own tolerance and for the most part, they're by default flexible enough to go along with the flow until a line is crossed. Some companions develop and grow through the campaign while others continue relatively unchanged in their minds. When done with purpose as it is here, characters end up feeling more organic. There are some that cannot be swayed and they are represented. All except the main questline of people, they're made a little bit more gamey to move the plot along and have plot stupidity syndrome at times.

Being able to turn off friendly fire is a blessing considering how frickin stupid you can modify your weapons to shoot everything within moon's crater's radius for weapons like flamethrowers and shotguns. This option is done pretty nicely as you can still blow up your own team with explodey stuff that makes sense to be a bit more limiting than a primary weapon. On the flip side, friendly fire is dumb for certain skills like demoralize. I'm trying to insult the enemy team's duck god, not our own team's rabbit god, frickin Pvt Smith. More than a few times, a certain ex sheriff decided insulting duck gods did enough psychic damage to warrant leaving my team. Good thing reloading only takes half the time it takes to watch the entire LOTRs. (exaggerations may have been made, but they are unacceptably long)

Not being able to respec is odd. You can recreate your core rangers as many times as you like without cost (you do lose any perks gained from skill books and quests, also animal companions -RIP you foul-mouthed bird). It's far more clunky to unequip, discharge, and remake from scratch a character. Also, you can't save characters like in WL2 so each time this happens, the entire character creation has to be done. Not having a respec for the companions is a design choice, I disagree with it, but it's a choice and it's fair enough. I like some of these companions, but their skills are allocated for flavor which makes an already tight skill system tedious to work around at higher difficulty. Turning down the difficulty takes away from one of the most enjoyable parts of the game, the combat.

The UI, my god this needs some TLC. Rather than having a longer duration after hovering over a skill or item or creating a bar so that when you hover over the area, the damn thing stays up, the bar continuously refreshes on every little update flashing in and out trying to select a god damn medkit to save my 1 hp ranger who's currently on fire- and it's dead Jim. Again. This extends to skill usage in combat, coupled with the bad feedback for when a skill is selected and selection lag leading to situations where I'm trying to use a strike on a meat target and it ends up trying to plink away at it.

Animations are not smooth. Without speed ups or snappy and short animations, clicking on a locker unlock leads to a pause, idle animation, walk animation, idle animation, fiddle with object animation, idle animation, kneel, pause, open up locker. This clunkiness leads to a lot of reclicks and misclicks as well as sometimes the 'formation' animations taking priority without queuing up orders leading to 'move to', 'explosive mine spotted', 'move to safe distance', 'disable mine', BOOM because instead of moving to the safe location, everyone's still forming up on the first location. This unresponsiveness is frustrating on every level of the UI.

The long and short of it, it's a buggy ass game where the bugs can and probably will be fixed. The core is frickin fantastic for people who enjoy games more along the lines of Fallout 1 and 2 or Wasteland 1 and 2. It's punishing when you don't know what you're doing and satisfying when you overcome it with some thinky noises. The story isn't always straight forward and can take things for a hilarious spin or dark turn around the corner. Everything is nuanced where feedback and consequences are given selectively making the choice less so about 'good or bad' in the gamey sense and more what is 'good or bad' for the player. If you care about nothing but phat lewts, there's a route for that. Evil bastard? There's a route for that, and it definitely comes with equal parts rewards and consequence. Goody too shoes?

73,75461297,english,"Ok, this game is a far cry from Wasteland 2.  Firstly, as I guess is just the norm now, this game is extremely buggy at launch, so much that it really seems like it's in an early access state, as there's bugs all over the place and I really wonder if some of the core mechanics are even working correctly.  

Second, the game is ugly.  Wasteland 2 was quaint in a sort of fallout 2ish graphic, nice and simple.  They upped the graphics big time this time around, but made it look more cartoony, more like Warcraft 3, and to me it just looks garish and over the top.  Many if the items in the game, especially the armors, looks just plain stupid.  

Thirdly, I haven't even played this game that much since launch, because I just find it hard to get into.  I really just don't care about much of anything in it, almost everything about the game just seems off from wasteland 2.  Combat is much more complex, and word of warcraft like, rather than the pretty dead simple, yet fun one wastland 2 had.  Everything about the game seems like more of a chore than a game.  I especially don't like that 90% of the challange in the game seems to be fighting with the controls while trying to select either one or all of your rangers.",1599275112,1599407759,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198031530742,45,8,3552,0,2717,1599654565,,

75,75549591,english,"Wasteland 3 really scratches that isometric classic RPG itch. However, with it's game systems loosely being based off games like XCOM and a bit of Fallout (even though Fallout was based on the original Wasteland) it feels relatively fresh. A lot of the skill builds and choices work well and mesh together nicely. Examples being things such as Big Guns (Flamethrowers) and Toaster Repair (Fire damage) synergizing. This is just one of the combinations that work well. However, I would say that I feel that the utility skills are almost too good. [b]Recommendation[/b] - Have at least one character with each of the various utility skills (Nerdy Stuff, Lockpicking, Mechanics, Hard Ass, and Kiss Ass) or have a mule character with these skills. Getting lockpicking and mechanics up will make your life way easier (almost too easy sometimes).

I enjoyed the story a lot. It wasn't particularly complex or anything but a lot of the factions really play off each other in some way. The choices with regards to some factions can really have some large overarching consequences with others which I really did enjoy. Voice acting was great and there was a substantial amount of it. There are a lot of especially great ones that were genuinely funny such as MacTavish a luchadore mask wearing mechanic using an awful Scottish accent he learned from a broken Braveheart tape. Yeah, what an arc that was. There are a lot of interesting characters like that. The music was also a highlight and some encounters had their own track which really enhanced the experience.

Now, this is as of patch v1.1 and I'd like to address the technical issues. I haven't had too many issues but there are definitely quite a various number of bugs. Luckily I've avoided game breaking bugs such as losing progress or having progress reset and the like. These are some of the bugs that I've encountered such as not being able to use prepare/defend in cover and having it say out of range (fixed this by moving), characters sometimes bugging out and shooting in completely the wrong direction, rally sometimes bugging and not granting the party AP, weird animation glitches with regards to ladders (characters not climbing and then teleporting to a location), and Overload's (Weird Science skill that buffs energy/cold/fire damage) audio remaining even after firing. The worst one I've encountered is when the frame rate tanks to an absolute crawl of 10-15 fps. I have a really good rig and this game is definitely not some graphical powerhouse so this is an absolute headscratcher. This occurs usually with extended playthroughs and resetting the game fixes it. Lastly, the amount of loading is quite annoying. Some loading screens can take 30-40 seconds and there will be times where you have to load across two or three different maps to get to your destination. Not fun.


Despite the technical issues I really enjoyed my time with Wasteland 3 and I'd probably rate this game about an 8.5/10 if I had to give it one.

Anyway. Let's talk about the game:
Your first launch will be the longest. It gets way better after that and then it will always depend on your location of what is being loaded for their respective load-times.

Single player Rangers, You will be starting the game with a Pair/Duo of Rangers- you will start with a custom or pre-made couple of new rangers/techie rangers/ father and daughter/ metal rangers ;? lots of possibilities - 
Later, you can have max 4 rangers, and 2 companions.

Special notes below on performance- or if it doesn't work for you. 

Game Running : GPU sits at 36Degrees*Celsius  33% Fan rate.
Very high power consumption though,.

*INCREDIBLE voice acting. Everything besides your choices are worded to you. Click to continue the dialog. Cannot click anywhere though. Specific placed clicking - or controller friendly i guess.

You enter Colorado springs to set up a base but immediately, you are ambushed. This unfolds at the start of the game to place you in an already brutal world to continue the mission at the cost of anything.

*The patriarch must _________
& Choice in dialogue  is still  sometimes linked to your abilities <Cool>
-Animal Whispering possible
-You must note the difference between Weird Science & Nerdy Geek stuff - they both will matter a lot this game - 
-You might spend a few first runs deciding on your favourite play-style before you actually want to go far

The way the battlefield opens and expands to begin a fight feels very immersive. The free-roaming world you're in is transformed in front of you to show your cover/defense and explosive counter-parts of the battlefield. As well as your percentage chance of hitting the enemy based on where you want to move.

The hit percentages can be frightening at times, but height definitely also plays it's advantage in the fights/

Grenades are incredibly highly recommended for the beginning already.

Think on your feet and welcome any challenge that comes your way. The standard default couples are very good, and custom will be up any experienced player's alley.

Beginning good traits; Leadership +2 - OR - Melee +2 - to fight a deluge of red-neck Dorsey's

The game welcomes freedom to play

Don't believe any of the negative reviews.

The game shouldn't have released in this state, this was after a delay as well, it should've had at least another month in the oven before getting released.  This review will probably change to a recommended when they get around to fixing the bugs, but at the moment it's either an avoid at all costs, or play it on Microsoft's Game Pass for $1, the former you should do if only wanting to play co-op, since it just flat out doesn't work.

Edit:  A patch came out about a week after release that ""fixed most co-op issues"", that didn't fix one of the main ones; infinite loading screens.  They either force you to hard-quit (alt + f4, or ending in task manager), and relaunch the game hoping it'll load, or load into a new zone in singleplayer, save the game, then load that in co-op.  Super not ideal, and a fairly big PITA to actually deal with, hopefully that'll be fixed soon, but my former comments about the game not being ready for release still stand.",1599176307,1599388672,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197998744581,321,17,3625,162,1666,1601727507,,

Just a turn based tactical squad game with RPG style character progression. Story is about as cliche and straightforward as it gets. Round up some out of control children trying to rebel against the king. Or kill everyone. Or accidentally kill people in the wrong order and have the game end on you. The lack of choices is yours. But the game will sure beat over your head what it thinks your choices should be.

Some of the many poorly thought out ""features"":

Game turns into a revive fest because everything one shot kills you. And you can spam consumables and cheese the game.

RNG crapfest. Either you get those critical hits and the battle is a sad joke, or you get stupid unlucky and suddenly half your team is dead. 

Getting the attack icon and clicking on an enemy causes you to run up to them and aggro instead of firing. Have to click the attack first because crap UI. Skill usage is a mess that'll often cause you to do unintended things like running or firing instead of using. Also, vapid and cheesy dialogue will interrupt your sneak attack against many characters because heaven forbid you play the game without listening to them rant and then lose the first shot.

Weapon mods can't be removed from weapons. Why? Because devs hate you. Better hope that gun won't be obsolete one level later when you put a good mod on it.

Performance is staggeringly bad. Long load times and sometimes the game turns into a slideshow for no good reason. Running RX5600XT on 1080. This is completely inexcusable for a game with mediocre graphics and stupidly small maps.

Voice acting can be absolutely awful. Listening to characters pause every other word as a substitute for drama makes even amateur theater look good.

Game gets political. There's no intelligent commentary, just in your face stupidity, like a cult that worships Reagan as God, or people calling your characters ""red hats."" Har har, a reference I get.

14,75526516,english,"This is the most fun I've had in a game like this since Disco Elysium, and I'm barely into the meat of it all.

The amount of choices and internal conflict this game throws your way (and those choices actually meaning something) is such a breath of fresh air. I've had to sit back and think about what I was doing multiple times, juggling my options and especially thinking about how said choices will affect the future. 

I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible and refrain from naming names and specifics, but if you're interested in a general example of one the tiny details effecting the story at large I'll put one here -> [spoiler] My employer had someone jailed for past beef, and an unknown source tipped me off at his location and asked me to save him, I did so under my employers nose. (I could have just as well told this unknown source that we weren't going to help as well) I saved the prisoner and added him to my party. Without even thinking about it much later in my playthrough I went to go and meet my employer with the man that was supposed to be imprisoned in my party. My employer was baffled that I'd openly bring him face to face and demanded an explanation as to why he was there. Little things like that make this game incredible. The airport section of the game has a part that perfectly shows what I'm trying to explain about choices effecting many things throughout the story but I won't spoil it, it's great seeing it for yourself. [/spoiler] There are probably hundreds of moments like this in the game, and I wish I could type them all out but it's so much better seeing it all unfold first hand.

The skill system is pretty simple, but it works for what it is. Plenty of perk trees that expand the more you level up said skills and it all meshes together very nicely. Modifying weapons and armor is fun and rewarding, the armor looks badass, and the combat is fun and engaging.

For 60+ dollars I expect the game to have some decent level of combat yet it does not. I think the combat could even be said to be worse then Wasteland 2. 

What makes the combat so bad? Well enemy AI is like program to run to a near by cover and then hunker down tell it is dead. The AI will not really move for anything. The AI does not flank. Does not try to get to the back line and take out my snipers. Who I do not put in cover and give armor. Even on the hardest difficulty. Yes you heard it right. No cover and armor for my snipers. Because the AI is to busy attacking my heavy weapon flamethrowers or other close range heavy armor. 

Even if you flank the enemy. They will not relocate to another spot. In fact the enemy will sit in fire/damage over time effect. Will run into environmental hazards. Will kill friendly enemies with friendly fire. Does not use many special abilities. I only seen one enemy buff it self. It like all difficulty does in this game is increase hp, damage, accuracy. Maybe decrease your damage, health and accuracy.

I would recommend to wait a little bit for some patches to fix the bugs, crashes and improve optimization right now though. There's way too much of those issues at the moment. I have a pretty powerful rig (ryzen 2700x, rtx 2060, 32gb ram) and my pc would literally drop to 10-15 fps in some areas for no reasons. One second it would be fine, but as soon as I did something like opening/closing the inventory, my fps would drop like crazy and it would stay like that. I had 3-4 random crashes and there are many bugs like being able to go through invisible doors, attacks not displaying animations, losing pets randomly, etc.

Otherwise, the graphics, the gameplay, the classes, the costumization, the battles, the enemies, the replayability and so much more are all fantastic. It has the potential to become the best turn based RPG of the year. It just needs a lot of polishing. The exploration is super rewarding and the story is great.

First of all, there's the bugs. Tons of them. Some game-breaking, most only annoying. It will probably take months to weed them out, if the devs intend to.

Secondly, the storywriting is really bad. The game tries very hard to never give you too much satisfaction by making mission outcomes frustrating. For example there is a ""trolley problem"" mission. Two urgent missions to save people out of which only one can be done before time runs out - I really hated that in Wasteland 2 and how the game would keep nagging you about the other group you couldn't save, and I hate that here too.

The endings suck (all of them). It's hard to explain without spoiling, but believe me you'll hate it. There is not a single satisfying ending. Again, the game forces you to make a choice between several bad options. Whatever choice you make, you'll be sure to regret it.

- Broken character creation when expanding your squad.
- Had to reload the game 4 times to fix the glitches and bugs when creating characters for the expanded party.
- I disconnected from host 3 times in 2 hours. I've never disconnected in any other game before.
- Buggy animations when shooting behind cover. Animations either don't play or you face the wrong way when you fire.
- Got stuck in dialogue. Couldn't progress or leave the conversation so had to alt F4 the game on 2 occasions.
- Some weird clipping and other graphical bugs (glowing white face in character creation was a very weird one),

and a whole host of other issues but you get the point. It seems obvious to me that the testing for coop was barley if at all done. I'm pretty let down, was very hyped to get stuck in at launch. 

I'm sure this game will get some patches soon and when it does and the issues I'm having are going I'll update this review. As it stand, if you wanna get this for coop, don't. For solo, I think it's stable. 
A very cool game but for me who is strictly playing to coop It's no playable for me.

EDIT AFTER UPDATE #1: Something noteworthy, the keybinding for this game is very bizzare. There are some hidden keybinds.
An example of this is that the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are not set to any action in the keybind menu but in game they actually are (ready weapon, reload and crouch) despite these actions having other keybindings (Lctrl, r, and z) . I suggest you look at the keybinding in the game, you'll discover some functions the game doesn't tell you about, such as radio being the ' / ' key. 

Upon toying with this further; The preset keybindings that are not shown in the keybindings menu (number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 can be re bound but will retain their original function. I rebound 3 to select my 3rd party member but it will also make them crouch... despite the fact that 3 isn't key bound to crouch in the menu, z it key bound to crouch.

In conversation audio sometimes cuts out mid sentence.

Performance is even worse. The frame drop is more dramatic, happens more often and lasts longer. 

Still having animation and sound desyncs

The load screens still take far to long for any comfort. Fram drops are insane, load screens will drop to 1 fps sometimes.

I completed every quest/location available and its approximately 60+ hours of gameplay to do everything.
 Now for what I did not like. 
-Having a large party of companions can really bog down combat. At the later stages of the game I had nine companions and their turns would take nearly five minutes to complete. And boy are they stupid, they will kill themselves by running through fire and block pathways to enemies. 
-Some of the combat abilities can be bugged, while this was not a major issue it was unfortunate when it came up.
- At times the camera can will shoot off in random directions at high speed, again not a major issue just a slight annoyance.
-But the worst thing of all in this game is the horrendous load times. Some locations only have one path to get to them and you can end up having to load several different locations.

The Combat is very bloody and sometimes very hard as well especially when you encounter Scorpitrons together with lots of other robots. This game feels more like Fallout and is also better than Wasteland 2 which was also a lot of fun. The songs are also very good that play on the radio when you drive around on the worldmap or on certain missions/locations. The missions are good and fun some were annoying but there could be more missions and more places to visit. There is not much you can visit and the random encounters can be quite annoying. I love to fight Scorpitrons they are quite rare but there is a lot of stuff to loot when you encounter one of them on the worldmap.

The Characters are also cool and I love Major Tomcat the animals help a lot during combat and have a good amount of health and can do a lot of damage as well. The humor is also very good and the character voices but some characters were hard to understand because they were talking in an annoying way not a very big problem because I'm playing with subtitles. I also appreciate that your squad can't really die you can always resurrect them and fix them up (it is a game over when all your squad members get downed) and you can learn abilities that are also very helpful. The combat feels better than in Wasteland 2 and there is a lot of cover you can take or destroy.

The game however still has a lot of bugs from infinite loadingscreens to weird character bugs were you can't open crates or even heal teammates. The enemies also shoot through walls or throw healing darts through walls which can be quite annoying. I also don't like the shared inventory when you play co-op would be better if each player has their own inventory and also can loot what the other player already looted.

As such, here is a newcomer to Wasteland's impressions rather than someone who had been anticipating the game. I didn't even realize it was coming out so soon and bought it on a whim.

This game is everything I had hoped for so far in terms of feeling like how Fallout used to feel.  I will update if it disappoints, but it's extraordinarily well written. Its writing consistently hits the mark whether the mark is sad and shocking or tongue-in-cheek and sardonic. The combat is satisfying and the skill tree is great. The world feels alive and detailed, every nook and cranny is crafted with care with great environments. Major Tom is a cute cat and I was so scared of him dying I had to drop him off in my base. My choices feel like they matter, and I'm compelled to think every dialogue option a few times over or wonder if I did the right thing. The various factions are so far well-written, morally grey, and intriguing to explore. I can't wait to see more of what it all means and how it comes together.

And yeah, I understand the Wasteland series roots and know why it ""feels"" like Fallout, as it's basically the original Fallout game, but as I said: it's just pretty much what I had hoped Fallout 4 would be and wasn't.  To me, it feels like a spiritual sequel to Fallout: New Vegas which was the last one I genuinely loved. It just drags you in immediately from the intro and so far hasn't let go.

In a word, Wasteland 3 is delightful.

I've read somewhere an article that said ""Wasteland 3"" is a nice game for you to be occupied while you wait for bigger and better games to come out and I agree with that. It was fun for a while and then got tedious so quickly I was surprised by it. For me it suffers from the same problem as Fallout 4 (sorry to compare to games with each other that both take place in a similiar setting, but it fits here.)  The characters and the story are simply not compelling, at no point I felt invested in it. The problem for me is that I ended up caring about a non-voiced character that I created myself more than anyone else. NPCs feel quite empty, save for Lucia. The Patriarch works quite well and is interesting, because he is presented from so many viewpoints, but he is the only one. I didn't care about the kids, any of the factions or the character from the past, that appears randomly at some point and throws the good ending in your face, though it seems unrealistic and naive to pursue that. All in all, yeah, it's kinda nice.

- My PC specs are way above average and my CPU(i7-8700k) and GPU(RTX 2080) are stressed to the maximum after a few hours of gameplay. The more you play, the worse the lag gets;

- The apparent lag does not seem to be related to graphics quality as it has the same behavior on Lowest and Ultra settings;

- I haven't experienced such lengthy loading screens in years;

- I've found several quests in which I am unable to progress due to bugs.

- There are multiple ""triggers"" that end the game prematurely, while not a bug per se certain interactions can give you one of the endings that you normally get after a long playthrough.

- humor.
-  XCOM2 like combat style game
- many factions, decent storyline
- combat can be quite unforgiving if you start in a wrong position. i guess that could be perceived to some as a negative, but I like the challenge.

The bad
- even if  enable 'friendly fire off' , if you accidently hit the portrait of you hero, you can shoot your own hero. Coming from games where you swap between portraits, it feels counterintiuitive
- zooming out could be increased. regulary i'd wish i could zoom out more, because i cant see the hitpercentages on the screen for a certain movement option


The ugly
- sometimes the hit percentages make no sense from one position-square to another. no logic at all to be seen. There is no explanation how they come to certain hit-percentages either.

75,75506474,english,"Ok First off, a ""one thing i wish i knew before i BOUGHT the game"": It's not done. If you are here because you're contemplating getting the game; Don't. Wait 3-6 months. It is ridicilously broken, and had i known they were planning a multi platform release, which means optimizing and bugfixing for 3 different platforms, i'd have waited a good 6 months before i bought it.
It feels like an early access beta build with broken cutscenes, sound effects (kodiak engine sound is present all over ranger hq ie), broken visual effects (scopes on flamethrowers appear sideways), skills and perks doesn't work apparently (i've just avoided all the reported broken perks), Items are broken (winners medal doesn't give any bonuses), poor optimisation (loading times takes several minutes). This is sadly not a finished game and it is really annoying the charge full price to have people playtest it for them. I'm fine with waiting for a release, i'm NOT fine paying full price for a broken product. 


All that aside, it is a great game with an exciting storyline, very fresh dialogue and good mechanics you get hooked on super fast.But, theres only ONE storyline, everything else is minor quests that typically are just ""recieve mission, go to location, murder or chat up everyone, return to mission issuer and that's it. It just feels shallow when compared to Wasteland 2, which was a legit masterpiece RPG with long and intricate, meaningful sidequests. The dialogue feels TOO fresh, they've obviously decided to have a very free spoken dialogue which is don't mind, but it feels forced, kind of like that they purposefully tried to ram as many ""motherfuckers"" in as possible more for the sake of swearing in a mainstream game, and less for having colourful characters that use language as a, let's call it a ""cultural tool"". It's kind of like if you told a 10 year old they're allowed to swear as much as they want for the next hour, and they'll ONLY swear for the next hour. 

The mechanics are mostly solid, except that with the introduction of the ""manage squad"" feature, which let's you create as many custom rangers you want, and swap them out at any time you want, Weapon and Armour Modding and the Barter function has lost all purposeful meaning, and the whole system has declined into being an annoying timewaster, as, unless you care VERY MUCH about roleplay, you should 100% certainly make a skill gimp (min is a tiny green clown with red mohawk) whose only function is to max out modding and barter, becaues there is literally no reason for you to equip your combat rangers with ""HQ Skills"" when you can just request a tow and strip, sell and mod all your shit at the base, which honestly makes more sense from a realistic perspective as well.
It's counter intuitive to assume your rangers are going to stand out in a nuclear winter wasteland overfilled with murder clowns, cannibals and mutants and pick a gun apart so they can sell the screws to some chump in an old VW somewhere, when they have skilled mechanics at their base that can do all that for them, so they won't have to divide their time between combat training and sweet talking fish pun merchants in a holiday resort.
Who puts like 60 points and a perk into Armor modding to get +5 armor like..

What they should do is make the Tender Loving Care and Powder Packer perks part of like Survival (as caring for your gear in the wilderness and being able to scrounge more ammo off the ground definitely are ""Survival"" perks), and just have both the modding skills be some workbench in the HQ you'd have to upgrade in some form or fashion.

Which again points at how weirdly the skill trees are developed. It looks and feels hastily put together, as if they had to just chuck swear words, ""sidequests"" and perks in because they had to spend their time optimising the game for pc, xbox and ps4 (and mac i think i saw somewhere). I mean, i love the setting and the series, i like the studio and i appreciate the ambition, but this honestly feels like a No Man's Sky situation, where the ambition ran loose, and what we're left with is half a game.

Now don't get me wrong, i do like the game, it's just so broken now that i'm sad because i thought i bought a finished game, and i'm not going to recommend a broken game.

This is especially a problem when during the final mission, if you side with Angela, Wesson sides with the Patriarch and is executed by Angela with no prompt or input by you. Kwon also sides with the Patriarch but you actually get to decide if he is arrested or killed. These are the only 2 companions you will have for a large portion of the game and you do not even get a skill check to keep them in your party. I was expecting a big epic fight into the Patriarch's palace, instead he just waltzes out into the main town square with a tank that I nearly destroyed in one hit. And then guess what?

At the time of this review the game is riddled with bugs (some of which are game breaking) and rife with performance issues. It also sports a hellishly cluttered inventory and features an obscene amount of loading screens that waste a player's time. That said, these are easily forgiven given how good the overall experience is. 

Combat is tactical and turn based yet efficient and quick. The writing is excellent and though the music is very hit or miss, the voice work is amazing. The story is engrossing, with very few black and white choices. The characters, though not Old Bioware levels of interesting, are still deep enough for you to genuinely care about. Inxile have created a very compelling world here filled with colourful characters. 

My only real complaint would be that the final act feels rushed. The story wraps up fine but the last hour felt like the devs had someone screaming at them to finish. (Probably explains the bugs too). I was honestly surprised that to see the end credits roll because it seemed like we were headed for one of those ""You think I'm bad but you don't know what's coming for us"" moments.

Contains many bugs and disappointing UI decisions and... loading screens.... god the loading screens.

If fetch quests or go do talk to this person quests weren't annoying already or monotone, try going to several load screens as a cherry on top. 

Bugs :
Exp bug, exp isn't bound to your characters or whatever the hell they did for exp function. I can level up my ""behind"" characters by removing them from my party and re-adding them, then magically they have more exp/level.

A bug that made my character useless. Removed all its skills, attributes and perks and gave her negative attribute points and random useless skills. Making it unplayable, especially in mid to late game.

A bug that makes character in the choose to add to party list invisible. They are there, you just need to juggle your party members until they appear as addable.

Bugged ""doors"" that have been opened and looted but show as closed, it's minor and only graphic.

Skill bug when you have a skill item equipped and want to level up your skills, it will cost you more skill points. Unless you remember to remove item, then lvl skill then re-equip the skill item.

Your party consists of 4 custom (max) and 2 npc's called companions.
Companions are in my opinion dead weight and only contribute lore/story wise.
Other than that their attributes, skills they come with by default are late/useless and that they are quirkless. So the game forces you to have 2 meh characters that aren't even adjustable to your party needs.

I discovered all of this without even finding one of the important people from the main quest.

Been a gamer for a LONG LONG TIME (too embarrassed to say how long lol)

I've played the previous Wasteland Games so I was excited way before release and couldn't wait for the release to get here.

The game is what you would expect from a top notch company, great graphics, great voice acting, and a great adventure.......Is it worth the money???.......sure.........remember that triple A games in the past for a 60-80 hour span was always around 50 bucks, now usually 50-60 bucks.

With that said, you will see 131 hours played for my gameplay through the story once.
The positive side on that for me is I am a completionist and I do like to explore every crevice, corner, side mission etc when I play a game.
The negative is that the 131 hours is inaccurate because.... (HERE GOES) The Load Times!!!  UGHHH....I timed it a few times at 1:17 per load. This can be crazy when you gotta go somewhere through 3 loads and then come back through 3 loads. Also many times I do not quit out of the game so it sits for 8-10 hours.
That is the reality but in the end I am sure I got a really good 80 hours out of it.

With that said, this is a heavy duty game with a multitude of things going on so I have to somewhat forgive the load times.

Regarding some bugs, yes there are some still. Really nothing major that is game breaking. The only time through my playthough was once when during a random map encounter the ""loading wheel"" just kept spinning forever and I had to restart the game from my last save. I think that they did fix that in the last couple of recent patches. Other bugs are very minor and some people might not even notice.

The game does become a bit repetitious once you near the end and you have everything and the story is winding down to the end game.

Overall if you like rpg style, handling your group in turn style combat, and going through a very decent story line, I would recommend you check it out. 

I don't write too many reviews but I thought this might help some people in getting some good info on it :)

The only mildly annoying bug I'm finding at this point is the game freezes when I got to quit and I can't even end the process in the task manager, but CTRL+ALT+Delete and a restart will fix that.

It has simple, but interesting combat system. There are little-to-no terrain manipulation, so the battlefield would feel really static.
The story... Well, it is interesting enough to hook you into playing more. There is always a clever quip coming your way, without being obnoxious. The player's choice often matters as well, and not all skill-locked choices would benefit your party in the long run. I really can't praise the story enough.
The characters are well-made as well, I never thought I would get attached to some characters [spoiler]and got to gun them down in the end of the game because they didn't support my choices[/spoiler].
The random encounters on the world map are annoying, but they all can be avoided -- provided you have the necessary perks.

There are some annoying bugs as well though.
Some abilities just don't work sometimes, like ""Rally"", which doesn't trigger anything, but still reduces the user's AP.
Followers; like entranced animals, robots, and NPCs, sometimes won't join the battle.
All items in the game supposedly has decimal values, which renders the barter skill useless for any item with values roughly lesser than 3$.

CONS  All I've found for bugs is the animations for some doors not opening, but if you made the skill check you can still pass through, so nothing game breaking.

The multiplayer adds to the role playing its self, where me and my partner will spend some time actually debating the moral ramifications of decisions in the mind set of these rangers, Whole lot of fun and because the inventory is shared and the game play mechanics kind of force specialization there is no worry to who ""gets the loot."" That said there are times I feel the multiplayer doesn't work, without exploring any spoilers I will leave it you can't just be left to your own devices. But that could be cured by extensive communication too. 
On to the game play. I feel this game exceeds where wasteland 2 fell short (a game I also enjoyed by the way). It is as though they streamlined a lot of the elements in wasteland 2 that felt cumbersome for the sake of feeling like a dense rpg. The game play its self, if you enjoy turn based  isometric games this is going to be good, if you don't... well maybe not.
As of right now the only complaint I have for this game (provided it has barely been out for a week) is some glitches. Some times the sound cuts out and I have to restart my game, some times text floats Indefinitely even after leaving an area until I restart my game. . . are you seeing the pattern here?

87,75458612,english,"tl;dr Game is a mess. Wait until it's completely patched.

The content itself is not the problem. It looks REALLY good, animations are great, lighting is surprisingly well used, music choice is on point, sound effects for walking and shooting are superb, voice acting is serviceable at worst and the writing (so far) has been at least on par with Wasteland 2, and even the prologue tutorial has been the highlight of the game for now. The character customization, from an aesthetic perspective, is very permissive and fun to fiddle with: gun models are unique to each gun (as opposed to an MP5 having the same model as a stockless AR-15 like in W2) but unfortunately don't reflect any mods you attach to them. Armors also change your appearence but you can choose to turn that off for each character on each piece of armor at any point. Terrific.

The problems are, for the most part, in the technical aspect. I'll preface this by saying I haven't even touched the co-op and nor do I have any inclination to do so, but I hear it's nigh unplayable that way.

- The game just runs horrendously. I have a 1080ti that doesn't even get to 50% of usage during ingame with everything on max, and a 3.5 GHz cpu overclocked to 3.8, but even on Lowest settings the game refuses to run at anything above 60 fps at a 1080p resolution at BEST, most commonly at 40~50. I can muster 70 fps at most in non busy areas, and even then the game will always stutter as my guys walk through the map, especially when dispelling  fog of war. Game will freeze for a good second everytime you press the highlight key, no matter where you are.

- Every menu is painfully slow. I don't know if it's a design choice or poor performance again, but everytime you click on something on any menu - Inventory, loot window, character abilities, etc - the game will just freeze for a solid second. It's especially egregious in the middle of a fight, as you try to cycle through enemies, weapons, party members or abilities. 

- Character ""reaction"" is slow. Whenever you're navigating through a place and need to do a quick 180º turn to run the other way for whatever reason, your ""lead"" character will follow just fine, but it seems that everyone else in the party doesn't get the memo until a good 2 or 3 seconds later. This can and will fuck you over if you need to course correct out of a recently spotted trap or enemy units.

- Character customization can be really nice, with the glaring exception of their faces. Not that they're ugly or whatever, but for some reason everyone's face is strangely low res, or perhaps just textured oddly. On top of that, both your eyebrow colors and facepaints (which come attached to a pre existing face and you don't get a say on it) are colored according to your skin color. What that means is that the lighter skin tone you choose, the lighter (and sometimes invisible) your eyebrows will be, while the face paints will shift from black to a bright salmon-ish red. Meaning you can't be light skinned with dark eyebrows or facepaint/makeup, and you can't be dark skinned with red (or any other color than black really) eyebrows and face paint. Oh yeah, and if you stay long enough in the customization, at some point no matter how many times you click on it, you won't be able to change your portrait unless you back out of the menu entirely.

- Unbelievably buggy: Every time you click to open a container/door in the game world you'll be rolling for a chance of getting the following: It just doesn't open despite your character completing the animation; The game will tell you ""TARGET TOO FAR"" despite being one foot away from you; Your character just won't interact with it despite no message telling you the reason despite the cursor indicating you should be able to; The cursor just simply will not turn into the ""Hand Icon"" that lets you interact with them, despite being clearly supposed to be interactable by indication of the highlight key, container/whatever model, and even hovering over the mouse to show what it is (sometimes even telling you that you're able to lockpick it). Oh yeah, on some occasions it just opens fine too, but then you'll have a chance, although rare, of the game crashing the moment you pick up the items from said container/whatever. I'm not gonna list every single bug I've encountered in such excruciating detail, but if you're curious just scroll around the reviews here and you'll see that I might've gotten off easy, apparently.

- Load times are unbelievably long at strange times. I don't even quite get it, because the first load whenever I boot the game is a manageable 1-3 minutes wait, but if loaded again while already in game, then it takes up to 5 minutes. Quickload doesn't mean dick and it's there to mock you.

- Your inventory menu is a mess with no manual sorting option. You do get a few filtering tabs, but guess what? Your trinkets do not have a tab in which they apply, so to find them you have to wade through your entire inventory while hoping you recognize its icon.

- Lastly,  the conversation window baffles me. Why? Simply because that you cannot check what has already been said and you don't have a Log menu or window afaik. Just why.
_________________________

That's it for the objective problems with the game. From here on down are my personal gripes:

- I'm not a fan whatsoever of the combat revamp. It's now VERY closely resembling the combat from Mutant Year Zero, which takes a lot of its inspiration from the modern XCOM games, with detection radius highlights and all. The biggest problem is how it is divided between Player and Enemy turns. It's not that the system is inherently inferior or otherwise, but that not only it puts into question what the Initiative stat is even good for anymore, but it's also just not the type of combat I prefer in the first place.

- Characters now have abilities they activate during combat like in the newest XCOMs or Mutant YZ. There are now both the ""Strike Attacks"" and Abilities. The former is like a special meter that you fill by damaging enemies, and once full you get to activate your weapon class' Strike (on top said weapon's side ability which is just a glorified RoF switch most times). The latter comes from either Perk Abilities (which you get every other level) or Skills like Animal Whisperer, which you can use to charm an enemy animal. Fights will eventually just become an ability spam fest later on and I hate it.

- I don't know if this is yet another bug or a design decision, but you can freely swap out quick slot items (you can only pick 2), such as grenades and medpacks, at any point during combat for no AP cost. Which then begs the question as to why is there even a Perk to increase your quick item slots from 2 to 3. Oh yeah, same goes for weapons, but then they are equipped with zero ammo (sometimes). I can see why have quick slot items in the first place, since the inventory is now a ""Party"" inventory, as opposed to every character having their own, on top of no weight or item limit. Which is very much appreciated by taking out all the juggling of items you had to do between your companions in W2.

- Leveling system is just bizarre now. You get a *FIXED* amount of Attribute and Skill points every level - 1 and 3 accordingly - despite your character's stats. Meaning that the Intelligence attribute blatantly misleads you by saying that you get a skill point every even level of it, thus implying that those extra skill points will come from when you level up, which you'd have easily assumed if you had played Wasteland 2, as that is closely how that stat worked. But, in actuality, you'll only be receiving that extra skill point ONCE, and that means only when you raise said stat to an even level. So yeah, Intelligence is arguably worthless apart from its Crit Chance and Damage modifiers, even on skill monkeys.

I felt compelled to warn folks that the tone is much, much darker than previous entries in the series. Of all the entries in the WL franchise, this one plays the apocalypse the most ""straight"", with the humor being mostly gallows in nature. It does not have the same zany nihilism of the previous titles, and I found that to be a major letdown. I was hoping for something more like 6-String Samurai than Frostpunk. 

I'm finding the whole experience to be rather dour and tedious - do not go into this product expecting a wacky romp.

Spoilers, I guess:
Like, early on you find a mass grave full of child corpses. Wow guys, super edgy, you got me good. Next we get to hear the audio of a family's last moments before they are murdered by cannibals, all rendered with top-notch voice acting. It just comes off as edgelord crap - made to shock and bumm you out without saying anything interesting or challenging. Also, the frozen Colorado environment is unexpectedly bleak and ugly, to the point that I didn't like looking at it. All of the characters are parka-wearing clones.

I think its telling that the only early character I found remotely sympathetic or interesting was the straight-shooting revenge girl that was just a reference of the straight-shootin revenge girl from True Grit. Not a great sign that the only thing I care about in your game is something you stole from a better piece of media.

Great turn base game
Great story

The bad:
Ai will get stuck and not end or continue turn forcing you to Alt+F4, game will not always exit an area properly, if you block a path to the ai while in combat it will also glitch
Game is underdeveloped, feels like an indie/beta version
Graphics on ultra high 4k are pretty bland
No cinematics
Game is not optimized very well, it crashes. I have never had a game crash on max 4k settings, except this piece of junk
Music is very religious and annoying, fuck god and fuck you if you disagree, keep religion out of games you twat
some classes are too weak such as most shotgun and heavy builds. Most pistol builds are better, which is annoying.
Limited ammo, want to use RPG? good luck outside of buying the ammo after 30 hours of playing i have found 6, and i scavenge everything
Doing quest a few of the time is confusing because there no indication of where it is on the map. Unlike most games that mark it on the map for you. I am new to the series so forgive me if i dont know everything about everything MORTY!
its a little unbalanced, for example if you want to help the robots, you have to fight 4-6 waves with no heals or resting. This might be ok for you veterans out there that have played the game but its a little unfair, especially when medpacks/kits are scarce, and when the enemy can one shot one of your teamsmembers. + ambushes to get to the healing area, it can be a little tough/unbalanced

They got rid of the constant 5-6 second skill loading things you had to do for almost every interactable object, and often multiple times per object. Now skill usage is pass or fail based on your skill score, and it's instantaneous. Really helps move things along.

On the negative side, loading screens are numerous and they're excessively long. I say this as someone with a pretty high end PC. If you're a couple of loading screens into an area, like Broadmoor Heights, and you need to get to the world map, you'd better have your phone nearby so that you can browse Reddit while you wait.

The combat is solid and entertaining, though simplified compared to 2. If you're newer to the CRPG genre you will find it much easier to get into. If you are an old hand at the genre you will find it comparatively shallow. 

One of the biggest missteps was consolidating initiative into shared turns where enemies or your squad all act simultaneously instead of individual initiatives - This basically means, if you get the jump on your enemies you can kill half of them before they act, rendering the fight easy; if the enemy gets the jump on you they can down half your team before you can get into cover (so you just quickload). It doesn't help that there's no ""pause"" button and characters are slow to respond so if you accidentally walk into enemy's vision you're almost certainly screwed. 

The characters and voice acting is solid enough, though few characters stand out as truly memorable or interesting.

Where the game mainly fails is the main storyline. It is bland, predictable, and, frankly, doesn't make logical sense.

Things that I have experienced that is now making me change my review of the game.

1 Extremely poor performance later in the game with larger battles and once your HQ gets filled out with NPC's.

2 Your hero characters have pathing issues, they either get stuck running into an object on their way to their destination (during combat) or they are quite happy to run through cover obstacles or even walls to get to where they are going.

3 enemies and players controlled characters can sometimes shoot through walls near door entrances depending on the map making any sort of choke-point/cover deceiving.

4 player charmed animals, robots and companions not directly under the players control can cause situations where your team are trapped and cannot move.

5 a certain party addition later on with a healing ability quite often uses its heal on full hp party members when there are low hp members standing right next to them.

6 paying a doctor to heal the party does not heal player controlled pets.

7 loading screen stops at 33% (I know this is fixed in the upcoming patch but its still not good enough)

8 Inventory items disappearing from quick slots randomly after or during use.

9 special ability targeting overlay bugging out and failing to show respective target damage.

10 If any player character has used over watch and then later in the turn another member uses the Rally ability it will cancel any party members on over watch and give them 2AP as intended but effectively costing them the AP required to activate over watch.

11 alt tabbing out and back into the game can see ghost keys stuck down with the camera moving by itself, and if using ALT to highlight loot will also have that overlay stuck on AND trying to cancel the ghost key inputs will see UI elements open and close EVEN during an enemies combat turn.

12 Some combination of multiple party members on over watch, a sniper with rank 10 sniper rifle perk and a horde of enemies moving into over watch range will cause combat to become stuck after 1 or more enemies are killed and or shot at, at the same time by multiple party members. I think the game is waiting for the sniper to chain his over watch kills but cannot for some reason.

13 NPC's in HQ appearing with the same name.

14 special stat boosting items not giving their intended stats such as the ranger hat.

15 General UI clunkyness, pauses between conversation screens, activating abilities, targeting reticules.

16 running through a laser trap to get to the other side of it to disarm, think this was in denver ruins.

I cannot recommend this game at this price or current state.

""So far so good, much better than expected game play wise. Early youtube footage made the game look linear but it's not it is quite open with freedom of exploration.

A few quests are flat out unfinished with placeholder dev materials still showing. Additionally several quests feel like they are missing very obvious choice inclusion on the outcome which leaves you wondering why your Rangers wouldn't have brought something you did up.

There is numerous UI options that are flat out missing that shouldn't be such as auto progressing dialogue or silencing confirmation dialogues when handling level ups. By level 15+ this is extremely irritating with you seeing 2-3 warnings each level up per character.

None of these issues alone would be a deal breaker but I know that I can be more forgiving to imperfections than some people.

-Several areas marked with ""house"" icons on the map have nothing there. 
-The entire south-west quarter of the map is barren, giving it a very unfinished feel.
-The mid-game feels empty. A couple high-level missions are given to you at the start of the game. It felt like several ""meet and greet"" missions followed by several ""you're gonna need more levels"" missions and then endgame missions.

-Armor, and consequently strength, doesn't seem worth the investment. High armor values only help against basic weapons as energy(lasers, explosions, fire, cold) has 99 base armor penetration. Armor with the highest values have strength requirements that make it feel more feasible invest points elsewhere to just kill enemies before they attack.
-Some of the bonuses from leadership seem to be rather situational, most of the time they came into play the battle was essentially over.
-Why are the generators powering the turrets tankier than the turrets? I want to run over and shut off the generator but that never feels like the good option when they weren't accessible outside of battle.

The weirdest thing about this game is the writing. I'm unable to tell in which direction they planned to go with it (meaning if I'm supposed to take the plot seriously or not). You will immediatly notice a VERY BIG reddit influence in the writing. Some dialogues are basically just written down reddit memes, which in my personal opinion is very cringey.
The exaggerated use of swear words doesn't have the effect that the writers intended. For some reason they thought if everyone says f*** and sh** all the time that this is going to ""add a layer of coolness"" to the game. In fact, it has the exact opposite effect.
One example: This is the description of the leadership buff: ""With a leader nearby, you'll get your sh** together"".
On the other hand, you'll read some funny/interesting dialogues too. I actually had to laugh a few times and the main- and sub plots are interesting enough to keep going.
To summarize it feels like the writing staff was a mixture of decent experienced writers and 12 year old redditors from /r/teenagers.

In all seriousness, Wasteland 3 is a brilliant RPG made by masters of this genre that you should definitely play. Everything about what makes a good RPG from tough choices & real consequences that you can see, to an actual sense of role playing what type of Rangers your team want to be, to a compelling central conflict in the world of this game and IMO one of the best well written major choices that you'll come across in an RPG. That's all present here and more, its also an improvement over Wasteland 2 in all major aspects while still being familiar and easy to get into and enjoy.

BUT I would not recommend buying this game at the time of this review due to a ludicrous amount of bugs and technical problems, some examples of that would be: A side quest that can be permanently broken if you choose a certain outcome, and Loading times that are unbelievably long(up to 30 seconds) among MANY more issues that I encountered.

Combat is like XCOM2 just a lot less exciting and unbalanced. You move as a team but 1 character always go 1st like an idiot and everyone else follow from a distance. They have this weird way to force that 1 character into the room with a ton of baddies and every one else outside then let the bad guys move 1st right after the cut scene. 

Sometimes you can try to move the characters closer to the event area so they don't spread out but it just take you out of the immersion. ""There is a cut scene coming up, I better move the guys closer to the edge of the area!!!""

The so-called ""moral choices"" are artificial and forced. There are 2 choices GOOD or BAD. It doesn't matter what you do, you have to choose these dumb options. Great story 'choices' are made by the players given a problem. Like how you want to approach the boss or give up something for something because it's a tactical decision. These guys just give you options and 'rewards' and you just select them and the story could be 'meh' it wouldn't matter that much.

All jokes aside, Wasteland 3 is a solid RPG from InExile (with team members behind Fallout 1 and 2 onboard) that plays like a mixture of Classic Fallout crossed with XCOM, complete with shiny modern graphics and UI. 

The game offers players nearly complete freedom in how you build your 4 custom characters and NPCs, from making them medics, gunners, leaders, traders, scavengers, you name it. All of the skills tend to have in-dialogue benefits too, and some help on random encounters in the world map as well. 

The Game has various factions to aid, ignore, or brutally murder, your call. These can range from Monster-Mash fans who run a trade town, a Cult that worships a commie-hating Robo-Ronald Reagan as their deity, a machine commune, the Colorado Marshals, raider groups, and more. 

Your group, the ""Desert Rangers"" (not to be confused with Fallout's Desert Rangers, though they are similar) is a group hailing from the State formerly known as Arizona, which got nuked bad at the end of wasteland 2 for lore reasons in the story (something about a human-hating AI taking over their base), and Arizona is now even more of a wasteland, which is why you're in Colorado, trying to find supplies by helping the local warlord guy who controls the state. You're brought in as a sort of ""By-Any-Means"" Squad to do the Patriarch's work so he runs supplies to Arizona. Primarily he wants you to drag his adult kids back to him. 

Combat is basically like XCOM. You have full turns between your guys, the enemies' guys, and friendlies. You also have bullcrap hit chances sometimes, and you can build up a meter to do a sort of VATS attack on a body part of an enemy which can confer a debuff such as lowering that enemies' damage, applying a damage-over-time effect, making them go berserk (robot only enemies) and so forth. You have a variety of weapons, such as Assault Rifles, Pistols, Shotguns, SMGs, Rocket Launchers, bladed / blunt melee weapons, punching weapons, and energy weapons (which are also any of the above mentioned types, just with lasers). You can also bring your vehicle, the Kodiak, into fights in outside areas in certain parts of the game, such as the world map encounters. It's got it's own equipment you can upgrade, and brings a considerable amount of firepower to the table, and can run enemies over too, which is fun. 

The game also offers a lot of choices in how you deal with factions and missions, which can affect who is your enemy and who is your friend, as well as who you get to staff your base and who helps you. At my current 20 hours in, I've seen quite a bit of choices and experienced a good bit of the game, though I'm still nowhere close to the end, It's got a heap of content in it.

Sample of some bugs I've encountered so far:
[list][*]Floating heads.
[*]Body parts displaying in wrong location. 
[*]Squad member not able to be used during combat. 
[*]Combat causes a hangup. I'm going to venture a wild guess and say there is some loop not terminating when this occurs. It's occurred multiple times--don't know why.
[*]Several crashes.
[*]Dialogue and quests occurring despite my having killed their quest giver. Killed the quest giver [i]again[/i].
[/list]

Bugs aside, the game controls somewhat poorly. It feels janky--and sometimes controlling characters can be problematic. There is no way to toggle a slower movement speed, and I don't believe there is a key to ""stop"" squad members. Consequently, I've triggered more traps than I would have liked to . 

The jank is most obvious when characters are ""taking cover."" They don't actually hug the object they're hiding behind, and any time they use a ""end turn"" action they will move away from the cover and then slam back up to the cover. No idea why devs decided to do this. It would look and feel so much better if the icon just popped up over the ranger head while they were hunkered down instead of the wonky, disjointed movements they currently perform. 

I'm enjoying the story and quests so far. It's not the best story I've ever seen, but I have a weakness for post-apocalyptic settings.

if u like WL2 u should like this game just fine :) but.. 
if your expecting them to make a new and a better WL game then.. this is not what your looking for sadly.. :(

 
its basicly the same game as WL2 menu's are still buggy.. and messy..

driving the truck around the world is fun at first.. but.. u will run in to rads that damage u around every  corner.. untill.. u find or buy better rads stuff for your truck... 

it is so stupid to bump in to rads as taking dmg is just such a pia!! why! u end up having to ether eat though your meds.. witch u have very little at start of game all ready!.. or slowly go back to town.. go though  loading.. then talk to a doctor.. this is such a stupid way to stop players from getting to high lvl places in the map.. 

this works in 2nd game as u clearly see the rads on the map.. but in this game u have a tiny mini map.. to see this crap.. they have gone backwards.. with this.. and i hate it.. :P

all so the story is trash well i think it is anyway.. with out spoiling anything u basicly have to pick the bad ending or the bad ending ether way your effing good ppl over.. witch is stupid..! why is there no good! ending..! both ending's end up with letting a lot of good! ppl! dying..! and i hate it -_-

the game crashs some times and can be a pia if u have not saved for a bit.. 

now other then that it is a WL game :) so as i said be for :) if u liked WL1 and WL2 u should like this game just fine :) but i wish they put more work in to it and made the systems and AI menus and so on better but no.. they didnt :( and its a shame but i think this game is still a 6/10 ;) its a good WL game but i just wish it was a better WL game :(

The good
-A LOT OF CHOICES! and grey ones too that are fun, interesting and your choices have weight throughout the game.
-fun satirical and realistic writing for a post apocalyptic setting
-Like wasteland 2, with even more! (similar turn-based combat, fully voice acted, really good music)
-the music again, REALLY GOOD (everybody have fun tonight)
-the pacing is better (but feels much shorter than w2)
-after finishing the game, i really want to play it again (but things keep me busy :( )

the Bad
-coop bugs kinda break the game (have to reload for example)
-long load times
-a little shorter than I was expecting
- game content felt slim in my opinion vs wasteland 2 (shorter than W2's content) (spent 40 total hours in this vs 60-80 in wasteland 2)
-also in late game, there is a lot of insta killing/downing, (like a lot) against and for your team.

OVERALL
-extremely recommend for any fans of crpgs, it is the best spiritual successor to classic fallouts to date. it is worth it for singleplayer.
-do not recommend coop rn, wait for them to fix coop if you plan on getting it for that.

This game is still one of the best RPGs I have played, let alone cRPGs.  I played the second title, and I can say that Wasteland 3 takes everything Wasteland 2 did and improves upon it.  It is a distinct, unique experience that departs from the desert wastes of Arizona into a new world with new enemies.  Some familiar faces return, but the new lore and worldbuilding make Colorado feel even more alive than distant Arizona.  Rumors of the Motor City Gangs and Buckeye Republic further east make Wasteland's post apocalyptic America feel like a whole society rather than isolated cells of civilization.

The writing is great.  Characters have fantastic personality.  Serious moments are punctuated by dark humor to alleviate tension, but that humor almost never takes over the entire games tone.  The satire makes a point, the lines like a trader crying ""Reagan bless this arms deal!"" before you buy some ammo are witty and funny but also make sense given the context of the place you are.

The decision making is real.  The game moves beyond simply looking at the 'good and bad' or the 'morally grey' and tries to make the player choose between what benefits the world and what benefits them *individually*.  Does the player pursue the immediate benefit of a unique rifle by killing innocent people? If so, what is the impact on the world? Is being granted access to a cache of high end weaponry (a cache you cannot access any other way) worth selling out somebody to slavery? While the morality may seem black and white to us, the Wasteland is not our world, and the gameplay benefit of having that cache seems much more valuable than the guilt you have over some pixels.  You will of course be tasked with picking sides and playing politics.  You may regret some decisions.  You will think about what you did and reflect.  You will ask if you could have done something different to do better.

Wasteland 3 is a standout title in this regard.

There is nothing plot wise that will hook you onto the story. Unlike Wasteland 2, Wasteland 3 tells you who you are going to fight and everything about your enemies from the start. Are they interesting groups? Sure, nothing wrong with the enemies and NPCs they all add to the story. Though that's not the issue, the combat is great, the characters don't feel shallow, the new ""talking heads"" make the world more immersive.

Yet once you beat the game you'll be wondering ""is that it?"" Because you are told everything from the start it leaves you with nothing in the main story that will surprise you. No tension, no flair, just hey go kill or don't there three rebellious kids once you level up some. And that's it for the main story.

I have to say i'm very disappointed, show don't tell. The game devs told everything up front and it was a bad idea. Let the players explore and get to know the world through their interactions; not by the default of information dumps through dialogue.

86,75396341,english,"Finished my first full playthrough of Wasteland 3, and I give it an overall 8.5/10.

Without spoilers, will try and break it down as succinctly as possible.

Story: 8/10. I like the story but feel a few things were disconnected from the overall feel. I also liked the moral ambiguity of the last game better. This one is less obvious out the gate which is the ""bad"" decision, which is the ""good"" decision, and which ones are morally grey. So there's less agency to the dilemma and it feels more like ""Are you a pragmatic asshole, or a compassionate fool."" 

Graphics 10/10: This game isn't going to push the boundaries of any graphics card or blow your mind. But the thing with Isometric RPGs, they are plagued with some laziness in their graphics. A lot of the beauty breaks down when zoomed all the way in. Not this game. Every details is gorgeous and even the little trash piles have some very nice detail work. The overworld map is absolutely beautiful and so many minor touches really make you appreciate how much work they put into making the environments. Speaking of environments, none of the maps felt re-done. Every map felt and looked unique. From Ranger HQ to the city, to the lodge in Aspen. It was like every map had it's own texture and resource pack. And I really appreciated that. 

Music: 9/10: I love the soundtrack to this game. All the weird Dystopic western remixes of classic songs were great. But the problem is whenever anything played on the ""radio"" it sounded awful and hard to hear, either too quiet or too loud. But man. It sounded amazing during the maps and battles. 

Gameplay: 7/10: This got the lowest score for me and it's probably things that will get patched out, I hope.

But for me the reasons I took points off here is that the core of the game play is the tactical combat. And that's where all my gameplay issues arise from:

1. If you go to attack something, and try to right click to cancel the attack order, but you do so within the unit's movable area, it auto processes it as a move order. Right click is the default cancel order but also the default move order so this can be quite problematic.

2. If you try to move into an area where there is a corpse, the corpse blocks your ability to right click to move there and is instead interpreted as a looting the corpse move. So you move 1-square away, potentially consuming the same amount of AP depending on your combat speed, and loot the body. You have to rotate the map and slowly move the mouse to find a valid spot in order to move there. And this can be lethal in a game with as much cover-hopping as this one has.

3. Kind of tied to #1. If you click to attack, cancel, then click on a portait of an ally to switch to another character, you will attack that character as if still in attack mode. This is even if you have friendly fire off.

I suspect the accessibility changes they have made are also going to become industry standard. No longer do you have to hassle about looking for the specific character with the skill, or spend time running around encumbered messing around with bothersome inventory mechanics. Even the ratio of lootable items is just right, you won't spend 90% of your time collecting trash from the 100 shelves and trash bins in a single room of a random house, but instead spend a majority of the time playing the game itself while picking a few items up along the way.

The pacing is great, everything is voice acted, looks great and combat has that ""oomph"" to it. The only cons I can think of are some rather long loading times, which makes quickloading a drag, and the attributes are a bit weird. Intelligence doesn't work like intelligence at all, it's just a crit dump stat. All characters are basically limited to 3 skills (if you want to have them high enough), and there are quite a few skills. So there's some hassle having to fire rangers and re-hire a different version of them, because you just took on an NPC that has skill overlap with your rangers. Also the skill requirements get quite high quite early, so I've had to type down different places with locks, explosives etc. that I couldn't do anything about the first time I was there, just so I'd remember to visit later.

However, the game really lacks polish and quality of life that I would really like to see fixed at a later time. 
- There is quick travel back to the main HQ; however nowhere else in the map. 
- When entering an area, you can quick travel within various sub areas...however you cannot do the same to leave. So for example, if you are popping back into an area to revisit a shop or maybe some loot you couldn't previously get, it's quite easy. However, when you want to leave, you have to walk through each area. 
- Some elements of the HUD aren't as clear as they could be, for example the equipped weapon highlight is almost identical to the off-hand one, and since the movement range, attack range and AP is calculated on the equipped weapon, I would often misplay because of that. 
- The inventory sorting seems unfinished. You can sort to display only weapons, only armor, only consumables...however several types of items don't appear under any sorting...so the only way to access/use/equip them is to go in the ""Show All"" and scroll till you find it. 
- The line of sight and AI detection is sometimes really odd, I would regularly detect mines, traps and burried treasure through walls for areas that I had not yet visited (completely blacked out). 
- The overworld map is clunky, it's unclear what radiation levels you are entering until you start taking damage. 

It's all these little things that make me a little bitter about the triple A pricing.

The weapon play is also very nice with light modding but the game has a certain progression to how characters improve both by skills and finding loot in the world, it's a passive progression and I like it.

-Great story
-Interesting and fun characters with no solely good or bad characters apart from maybe Fish-lips
-Fun and action packed combat
-Loads of different gun's melee weapons and armour
-Wonderful environments if you like snow
-Great progression (I only needed to grind for about an hour for one part)
-Some great songs in boss battles
-Multiple ways or doing nearly every quest

Cons
-Some story choices for example one in the last mission can damn right ruin the game if you miss something early on.
-Because its so soon after release I experienced a glitch that changed a ending slide.

Final verdict:
I spent nearly 35 hours running and gunning and helping my way through the Wastes enjoying every second of it and having many drastically different factions in the game that you could help in small and big ways to earn reputation is always going to be a winner, because of this and my only real cons with this game being glitches and things i should have realised wasteland gets a very strong 9.5/10",1599156395,1599156395,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198211633868,199,2,2070,0,2004,1599316587,,

The story is to short its also to straight forward, to flat, doesn't feel like there are unexpected consequences in the late game. You kind of already know the consequences during the decision making. Its all to easy. I miss a certain depth and layering to the story, it doesn't grab me as much as Wasteland 2 did.

-Amazing storyline choices that do actually matter ( make negative choices like making a poor girl a slave and it comes bite 
 you later :P , i won't spoil)
-Very Flexible character skill customisation (you can create up to 4 player character to fit the skills you need in your team)
-Exploration systems
-Voice dialogues , dark humor , references with many series 
-Crushing stuff with vehicles 
-Secrets !! Easter eggs
-Freedom to be the bad guy / the good guy or the asshole who don't care
-Unfiltered language 


Cons:
-Little lack of tactical choice during fights
-World map ambushes can become more of an annoying feature on the long run rather than a fun feature
-I fear it might be too short (even if it has multiple endings which can be played through)

I got a strong feeling that some content was cut due to development time, which brings me to my next point is that I think co-op should have been added in a future update because it in it current forum its is a buggy unbalance mess and with that development time spent implementing that it could have been put towards developing more questlines, perks, ways to make you base feel more involved. Combat is pretty solid had no issues getting a custom to it and soundtrack is really engaging just wish I had more stuff to do in the endgame.

However, it's not even remotely good enough for its pretended AAA-ish place (by price and other factors): it's ""nothing special"" on technical side - no good graphics, sound, or even smooth framerate; its tactical combat mechanics are better that Wasteland 2, but still very primitive, badly balanced, and very easily abusable; and on CRPG side - even if it captures Wasteland setting & spirit better than Wasteland 2 did, its storytelling isn't really any more compelling than, say, Fallout Tactics (that ""Fallout"" game that everyone tries to forget). Even if you can do missions non-linearly, you still better follow the intended order, otherwise the game isn't clever enough to tell you the story differently, all you get is being locked out of early quests because the game thinks you went past the intended stage to do them (so, again, not much difference with linear F:T). The major steps of the plot are promptly laid out before you right after the tutorial map - and no, there isn't any subversions or unexpected turns, stuff will progress pretty much exactly the same as discussed. The only small spoiler regarding the very last conflict in the game is completely exposed to you after a couple more hours into the game. After that - that's pretty much it, you either know everything what's going to happen because the game just told you that in no uncertain terms, or you can very easily guess, because the game dropped a whole bundle of absolutely not subtle hints on you.

All that's left for you is to actually visit all those local freakshows of various kinds, meet people, kill them, do the actual quest, and smoothly proceed though all the steps initially discussed towards one last conflict and the ending. All while either suffering through badly balanced combats if you didn't care to think about loopholes in combat mechanics, or breezing through them if you did.

The following is from the perspective of a 40+ gamer.

Pros:
+The game has an engaging story and branching choices which encourage replay for different endings. 
+The difficulty settings are well tuned to allow for the most casual to hardcore play.
+Truly a mature story. The game does not pander to the audience nor shy away from dark and downright gruesome situations.
+There are few black and white choices. Choices have consequences, some which you may not anticipate.
+Major Tomcat.

Cons:
-Character creation and cosmetics for your squad are not as in depth as other games. At some points this game shows that it is made in Unity.
-The game could use a bit more polish. There are some bugs on all platforms, however the devs have acknowledged and are working to correct them.
-The price point is a bit higher than I would like but as a caveat it is their game and they can sell it for whatever the market will bare. 
-Dismissed, Unique, tamed animals will disappear if you leave the area. This is a nitpick but might matter to someone.
-There is no La Cucaracha horn for the Kodiak.
-The weapon modding system needs some polish, you can attach but not detach weapon mods leading to some regrettable choices.

Overall: This is a good entry point in to the mythos and playstyle of the Wasteland series and Tactical RPGs in general.

As an old-school RPG fan, I gotta admit that this is one of the best games I ever played. Sure, it has its shortcomings, and it didn't bring too many jaw-dropping moments or absolutely new perspectives, but it's a good game with good mechanics, good graphics and good story. Also, the choice of music is just 11/10.
The voice-acting for some female characters is pretty hilarious though. Like, they wanted to make certain female leaders look and sound like badasses, dangerous and cunning, but in the end it resulted in actors just really-really lowering their voices and trying SO hard that you just can't un-hear it. Besides the girls trying to sound manly, the game also has lots and lots and lots of hilarious things, like puns, amusing descriptions to guns or armor, some crazy people's dialogues, cutscenes and all. It often reminds me of Wasteland 2 combined with some of the Borderlands 2 goofiness. Sometimes I would just have to pause the game to laugh at something. Really lightens up the mood. The character development is pretty cool, the squad team-plays quite well, complimenting each other's skills. You actually feel really invested into the story and into your progression. Personal HQ, personal vehicle, modding, implants, all the blings are there!

All in all, if you like a good RPG like Wasteland 2, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights 2, Jagged Alliance, XCOM and the such, you might wanna take a look. Well-worth the money.

Pros:
X-Com style combat
Deep RPG character mechanics
Great voice acting and writing
Nicely cracked worldview

Cons:
Small technical glitches (I haven't hit anything game breaking that a reload or alternate option didn't solve)
Companion characters don't do as much commentary as I thought they would

Biggest Issue:
The high level of synergy developed with the main team over time makes it very hard to slot in a new character. You will be dramatically less efficient and they don't appear to bring that much to the table anyway so hard to justify switching. For example, Scotchmo has small arms plus lockpicking. I already have max lockpicking on my tank. To add him, I will lose survival/weapon modding or sneaky shit/kiss ass/armor modding from my other companions. That means I not only need to switch him in and max the skills he has, I also need to switch out the tank and give the new ranger the skills I am losing.

-A lot of bugs
- waaay too long loading time even with the best ssd
-why unity engine just why
-only 3 other ""big citys"" and a ""big"" world filled with nothing is still not a ""big"" world.
-you can´t overtake other cities or important places for the ranger to control you have to decide witch faction you want to help
would loved to take city by city and have more control over the region for the ranger
- you can only be ""bad"" or ""good"", but being bad you won´t get any -% on shops...
- again you can only choose from 2 options be good or bad
-Only english for 70€ pls what..
- at the end again only 2 decision (why just why like Fallout 4, destroy the institut or join it, boooring)
-would love to have the option to turn the camera when i speak with npc

- ok storie
-good charakters / funny charakters
-good map desin (of cities, random places)

I have freezes at launch, FPS crashes, game mechanics intermittently not working, randomly long load screens (so many load screens)...

I have a brand-new PC that blows the specs for this game out of the water. This many flaws for a $60 game is completely unacceptable. I'm just livid that it took this many hours in before it all started falling apart.

I have friends who have all experienced at least some combination of these issues. With this many endemic flaws, I can't recommend paying this much for such a broken product.

1. Create - All custom characters look ridiculous. This is a very important aspect of an RPG to me. I don't want my mains face to look like an old bag of potatoes.

2. Looting - One of the largest parts of an RPG and no circle search (like DOS2). Looting was tiresome as i enjoy playing with a controller for comfort and the character movement was too clunky to move to loot pouches. It does select all in an area but that only helps for killed mobs.

3. Weapons - I decided to make one of my mains a heavy user and very quickly ran out of ammo in the intro level. The weapons and ammo consumption just seemed very unbalanced.

The voice acting was phenomenal and the setting seemed interesting. However the fact that it runs more like a high end mobile game than a AAA RPG like DOS2 was just a real turn off for me.

К W3 самая большая претензия сценарная.

И ты там бродишь среди всего этого в поисках своего водяного чипа и охреневаешь, - сначала доктор в Джанктауне чуть на мясо не пустил, потом в Хабе о каких-то чудовищах с когтями расскажут, или караванщики предложат заработать и привезут аж в Некрополис. Страшно, интересно, увлекательно, хочется разобраться в этом мире.

А вот в Wasteland3 банда клоунов (в настоящих клоунских носах и париках) нападает на банду армии монстров (в масках из магазина игрушек). Почему? Потому что хотят их всех убить.

The Pros:
Well polished gameplay and great combos and a very useful strike meter

The weapons and armor all look amazing and there are quite a few unique ones for each play style

Great voice acting throughout the whole experience with very few poor outliers

Each choice you make is well reflected and nice to see in the world as you play

The main characters are presented in this weird but awesome first person that gives them a lot more life and personality 

There are a respectable amount of ways to approach any mission and its awesome to see how many way you could try something differently

The Ranger HQ's growth is fueled by your prestige and personal recruitment, it pays off to spend the time to do it and its awesome to see it grow.

The Cons:
Allot of people are complaining about the bugs and for good measure, Ive had a few quests fail to complete due to the fact that i did some ""out of order""

There is a certain reward you acquire for meddling with all the toasters, and the reward has a very annoying sound issue where it plays a very loud and repetitive noise that is unfortunately tied to the SFX sound bar and not the voice sound bar. Reloaded a save to save myself from the ear pain.

Overall, an excellent game and hands down one of the most well polished and engaging RPG's I've had the luck to find. Highly recommend this game once they iron out the bugs.

One fight we told a bad guy we were going to arrest him and it started a big fight so far so good go up to him and kill him the fight stops everyone it just standing there staring at us cool all done we grab the loot and leave. nope. we cant leave. We are still in combat... we kill everyone they did not fight back. Ok cool ... didn't get anything from killing the rest but that's fine we leave. nope. we can't leave. we are still in combat. 
Restart from early save point the fight works this time, he surrenders once you get him down to 0 hp. cool. 
By the time we go back to our headquarters we have been having small problems but nothing game breaking.

- The Story is absolutely amazing so far and has kept me enthralled.

- Unlike most other open world games it does not over load you with side quests, rather bringing them in at a pace of 1-2 and giving you more as you complete the previous.

- the conversations are witty and downright funny. Along with all The NPCs feeling unique and memorable.

- You TRULY control the world around you, even after 14 hours I have noticed the changes in how people act towards my Desert Ranger (mostly running in fear if they are raiders, and harrowing us heros if they are wastelanders)

- The game forces you to make tough choices that can change The Desert Rangers forever, early on they offer you the choice of ""do you keep The Desert Rangers the moral and helpful heros, or do you put old traditions to the torch to ensure The Desert Rangers survive the situation they find themselves in?"" because honestly I feel The Desert Rangers WILL die off if they can't rebuild here.

I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down, and I'd love to have the opportunity to change it to a thumbs up. inXile has put up the majority of a great game, a worthy successor to Wasteland 2. There are just too many game breaking and immersion breaking glitches and bugs  for me to describe this as a fun time right now.
My friend and I have tried to co op this game multiple times and, in no particular order, have encountered the following:
-infinite loading screens that require a work around (go into single player, trigger loading scene, make save, load new save as multiplayer session)
-Loss of all reputation with all factions
-conversations bugging out when we both try to read them together, sometimes resulting in ostensibly a frozen game. In one instance, I had passed authority to my partner, but my partner was unable to be a part of the conversation. I had to kill the task and revert to our most recent save. Other times, a stage of the conversation is arbitrarily skipped, resulting in having to fill the gaps on what happened between where the conversation was and what we are talking about now.
-Quests disappearing and cash disappearing from inventory
-Quests resetting (Spoilers ahead) [spoiler] we opted to let the refuges stay in our HQ, then in the middle of adventuring we received a radio message saying that our troops have found refuges stashed away inside the HQ, so we went back. Upon going back, the intro dialogue with the Patriarch repeated and we had to re-clear and re-investigate the HQ. We talked to the refuges again and let them stay again, so we were able to move on but it was still certainly immersion breaking [/spoiler]
-Spoiler... [spoiler] also with the mafia boss in little vegas, my partner shot him with a sneak attack to open the combat, upon which combat was interrupted and he said ""okay I surrender, what now?"" the conversation was interrupted by the enemy's turn, so we just had to kill him. [/spoiler] this dovetails in with another glitch, if player 2 starts combat, player 1 loses their turn. ie: if P2 starts, turn order is P2->enemy->P1... if P1 starts, turn order is P1->P2->Enemy...

In short, there are just an overwhelming number of bugs and of the 39 hours I've played, I would solidly say that at a minimum half of these hours have been troubleshooting, using workarounds, having to revert to saves from 8+ hours prior and blasting through to catch up to where we were, or flat out repeating quests/dialogues from earlier in the campaign that are happening a second time.

23,75351052,english,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PLAYING IT WITH A FRIEND IN COOP MODE, HERE'S WHY:

The game is UNBELIEVABLY buggy. I played with a friend, he was the host. Below is a list of bugs ordered by how absolutely insanely gamebreaking:

1- Quest log restting: Our quest log, which seems to determine which NPCs are where and what their dialogue options are and determines progression through the story CONSTANTLY RESETS ITSELF AND BECOMES EMPTY! Every time we load/change zones, there seems to be a chance that our quest log becomes empty and we have to reload the game from the previous god damn zone. anything else doesnt work. We have had sessions where we check the quest log, make sure it is fine, save, then go to a different zone and our log disappears, and upon loading the aforementioned save or any save in that zone, THE LOG STAYS EMPTY. This is the MAIN reason you should not buy this game.

2- AI is targetting corpses: This happens in every encounter. If one of my or my friend's characters gets knocked down in combat (aka dies and needs to be revived), the AI still tries to go towards that corpse. AI ends up wasting entire turns doing this and we have won encounters that felt very stupid because of it.

3- Equipped weapons sometimes go to the inventory on their own: and when you equip a weapon, it needs to be reloaded. I check my guys before the fight, all weapons equipped. encounter starts: my sniper is not in my hands, and now i have to waste action points to equip and reload it before i can shoot it (which is on the next turn because a reload takes enough AP on snipers so that you cannot shoot it now). cool.

4- Turn order issues: as a turn based game, the most important thing to keep combat fluid is that the player knows when he will play and how many characters he can move... etc. Well, in this game, when you start any encounter, the turn order is just chaos. Sometimes i start the encounter with a sneak shot from out of combat, the encounter starts, it's my turn, but i have 0 action points, meaning i cannot do anything. Sometimes my friends starts the encounter, plays his characters, then it switches to my turn and the same thing happens: 0 action points for both of my characters.

5- UI issues: The UI is constantly bugging out. Dialogue boxes stay in the middle of the screen for an entire zone. weird stuff.

6- Bugged conversations: Sometimes, and completely at random, and often, i would click an npc to talk to him, and the game goes into the dialogue mode, but there is no UI, i cannot end the conversation, i cannot choose any options, we are stuck and have to load.

These bugs listed were the most annoying that came to mind, but there were MANY other smaller bugs all over. This game is less polished than every single early access or beta game i have ever played and that is INSANE.

Final verdict: Wait for major bug fix updates before buying or do not buy at all. Such a shame, the gameplay and skills and characters and voice acting are all pretty damn good, but bugs make it absolutely unplayable.",1599092022,1599092022,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198008229961,210,8,2071,0,1017,1600221917,,

The game is excellent with it's writing and the system is something you will spend hours on itself. However, with the multiplayer being dead at launch and a critical list of bugs as seen on this reddit post.

Is an utter nightmare to navigate. Especially for those who are trying to follow inExile studios challenges and community updates. There are save issues, quest issues, and even perks, stats, and pets like a cat by the name of major tom vanishing. Or other animals like robot chickens vanishing when you need to take them back to your ranger hq for a quest. 

At first you may think it is forgivable, because the potential and the story line is well written and indeed the game has am excellent hook as the up close moments in game for dialog are some of the most immersive and engaging intros to a top down tactical game to this date. Between the save data corruptions and some immersive breaking gameplay elements like fire dmg and the inability to sneakly move with melle chars instead getting a lower detection time. It is with this and the copious amount of bugs this game is a deluge of needing more dev time.

TL;DR 
Revisit the game in 60 days and pretend it just released then. Sure you will miss out on the gold scorpitron and Total Jerk difficulty mode challenge. It's not worth playing to find something glitched out or you should of saved excesively more than you should of.

41,75347971,english,"I'll start with a disclaimer - this is my first entry into the Wasteland series and I haven't beaten the game at the time of this review.

However, with that being said, I've been having just a grand old time! I'm truly enjoying the fact that each choice that I make feels like it'll have some sort of consequence (good or bad). But again, I haven't beaten it yet, so here's to hoping that this game doesn't go full Mass Effect! But in all seriousness, the decision-making, characters, combat, and feel of the game are all wonderful. I've seen some partial play videos of Wasteland 2, and I wanted an RPG with a squad focus and robust character creation (like the Icewind Dale series, for instance), and Wasteland 3 has absolutely delivered. The RPG elements allow me to build characters that truly look and FEEL different, not just in gun usage but in capabilities. The humor does go a little overboard sometimes, but I have loved every second of the zany hijinks that are in this game. The combat has a nice tactical feel that allows each of my characters the chance to shine with whatever specialty they've been given. And the music? You know, those songs that play during certain important battles in the game? Absolutely incredible.

There are some bugs, sure. I find it annoying that I will change the order of some characters around and then it'll be undone as soon as I go into another zone (no I do NOT want Kwon as my third character, I want him as my fourth to keep my created Rangers TOGETHER, GOSH DANG IT). Sometimes the UI recognition is a little off. Other times my characters will randomly have their second weapon equipped instead of their primary, and I don't know why. And yes, the load times can be a bit of an issue. But none of the bugs that I've had would put it into the category of an ""unfinished game"" or ""buggy mess"". Could it use some polish? Absolutely. Have these very minor inconveniences caused me to rant about how trash this game is on Reddit? Not in the slightest. As an additional note - I know some people have experienced problems with crashes. My PC is decent, but nothing impressive, and I haven't had a single crash to this point.

All in all, if you want to wait for some patches and polish before spending the full price on this game (or even wait until it goes on sale), then I completely understand.

WL3 is all about the team, not the solo character hero. But If you liked Fallout, Fallout2, and Fallout Tactics, you'll love this. 

Same grim humour, doesnt take itself too seriously, but keeps enough in itself to have a brilliant story. 
You dont need to have played Wasteland/2 to get this, it's a good old-fashioned revenge story, told in a very grey moral way.

Nothing in the game is a pure good or evil choice, like i said, lots of grey. 

The levelling system is beautiful, lots of weapons and ways to kill and maim. The worldmap has been upgraded from WL2, it's actually a joy to wander about. Random encounters are fun, and some of the NPC 's made me literally laugh out loud. Combat is a lot more fun than i expected it to be, seems very well balanced.

Haven't played coop, haven't experienced game breaking bugs, but there are tons of them, from minor visual glitches to broken skills/attributes, repeating scenes, NPC who have died but are still alive in some locations, etc. But let all of that aside, the game world is really a wasteland, i experienced like 10-15 small side quests during playthrough, 5 relatively short main quests after prologue. I dont understand folks comparing this to Fallout. Fallout is very variative game, which you could complete without a single fight, or at least without fighting yourself, there are no more games like good old Fallout. Wasteland 3 is just X-COM in postapocalyptic setting. The only thing pleasantly surprised me was that many fights can be turned in your favour or avoided by exploring around area, but there are still a lot of unneccessarily fights. Another thing that bugs me is that skill checks are purely linear and depend only on one numeric parameter, you don't have good old charisma, now you seem to have charisma that boosts your party stats and grants bonus exp, way to go. I really do hate that fact, that in old games, from 90-s and beginning of 2000-s games was much more fun, has much more content, and much freedom of choice. Seems like that nowadays only thing we get is better graphics, voice overs and cutscenes, gameplay is degrading. Why after every fight there is a medicrate and ammo crate?
Oh and also, game is very short and linear. Singleplayer contains unneccessary elements of coop, there is no leader, just a rangers hivemind which i hate a lot, even the Machine Intelligence Tower doesnt 100% agree with everything it says or thinks.

53,75340996,english,"Pretty disappointed overall for this game.  I'm just entering Denver and my squad is about level 11.  

Things that suck:  Overall the game has zero polish.  It's a real kick in the nuts if you're used to quality titles like Divinity 1 or 2.  Stats don't have tooltips to explain them (what does perception do?).  Using the mouse is clunky, if you use the shrink grenade - good luck trying to click on an enemy if it is on the same square as literally anything else.  The voice acting is horrendous, I'm pretty sure they just skipped using actors and asked for volunteers from the dev crew.  

The overall story and writing is really boring and predictable.  Some powerful male king figure sends you on a mission, but then things get mysterious as he turns out to be not who he says he is and...blah blah...ok, i'm not 12, give me something new.  

The combat messages appear and disappear before you can read them.

If you get shot from an enemy there is a 50/50 chance you either won't see who shot you or who got shot, because the camera isn't pointing at both actors, so you kinda have to guess.

If you're in your car/tank thing you can't really see if you're near radiation until it is too late, and then you have a squad with 24% less hp then 2 seconds ago. 

It's like a game that had some juvenile ideas, was hobbled together with a lot of obvious time and money saving corners cut, and kind of crapped out this pretty lame experience.  I saw a robotic statue of a US president melt a robot and kinda lost interest completely.  Like...we get it, you think Americans are idiots and we worship ourselves and violence.  Social commentary is ok, but the way it's presented in this game is just overdone, and quite honestly if I were a red state person I'd probably be a little offended by their obvious and relentless mockery.

The lore books I have no interest in reading.  There are too many ammo types, like I don't want to keep track of 10+ ammo types and constantly sell 100's of useless weapons.  Targeting is clunky and often broken.  The UI is hard to understand, and never really explained.  Why have quickslots if you can just go to the inventory and drag the item into the quickslot DURING combat with no ap penalty?  Just give us 5 quickslots.  

It's that kind of dev-blind player experience that really has me thinking twice about playing this game anymore.  Then you have stupid AI.  Where in Divinity you have a party of 4 and none of them will walk over say...fire on the ground.  In this game you have a party of 6 + 3 animals and they all die because you forgot to unselect them all and they stupidly run right through the fire, or ice spray or whatever...so it's another reload...

Got a grenade?  Watch it get thrown in a stupid nonsensical arc up through the ceiling and then back down through it a second time, only to do a nonsensical amount of damage.   Using a sniper rifle?  Watch yourself shoot the 2 foot high barrier in front of you like a moron.  

Got 10 strength and a cool fist weapon?  Watch yourself hit like a wet noodle and realize unarmed is broken.  Use a molotov cocktail?  Hope you don't have animals as they fearlessly run right through the burning flames and scream every turn as they burn.  Also, it's almost impossible to tell where the fire ends and a safe square begins, so you kind have to guess.

Ultimately, these are all tiny issues, but combined they lead to a play experience that I just can't recommend.  The game needs a lot more polish.  It wasn't ready for release.  It was game-breaking bug free...maybe...but not polished and ready to be enjoyed.  It's in a state where an intelligent gamer is going to spend as much time moaning and groaning as leveling up...which is another tedious experience.  I'm only level 11, and that means I've leveled up 3 separate stats tabs, 11 times each, for 6 characters...that's 180 tabs of clicking a square to choose a perk or a single strength stat.  That isn't fun.  That feels like a job working for a business in the 80's when Microsoft excel was just released for the first time.

77,75334274,english,"I like this game, I like where it is going, and I like the improvements over the previous title. Does it have issues? OH ABSOLUTELY IS DOES. LET ME ELABORATE:

For being another title with party based squad management you'd think they'd have ironed out some of the poor default controls or lack of controls in regard to managing your squad. Theres no options to tell multiple members do all line up, or move in unison, crouch down, or simultaneously fire. So for 'player initiated' combat you end up trying to set up outside aggro lines and select each person to position and crouch/cover while praying you're quick enough to not have someone pat into sight and give the enemy all their turns before you while you're out of cover. It's dumb.

Also, if a party member spots a trap, howabout the party stops, and revamps their pathing to avoid that trap.

And as other reviewers have said, Co-Op might as well not even be a thing at this level of broken, and theres plenty of graphical glitches along with ridiculous loadtimes to go with them. Story choices are good, but I honestly can't think of an RPG where there hasn't been at least a few times where I've wanted an option that just isn't offered- this included.

And then theres combat.... which is good but also inconsistant. Why can this character not use an ambush? Why does it say this gun has no ammo when its fully loaded? Why does it say there are no targets in range despite this person clearly being in range? Why can some robots be hacked and others not? Why can I only hack robots in combat? Why does my melee character stand inside my other character and then can do no actions because he's in a shared spot? You get the idea.

If you can forgive all that, which is very doable, it's a fun game. And that's what it's for right? Have some fun, blow some nerds up with a rocket launcher that shoots ferrets.",1599064935,1599064935,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197977781021,851,6,3172,0,1316,1600664035,,

That said, there is very little in the way of breaking ground, this is fairly old school so if you like this genre, you'll like this game, but if you are looking for something that has built and improved on the formulae, you might be a little disappointed.

It's got great character development, great quests, no random generated content, excellent voice acting. You get a lot of flexibility in creating your characters, including new ones that join you, so it makes having pre-existing characters a bit pointless, since it makes way more sense to just build your own and customize them to what you need. The world economy is surprisingly balanced. I'm not flush with cash (so far at level 12), which makes looting irrelevant, but I also am not broke and unable to keep reasonably supplied.

Other issues are the slightly clumsy world map navigation when you drive around in your car, that could have been a bit smoother, and it is interesting to have a car in combat, though again, it is a bit of a clumsy interface.

Yes, the game has some of the issues of RNG based combat, but overall it is a solid system and there is a lot of variety of weapons and strategies. Sometimes it is easy to attack what you are trying to select so you have to be careful with the interface. Small issues overall. Bugs are minimal. If I had one major complaint it would be the very slow loading times, transitions, save games, it is all really slow.

80,75333136,english,"Intro:
I have been looking forward to this game for a long time. I followed Wasteland 2 through development and enjoyed it immensely, and so when I heard about Wasteland 3 I hoped and prayed that it would be as good, if not better. Thankfully the game is good, but unfortunately I don't really think it is better than Wasteland 2. However, I am still very early on in the game, in the first starting area (despite 13 hours played) so I will most likely be updating this review as I go along, and I may even change my opinion on which game is better by the end.

Characters:
This game feels a lot less like Wasteland 2, and a lot more like Divinity Original Sin: Wasteland Edition. I don't know what happened, if they bought the engine, or changed their engine to be a lot like Divinity, I have no clue, I didn't look into it. You also start off with only two characters, like in Divinity. In the previous games, W1 and W2, you made your party of 4 characters right off the bat. You could create hyper specialized characters, or a well rounded party that covered almost everything pretty well. In this one you can't, or at least at the start you don't know you will be able to do it later. It seemed so much like Divinity that I made two characters I never would have made if I knew that an hour or so later I could create my other two. I don't know why they made this choice. I think it is silly and really hurts the early game, and I constantly think about just restarting knowing what I know now.

Skill Changes:
Like I wrote back in my Wasteland 2 review, I felt like there were just too many skills. The game was absolutely full of things for you to use them on, so the ones you invested in never felt like a waste, but so many of them overlapped or were just plain unnecessary. In Wasteland 3 they have finally combined many of these skills together, you now have Nerd Sh*t for all the different computer stuff, Sneaky Sh*t for all your stealth and alarm disabling, Lock-picking now includes Safe-Cracking, medical skills have all been rolled into First Aid, etc, etc. Some may see this as a breaking down of the game, but I see it as something that needed to be down and that dragged down the first game, and I am a hard core RPG fan who loves player choice and agency when it comes to this sort of thing and creating unique characters. With this change the game just runs so much smoother.

However, and keep in mind that I am still early on into the game, it feels as though that despite all of these skills being rolled into each other, there are far less chances to do any of them. In the first game skill checks were everywhere, I mean everywhere. Your characters with those skills felt fantastic when you played them, because they were always useful no matter what it was. Now it seems there are far less chances to use your skills, a lot like Divinity.

Skill Changes Con't + Damage Subtypes:
There is one area that they really messed up, and that is removing Laser Weapons from the different types of guns you can use, and instead rolling it into a new Weird Science skill. Some context is needed before I continue on this. Elemental damage types have been added into the game, like Divinity, as well as environmental damage sources, such as explosive barrels, oil barrels, etc. (The list is Energy [laser], flame, cold, and I think acid/nuclear but I am not far enough in yet for that.) While this is nice tactically, it just makes me think of Divinity. I understand that they wanted to make laser weapons for all the different weapon categories, so that you can have an elemental sub-type weapon (like with flame throwers, and ice bullets) but now instead of just investing in Laser Weapons and using that character on non-human enemies with all kinds of laser weapons, you have a character that is split down the middle with their weapon choices.

So not only are they only half as good at using their, lets say assault rifle, but now they are only half as good at using their laser assault rifle. They also can only use said laser assault rifles, no longer able to use all the laser weapons. Like I mentioned before, laser weapons could really only be used on non-human enemies or enemies with high armor, and so when fighting you could sometimes find yourself down one party member for a fight, but at least they were good in the fights they were in, and could be customized with different weapons for those fights. They could literally change the tide of the battle, as robotic enemies are some of thee toughest out there. Now I feel like in the attempt to make them more useful, they have instead been made less useful. Maybe my thoughts will change on this as I go along.

More Skill Changes:
In the previous game, when it came to picking a lock, or disarming a mine, what ever your amount in that skill was, it would give you a % chance based on the difficulty. So if you only had 50%, but you really wanted to loot a safe, or try and disarm a security system, you could take that risk and deal with the consequences of the safe being broken forever, or the alarm system being set off. They have changed it so that now if the skill check is a difficulty 5, you require a 5 in that skill. I can understand why they made that change, having a 90% chance to open a locked door, and then failing it, was maddening at times, but it felt more real, there is always a chance that shit could happen, and it also let you try your hand at stuff that was out of your league and possibly hit the jackpot early on. This change feels a bit sterile, it takes the excitement and danger out of it all. You could possibly disarm that booby trap with a 70% to get into that armory, is it worth the risk? Do you want to try your luck? Now you know you can't do it, and will have to come back later (if you can even come back later.)

There is also a small problem when choosing your skills. At different levels depending on your skill level, you can get bonus abilities relating to that skill, that you can spend Quirk points on to obtain. This is great, a lot like the last game, but there is a problem in that more than half the time you cannot read what this ability is, because you cannot scroll down, because if you move your mouse off of the skill level the info vanishes.

Sound Design:
So far I have only heard one song play while I was in a big main quest fight, and I barely hear the music playing while I am going about in the world. Minor fights don't seem to have any musical changes, and ambient music is almost non-existent. Maybe I need to turn my music volume up, I will do that next time I play, but really music is a huge part of games, and to have it set, or to not have much music at all, I found to be a huge detriment to the game. Otherwise the sound design is great, with weapon noises, impacts, explosions, voice acting, everything really, being done extremely well. Not just the voice acting for main characters, but for minor characters out in the world too, it all sounds great.

This is in stark contrast to Wasteland 2, which had a much smaller budget and so could only afford to give main characters voice lines. But, again, this just makes it feel like divinity, especially when you step on a pile of blood and it makes the same noise. Because Wasteland 2 couldn't voice all their characters, text based dialogue had a large amount of importance placed on it, and it showed. Characters were fantastic, and even talking to many minor characters felt very good, with tons of dialogue options and things for NPCs to say, and for you to respond to, in a lot of detail. Now because they used all voice actors, I found that amount of detail and focus on making all the characters have a lot of great stuff to say is gone. It feels a little bare, stripped down.

I am out of characters to write with, so I cannot continue writing this, but I do highly recommend this game to both Wasteland and Divinity fans. Both will find something to love.",1599063355,1599063355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197967223692,784,164,5257,0,775,1600277202,,

Is it bad? No. 
Is it a masterpiece? No.

6 major problems the game has (not counting performance and bugs):
1. 27 hours (skipping dialog when haveing read it). Is just to short a game.

2. All of the recruitble unique characters. Does not seem to have any unique quests related to them. (not 100% true. You are given a quest when you meet two of the recruitble characters them and accept them into your party. But you do not need them in your party to complete thoese quests.)

3. Lack of unique dialog and opinions by party members. The character with the most dialog was Vic Bucannan and considering how late into the game you can get him into your party. There was only 2-3 places where any of my party members actually cared about what i was doing. 
The Marshal did not want me to take a family heirloom gun from a famous ranger. 
The private ranger you can get into your party was shocked i wanted a clone but otherwise did not care.

4. Unlike Wasteland 2 where you had to consvere ammo in the early game. There is no point during the entire game you are pretty much not drowning in ammo.

82,75332744,english,"Wasteland 3 has it's fair share of improvements over Wasteland 2 I feel but it also has some teething issues that should have been addressed already in a full release.

Pro's:

Exploring and combat are much smoother. No longer you need to select a PC, then select the skill from the skill bar and then click on the object you wanted to interact with. Nor do you have to manually reload after each battle.
There's also no ridiculous difficulty spike that marred 2 when you met the first robots. If you meet a heavily armoured enemy in three you probably already have alternative weapons to deal with it.

The story so far is fine and I haven't had a horrible choice like the Dam or Ag city (where you're pretty much f'ed no matter what you choose and do) choice in two. Choices do matter though, at least for reputation. Not sure if it goes deeper then that yet.

No more timed adventure map nonesense like the Topeca kid in 2 who drowned if you weren't fast enough or dropped the wrong pillar.

Neutral

Skills are a bit simplified and mashed together. On the one hand it makes building (and varying weapons) somewhat easier, on the other hand you have less choice,

Cons

Game is not well optimised, load times are longer then they should be and the game occasionally has soft crashes.

At least one side quest is bugged where you have to return to an npc you already killed (By an 'attack' choice in a previous menu, not a random slug in the mug.) This should have been caught in play testing.

Great game with a few bugs. 

It has an amazing story with plenty of ""black and white"" choices but more ""moral grey"" than anything where you feel like none of the choices are ""correct"" and you have to live with your choices. Also the music is 10/10 when we get it. blowing off someone's head while someone is singing ""America"" in the background turns me on.  great combat with one complaint, enemy critting you... it turns a guy hitting you for 0-20 dmg to BAM 600 damage. 
I have not tried co-op yet so i don't have anything to say about it, but i am excited to try it. 
One of the thing that brings this game down imho from a easy 9-10 is the bugs. Thankfully i have had 0 crashes but i have had a few bugs that wouldn't let me complete a quest. 
1. The santa's village. If i free the elves they do their little running out of the village with the camera on them, as soon as they reach the edge they stop and nothing happens and i get stuck there and have to restart. So i have not completed that quest to the final
2. In the explosives tree, the second chance trait works on allies, even those allies that are supposed to trip the bomb if you don't have mechanic 8 in so one of the sisters will be in a strange not dead not alive state so the quest for the second brother won't close off properly saying ""4 hostages saved, 0 killed"" 
3. Killing off the slaver didn't properly update the slaver quest to find the runaway girl. 
4. When fighting fishlips, if i passed the speech check to make most of his men leave the fight, after my first ally shot it will just cycle threw my characters uncontrollibly. 


All in all if i have to give the game a Number it's 8/10. Voice work is amazing, gameplay is amazing. I laugh my ass off everytime i think of ramming that poor mech scorpion with my car to cheese out a mech scorpion kill.

- The precentage chance is gone for activities, like first aid, lock picking etc... if you dont have the required level your going to fail, end of.

The Characters are well written, organic, fully voiced, and memorable. it is obvious inXile worked hard on NPCs of all colours, and it has definitely pulled Wasteland 3 above its competitors in that aspect.
The Story is well crafted - not that it's revolutionary or anything, but the game tries its best to give you a decision to make at every junction possible, and the game changes depending on those interactions.
The Combat and Music goes hand in hand: Mark Morgan returns to handle the OST, and with the wider spread of viable weapons, combat is at its all time high.
The graphics, while pretty aren't that much better than what the previous iteration had to offer.
Sound effects are hopelessly broken, and optimization is the game's true weak point. The loading times are atrocious.

SPOILERS BE WARNED/ TIPS FOR DEVS AT BOTTOM

Story 4/10   Grade: F-

The story is horribly bland, as it attempts to guilt you for actions you did/didn’t commit. Firstly, you’re an Arizona Ranger sent on a mission to establish a trade deal (your services) with the local authority called The Patriarch. As you get near the establish location your convoy of 50 rangers get bushwhacked by bandits. The game has you pick or create TWO starting characters (I assume for the coop aspect).

So far so good right? Well, the first recruitable companion is here, but here’s the catch you can only have her join your squad much later in the game. And if you don’t have the skills to pass the check her head gets blown off. To make it worse, if you wanted to pop the bandit holding her hostage your characters stand there and watch her die before actually springing to life. 

Eventually you make your way to what was honestly an amazing cutscene that had of the best endings to an in game cutscene that I’ve ever seen (ill put this in Graphics) and your CO dies in your arms leaving you as most senior officer. Eventually you get back into the mission IN WHICH YOU MUST SAVE ARIZONA and meet with The Patriarch bla bla bla you do a bunch of tedious stuff to familiarize yourself with the base. (it was at this point you wish you could speed up the running animation). This is also where you get your second recruitable character who actually joins team November (honestly best character) along with recruiting 2 more rangers picked/crafted to fill out your squad. You then get to do some interesting side quest throughout Colorado Springs with tie ins to Wasteland 2. 

Eventually you recruit a new companion who acts like an absolute child at the dumbest of moments (In which their aren’t that many) and continue to progress the story. It was at this point that the relatively good humor and interesting interactions with the local npc come to a sheer cliff drop as the rest of the game is filled with this or that ranger people’s lives are on the line. The problem is, the story already gives you an underling mission SAVE ARIZONA. So why should I give a shit about random NPCs who did nothing for my characters to attach to? Or even for me to attach to? The rest of the game is just this, you do the job to save your home or choose the option to do something else without the motivation to actually do it. AND IT SUCKS

By the end of the game your left with the feeling of just wanting to get over with it and finishing the game because you’ll have an excuse to play something else. But what about your choices affecting the overall story I hear you mumbling under your breath. Well the ending directly corresponds to the actions you took, but it guilts you in the dumbest way possible. In my ending Arizona gets saved, at the cost of Colorado’s future (Why do I care?) and The Patriarch eventually fails to establish a long-term nation (even though its already an autocracy).  

Gameplay 5/10  Grade: F

2 words BUGGY MESS. I get it first month of release I don’t expect the best so I will replay this game in half a year, but its honestly unplayable. The amount of frustrating, hair pulling, ass puckering bugs in this game is unholy. This game needed at least 2 months of development before it could even be considered early access. Heres a list

1.	Can’t use throwables indoors. Arc goes straight up

2.	Audio lines from npc repeat and overlap, I hear an npc say a line at 3 different time intervals

3.	Action points disappear or become infinite allowing my sniper to kill 5 people

4.	None of the exploding barrels give me tell me the radius (this might be by design BUT COME ON)

5.	Your squad mates decide to Rambo trip wires and mines with their face

6.	Trip wire and mines don’t have a click box to disarm

7.	Laser wires can’t be disarmed (not a single one gave me the option)

8.	Familiar ai (which expand your party by 2) go Rambo and face check traps RIP MAJOR TOM

9.	Cassette tapes cut off

10.	Radio cuts off 

11.	Weapon mods can’t be taken off (also by design BUT COME OOONNNN that’s the worst way)

12.	The ending song reading the epilogue cut off into two random combat songs and then into silence with the fire cracking in the background (approx. 50ish, somewhere around the sending convoys part)

13.	Quest, not finishing, resetting, especially when I kill an npc deserving it.

14.	A few more

Graphics 9/10 Grade: A

Thank fully this was one of the few things Wasteland 3 had. Each cutscene had me reengaged with toe curling excitement. BUT HERES THE PROBLEM why was there so few? One of the best aspects of the game limited to a few cutscenes one wasted on some random cannibal who was a recruitable companion for some reason. EVERY introduction to every companion should have had a cutscene. EVERY dialogue option with faction important character should have had a cutscene especially the fate deciding moments. 
TIPS

Here’s some tip for your next game. From someone who’s played a variety of rpgs. I’m not THE GAMER, but some of these should help.

1.	All recruitable companions should be introduced before 40% of the game is completed.

2.	Make your ammunitions match the gun you’re putting in the game. (m1911)

3.	Don’t waste time on developing weapons an ammunition that doesn’t make sense I.E Spikes

4.	Submachine guns and handguns are small arms, rifles and shotguns are assault weapons

5.	Stop trying to guilt me. Im a cold heartless bastard with loyalties to family. This would have been better if the 3 kids cut up Colorado and I was a ranger born in Colorado raised in Arizona choosing to help one of the kids, help The Patriarch take back control, or even take over Colorado for the rangers with Deth.

6.	Most of the perks were garbage, and not all the skills had perks. Perks should come rare but be good, and skills should have characters leaning to fulfilling one role over another.

7.	AI/robots can be bad, but cool future shit like being have cyborg should not be guilted. Let me kill bad people when I want

8.	YOU THE DEVS MAY NOT LIKE HOW WE PLAY and that’s cool. Make what you want cannon BUT let us play how we see fit.

And the sex is good enough for me to recommend. 

Firstly, the world. Amazing. Fantastic factions, grey moral choices, and depressed robot prostitutes that want to fuck you. 

You can take ""hush money"" from gangsters, eat ""clown burgers""(dont), literally save the elfs from tyrannical santa clause, or make them work tirelessly making ""candy"" for the ""benevolent"" rangers. 

My favourite factions has to be this religious cult that worships an AI of United States president Reagan. And let me tell you, nothing gets me on board quicker than a couple dead commies. 

The combat is good with a large variety of character customization, the diologue options aren't just based of off your ""charisma"", but can change the course of events based on how much you pump into mechanics, or first aid. Any character build basically gives you specific, unique dialogue options with radically different outcomes.

Overall - it's a fucking romp. I'm 40 hours in and I'm only getting into the last third of the game. It's good. Replayability is enormous, especially if you're an alpha Chad gamer who doesn't quick save/load every dialogue option.

44,75308091,english,"A Post-Apocalyptic/Sci-Fi, Classic RPG, Fallout/X-Com game!!!!! -- yet with all of the flaws.

It's quirky & I've laughed more in this game than any other CRPG, but I was very close to giving this a thumbs down. However, since I have not yet encountered anything completely game breaking, I must say that it is still very fun to play and it has so much content that you will be playing for hours upon hours. Possibly 400+ hours of content if you consider replay value. I didn't finish Wasteland 2 but I can say it's better for sure. I do have many gripes though. See below for pros & cons.

Pros:
- Story. A damn good story that hooks you in.
- Sci-Fi dystopian theme. Love it, Love it! LOVE IT!!!! It puts you in the cold. A twist on your usual desert, irradiated wasteland.
- Voice acting is a pro and a con. It's so good sometimes but sometimes so slow paced. Still way better than not having it at all. Maybe that's just our horrible lack of attention in this generation. You can skip though.
- Combat is fun and satisfying, although frustrating at higher difficulties (obviously). I just get my ass kicked even at Ranger. But still, I've played a lot of this genre and it's damn good.
- Customization. A must-have and this game has it good.
- Soundtrack. Thank you very much..!
- Guns. Lots of guns (and mods, too!)
- Atmosphere/immersion. It's cold out there. Is it cold in here, too?! Damn!!!
- Large maps with a very large campaign map. Epic.

Cons:
- The price. Come on guys...Divinity 2 was 45 bucks and I only had good things to say about that game. It was also 4 players.

- It's buggy as hell. Some people said they haven't seen 'em but trust me they're there. I've seen shooting through walls and have heard random weird audio glitches. Lots of talking over other characters, radio music playing over combat music. I've seen characters grayed out as if they were still in crouch mode. I've seen characters aiming in one direction and projectiles going in the opposite direction. UI oddities. I haven't had anyone to co-op with but ..... oof .... still nothing game breaking in single player - yet.

- Cover .. ? There's a lack of cover where you think it should be in this game and it's just sad because it's quite relevant in combat.

- The UI.. oh my god the UI. I know this wont be an easy one to stomach but this UI is ridiculous on the PC. I really don't even know where to begin with this. I hate leveling up. How is this possible? Let me choose my stats and confirm them instead of changing tabs or just maybe not have a confirm button at all. Maybe I'm nitpicking but I don't like it. When comparing weapons or viewing stats it's just awful. I can't even scroll down to see some of the  extra stats or perks that weapons include. Also, I can't disable the battle cam that follows enemy movements. When you have more than one character in watch mode the camera will f@#% up pretty bad. 

- The voice acting is a pro and a con. It's well acted but the pacing is agonizingly slow. I feel like that could have been sped up. I don't have all day to listen to one character give me their long spiel after I just listened to a long spiel. Glad I can skip.

- Pets die - and they die forever. I wish I could give an order to hold position while the Rangers do the dirty work. I just love Polly too much to let him get splattered so my #1 Ranger has to stay back for the first turn so the pet follows him & doesn't engage in combat.

- Character graphics seem bland sometimes even when you zoom in. Other times they look great so...

- Loading. I feel like I've spent a lot of time loading even with my gaming SSD.

Overall, I think Steam's 7/10 is a good rating. It's quirky, has good combat and makes me happy when I load in and see my squad.

Pro: 
It's a great crpg, great storytelling, characters and the writing is topnotch, gameplay mechanics are awesome. Ingame decisions matter, you want to be superevil? a world safer? something in between? The consequences of your decisions are visible ingame. And of course it's very funny to run over deers with your truck and watch the over the top animation. The Humor is excellent.

Con: 
The campaign is too short at least for me. Supreme jerk difficulty is too easy, after 48 hours i saw the end credits, few side quests left. In the beginning it's harder, after level 10-12+ the cakewalk begins, of course you need to understand the main game mechanics of the game. The game needs some balancing. Consumables items are a waste, they should be way more important on supreme jerk.


What is OP?

Snipers are overpowered 8000hp oneshot. not always, but it happens. takes the fun out of the encounter when you oneshot a boss. Had only one sniper in my team to make it more difficult.

Turrets, decoy items and robos are too easy to get and make the encounters a walk in the park. @Devs: please disable them in supreme jerk difficulty, or create a option.

Story can be influenced and almost all missions can have different approaches/outcomes.  Side with faction A is possible, Side with faction B is possible, kill all the factions and go your own way is possible! :)

It is a dream come true for any Fallout and/or RPG fan...

Update at 52.3 hours.
I thoroughly enjoy the perks being based on your skill-level for specific skills... this makes putting points in a particular skill more worthwhile and rewarding.

The ability to charm almost any animal and make them your Pet is great.. it does depending on your skill-level though, if you want to charm an impressive animal you must have a pretty high ""animal whisperer"" skill level. I had received a particular quest reward that was a ""helper"" unit unique to my character which was great.

Pretty early in the game I had encountered the dreaded Scorpitron in a battle prompted by the map and using the Ranger vehicle I managed to destroy it.   The reward was a unique automatic weapon which immediately made my second main character a real force for enemies to consider.

The world ""seems"" alive,  I had assumed a particular assault mission suggested by another group was like the other quest missions but this one was ""timed"".  After I received a radio transmission, I checked out the target of the assault and only one character was left alive.  This was fun since I had already spent 6 hours in this particular area doing other missions and I thought this area was ""done"".   Often, areas that you ""cleared"" by killing the enemy NPCs can be revisited and cleared again since some Wasteland monsters had moving in eating the corpses (?) left in your wake.   I love the re-use of locations like that.

In addition to unique items that offer bonuses (a animal brush offering animal whisperer skill bonus for example),  perks can be earned from doing quests where initially no reward seemed obvious and cybernetics can be implemented to add bonuses.  

Weapon mods allow you to modify the type of damage,  offering the ability for a frost-Assault rifle or a Fire-SMG.

All combined, the seemingly limitless possibilities, the story line and the humor makes this a great post apocalyptic RPG similar to Fallout 1, 2 and Fallout New Vegas/Wasteland 2.",1598837746,1599003311,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197976525405,967,25,4214,0,2170,1599141246,,

I first tried Wasteland 2 a few years ago, and I got beat down brutally because I thought I could easily run through it with minimum effort and still have fun with an RPG. Wasteland 2 ended up unplayed for years in my library, a relic I looked upon fondly but never played again.

Then Wasteland 3 came out, and I impulsively bought it. $60, am I right?

Wasteland 3 has surpassed my love of Wasteland 2, and while being challenging, it creates worthwhile victories that stack and stack. It's a great game, with ton of pop culture references, and seemless combat. It's a fun ride, and I'm not done with it yet.

Wasteland 3 has two big problems for me: its load screen which takes ages to move from location to location, and only having 2 player coop. The load screens become difficult to deal with, but aren't a deal breaker. 

2 player co-op doesn't make sense with the system in place. Realistically, due to having 4 customizable rangers, should yield toward 4 player coop. Yet it's a 6 person squad, so I would understand 3 player co-op with each player given 2 people. Divinity managed a system like this that worked, so Wasteland 3 could too.

15,75282764,english,"52 hour solo playthrough and it was a grand ol' time. Really, really impressed. Despite the often minute-long load screens and a handful of technical snafu's this game remains downright deadly. From the myriad of meaningful choices your presented at every turn, to the stupendous voice acting and character work seen in even the most insignificant of on-screen vistors - the inventive dialogue, the terrific character customization that allows you to play and succeed with a variety of different weapon types. This game pulls you in and immerses you wholly. And let me tell you, when you reach one of the various climatic peaks and that folksy soundtrack kicks in with a darkly grim yet strangely hopeful rendition of an American classic... it gets you. Man, it gets you. 

That said I have a few gripes. One, it's a little short for a game of this style. Not by much, maybe ten or so hours shy of just right. Though I suspect there's a few areas I missed because near the end I was so encapsulated by the critical path that I felt obliged to sally forth, still I doubt what little I missed would have bridged that ten hour gap. Second, technical issues - long loading screens, interactable's becoming non-interactable, delays in the combat and out of combat interfaces, occasionally resulting in nightmarish consequences, issues with character pathing while controlling multiple units which risked followers being spotted or running into traps, random turn skippage. Few other unmentionables. However the biggest annoyance is simply that these various technical holdups necessitate the need for reloading which guarantees at least a minute of sitting at yet another lengthy loading screen. And lastly, the level of challenge isn't super consistent, when it's good it's good, but even on the hardest difficulty I felt more advantaged than not during most encounters. Granted I save scummed plenty, but not nearly as often as in other similar games and the reasons were often due to some technical mishap.

25,75212673,english,"First, ignore all the rose-tinted review from the fanboys. I will give you impartial one from someone who is fresh to this series. This game deserves a neutral and maybe a thumb-up later if they manage to patch the so many game-breaking bugs and serious balance issues down the line. As it is, it is not really worth the price. maybe 20-30% lower would do. We have good thing here but it is lacking in many areas. 

Gameplay is the biggest gripe for me, as it also should be since this is a turn-based combat heavy game. Think about this as Divinity Original sin 1 but half the combat depth and un-ignorable balancing issues. Why? Let me go point by point. They seem trivial alone but when combined, you get a very accumulative annoying experience.

Class/gameplay diversity is terrible: 
Why? You have combat stage that is mostly empty space with very little cover. This means to fight effectively, you need to shoot far and precisely, i.e. the game shoehorns you into running snipers or somewhat acceptable assault rifles. You can get away with pistol on lower difficulty but most likely, you will die before you even get into position. Enemies hit hard even on easy. Game demands preparation when it will only take a few turns before enemies start piling up on you and by the time you are ready to fight, you are wiped. So you either have to make everyone sharpshooter or have a dedicated doc with tons of med packs running around reviving (boring). Melee is useless. Unless you body block or is the only one in wide proximity surrounded by enemies, they will go after the weakest ones in your team. I mean, they will beeline to them to kill them and purposefully ignore your tank. So why even give us a tank build? There is also serious issue with stat building. Every class and spec needs to max out Coordination, i.e. forced. If you play melee, you need strength and speed. If you play gun, you need luck and awareness. If you play utility, you need intelligence and maybe leadership. Wanna play turret/engineer? Too bad every deployment costs an arm or a leg. The game does not favor hybrid and force your builds to be very one-dimensional. If you dabble, you will suck because your stat will suck and you won't have access to high level active skills that are acquired through leveling these professions. These are just the more high level examples. The game LOOKS like it has shit ton of customisations but it doesn't if you don't want to wipe the floor every turn. Compared to games like Pillars 2 or DoS2 when it comes to balancing diversity with viability, this game is terrible at it. Like I mentioned earlier, this also extends to how the level design is made to favor only certain playstyles. 

Level design is bland and uninspiring:
Continuing on previous point, it seems the only mechanic around the battlefields boil down to a few thing: shoot this, cover here, shoot this barrel for some extra explosion. and that's about it. maybe you will land stun once or twice as CC in an encounter but that's as far as combat depth go, i.e. extremely bland. It's NOT BAD but it's not something like DoS2 or Pillars2. This game fails at the classic combat design. It favors dps creep and make tactical thinking saved for some position meaningless. In DoS2, you can manipulate the battlefield for some fantabulous battle strategy. You can't expect that here. 

SO. MANY. GAME-BREAKING BUGS:
At some point, it will crash or freeze, or get stuck, etc. get used to it if you don't want to wait for patches

Those are some major gripes. Story is a bit short but if you play blind and try to do everything, it will be long enough. Companions are..... there but don't expect Bioware level. Game oversells on the moral choices and consequences. They are there but again somewhere inbetween Bioware and Bethesda kind of meaningful.

=The graphics is pretty mediocre, environment lacks details.

-The optimisation sucks, fps drops can only be fixed by restarting, imagine having severe fps drop in the middle of a fight, and you can't save.
-Plenty of bugs, some bars quest progression. One of those is killing the slaver in Ranger HQ, breaking the side quest completely.
-Main story quest forces you to make a binary choice, there is no alternative.
-Some of the side quests are timed, but there's not enough information in the quest log mentioning that, I accidentally exited Ranger HQ from the start and received Homestead distress call, went back to Springs to catch up on the main quest, ended up failing both the homestead and caravan side quests.

I think if they're able to fix some of the issues with the UI bugging out (sometimes cant click or things dont behave the way you want) and loading times (really frustrating having to get to somewhere which is 3-4 areas away and waiting for each) this game will be really solid.",1598972073,1598972073,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198037366439,67,3,3210,17,1186,1600886469,,
32,75269447,english,"I honestly don't remember when was the last time I played a game with so many minor bugs and unfinished features. It's as if no one actually played the game before releasing, which I don't really think is possible, but the only other possiblity I can think of is that they knew about all these things not being done, but decided to release it in this state regardless, which is even worse.

It's so many tiny little things like sometimes you meet traders out in the wasteland and if you choose to filter their items by category because you'd for example only want to see bullets, the game will cancel out of the trade window completely, trader will be gone and game will ask you if you want to be towed back to base (???). Or if you try to sell all junk, but you have none you'll get a message saying ""you can't afford that item"". Surely this is not the message you wan't to display in this situation, just another already existing message linked to the instance of this event.

There's also many simple quality of life features missing like being able to filter your inventory for a specific type of a weapon. There's a ton, an absolute ton of loot dropping from everything, almost any room you enter has 1 to 3 boxes with stuff, which is kind of cool, but very quickly you end up with 50+ different guns in your bag (and it goes up quickly even more as well) so trying to figure out which of your characters could use which weapon is kind of a pain, because you have to go through all of them, as they seem to sort in some strange way, so that some weapons don't sort like the others. 

A simple feature to filter gun types and armor types, please.

Also some items don't belong to any category and you only see them in ALL view. Good luck finding something there after a few hours of playing.

While travelling outside in the Kodiak you can't move the camera - which I guess I can understand why - you can't really see further than you are. Ok I get that, but then when on foot you can do that regardless, so this doesn't really make sense. And this in of itself wouldn't really be an issue, but in some areas of the map the camera will auto position over Kodiak in such a way, that you can't see where you are or where you can go, because the scenery is in the way of what you can see. Just let us move it a little, like half a screen if you don't want to go all the way.

Some traps dont have indicators when you hover them, so it's kinda quicksave - quickload lottery trying to figure out which skill you need to use to disarm it and whether or not you have it trained high enough.

Which reminds me - loading takes a really, really long time, but this might be me, can't say for sure. Everything works really smooth, but the loading or level transitions take a really long time (interestingly, even if you're transitioning to a small location)

The game is fun and I'll be happy to change the review if these things are fixed, as at the moment it's rather frustrating on every corner. It honestly feels like playing an unfinished Early Access game, which I wouldn't mind, if the game was tagged as EA, I would probably still buy it and still play it and wouldn't complain.

There's also a lot more of these things, but I don't want to add more to what already became an essay.

These issues are so obvious that I do not believe they could have been missed, so it makes me think that the developer doesn't care about the quality of the released product and released this game in this state knowingly ""to fix later"" which is kind of a shame, because I always had a lot of respect for inXile.

I was on the fence about buying full price, and just wound up going for it on a whim. 

In terms of RPG elements and story telling, I got my money's worth within the first day of owning this.

The story is just absolutely compelling and interesting. There is a pull about the writing and voice acting that caters VERY well to the immersion. 

The game clearly has high replay value and will seemingly lend itself very well to at least a few different runs. Which, you'll probably want to do considering the likelihood of spending your first playthrough learning what you really want to specialize your squad in.

This is the best Wasteland game I've played so far. With this as a base offering, I can't imagine what is coming in the future regarding DLC options, mod availability and so forth. 

If you like games in this genre, its an absolute buy. Yes, I have read people have had difficulties with co-op, but I didn't get this game for that aspect. That part is more of a side option in case a friend gets it and wants to play sometime. I much prefer experiencing the story solo for any first playthrough. 

Just get it and enjoy.

While I am not really a sucker for the storytelling, I do enjoy the characters and overall atmosphere - It reeks of some good ol' post-apocalyptic adventures.

But the firefights, strategic gameplay and sometimes harsh choices are among my favourites and why I have wanted to comeback to Wastelands again. And it is simply awesome!

Nothing functions properly. Glitches and exploits occur frequently even by complete accident. Performance is horrible, although the very small hotfix from the 29th has improved it slightly. Give this game a few months before even thinking about touching it.

Not experiencing the bugs that some are having, but the few I do get are the kind where a dialog interaction or cut scene doesn't want to end and hand control of back to the player, requiring a hard crash of the client. Co-op has issues more often than solo play.

Bugs aside, the writing seems to be juvenile and predictable. My son who normally likes a heavy dose of that kind of humor, has already reached the point where even he finds some of the names and character lines to be annoying.

On the plus side, I really do enjoy having the type of control it gives. Such as attacking the Patriarch right as soon as you meet him. Decisions where a choice between doing one of two events needs to be made gives weight to them.

48,75271624,english,"tl;dr: If you are a fan of Fallout 1 or 2, Brian Fargo, or Wasteland then you'll probably love this game. The atmosphere and gameplay is here but, there are some issues.

So far, the game gives off a wonderful early Fallout vibe, which is incredible. There are lots of companions/rangers to choose from and you can customize them all. The combat works and isn't too much of a struggle on the normal difficulty. That said, there are some issues that just shouldn't be in a supposedly finished product by such a renowned developer.

Unfortunately, several hours in and the first-person conversations mechanic touted on the store-page has been used twice, both in the first 20 minutes. That's 2 conversations that lasted maybe a minute in my entire play through so far. I wouldn't call that bringing Colorado and its sensational landscapes to life with first person conversations. There is lots of atmosphere and the world feels alive, but this touted feature isn't causing it.

There are also many small bugs and systems that need another pass of polish.

Unfortunately, the game still feels very much like a beta with at least one mostly non-existent system and UI bugs that should NOT have made it through to launch. 

For example, using a controller to navigate the inventory UI. If you select an item and then press down and then up to navigate the menu, the UI breaks and you have to close the inventory. This is most likely because they've used Unity or built a system like Unity's Canvas and haven't locked the UI movement from going back into the inventory when an item menu is open. The UI inventory system doesn't know that it 'can't' go off the menus when they are open.

The above bug is something I ran into on my own Unity project recently and as an inexperienced indie dev, I fixed it pretty quick. So I really just can't believe inXile missed this and other issues if this is a full release.

For that reason, I really can't recommend what feels like a beta product as a full release. Ultimately, the game will absolutely please fans of Fallout and Wasteland but I can't ignore the issues I've found.

Pretty in-depth character customization, and definitely more options than some rpg's tend to give you. You even get to unlock more clothing as you go to add to your wardrobe (which you unlock later to change small cosmetic stuff like hair and so forth, so don't fret if your character isn't how ya like it.) The combat is what you'd expect from the usual grid-based combat, but with the added bonus of percentage based hit chance applying to every bullet that leaves the chamber. Beautiful. Branching dialogue trees are my favorite, and this game has it in spades. The writing is phenomenal, and the voice acting breathing life into every word is just god damn art. In most games I just run out every dialogue option to get exposition incase it's relevant to something I need to know. And in this case.. it's nuanced. I love the exposition just because I love hearing the characters talk, and how the voice direction might've influenced an individual personality. That's my nerdy little rant though.

Assuming you don't mind that, this is a pretty good game, though I must admit that this feels more like x-com RPG than awastelands 2 sequel (gameplay wise)

The main differences that you're gonna see compared to wastelands 2 are that now your whole team takes its turn simultaneously , and that a lot of stats are rearranged, for example now only coordination gives AP , int gives crit but not skill points and charisma gives extra xp.

If you can get over the wastelands 2 mentality though this is a really good game, it still has a lot of choices, a lot of skill checks , and the thing I liked the most was that my skill mule was useful in combat (throwing around turrets or giving ap to my chars or debuffing others)

The graphics are not that great, and the characters you'll make will probably look ugly, but at least we have oversized armour to cover it and you don't get to see them up close so that's nice.

The pros:
- Combat is fun
- Visuals are impressive

The cons:
- The combat gives you control of a squad of 3 and your friend gets a squad of 3. But each player has to play all 3 squad members and then you play your three. It means you get bored waiting for your mate to play all 3. Browsing your phone as you wait. Why not allow an option to play 1 at a time for each player?
- Your players uncover landmines and hazards. But then rather than running around them, they run into them and set them off.
- Shared inventory. So you have to 'negotiate' with your mate how much is ok to spend, what's ok to sell. you don't see what the other player loots. It's a game of 'find what your mate just picked up, maybe there is something you can equip'.
- Day one bugs are plentiful. Body parts don't render. Game crashes on loading screens. Sound cuts out
- There are loading screens so often. Makes you appreciate the constant flow of divinity.
- Player 1 seems to go first much more often then player 2 in combat. Player 1 always seems to control the vehicle too.
- Damage done from weapons to armor is not clear. Can't the UI show how much armour i'll take off and how much health i'll take off? (E.g. Divinity).

22,75249970,english,"So, I just beat Wasteland 3 after a 25 hour long journey through Colorado. A lot of folks on my friends list have asked me how it is, and how it compares to Wasteland 2, and I've decided that it's very good, better than Wasteland 2, but that there was certainly room for improvement.

That being said, 25 hours for a first play through is quite good, and there seem to be a fair few endings, branching paths, and shifts in narrative that would make for interesting replayability.

Let's start off with the things I wasn't such a big fan of.

Weapon balancing, scaling and the lack of real variety. There seem to be maybe four or five tiers to each different weapon - Pistols start out as pea-shooters, as everything else does (though of course hitpoints scale with weapon damage as well), and as you progress through the game you find each incremental stage upward. The problem with this is that there aren't any real 'unique' weapons - There are cosmetic differences between them, like the Prototype Patriarch Hammer being on par with the Engine Block Hammer but in a different flavor. I don't know what I would've liked to have seen be different there - On hit effects making a difference? Better unique weapons? In any case, a lot of the joy in finding cool loot was largely absent in Wasteland 3; The most exciting things I could find were higher ranking weapon mods, and even those were nothing to write home about.

Factions - Why does it feel like there are only two shifts for the Hundred Families? Why do the Hundred Families not impact the ending? Why are half of the factions in the game present just in Colorado Springs, and that's just three of them? These are questions for the developers, largely, but I can't help but to feel that the game, particularly the southern portion of the map, were extremely barren in regard to groups, factions, encounters, etc.

Ranger Headquarters. I hauled my ass to Colorado, got blown to shit on an ice lake, got made the CO of a mission with one other surviving ranger, ended up with a base, and you're telling me it's just ""Okay, find yourself a grease monkey, an armorer, a doctor and a cook. Also, maybe a scientist and a museum curator"". There are opportunities to collect a few more people here in there, like a robot doctor, or some extra folks for the garage, but by and large there are no real changes. Why is there not a Command and Control bunker at the AFB? Wtf

Content - I feel like I was always waiting for the LA section of Wasteland 3, to be dropped into the southern half of the map and have a whole other 22+hr shindig in front of me. Instead, after you get Radiation Resistance 3 on your Kodiak, it's barren wasteland city and Scorpitron hunting for you before you go to meet the power top that is the Patriarch's daughter. Speaking of, where is the involvement with the Patriarchs kids? You go scoop Vic and Val and they just sit in your jail? Daddy Dearest doesn't even come to slap them around? And there are no words about what happened with Liberty?

With all that being said, I still recommend the game. It's still better than Wasteland 2. It looks better. It's more enjoyable to play. It might have some performance issues, and there might be missing content, and there might be some reactivity and quest issues, but I still prefer it over going to Ag Center and listening to Highpool berate me over the radio for an hour because I couldn't be two places at once.

I hope that additional content comes out for Wasteland 3 - At the time of reviewing, the game is positively rated, it's in the top 100 concurrent players on Steam list, and it seems to be selling more copies still.

You kill or capture them, the end game happens, the game is over. It still lasted me around 25 hours, but I was hoping for more.

Here's my thoughts on how to lengthen the experience and make it feel more fleshed out:
1. Add better management controls and impact for how you handle your Ranger Citadel
2. Create some macro mechanics for allocating troops, hiring guards, world map fights between NPCs, etc., so it doesn't just feel like you show up and kill entire factions in a day
3. Add an additional campaign after the final fight that's focused on fixing the main city and making the local areas safer. Maybe with an additional deadly faction that tries to take over in the middle of the chaos?
4. Give the player a real reason to do anything but focus on two companions the entire game

Upgrades over Wasteland 2:
* No water management
* Better interface
* Better quest management
* Slightly more interesting world map
* Extremely satisfying gameplay
* Fights turned into music videos

Downsides:
* Fewer factions to interact with
* Diplomacy was relatively unimportant

One day I was bored, and began looking for games to play on the large library that XGP has to offer, and thus I landed upon the masterpiece that was Wasteland 2. I wasn't sure at first, but after finishing the game twice I knew that it was my favourite game of all time. The tactical combat, the funny encounters, and just about everything you did or didn't do had an effect on the world. When I heard Wasteland 3 was coming out as well, I was beyond excited. While I was too late to become a Fig backer, I waited patiently for Wasteland 3 to come out. Then the release date came, and then it was delayed. Finally, after what I can imagine was a lot of polishing, they released Wasteland 3.

This game surprised me from the start, as I had very high expectations and hopes for this game. I was slightly worried that inXile would simplify it too much, or screw it up in some way. But thankfully, the game is spectacular so far. I'm having more fun with Wasteland 3 than I ever did with 2, and that's saying a lot.

Furthermore, loading times are lengthy, especially considering the fact I have this game on my SSD. 

Inventory management also has its little issues, like missing a tab for utilities, and not having any place to store stuff (as far as I've seen in 36 hours). Your inventory is unlimited, but there are things I wish I could put somewhere so they don't clutter it up. 

That said, it's still Wasteland, although I would consider Wasteland 2 the superior product, at least with 3 in its current state. You're romping around a frozen (instead of scorched) hellscape, getting attacked by psychos and monsters, all the while doing quests and helping the little guy (or stepping on them). You collect loot and level up your guys and do pretty much everything you did in the previous game. The only problem is, because of various issues like the many, many glitches, doing all that is just not quite as enjoyable as in W2.

If you played the previous game, this game has plenty of references and nods to throw your way, although it also diverges off the path of Wasteland 2 sometimes even in core gameplay mechanics (like no percentage chances on lockpicking or disarming) for good or ill, depending on your perspective. If you haven't, its not so self referential you cant enjoy it, and its still a good classic-ish rpg in its own right.

Gripes - a few, mostly quality of life stuff.
Inventory is pretty basic. Could do with options to filter by weapon types etc.
Upgrading your characters is a PITA.  You have to do attributes, then confirm, skills, then confirm, perks then confirm.  FFS just give an option to commit or undo.
Fast travel within locations - why not?
Loading screens - there are far too many on these and it takes 25 secs (avg) on my good gaming rig with SSD drives.

Pros: 
-Fully Voice Acted with great actors, and funny too.  (The guy you find in prison surviving on mushrooms and rain water had me cracking up)
-Decent story with a many complex moral choices. (And some not so complex lol)
-It is Wasteland 3! A great turn based strategy RPG that will bring you back to the days of Fallout 1+2. 
-Nuff Said! If that doesn't turn you on nothing will!

Cons: 
-Long Loading Screens
-Having to backtrack through multiple long loading screens
-Laggy in crowded areas, at least for my PC, which can run most AAA games no problem, but this lags? (Da hell...)
-Some minor bugs and glitches.  (I heard there are a few game breaking bugs but I have not encountered any... yet.)


Things I want: 
-Some kind of Fast Travel System to cut down on loading times and having to backtrack through multiple areas, multiple times. 
-A function that allows you to click on the map screen to instantly position your camera, (like you can basically do in every 'isometric' RPG going back to Baldurs Gate 1), instead of having to scroll around the entire map. 
-Ability to Respec Characters. (You can just Remake any of your custom guys and Respec them that way, I think you lose some Exp though).   Playable story characters cannot be Remake or Respec however.

TLDR; Game is buggy as hell but mostly playable until it isn't. Will be very solid once the bugs are fixed. Don't buy if you want co-op; with the bugs it's broken beyond being playable.

This review will let you know if you want to play Wasteland 3 in it's current state.

I am going to preface this review with the WARNING that if you want to play this game in it's current state your experience can vary highly and you WILL encounter bugs.

Some examples of bugs are the following:

Ranger HQ bugging out due to overlapping game states.

Floating guns, misaligned weapon models, failing to execute door animations.

Quests that cannot be completed if certain actions are taken (Ex. Killing the quest giver)

Allowing in-combat death of seemingly ""essential"" NPCs?

Whatever this is: ""Users whose languages is set to Thai, Turkish, Arabic, or Polish (not a comprehensive list) may become stuck in the opening Ambush Site scene or a black screen.""

Overall this is how I'd rate elements of the game:
Scale (in-between values will be given to bugs somewhere in-between the two values)
+/- 2) Causes Insignificant affect
+/- 4) Causes Minor affect
+/- 6) Causes Significant affect
+/- 8) Causes Great affect
+/- 10) Causes in the Best/Worst way possible

[Combat Gameplay] 7/10
+10) Base combat systems feel and function very well.
-2) [BUG] Sound sometimes cuts out or animations don't play (NPCs slide around the field without animating)
-1) [BUG] Equipping consumables and using them sometimes removes the consumable from the slot even if you have more.

[Combat Attributes 7/10] 
+8) Attributes contribute greatly to a characters effectiveness in combat (spend them wisely).
-1) Lack of a in-game way to reset/reallocate attributes (punishes new players).

[Combat Perks 6/10] 
+8) Engaging and affect combat to a great deal.
-2) Some perk trees feel lacking.

[Content]

[Co-Op ?/10]
-/+ I haven't tried the co-op but from what I've read it's extremely unstable and with singleplayer not even working I would NOT recommend attempting co-op at this time.

[Main-Content 8/10] 
+6) Initially, very engaging and involved but drops off once you start exploring (unless you only do main quests).
+4) Fame and notoriety affect peoples opinions of you and what they say/how they treat you (adds a lot for immersion).
-2) While doing side-content it is easy to lose sight of the main story line.
+/-) Side-content is necessary to be strong enough to do the main quests (experience during Ranger difficulty).

[Side-Content 10/10] 
+10) Side content makes the game. Absolutely, engaging and well implemented (doesn't even feel like side-content).
+/-) Required to level up enough to do main quests. (experienced during Ranger difficulty).

[Stability 3/10] 
+8) Playable if you make sure you keep some saves.
-4) Large amount of small to game breaking bugs (encounters of these bugs vary greatly).
-1) Small immersion breaking bugs (generally visual glitches)

[Atmosphere]

[Sound 8/10]
+4) Ambient sound is well done and adds to immersion.
+2) Music used outside of specific situations is non-invasive generally but provides enough to keep things interesting.
+2) Music played at key sequences is VERY good (however these occurrences are rare).

[Immersion 4/10, 10/10 if you can ignore bugs]
+4) Environment is stunning and filled with clutter and detail.
+4) Voice acting is overall very good and all interactions are voiced (rarely there are lines that sound off).
+2) Combat sounds weighty, ambient sounds keep the player engaged.
-6) MAJOR visual, sound and gameplay bugs.",1598906692,1598907738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198039872957,227,8,4110,0,1975,1600141216,,

combat is similar to X-Com and is really fun in my opinion.
the humour is top notch ive genuinely laughed out loud quite a few times already in my current playthrough.
the characters are really unique and well written with a immersive dialogue system to match when you meet important characters.
the roleplaying elements are really well done i love how each person has their own unique role within the squad.
i have yet to try the multiplayer ive heared its had a few problems in its current state but i know inXile are working on fixing it, bugs aside however i do like the way it works where each player controls the squad members you create at the start of the game and then you can travel the wastes together or go seperate and split the group and make different choices which can affect the other person.
the soundtrack especially in action sequences is really well done ive found myself distracted by the songs before taking my turn in combat haha

Long answer: So far it is a good game, story is great, with the lore and people you have met from Wasteland 2 may have or not carried over. Also, may be some lore and characters from the first Wasteland (i have not played the first one, so i am not sure about this). Combat is interesting, for a second, it confused me with enemies get turn, then friendlies get turn.  An interesting gameplay mechanic that i'm not sure about yet. The bugs in this game are a little troublesome, only to a point where i need to restart the game. Some of the bugs i found is there would be text in the screen that won't go away, I arrange my group only to be undone later or moving into a different area.  Lastly, when playing for like 2-3 hours the gameplay gets clunky or can't seem render itself anymore. 

Should you get this game?  Probably after a few patches and then this would be worth it. But, if you liked Wasteland 2, get the game, it still has its silly and weird personality. 

Sad about these things, or may be they are there and I just didn't look hard enough. I only played for 15 hours.

1. Stutters occur throughout the game (i.e. when moving the camera during combat, when highlighting items to interact with, highlighting characters, moving between tabs in your menu (inventory, skills, perks, etc))
2. The camera movement is similar to an IOS game where you hit the button and it moves a quarter and then you have to hit it again.  Seems made for consoles or IOS not a PC Game.
3. Having problems with the button mapping, as an example I tried to map the camera movement keys to E for clockwise and Q for counterclockwise and it would not let me change them.  Also, you can't map any keys to your mouse buttons.  Again seems like a game for console.

And before anyone assumes that it might be our PC's, no its not, trust me.

Number 2: we did a mission/quest and spent almost 5 hours going through EVERYTHING in city Denver, from there we went into the robot commune. 
Everything was fine until we went back to Denver, because ones we loaded in the whole damn Denver city and questline had restared and we had to do everything again!!
5 hours down the drain!

Like i said, i like the game, but only when it works.

Example: In order to transition between two early quest hubs you will need to transition areas 4 times and each one will have a loooooong load screen.

To make it worse you will  spend less time controlling your party whilst transitioning areas than you will looking at the load screen as the areas are tiny.

The engine used seems to be of path of exile, the customization options were reduced. Character progress is like in an action rpg... a level 3 tomm gun with .40 ammo makes 4-6x more damage then your standard assault rifle using 7.62mm.... aha. And it goes like this through the rest of the game.
At the very beginning you need skilsl to be lvl 3 (rarely) up to 5 (very often) with 2 lvl 2 rangers that barely have skill at 1... and you think ""nah ok i will return later"", but you dont, because the scenery changes with every ""step"" in the game, bar a few exceptions.
It is also when you thin you will go on and get stronger as you move along... nope. First main mission and you get the first side mission at San Lux aparments, you go there and notice, ok better I get 10 more levels and way better equipment, or I keep saving and loading all the time, till the game decides in my favor (more crits for me, less for enemis).
Same when you leave Colorado Springs. You have the choice between doing a ranger thing or lick the patriarchs boots... but that decision is just an illusion, if you go for the ranger thing, you are screwed, because you can wipe out 50% of the enemy forces in the first round, but die in the 2nd because at that point you are just onehit kills. So either you go load and save and load and save and load or go for the patriarch stuff.
Basicaly I run in the same problems wasteland 2 had, thats why I quit playing it havent returned until few years later when the ""directors cut"" was released, with a lots of improvements.

Bluetooth headphones not working (other apps/games work fine)

Insanely long loading times between sections (installed onto an SSD) -- about 30-50 seconds per zone

Indeed its more polished compared to Wasteland 2, looks prettier and what I feared most was the invasion of bazinga tier writing didn't happen that much ,one or dialogue where I cringed hard but the rest was all right.
Looking how short it was it was intentional so you can see the outcome of other choices? So mixed feelings about the extension of this game if the game don't fail hope that instead of DLCs we receive a full expansion, finished the game wanting for more content.

Regarding gameplay, same as previous wasteland games, create a squad don't try redudant skills or you will harm yourself by lock options. The encounters could use some BALANCE MAN touch, they were too easy, like in theory Ranger difficult meant to be hard. I'm gonna boot on Supreme Jerk next week after my vacation from work start and see if it gets better.

Gear still suffer from the Tier garbage, this gun is better than this and require X amount of skill, some guns lack higher tier stuff so you stop at tier 7 for a long time until the end of the game where you pick a T9 version of it just to use in the final fight. Encounters are mostly with RNG loot with occasional special encounters with tailored loot so thats a downside for me. The bright side now you can see your armor equipped and even choose to see if it show up, had fun with Scotchmo wearing a power armor without the helmet Ultra Tech Hobo.
But overall the itemization of this game is pretty weak and could use some love.

The story was a bit chaotic and messy at least on the path that I choose, wish they fleshed out the Patriarch and his sons more. The side stories were fun but it needed more, because you had these sparse stories of Colorado out there but you fail to bound with the people out there.

Load-screens between zones in a given level really get to be a pain.  Some issues with confusing quests, but nothing to get excited about. Now for the best part...the story.

They do a great job with music, world-building, and general story telling. Three cheers for all the great voice actors putting their hearts and souls into their roles!!! They really bring a ton of personality into the Wasteland...that proposition from the slaver La Perla absolutely drips with menace and evil intent...and the prize she dangles is the only thing in the game that could have made me consider her offer. It  caught me totally off guard. I was glad to see that the developers did not shy away from some very grim elements....it's a very mature story. I'm just getting into some of the deeper story issues, but everything is getting more murky and complicated. About half the deals you do end up feeling dirty or leave you with regrets. Excellent writing and performance!!! I'm looking forward to all the deals I will need to strike with some truly awful devils.

Combat and general game-play are great. They really put a lot of thought into the UI, so any common tasks are streamlined...like when you kill a bunch of bad guys, you can just search one and you immediately access all the dead guys' loot. Another nice feature is the skill tool that shows you who else in your squad has a given skill so you can avoid overlaps without memorizing every detail. Combat is exciting and dangerous and  things can get out of control quickly if you do not plan well. Lots of variety in the weapons and types of enemies you face. Always something new coming at you.

I love this game, this is a game with big potential! but as of right now it is all undeveloped potential. 
let me point out some issue that bother me personally. 

- BUGS BUGS BUGS
- Cannot see enemies detection range ( 10% of the time it shows ), have to save scum to find the distance to set up ambush
- Pets rush in blocking everything and die with no workaround
- Your characters duos ( custom or not ) doesn't interact
- inventory UI is still a mess
- can't detach mod on armor and weapon

BIGGEST ISSUE FOR ME :
NO RE SPEC ( Especially on recruitable NPC )
- just let us re spec instead of restarting the game and waste hours...
- the developer put lots of effort on the interaction of these npc during quest, which enrich the story and provided new ways to solve quest, BUT you can't re spec them to fit your crew style, so it became a choice of bringing interesting npc but a liability in combat and exploration.

and that is what I mean this still feel very much beta, this trend of developers  releasing unfinished game gotta stop, who ever push this game out before it was ready is wasting the precious efforts of the people who devote their passions into this game.

The story is fantastic and the voice work has been so character appropriate that I find myself cracking up laughing as I play.  The only thing I've not been happy with is, autosave.  Even when you have it shut off, it still autosaves.  So if you want to save a game and then have other games that you play with your friends, remember to, LABEL YOUR SAVES.  Otherwise they will get saved over.   Found that out the hard way.
The character creation is descent.  It's got a good starter base of looks and styles but I do hope we get more. The controls are simple and easy.  The visuals suck you in and make you feel there.  Specially the little things.  The cold breathe, the shivering characters, the way they rub their arms and hands to warm themselves.  Very smart additions to immerse you in the game.  I fully recommend this game if you're into top down, turn based, rpg's or even just simply rpg's.  It's well crafted, the team put some love into this game and it shows.

10,75201842,english,"I like it. I honestly do. BUT I cannot recommend it in it's release state. I just had to quit out of my third run because of game breaking glitches and it has got me ever so slightly furious. If you haven't bought it but want to... wait. Give it a few weeks and then check the forums for the updates on bug fixes. If people are still raging... stay away.

Here are the ones that killed my games.

First play through. In the opening area called Ambush Site, I saved a fellow ranger. I entered into conversation - and when I came out, I couldn't open any of the boxes and dead bodies from the fight. Without resupply, I had no ammo for the next fight, a huge robot. There is a computer terminal and a water pipe offering alternate means of passing it... but I couldn't click on them due to the bug. So I either punch the giant death bot to death... Or I reload. Only the bug persisted and after a complete restart the save game loaded with one of my characters completely unselectable.

Second playthrough.

Much better. My characters got through the starting area to the HQ and then into the first mission hub - Colorado Springs. I was happily mopping up quests there when I accidentally double clicked in a conversation and started a combat. Mia Culpa. (be careful, incidentally, there is no back button or recap - if you miss what someone says to you... tough shit). Having reloaded an autosave I found... my characters were still heavily wounded from the combat I just triggered. The save was prior to the start of the fight yet my characters were next to death. On restarting the game and trying the save again, I found only one of my characters where I left it, the others were stuck somewhere off the map (or in an area I hadn't been yet). I couldn't see them when I zoomed to them and they wouldn't move to my location when I told them to walk there... And the exit area interfaces were all busted. I started a third game.

Third Playthrough. The introductory area lets you have two characters and you get more once you get to your HQ. I made it through the ambush with only one bug (not being able to use my remaining AP to 'prepare' for the next round due to 'out of range' which is odd seeing as that isn't a factor in that action). I skipped the turn instead and got to the HQ. Crafted two more rangers when the option became available - but the character creation broke this time. Whichever face, portrait or cosmetic options I clicked on first became fixed. I couldn't change them from that. Not game breaking, but truly annoying. I then tried to begin exploring the base but despite me indicating to my character to stop well short of a trap at the the top of a ladder, they ran right through the trap. I tried to reload it... and again... the game that loaded back was screwed up. One of my new built rangers was somewhere off map, heavily wounded and unrecoverable.

That's when I gave up for the night. 27 hours according to steam, and the next time I run the game I have to start again, from the start.

IN ADDITION TO THAT:

The customisation/character creation is clunky as hell. The beginning outfits are ugly as sin, the faces and hairstyles look TERRIBLE, and for some reason EVERYTHING has an overpowering blue tint. Selecting white for your armour colour changes it to a fairly deep blue and everything else is worse than that. There are blue, green and grey skin types and gradients of white skin to brown, but no yellow or red variation so asian or native american characters are not an option. Orcs. Trolls. Dark Elves. But not Asians or Native American. A curious choice given that Arapaho characters make a strong appearance in the game and several of the portraits are clearly Asian in appearance.

Don't start a game with characters using assault rifles or sniper rifles. You will not have enough ammo to complete the starting area. It's a weird balancing issue, and you can get around it with different strategies... but it's just easier to pick other weapons and then let later characters spec into those weapons.

The inventory management is not great but usable and there are a few other minor irritations but that's about everything I've found.

Honestly... I want to like this game. I DO like this game. I just can't recommend this bugged, unpolished version. Maybe in six months, if they fix it up. Maybe.",1598846095,1598846095,False,5,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198071309484,397,14,10592,1108,1637,1601319145,,

13,75201402,english,"I think there are primarily two ways to evaluate this game:
1) as a turn-based strategy game
2) as a story-based RPG

My take on this is almost entirely on the second point.  I play games mostly for the story; I'm not a hard core strategy player.  I play on the ""story mode"" difficulty settings, so if you're looking for any evaluation of the strategy aspect, all I can say is that the combat wasn't boring and at very few points did I feel like things were too hard (which is the way it should be for ""story mode"" settings).

Story and characters:
Non-party NPCs:  The non-party NPCs were not bad -- yes, they were ""not bad"" in video game terms, which means they were slightly flat caricatures.  The most nuanced was probably the Patriarch, who was given some depth.  His sons and daughter were not all that well-developed; they were pretty much what they appeared to be from the outset.  They were given their own voices and I rarely felt like ""this guy acts this way because it's convenient for the plot"" but then, the plot isn't all that complex.
Party NPCs - once they are in your party, they become mostly voiceless.  Yes, they occasionally interject in your dialogues and make statements, but it's not very common.  The biggest disappointment, though, was the ""hindu cows"" void that was the main characters in the party -- when you create a party at first, you can choose from a bunch of premade character combos, and they each have flavor and dynamics.  However, the flavor stops there -- quite literally.  I chose the father / daughter combo, and much to my dismay, they have literally no voice, AND they have no recognition in the other characters as to who they are.  You may as well call them ""melee killer"" and ""sniper"" -- that's all they were.
Story: Cliche, but well-written.  There are a few holes / WTF-you're-missing-the-obvious moments, but I've never played a game without some story problems.  A lot of the story seemed to focus on the unintended (negative) effects of your decisions, and on the idea that no matter what decisions you make, some people are going to hate you, and some people are going to get screwed...maybe *everyone*.  That was well done -- I thought about the values of the choices I was making, about the balance between freedom and safety.

Bugs and User Experience: 
1) There were a few bugs, but mostly very little stuff, like I couldn't load into the Patriarch's mansion ""until I gathered my party"" (they were already all there) until I unselected them all, and reselected all.  Mostly minor annoyances that I could fairly quickly work around.  A few visual issues too, like when one of that character's first cinematics played, the name of the village was superimposed on the screen.  Nothing too severe though.  Gameplay was pretty smooth -- in 40 hours, I got maybe 3 crashes, which is more than most games, but not bad for playing the day it was available, before any patches.
2) Map load times were 30-60 seconds many times.  Any time I needed to load between maps was painful.  It appears the map loading is single-threaded, and CPU-bound (it barely touched my drive).  Not the end of the world, but irritating.
3) The UI itself was fairly intuitive.  There were a few areas where ""hover"" elements of the UI (things that pop up on hover, or pop up on clicking certain things) got in the way.  Some of the ""notifications"" on the character portraits were annoying though, like a notification that a character has a level being the same as unspent skill points, when at many parts of the game, you have to bank skill points, so you just see a bunch of blinking level indicators at the bottom of the screen.  But overall, good UI, I was able to figure out how it all worked with a minimum of fuss.  The one true irritant was the weird way they forced you to drive from place to place and in certain areas, if you wanted to get to a particular spot, you had to go through multiple load screens to get there.  Normally I wouldn't care too much, but the long load times made that painful.

Verdict: Good game despite the somewhat cliche and shallow characters.  Lots of choices for builds and options for leveling.  While the story was a bit cliche, it was also well-executed and you did feel like your choices matter.

28,75199197,english,"Got this game specifically to play in co-op, and feel like the negative reviews complaining about it are overblown.
It took a couple attempts to get into the game together but after that it was smooth sailing and we didn't have any trouble playing it for 12 hours straight besides running into the bug where your quests disappear once but thats easily fixed by just reloading a auto or quick save and the game has timed and auto quick saves if you want to enable them so its not a big deal.

Game plays like xcom and it feels like they're going after the Divinity Original Sin crowd by including co-op which I think is a good move. Its very fun to play, multiple weapon types that you'd normally write off as gimmicky in other games are completely viable like only using flamethrowers.

Game has some polish problems, for example, with small arms theres a perk that lets you shoot for free after reloading a gun that used up all its ammo, but if that reload took all of your AP you don't get the free shot since it auto ends that characters turn even if you try to control them again and that free shot doesn't carry over to your next turn. They've proven before they iron out these sorts of problems, especially with their directors cut version, so its not really a big deal and easily played around after you notice it.

I just hope we get mod tools down the line, it'd be nice to have more perks dedicated to specific weapon types because if you want to use only a specific type of weapon in a weapon category you don't have much options.
Also weapon / armor modding should be either merged into just modding and / or they should get perks to increase preformance of weapons, armor or reusing mods because right now it SUCKS having to spend those all those points leveling up armor AND weapon modding just so other characters in your team can take way more advantage out of it since they're the ones getting combat skills leveled.

30,75198838,english,"Ok so I'll be comparing this to Wasteland 2 a game I love as well.

It's been improved in every way in my opinion. Quite lot a of the irritating features are gone and some things have been streamlined to be less clunky. So let's break it down.

Skills: Unlike 2 you get a flat rate of 3 skill points per level you can add to this slightly by having high intelligence which will give you 1 extra for every 2 points for a total of 5, it still costs more points to upgrade at a higher level but not quite as much as in 2. The skills have been streamlined a bit for instance by combining safecracking and lockpicking into the one category and first aid and doctor are now just the one skill in first aid, although I feel it should really be renamed medicine or medical because you do a lot of doctor things with this skill.  There is no longer a chance to fail when using skills rather you either have the level needed or not which is mixed for me, I suppose it removes save scumming for a good result but at the same time it's weird that someone with 6 lock pick couldn't attempt a level 7 lock.  Regardless overall it feels balanced. There are lot more skill checks in dialogue and environment interaction like using first aid to examine corpses for more information, this is a great improvement for me. Animal whisperer has also been greatly improved and has really practical uses.

Attributes: You now get 1 point for every level up making it easier to build a character you want as well as a bonus for level 10 in any attribute, I find this far less restrictive and it is better balanced because dump skills don't cripple certain character builds. (Like the whole party needing high charisma for better outcomes).

Perks: Far more interesting and varied and no lock on needing previous ones in a chain if you don't want them.

Graphics: Very much improved, don't understand what some people are complaining about, you can now pick an outfit for your character and then choose whether to show it or not in either head, chest or leggings which you can mix and match with the armour you are wearing, you can also customise this at various places in game with no penalty or cost. Compared to 2 it's been hugely improved in every aspect from special effects to detail.

Game play: Still the same combat system with some more quality of life improvements, there are some strange choices occasionally like not pausing the game in the inventory screen or character screen and out of combat it takes a little bit of learning the U.I to control your party. Some people complain about the lack of cover in some environments and that's true it can be unforgiving in some but fine in others, although it helps to think tactically about how to use this if you only have 2 cover slots that you can use then who needs them the most? etc.  You have a much greater depth of available tactics like deploying turrets of various kinds for mechanics or many options for medics which make combat far more enjoyable for me. Overall the translation of the skill system to game play is very well thought out and satisfying with far less the f*ck moments than in 2. Finally the story is good, compared to two I find it contains even more gritty hard moral choices where the colours are less grey and more muddy brown whichever way you look. For instance how to choose between a group scientific or nature religious fanatics who are both scary? **There is no inventory weight limit anymore, huge thank you for removing that irritating feature.

I haven't personally encountered any of the bugs people complain about which is not to say they don't exist but I can't really comment on things I haven't experienced. 

Honestly I am thoroughly enjoying the experience of Wasteland 3, it has been improved on multiple levels and hasn't been overly dumbed down like many sequels for more casual gamers. The story line is good, the characters are good, everything is either good or excellent in comparison to 2. If you liked 2 you should like this if you've never played it and you don't like 3 then hey everyone is different but I think it is a really well produced game that's worth playing.",1598840521,1598840563,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198017188773,428,29,9345,0,1624,1600510179,,

The game is more or less Divinity Original Sin 2 gameplay, combined with Fallout aesthetics and worldbuilding, and almost Borderlands-esque humor (except more mature, as in less poop jokes). 

A few bugs (please note, these may be exclusively multiplayer bugs)
1) Load times when moving to a new area (or reloading the game) can be very loooooong
2) We've had multiple instances (to the point where every time we loaded into a new area we checked) where all the quests in our quest log just... disappeared? And we couldn't progress on any of them anymore? It was weird. Not sure how that would even be possible. 
3) Just had a bug where no sound was playing when we loaded in 
4) Sometimes, the loading screens get stuck. You can tell this has happened when the bar gets stuck at about 1/3 and the little star wheel just keeps spinning forever (if it's loading, the star wheel will start and stop) 


Update: ~10 hours into the game, and we've run into the ""quests are all gone lol"" bug too many times to count. At this point, I'm still enjoying the game but can no longer recommend it until someone from the developer bothers to playtest it. 

This seems like the kind of thing that could have been ironed out in development, but as of now it's aggravating as all get out.

Update 2.0: They have said they're releasing a fix for the ""journal becoming empty"" bug in the coming week. In addition, they've provided a workaround (disabling autosave). As soon as it gets fixed, I'll change this review back to recommended, in spite of the rest of the bugs that I've run into (there have been plenty, but I'm done trying to remember them and add them to the list above.)

In my opinion, any other bugs that I've run into are more than compensated for for the engaging gameplay and excellent writing. ",1598718310,1598837972,False,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,76561198005257311,300,9,3241,0,1481,1600483318,,

I quite like InXile, this is their only product. I have a negative opinion about. Many reviews will state bugs, but lets be honest. Freshly released games, will always have bugs. Put more merit into the gameplay, game design and story. 

Pros: 
1) It's a tactical RPG, they're fun if you like them
2) Improvement on graphics from Wasteland 2
3) Funny pop culture references
4) Uh... you can pee on snow?

Cons
1) Lack luster story
2) Oversimplified UI with a bad barter system
3) Attributes, Skills, Perks are all a bit of the same
4) Combat feels clunky, AI is really awful even on highest setting
5) Trying hard to be the ""Divine Divinity"" of post apocalyptic RPG's

This is nothing like Wasteland 2.
It's a dumbed down version of a good rpg, it's made for people that needs handholding.
You get pushed in one direction at all times.
You gain levels all the time and attributepoints.
you can't even try to use skills that are a bit too low, you need a level for it and it is set, you can't get lucky, or unlucky.
I feel very limited about my options in the game. Railroading.
And the quests says what level they are, I would not be suprised if you can't go to a quest because lack of level.
From what I have seen, changing difficulty is on normal you get more loot and fewer enemies, instead of the enemies been smarter and a bit sturdier. I have not tested this out as much yet, might be wrong, but that was my impression.

At the end of a quest/boss you instantly gets a call from the rangers, I didn't like that. how do they know what I, I learned that it was the end of combat by that not that turns ended and I could make a choice of what to do next.

I would not buy this game with this experience I had, and any game comming from this company I will wait until I can see a few hours of real gameplay.

A short list of bugs would be, text randomly sticking on the screen and not going away without a full restart, money being wiped, quest progression being reset which often breaks the game, buggy dialogue where it'll just sort of freak out sometimes and that's about the weight of what has happened.

These bugs occur OFTEN and this game is NOT WORTH BUYING in its current state.

I'm going to persevere with the game because it's quite fun the actual gameplay is solid and the story is okay, but our patience has been thinning with having to skip quests and such because of these bugs and I'm unsure how far we'll be able to get before the game breaks to an unmanageable point. 

Wait for it to be fixed is all I can say, people have said this happens in singleplayer too so keep that in mind, purchase at your own risk.

The AI runs straight into their enemy until one side is dead. There's no tactics, no interesting combat. Just human waves.

24,75180025,english,"Let me start by saying Wasteland 2 was my favorite game since Dragon Age: Origins.  So I've been waiting for this game patiently.  Two and a half days after release and I've put in 33 hours so far, which for someone who doesn't game as much as he used to, should speak volumes for how much I've enjoyed it so far.   

I'll list the pros and cons as of this time.

Pros:
Voice acting is great.  The characters are very unique, and their pauses and mannerisms really immerse me.  It's one of the few games that I actually listen to their whole dialog instead of reading it while they speak and clicking through it.

Twisted post-apoc events are disturbingly brutal, which really sets the mood for this chaotic world.

The morally grey plot decisions leave me with the decision to run the Rangers how I feel, and I think this increases the replayability as I'm tempted to play it again and roleplay a completely different set of morals.  I also second guess each decision I make, and wonder if I made the right choice.  You have to base your decisions off the gossip of others, and at the early stages of the game, it's impossible to know who is telling the truth.  That is, there's no clear good and evil.  Everyone seems corrupt on some level, leaving you the decision of who to support and who to condemn.

Combat is similar to Wasteland 2, and it is fun and engaging if you enjoy turn based tactical combat.

The different factions and their belief systems are great.  It's hard to elaborate without spoilers.  [spoiler]God-President Ronald Reagan had me in stitches[/spoiler]

The music during key combat sequences is different from other games in the genre, and it really seems to work. 


Cons:
The load times are very long between zones.

There are some bugs I've encountered.  One quest in the warrens seemingly is not able to be complete in my game.  [spoiler]Quarex's Hellacious Journey[/spoiler]

I've seen enemies throw heal darts through walls into other rooms.
Several times I've hit ""No"" to travel to a new zone and it takes me there anyway, forcing me to endure two lengthy load times.
The movement grid for AP is not always true.  I've moved into blue squares, only to be too low on AP to perform an attack.  I've since learned to count the AP and not rely on the color coding.

Inventory sorting could be improved.  Why is there no tab for utility items?  A checkbox for usable items would be nice too, rather than seeing all my armor and weapons for each character.  
Compare item only compares to the main weapon, and not the secondary, which just makes me swap weapons to compare each one.

The perks are interesting, the skill system works well, the quirks really make you consider your choices, and they still have all the badass weapons and armor as usual.

The combat is amazing and brutal. It seems to me like you always a few ways of going about your attack every turn. I was never locked into one approach and I can see a lot of effort went into the battle layouts (where the enemies, cover, and destructibles are placed).

Some things I wish I knew prior to starting a new game

1.  You can create two more custom rangers after the tutorial.  Don't bother trying to make the first two compliment each other entirely, you can make two more with whatever skills you want later.

2. Junk is just junk but all of it is worth something, loot it all, sell it all, profit.  Leave nothing in any containers because there is no inventory limit.

3. You can change your characters outfits soon after finishing the tutorial and setting up a base, new clothing styles can be bought from stores.  If you find armor that looks ridiculous but the stats are too good to pass up, you can toggle each armor items visibility in the inventory screen.

4. You can dismiss animal followers by selecting them and talking to them, they will stay where you dismiss them.  I click on everything and have three animal whisperer characters.  After clicking some chickens I had an accidental clucking army following for like an hour and had no idea how to get rid of them aside from sacrificing them on land mines.

5.  First aid is pretty darn important, have at least one ranger with fierce skill in this.  I equipped a sniper with this skill and it has been working out well.  I have two bruiser melee characters that seem to attract all the aggro so the medic hardly ever even gets shot at.

6.  Toaster repair is more novelty than it was in wasteland 2 where every toaster in the game had something special in it.  I made one character that has one job and his job is as useless as it sounds.  I have yet to find anything truly worthwhile in a toaster, time will tell I suppose.",1598805069,1598805069,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198052253220,105,6,1802,0,614,1599145920,,

Overview:

When was the last time a game moved you to make personal emotional decisions that affected not only your group but the perception of you and your group among various factions? You don't need to play this game long to start seeing these questions pop up. Your decisions in Wasteland 3 MATTER, that dude in a cutscene who is totally about to get murdered but you have a chance to change the outcome.. that matters, whether you or another group kills them, that matters, how long the character lives or if they die early, that matters. You know that drunk you see bumbling around in a dumpster who no one would miss if you murdered them and took their loot, killing them matters.

Gameplay:

Gameplay in Wasteland 3 boils down to 3 main points Turn based strategy, Decision Making, and Recruiting members to your squad.

Every decision you make in Wasteland 3 no matter how insignificant you may find it will matter at some point in the game and this goes further than just good decision, neutral decision, bad decision. Due to how many potential outcomes there are, each playthrough will be different (unless you decide to make the same choices) Among the five other people I know who played this game the same time I did, we all made different decisions in the beginning stages of the game and already have vastly different gameplay options available to us.

Your squad will be composed of characters you recruit or find in your travels. Recruited members can be chosen from a list of pre-made characters or you can create your own. Character creation is robust you can choose the characters background which applies different traits to them, apply attributes to various stat blocks to affect how they act in and out of combat, apply skill points to further specialize what type of character they will be in your squad, and also chose to give them a quirk which are trade-offs. For example one quirk is called ""Sadomasochist"" this quirk allows your character to deal more damage but they also receive more damage, among the quirks are other interesting choices such as ""When a party member dies, gain more actions on your turn for the next 2 turns +damage bonus, Once the two turns are over reduce your actions for the following 4 turns"". The skill system is extremely vast and will allow you to build a team of very different individuals who's varying skills will allow you access to extra content throughout the game, thus building a well-rounded team of members who specialize in different avenues is extremely rewarding.

Combat:

Combat in Wasteland 3 is turn-based and feels very much like XCOM without prema-death. There's a cover system, a watchdog action, defense, and hold action. Watchdog allows your character to fire at someone if they cross your line-of-sight, defense gives you additional defense stats equal to how many actions you didn't take, and hold action will allow you to carry over additional actions on your next turn. Melee is hilarious and awesome definitely recruit a melee character when you gain access to do so.

Voice Acting:

I want to say the game is about 95% voice acted, there are some scenes where it isn't and you will have to read but I've run into that perhaps twice during the 10 hours I played the game. Also the voice actors are really good, I'm unable to tell how many different VA's they used because every character just sounds that much different.

This game is 100% worth the $60 price tag, it really does have the feel of the original fallout series (CRPG) to it.

Seemingly every mission/quest has multiple solutions, from stealth, diplomacy, hacking, straight up shooting, etc., something that was completely taken away from most other mainstream RPG's. Dialogue is creative and funny (though some of the humor is a little try-hard). 

The only real con I have of this game are the absurd loading times. I have 20 hours in this game mostly because I get up every loading screen to go do something else and forget the game is running. They're seriously like over a minute long and I one point I had to go through 4 loading screens in quick succession to get from HQ to a town, to a park, to a secret area, and it shouldn't take that long for a game that isn't exactly breaking boundaries with visual quality. Also: why the F do hats make you bald. Come on.

BUT, I can't stress how much I love this game and series. I love building a team where each member has their unique strength - one science, one explosives, one stealthy, one mechanic, etc., and seeing all the doors that opens for every mission! Choice actually feels rewarding and matters. Choosing what seems like the ""good guy"" choice could have unforeseen negative consequences later.

I have gotten through the first area after the Dam, and have not had any bugs or issues with the story.  This was definitely designed with the console in mind, and I wish the UI was a little better with keyboard and mouse, but it is not anything that is horrible.  The jokes all seem to be low brow, so far, but it might just be that I am getting older and I don't have the same appreciation for them as I once did.  

However, I will say that they have really ramped up the hate that they have against certain groups.  And the developers seem to have a message that sometimes is in your face, and other times a little lighter hand is used.  If you can ignore the political satire and play this as a game, then you will enjoy it.  But if you cannot take the political commentary, and can't really just play it as a game without relating to the world today, then this is not a game for you.  

While I was not amused by the political commentary, especially the fact that in this world southern accents are pervasive in Colorado.  The fact is this is a game and they can use any caricatures that they want. They can also make any ""real"" world person, idea, or thought and bend it to any message that they want.  But again, hopefully you can take it in the tongue in cheek expression that they were hopefully attempting.  

In the end, you need to make a determination if those messages can be ignored by you, or if it evens matter to you.  There is a great game here, and while I hate real world prejudices being bashed over my head, I will keep playing the game.

I'd love to recommend this game. From what I've played, it's fun, decently written, and offers a good co-op CRPG experience. However, I absolutely cannot recommend it with the egregious game-breaking bugs it currently has.

These aren't fringe issues that occur once in a blue moon - I could look past that - they are bugs that completely remove game progress, lose all of your money, reset or break sequences (e.g.: we returned to HQ only to have the first scenes play out again, except one NPC who had joined us already and thus we couldn't talk to him again, preventing quest completion). We experienced all of those multiple times within just the first 10 hours. It is straight-up not playable in it's current state.

Smaller bugs that cause knock-on issues as well, such as skills and perks applying to other characters but not to the ones that actually have it. Gear vanishing. NPCs resetting. Levelling attributes costing more points than it should because of equipped items.

It is less buggy in solo mode, but I haven't tried enough of it to give an informed opinion. Your mileage may vary.

There's a great game in there, somewhere, but as it stands it needs a lot of fixes before it's playable. It's so disappointing.

But the gameplay itself? Not so much. The devs should've taken a page from other turn-based tactical games like Divinity and Mutant Year Zero. Those games had consistency in terms of design, this one lacks in that department. 

Usability is also a nightmare. A lot of small annoyances stack up against this game. 
 - Too many loading screens
 - Loading times are too long, it takes you out of the game. 
 - The inventory system needs work, especially when trading. Certain items don't have a filter, leaving you to comb through your entire inventory. 
 - Combat doesn't allow a disengage or leave action, forcing you to fight an enemy three rooms north when your objective is just a few paces south. 
 - The game needs to be optimized, battles with multiple fire and energy effects will bring your GPU to its knees. 
 - Enemy scaling is all over the place even for quests that your level requirements. 
 - World map travel is interesting at times, but mostly tedious. 

So, why is it a positive?

53,75116976,english,"Unfortunately, can't recommend this. Especially at its price tag. It's buggy mess that feels like an poor console port in early access masquerading as a full release. Really, the best bit is the settings and voice acting. The game has some poor design choices, such as feeding you endless supplies, a lack of perma death (you are given a pool of recruits to choose from, seemingly endlessly, but no one dies ), combat that is only kinda tactical, a couple skill points In a specific skill tree can allow you to become simply overpowered. The list goes on, I'll edit the review later when not on mobile. I hope you get the point. 

Simply moving your characters around the map feels like a chore, due to the clunky unresponsive camera. AI pathfinding is a step back from DoS2, with characters constantly getting stuck or walking over traps they know are there. 

The kicker to all this is that co-op saves will overwrite your single player saves. I do not know if this also applies to named saves (implying that there is a very low number of save slots). This is a cool idea, the easy sharing of a co-op saves, but like many systems in wasteland 3, is poorly implemented. Perhaps that is the best way to describe wasteland 3. Good ideas, poorly implemented. 

In summary: buggy, poor design, and bad QoL. Overall poorly implemented game mechanics In a well done setting. Save your money. 

I am not confident that a couple patches will fix the issues present at launch, but we will see of course. At this time something like DoS2 of ATOM RPG are far more deserving of your cash, with consideration given to their own faults. ATOM RPG is thematically similar and clearly inspired by the previous iterations of the wasteland series.

Edit: As my refund request did not go through, decided to give it another go with a buddy. We got the bizarre area & came back to the Base you are given, only to find that our quest log is totally reset & we are back to sq1 quest wise.

1. sound bug : Certain dialog will cut out during some interactions and not others making it really inconsistant as to what you dare do while any audio of importance is running. And that is quite often. I dislike fearing to lose out on story because something happened that cut the audio off instantly with no way to return to it afterwards. 

2. some missions have a few logic hiccups in terms of what has been done so far and what has not. There is a prison interaction where someone would only talk if i freed him, but i refused to. I walk around a bit and find the key to his cell. I talked to him again to see if i got more options. But then he starts talking like he is already free even though i did not yet use the key to free him. Even worse is that i did not free him but the game though i did so i just had to roll with that decision being made for me.

++PROS++
  +  Voice acting is mostly decent, but nothing grand
  +  Has enough moving components to distract you from some of the big issues
  +  Can customize almost your entire team, which for me is always a plus

--CONS--
  -  A lot of re-used voices
  -  You can even unknowingly lock yourself out of completing critical quests
  -  Bugs, bugs, bugs
  -  Load times, even into smallish areas, are long
  -  No keyboard/controller rebinding options
  -  Lack of attention to detail - almost all interactions show, ""Talk,"" as an option despite the fact you're interacting with things like billboards, fences, computer terminals, etc. 

Another thing, I'm not sure if this game includes a re-spec feature, but a lot of games allow this because until you've played a bit, you have no idea how progression, skill usage, and skill synergy works in the game.  I've found that I would have assigned my starting skills completely different had I known how things would progress.  This also brings up another thing - possibly a bug - I tried to preview the quirks and found that once I clicked on one, I could no longer select the, ""No quirk,"" option during character customization/creation.

I'd really like to change this review to a thumb's up at some point, but the fact that they pushed this out live without fixing some of the most glaring issues, which still remain unfixed as of now, has me worried.  I'm playing singleplayer, so haven't had the other issues people have reported in MP, but I still can't recommend this based on the total lack of attention to detail displayed.

88,75138039,english,"That's it I just raged quit the game after having to stare at the millionth loading screen. I was really looking forward to this game and I am deeply disappointed. 

The first part is not really engaging, you're really just going through the motions, and the game does not let you forget that you are just playing a video game. 

This is due in great part to the incessant loading. It's also due to the absence of support for any keyboard layout other than qwerty. If you're not blessed with having a qwerty keyboard, you'll have to constantly move your hand around the keyboard. This means that I have to look at my keyboard every other minute, because I cannot instinctively find 'z' when my hand was on the other side of the keyboard because I have to use the arrow keys to move the map around instead of zqsd like a human being. Seriously, this is not hard to do, just enable the player to remap the keys.
There also are a few irritating bugs here and there, like the one that has been mentioned on the quirks menu. If you select a quirk in the list because you misclicked, well that's it, you can't select the option not to have one anymore. And they force you to enter the menu ! Seriously, when I am in that menu I feel like I am defusing a bomb, moving the mouse with the lightest touch to make sure it does not misfire so I can hit the back button safely.
And please, for the love of god sort out the map, this thing is a nightmare. Icons for merchants appear and disappear as you get far from them. Why ? Also, when you're lost you're in for the hover mini game, where you have to hover your mouse over the question mark icons in order to know what they are. And better yet, you also have to hover your mouse over the exit markers that are scattered on the map to know what those are too. Once you've found the place where you want to go, you can mark it. Then a tooltip will appear randomly in the main view to show you the direction. So what you do is move the map frantically in all directions for the tooltip to appear and then be able to follow it.
Combat is buggy too, with some enemies being able to throw grenades through walls.
Lastly, balance. If you decide to buy the game and create a character, well, one piece of advice : pick the lockpicking skill, and keep adding points until it's maxed out. The thing is I very often play that type of rogue character, and I decided to try something different. So I didn't pick lockpick. About 5 minutes into the game I realized my mistake when I ran into the first armor crate. This has only been confirmed later when I realised that essentially every single area had a safe that could be picked, but that always required a very high lockpicking skill.

Anyway, I know I am ranting a bit, but seriously, hold off on buying the game. It may not be bad in itself, but it really needs polish. Hold off doubly if you don't have a qwerty keyboard.",1598747950,1598747950,False,4,3,0.480819255113601685,2,True,False,False,76561197997908749,143,1,568,0,559,1598750012,,

The battlegrounds are poorly designed with little to no space for all 4 let alone 6 characters, which makes it easy for AI to just throw grenades, or other AoE. Some places you straight up start out being flanked by a turret and turret have almost the same range as a sniper rifle. You either try to shoot first to get the first turn and put some initial damage in, or you risk losing a character. Who design all these encounters? Majority of encounters only have one entrance, and the entrance is so small what's the idea here? AI get all the spaces to set up, but you have to waste your first turn just to get in position. With XCOM even when you spot an enemy, they can't immediately exhaust their bullets right on their first turn and only get to set up. What's the idea here to have enemy team have the first round free to trash at least 1 of your characters? Can't balance it in other ways? What about sneaking? No you can't.

Effect statuses last 4 or 5 turns both in and out of combat, and what more, you have to use items or go back to HQ to heal or your characters get injured which reduces their stats. 

0 dialogue between the preset characters so far. So I guess the story doesn't bind to certain set of characters. Maybe the game is not about experiencing a story with a small set of characters, and more about making the sacrifice.

I love how they improved upon the old perk and skills system. A lot of great weapons and good balance too. I like how there's no limit to how much you can carry. My only gripe is that the inventory gets very jumbled. Perhaps there can be an update where you can get the strongest weapons listed in front of the weaker weapons in order.

There is no clear explanation of how to modify weapons and armor. There is no way to reset your skills. Other games think in their costumer's TIME and make available a device in the home base to reconfigure your characters. It is stupid to play for 10 hours and realize that the character configuration should be different. 

The character's appearance is a mess. Why placing a booth to customize the character's looks if the armor is going to over-take that (the entire team ends up looking like deep divers or ninjas with sky masks). 

To make it worse, the saving mechanism is horrible and you end up many steps away from your mistake. So you have to repeat many things you already did before that fatal encounter that ended you.

The game feels like a healthy follow-up to where Wasteland 2 left off. The Arizona Rangers have to deal with the fallout from the events of the second game, and starving for resources, respond desperately to a call from The Patriarch, the ruler of Colorado, who promises to send supplies to aid Arizona.

The first bits of gameplay involve fairly safe battles that acclimate the player to the controls and HUD, albeit a little weakly. Tutorials pop up now and then to explain mechanics as an added bonus. But I wish it had explained earlier on that you will be able to have a party of 6 eventually rather than just a duo, because I tried to make my first two characters jacks-of-all-trades, which later hurt my stat distribution.

The writing in the first 3 hours feels similar to W2, in that there are gory and dark moments paralleling silly dialogue and situations. There's a cat with a cowboy hat. The bad guys are zany and wild murder machines. And of course, toasters are in need of repair.

So far, I've encountered no bugs but be aware that they do exist. However the devs did a great job of ironing out the major ones in W2 so expect updates in the first few weeks.

While WL2 got me with its story here stuff seems more generic and the quests are rather basic, the skills have been redone and instead of trying with a lower skill based on chance to jam a safe/explode a trap in your face, they have opted in for the lazy Fallout 4/76 way of checks which annoyed me to hell.

Though... from watching the preview videos, I actually thought going in this was going to be a nerfed RPG compared to earlier versions, tailored for more casual *coughs* console gamers.  ...Boy was I wrong.

This is a proper RPG, and on higher difficulty, requires A LOT of careful strategy.  So far I'm 6 hours in and I've maybe restarted a half-dozen times after the first half-hour of gameplay.  Why?  Some might call it a mild case of OCD, but I'm learning right away that early choices - down to the smallest skill point, matter.  And I like to start RPGs as optimal/custom as possible....  So missing dialogue options right off the bat can cause me to rethink decisions I made in character creation.  I love it!

On a scale of feels, I give this game 4 out of 5.  If you like X-Com, earlier Wasteland, and Fallout series, or strategy/rpg games in general, this one is well worth the buy at full price.",1598714141,1598714141,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197970908161,92,2,4672,613,367,1602083179,,
80,75114875,english,"16 hours on record, only playing co-op for the moment and here is my take:

As someone who did not play the previous games, I decided to pick this up with a friend as it looked quite fun, and at its core it is a fun game.  Combat is interesting and feels rewarding when things line up.  There is some element of strategy to make the encounters more manageable.  I'm know diehard fans of the previous games have said that the combat is dumbed down, maybe it is, but I am finding it enjoyable and engaging, and that is what counts.  The story is fairly interesting albeit somewhat predictable in some cases.  All in all as a game, pretty fun and generally would have recommended.

Now for the blatant reasons I do not recommend this game:

At $60 and presumably more than one beta tester, this game is shockingly flawed.  From graphical errors causing speech bubbles to get stuck in the center of my screen making it damn near impossible to see enemy hit chances, to dialogue issues where if one person begins conversation without the other right next to them it can softlock the game requiring a reload.  There is another issue (at least for our game) that as the second player (not the host of the multiplayer game) I cannot use the Ambush final action, it does absolutely nothing even though my friend can use it with no issues.  Quest givers not being able to be interacted with when attempting to turn in the quest requiring a reload of the game.  Audio stopping midway through npc speeches.  Characters loading in with completely messed up polygons and just the guns floating mid air.  Black screens when loading into zones for just one of us, requiring a reload of the save.  Loading screen for me as the second player only ever saying the very first loading screen line about a convoy of rangers being dispatched instead of flavor text related to the zone.  The loading screen soft locking at 30% requiring a trusty alt-f4 to get out of.  Basically in order to play the game at all right now, before doing essentially anything (ie getting into combat, talking to a main quest giver, loading into a new zone, making changes to our characters) we have to manually save because there is a good chance the game will soft lock requiring a reload.  And other users report save corruption so I have had to create a file copy copy to backup the game files every hour so that I could in theory recover the save file should they corrupt.  These are just the bugs we have experienced, not even addressing the performance issues (Ryzen 7 2700x, RTX 2070s, 32gb 3000mHz DDR4 memory, WD NVME SSD, getting 48fps in combat with settings on medium...) or the fact that loading takes an ungodly amount of time even though both of us are playing off nvme ssd's (presumably networking related then, but neither of us have issues there).  Also the fact that direct connect seems to not work at all, we have to make a game in the lobby that is private then invite one another to make the game connect (this is definitely network related, but neither of us can make the direct connect work despite forwarding UDP7777 to our machines).  The list really does just go on...

All in all this game has the potential to be a solid game, but it came out in what I would describe generously as beta and we are doing live beta testing.  I can't imagine a world where these issues didn't come up in beta testing, and if that is the case then your beta pool was far far far too small, and your testers were woefully ill prepared to test even the basic functions of the game.  If the devs can get the blatant bugs addressed quickly then I would see no reason to not review the game positively and recommend it, but if any of the above bugs continue to plague the game a week after launch, then save your money and play something else.",1598713622,1598713622,False,10,0,0.538636505603790283,0,True,False,False,76561198027685452,229,1,1066,0,996,1598752645,,

56,75090374,english,"I do recommend Wasteland 3. It's a stellar game. But it does lack a few quality of life features, and has a very slight lack of polish, as well as 2 bugs (so far), one of which, while minor, is extremely and frequently annoying, and another that can break your game and force you to load to a previous save. The game DID just come out, however, and I wouldn't be surprised if many (or all) of my complaints are rectified soon.

The good:
-The combat, while a little jittery (animations need a tad more polish), feels great and has that ""oomph"" when you shoot someone or hit them that makes it feel really satisfying, it's just difficult enough to feel rewarding when you win, but not so difficult as to feel unfair (at least on Ranger difficulty, I'm sure Supreme Jerk is probably quite unfair, since it specifically claims to be).
- The characters and dialogue all feel interesting enough and the storyline is fairly engaging, though as of about  hours in, nothing special, but that by no means makes it bad, just fairly standard.
-For a more classic RPG experience, it's also quite the loot-fest, and while this might actually be a con to some, it's a very large pro to me.
-On that note, there's a lot of different weapons, skills, abilities and mods to play with that let you really specialize your characters and it feels just deep enough to really get into the crunch without feeling too daunting.

The ""meh"":
-Lack of some quality of life features such as:
 1) you can't compare new weapons to your secondary weapon, and have to swap them to your main hand.
 2) if you save the game while crouched, and then reload the game you will no longer be crouched. Very minor, just slightly annoying.
 3) inability to respec your original characters. Some skills turned out to be significantly less useful than I imagined they might be, and I'd have really liked to put those 2-3 skill points into more useful ones. Again, fairly minor, you can make  a fairly well rounded party by creating up to 2 completely custom characters whenever you want to round out any gaps.
 4) there's more but they all kind of follow this same direction, little things that could have felt better and when you put them all together they make the game feel somewhat cumbersome to play,
- Load times are a little long, the game is on my SSD and even just clicking the ""sell all junk"" button in a vendor menu leads to a loading ""bar"" that takes a good few seconds before actually selling my junk.
- Some abilities and skills feel significantly less useful than others. The social skills in particular feel like they don't have enough uses in the game to feel worth the investment when so many of the exploration and combat skills are used near constantly and many encounters that can be solved via diplomacy have alternate solutions besides combat that can be achieved with more useful skill. However, I should say that none of the skills feel USELESS, some are just clearly better than others on average.
- Brawling is almost completely useless at low levels on high difficulties, and stupidly strong when maxed out. 

The Bad:
-Medical Marvel. Whatever you do, do NOT take this quirk, it is bugged and will break your game. If a character with this ability goes down, even outside of combat, they cannot be revived and you cannot leave the map until they are, which means you are effectively soft locked and forced to load your last save where they were not downed.
-Utility items (accessories) do not currently have a filter, so the only way to find them in your inventory is if you have the ""all items"" filter selected, and without the ability to auto-sort your inventory this means that if you have a TON of items (which you will) it is an unbelievable pain in the ass to find the utility items.

The good:
The game is actually hilarious, the dialogue is great, voice acting is great, combat is fun, lots of customization, graphics are decent, so many quests and your choice how to approach everything. 

The bad:
The bugs, there are so many bugs, I don't understand how this was allowed to be released. I started this game in co-op with a friend of mine, from the beginning when you customize your first character, you are unable to select certain quirks at random, sometimes it lets you select them, sometimes it doesn't, restarting the game fixes this. There is NO tutorial if you do co-op. The only reason I found out there was a tutorial is because of a game breaking bug which I will talk about in a second. Every time you have to load a new area, whether you go back to the same area or not, you get the load screen, and for us there is a 50/50 chance the load bar gets stuck at 1/3rd making you force quit the game, start it in singleplayer, load the area, quit out, host a multiplayer game and then go into it. It doesn't matter if you are going to the world map, going into someone's shop, or back again, there is a 50/50 chance for us to have to do this. So disappointing! Audio dialogue for the person who isn't hosting abruptly stops after a character says 4 or 5 words with no explanation. Other numerous bugs, just check the reddit dedicated to this game.

Overall, this game will be great once these bugs get ironed out. But right now, I can't recommend this game. I am hopeful to be able to change my review very soon.",1598667178,1598667178,False,2,0,0.501510560512542725,0,True,False,False,76561197967055761,236,13,2143,0,303,1600838009,,

There are a few issues (quality of life) that I hope get settled out in patching, for example mods need to be able to be removed (scraping a weapon or piece of armor should have a chance based on mod skill for each mod applied to return to the inventory)....top down scroll out needs to be adjusted just a bit to allow for a larger view of the battlefield (minor gripe but just a bit more would be a huge tactical help, not being able to see stats on hit percentage because its out of view range is a pita especially for snipers), useful junk items need to be noted in white not grey, and equipable utility items need their own tab in the UI.

Performance issues are still a problem on high end machines but again hopefully this will get worked out in patching (my personal gripe is left shift lag/stutter).

This game is so far superior to it in every way. I love that they re-did the skills system to make it less cluttered and more intuitive. I see that some complain that it has been ""watered down"", but I disagree as there are still plenty of options to customize your characters as you see fit. Between skills, attributes, perks, armor/weapon mods, utilities, etc., there are so many options to specialize each member of your party. The combat is vastly improved and flows way better than the previous entry which really felt cumbersome and boring at times.

I am not far into the game yet as I am still pretty much in the opening act and setting up my base and collecting various roles, but I am loving what I'm seeing so far. The graphics, voice acting, presentation are all great. I am having a blast during combat and the story is intriguing.

Ok so 1 hr. in.

I was kinda hoping for the game to have a more serious/ dark note, more realistic.
But it seems more like some Mad Max flashy - almost cartoony.
Char creation and all are similar to WL2, they seem fine.
Ambient isn't all that immersive, but thats just me.
Controls and and camera are off . Like they are just a bit too unresponsive. Camera panning feels like it's going trough mud ( it's not unbearable). 
I'd assume all this is because of console compatibility, not unfixable for sure.

-----------------------
Alright. 4hrs. in.
Game just crashed. Was in a trading window. Pressed shift to compare weapons. Guess the game needs a few patches here and there.
Also there is quite a bit of lag when i press the button to highlight interactable objects.

And im rly not sure about this whole ""Almost everyone has an edgy personality"" thing, that they went with. ( It's like a scenario where only psychopaths, sociopaths and trigger-happy 'merican rednecks have survived the doomsday. Everyone else is just a poor ol' victim of the apocalypse.).

And ofcourse these people loving Rangers,which are supposed to be some elite fighters, that had their whole ""last chance to survive"" expedition wiped out in prologue.

And now it's ALL on you.

-----------------

Gameplay wise it feels like it's a tad bit simpler than WL2. Though it does add something too, like the special attacks that recharge.
From what i've seen you get to upgrade your vehicle and add (epic) weapon mods,armor and whatnot to it.
Also you get to have your own HQ that starts pretty much ruined, you build it up, add staff to it  (Which are just people that you meet in the wasteland that join you, but ofc not as party members. Not sure what their exact use is just yet.) which i find pretty appealing.

Jesus CHRIST the amount of hand holding in this game.
So you'll end up in this night club. You talk to the ""guard"" that is guarding this computer that controls ventilation and heating. The thing is the guy literally tells you how to screw everything up. He tells you 1* Start a fight to distract him 2*Hack computer to turn ventilation off and heat to max 3* Everything burns down. 
The poblem ? It's his job to guard the place. He has no motive to tell you any of this + it's actually really bad for him to tell you that. But the game just spills it out for you just like that (Mind you this is not some tutorial area anymore.).

- dark humor
- interesting customization.
- recruitment management (switch party based on what you need)
- voice acting
- lots of decisions.
- rotating camera on Q&E 

CONS
it has a lot of the classic annoyances from 2. lots of little things that are frustrating and clunky.
 
- the menu/ui SFX are way too loud, and despite multiple sliders in options, the audio for menu beeps are tied to the background ambiance. 
- there is no way to pause to give multiple move locations at once to set up an ambush before initiative. the old aggro radius feels dated. giving one command at a time feels old gen and frustrating. 
- I believe there is no way to ""flee"" once initiative starts. No combat options for arresting/disarming combatants in initiative. no surrendering.     
- confusing static text UI. it took me a long time to realize I had more text options on the scroll.
- can't rename/nickname recruits or leave background notes about them, so changing party requires too much thought trying to remember who I built for what purpose. 
- cannot use map to set a party move marker. too much apm just to simply backtrack thru town 
- can't set formations in a way that feels tactical. you can select a lead party member in V formation, but having formation options and slower walking speed options would be nice while dungeon crawling or looking for traps.
- no group ambush or group defense options in initiative. too much micromanagement. 
- clunky camera. rotates slow, difficult to see during combat indoors.  
- character creation (like so many games) happens in the dark of night, in low light.  you can change colors later (except for skin tone), so now i have an albino black PC that I thought was a deep redbone brown tone.

26,75068631,english,"10+  hours of gameplay so far on PC.

I'm enjoying it but don't feel for me that it is as good as gaming review sites have indicated. It's good but not great and I don't know if I'll end up finishing it. The writing is a little too cutesy/juvenile (in a way that tries too hard to be clever) and I'm surprised by how many sites are praising that given that it's woefully inferior to say Disco Elysium, the graphics are uneven (the landscape and vehicles look great when you're exploring in the kodiak but the characters look bland, and half the time you can't see their faces). The gameplay seems very much like WL2, which isn't a bad thing but so far it doesn't show much innovation - it's less fussy and that's nice. If I had to rate it with a number, it's a 7/10, maybe an 8/10 if the gameplay possibilities deep the longer you play. If it doesn't, then 80 hours is way too long. And there's nothing pioneering about the game at this point.

It's basically WL2 with some streamlining/optimization, better voice acting, and somewhat improved graphics.

Overall, can't recommend it at full price. Unless you loved WL2, wait for the price to drop. I do recommend buying it when it's $40 or less.

It reminds me a bit of Obsidian's lackluster Outer Worlds, as far as a nostalgia approach to games sounding good in theory but the reality is a game that ends up feeling a little stale and basic compared to current games like it, but with a full AAA price tag that doesn't feel worth it.

28,75075929,english,"I can see that this game was created with passion and good intent in mind; however, this doesn't detract from the fact the game is very buggy, broken and unpolished in areas. 

I purchased this game with a friend, only to encounter these issues over time, in order of appearance:

Dialogue boxes breaking and getting frozen.
Inventory items breaking and not appearing or being usable for both players.
Extremely long load times that would break upon tabbing out of the game.
Dialogue actually breaking completely to the point of being unable to hear it.
Inability to move and select characters.
In-game performance breaking down over time.
All money disappearing.
In-game settings getting completely reset.
All quests and journal entries being deleted, leaving progress impossible.
My character actually got deleted completely, with previous saves then being corrupted, leaving me unable to play the game as my main character.
Items in inventory being doubled; trying to drop or sell these items crashed the game.
Upon loading into the game again, the main menu was then merged with an in-game shop interface with a continual loading screen saying an item is being sold, meaning the main menu buttons couldn't be used at all to actually play the game anymore.

Do not play this game co-op until it's patched. We've requested refunds but we're not hopeful because we spent so long trying to diagnose whether we were just going crazy or our game was actually breaking over time.

Besides the buggy nature of the game, the HUD and user interface could do with a lot of work; it's claustrophobic and doesn't offer enough information, whilst also just being a bit of an eyesore. The combat, at times, leaves a lot to be desired when compared to something like Divinity: Original Sin 2, leaving the experience feeling a bit anaemic. The writing and plot are quite underdeveloped and lacks much bite, but if you don't care much for that it won't be a problem. The level design is pretty awkward, with lots of the geometry blocking the camera in a really obnoxious way that makes navigating the world difficult and a chore.

This game is similar to Xcom in combat, you take cover and firing/hitting is based on accuracy % chance.
Now when it comes to divinity you have dedicated characters that won't ever really be permanently replaced.
You'll want to dedicate specific characters to 2-3 skills each if you want to min-max you can have up to 4.
Finally, in the case of UnderRail this game has a similar aesthetic and look, and similar in the way you're able to mod armour and weapons as you please to give you a boost.

A natural evolution of the innovations in gameplay that series like XCOM excelled at, combined old school RPG elements that allowed you to create a character that is strong in some areas, but weak in others. You know, like a real person?

- The combat is based on a turn-based grid formation, like XCOM, but when outside of combat you can more or less freely move around the world space similar to games like Kingdom Hearts or the mid-era Final Fantasy games (7 - 14).

- The character creation is awesome, not as full as I would have hoped, but you can still make your character look badass. Give your character facial paints, change their skin color to green, give them blue hair, then hide it all under some badass helmet or mask. I would have like to have scars as a separate facial option, but what is there is still super cool.

- REAL RPG elements exist in the game, allowing you to better create unique characters that most likely won't be able to do everything on their own, and will rely on their teammates. Also you can give them different default backstories that translate into specific bonuses.

I would like to see the character customization menu fleshed out a bit, but even if it doesn't this game is still a pretty solid 9/10 for me on gameplay. I redid the first mission a few times to get a better feel for the mechanics, but so far the story is really interesting.

- Most animations are nothing to write home about

31,75038989,english,"Tldr: basically XCOM with worse gameplay but a better story.

It's a top down turn based strategy game with exploration and decision making thrown in. Best thought of as an RPG with class and gear specializations for a squad that you control. It's pretty fun, but the combat feels a bit clunky. The graphics are not great, but the setting of a post apocalypse Colorado is pretty interesting and distracts you from that. A lot of the menus are not optimized for whatever reason as it seems like the devs worked primarily on a console version of the game and didn't consider optimizing UX for the PC, it's not a deal breakers but it's certainly visible and irritating at times. My biggest issue with the game however is camera angle. It's a bit too high to be considered 3rd person, and too low to be a true top down game; it falls in this awkward spot where you can neither fully see the characters nor the scenery which is quite strange and unlike any other game I've played. Overall it's not a bad game in the slightest, though at the current level of optimization for PC in both the graphics and UX contexts, it is not worth $60. $30 would be a reasonable price to purchase this at, though if you have an extra $30 to blow it can be worth it if RPG squad management is your thing. Overall, solid game, but you'll probably forget all about it a month after you're done with it. Still fun, just not polished enough to give a true 2 thumbs up to.
