For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10.

2017-06-20,85,2139,612,False,Recommended,Disclaimer I survivor main. I play games for fun not for competition so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops) and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with) then no biggie. Next game please I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one) I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up there is always the next game )That being said this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it have fun with it and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!) and even then recognize that there are jerks who play this game like any other game and have fun while you compete!,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-12,4,55,2694,False,Recommended,"ENGLISH After playing for more than two years I am given the task of reviewing this game again.This review will be as complete as possible so if you do not want to see the full review I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as Pallets Windows 360's Moonwalks Hide Different powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.Rating Balance 6/10 Mechanical system 9/10 Innovation 8/10 Gameplay 8/10Graphics It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect. Animation 6/10 Optimization 5/10 Graphics 6/10 Matchmaking In this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but it's still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1. Servers 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusion This game has great potential for anyone who likes the ""Slasher"" or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors. That potential is covered up by big bugs.

2018-09-21,2,54,400,False,Recommended,Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside I enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing and so I will recommend.,Dead by Daylight

2018-12-04,11,106,900,False,Recommended,"This is simultaneously the most fun and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.For an asymmetrical game it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains for instance must hate themselves to play that and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.New content is regular 1 killer 1 survivor 3 perks for each side and a map are released every 3 months or so mid chapter balance patches occur and cosmetics are regularly added.There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage he sits in boring weak and generally unfun.Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you unless they are picked on the ""random"" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this despite in game currency being used for cosmetics anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.Awesome and incredibly angry community as you'd expect from a game like this.",Dead by Daylight

Where killing requires significantly more concentration survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles and the killers have completely different ""powers"" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. It's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.",Dead by Daylight

There are alot of different languages available. You are able to play the game with a controller There is a mouse and controller sensitivity slidebar available. 0% 100% For Killer and survivor (both seperated). You are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller. There is a manual Tutorial/help/tips available.About the game.You can choose between a Survivor or a killer. You are able to have 4 survivors in a match and 1 killer. Each side has an objective. The killer has to kill all 4 survivors in order to win while the survivors has to escape from the map. Survivors are using third person camera and killers are using a first person camera. Each survivor or a killer has their own level and perk system. So if you have unlocked an offering the offering can only be used in a match if you play that certain character.Survivors are able to use items and increase the effect of the item by adding add ons while the killer has a default power ability which can be improved by adding add ons. Offerings could be used to change the match or by gaining more points. The game is Trial and error and WILL BE DIFFICULT IN THE BEGINNING.While the game is pretty dark by itself you are able to increase the brightness by darkening your own room or increase the brightness on your computer monitor. This may have a little impact or no impact at all but if you are close to a window or the sun has the potential to shine into your room. You could be put in a disadvantage as you will have a hard time looking at the screen or able to see things properly. Killer needs to kill the 4 survivors in order to win. There are alot of different killers each with their own unique gameplay and perks. Some killers are able to go invisible or even stealth while other killers are using deadly tools to get their victims. The killer has a first person camera perspective which means he can't use their camera to look around the walls for victims. Killers are able to see ALL Generators and exit gates throughout the match which could help you locating survivors.You will have to hunt down the survivors and they could reveal themself on the map if they are failing a skillcheck helping a survivor off the hook or destroying a hex totem. Chasing a survivor will start the ""Chase music"" until the victim is down or escaped. An injured or a running survivor will leave a trail of red marks around the location which you need to track down in order to kill them. A killer is able to hear nearby ""grunting/moaning"" sound when a survivor is injured. The killer is able to kick generators to slow and decrease the generator progress or destroying thrown pallets by kicking them. Killers are generally faster than a survivor and the killer's movement speed will increase the longer the chase goes as they have ""Bloodlust"". Survivor needs to escape from the map by completing generators to power up the exit gate or they are able to find a hatch. There are alot of different survivors each with their own gameplay and perks. Some are good for co op actions while others are quickly. Survivors have a third person camera which will allow them to see around the walls and keep the killer at a distance. You will have to find generators to power up the exit gates to make your escape.Generators are randomly spawned on the map and could be located by looking up as you will see sparky flashlights. From time to time you will receive a skillcheck which you will need to success in order to prevent the generator blowing up and able to reveal your location on the game. Blowing up generators will lose some of your progess and could put you into danger as well. By reparing enough generators the exit gates will be powered up and you COULD leave the area after opening the gates. You could also find a hatch which will allow you to escape but the killer is able to grab you out of the hatch if he is quick enough.There are 2 hitchecks on a skillcheck The thick white bar and a smaller bar. Before the skillcheck will pop up you will hear a ""ping"" sound. Hitting the Bigger white bar will gain you more experience and you will gain 2% more progress but you are better off focusing on the smaller bar as it will be alot easier to hit. Most actions ingame require a skillcheck and missing a skillcheck will reveal your location to the killer. You are able to find items in crates such a medkit or a toolbox. Items has a quality level and make them more powerful the higher it is. Items are usually an one time thing as you will lose them if you have died or they run out of charges. You are able to to carry an item to the next match if you have escaped.The survivor is able to jump over windows throw down pallets or hide in lockers. Lockers are not a good hiding location and you will be instantly grabbed by the killer if spotted. You are better off crouching and hiding behind obstactles. A common mistake what people are doing is Running. If they see a killer and it is close to a survivor they have a tendency to run which will be a big mistake as this will reveal your location to the killer alot easier. You should only start running when you are being chased or you know for sure the killer isn't close to you.Ingame Information. Moderate replayability. Good Atmosphere. Dark graphical horror atmosphere. Has Perks and level systems. Each survivor/killer has their own system. Dialy randoms quests to gain an insane ammount of experience.Miscellaneous Information. Dwight and Nea are both good beginning characters. Worst enemies could be your allies while the killer could be your friend. Pallets are buggy Don't throw the pallet if you are facing it. It could teleport you to the other side and screw you over.Other things.The game isn't that fun as it may seem. Why? If you are playing as a killer you will fight against a bunch of ""high"" skilled trolls and they are usally pre made as well. They are mostly pallet/window jumping flashlighting and shamefully t bagging.If you are playing as a survivor you will play against a killer that may be alot better than you are. Sometimes teammates are disconnecting in a middle of the match which will leave you in a disadvantage they also have the tendecies to really screw you over. Sometimes even on purpose.Survivors are generally alot more toxic salty trolly and generally have a negative attitude than a killer will ever get in this game. Killers mostly relies on mistakes from the survivors and sometimes are more friendlier than a survivor.I will only suggest to buy this game whenever it is in a discount. Otherwise i would suggest to stay away from it. The idea of the game is nice Community however isn't and can be really frustating or game ruining.I have reached the text review limit. T T '( Reviews are always uploaded if i have at least played for 2 hours or more. Unless the game is really garbage and doesn't deserve the 2H limit.I Give this game a 7/10",Dead by Daylight

Yeah they finally update the game and just make it worse for the survivor you can get 15 000 blood points in a single game but if you don't escape you don't get a pip.

It's like when those youtubers play FNAF for views yet they look like they want to off themselves Dead by Daylight is not meant to scare you it's meant to challenge you.Now the game still holds incredible potential of fun. If you're a fan of the horror genre you're going to love the Dead by Daylight. The game features licensed killers from classic horror films like Leatherface Michael Meyers and remade version of Freddy Krueger (which imo is a piece of they added quentin instead of literally anybody else). The downside to this is that alot of these characters are locked behind an in game purchase door. You're gonna have to pay more money than the fee to start playing the game if you want to play the cool characters. The game holds a strong incentive to play. You level up your killers/survivors you get cool perks you get cool items and you can also get prestige! If you like farming for completion this game will keep you occupied.Now the downside the game has all the issues other online games have. There is a serious balance issues however the devs are working on it and the game is more balanced than ever according to Dead by Daylight's subreddit. Playing survivor is literally playing baby mode while playing killer is like smashing your head against your keyboard. If you plan on playing with friends you can only play survivor unless you have enough for a full 1v4 but you will not earn any points for kill your friends gamemode. The community is also INCREDIBLY toxic. Toxic communities to me are a sign of an utterly unfun game for people become toxic because the game angers them so much. And that is true. While you may have good games occasionally you will also have terrible games and those trials will put your mind to hell. Think of the game similar to CS GO and LoL. Toxic community hard core disconnectors garbonzo matchmaking yada yada.In the end the game is still great. If you enjoy competitive games this will be your type of game. If you want a high skill ceiling game play killer. If you want to play by dragging your balls from left to right on your keyboard and still win play survivor.TL DRThe game is not for everyone but most people will enjoy it to some degree. By the way if you bm as a survivor you are the degenerate scum that deserves to get shot down in the streets.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-22,0,0,230,False,Recommended,"This game and i have a love hate relationship. The forums are filled with nothing but killers complaining about survivors being OP and survivors complaining about killers being OP.. Truth be told the game is fun when playing againsts a killer who is fair and doesn't tunnel the heck out of you or camp you. in the end the bad players make the game non fun.Pls add a block option so players can avoid killers/survives who are either toxic or campers so they can avoid future matches with them tyKillers drop you when you thinking it will prevent you from struggling off their shoulder. NEWS it doesn't reset struggle timer. YOU tell survivors get good or you would not get hit or hooked. same goes to you if you have to use these tactics to win you're just unskilled or lazy.the pt system is so way off .. the killer if they do it right can leave easily with 40K plus pts this is even when they lazy and if a survive works their asses off they might get 20 to 30K? more often than not when using even bloody party streamers killer aims to kill as fast as possible and survivor leaves with 3K.That is if they are lucky but a killer is garenteed at least 12K if they only hook 2 survives.No wonders so many play killer .Wish they had a kill your friends that earned you bp and not ranks that would allow players to play for fun and skip being trolled by killers taking out non toxic players.Doing this as well will lower idiotic wait times for killers because it seems too many want to be ""evil"" just cause of event or it's easy bp and they having a bad day and want to take their negativity out on survives.Killers claim that survives are over powered but you got the doctor that has a ability that can hit survives pretty much a quarter if not more of the map.I am an unskilled killer who can down survives in second on the doctor if I chose. YOU got the pig who can pretty much have 0 terror radious sneak up on you add in the massive debuffsa then what the head trap. In the movie yes Amanda had to get it off alone because she was alone however in the game survives are NOT alone. Why not make someone get teammate get it off with the rule of them having to have a tool kit?I mean amanda didn't have a killer grabbing her while getting what she needed for the trap to come off. Due to killers tunneling the hell out of you there is no way to get it off your head unless the pig doesn't tunnel.I have had 10 pig killers troll the fk out of me .I see pig I will leave the game or just die on first hook. PIG induces toxic killers .I am not a sore loser give me fair game play without tunnel or camping I am happy win or lose. survives can be as toxic as well.A game should be fun competetive or not in the end we all here to enjoy a game.

2016-11-23,0,0,65,False,Recommended,"Yes I would definitely recommend this game. Sure it has a ton of bugs but its not like its the only game that has bugs. This game (Though it isn't in beta) is still a work in progress with a complex leveling system and new things being added every few weeks or so. Saying ""THIS GAME HAS TOO MANY BUGS"" is like saying ""MARIO IS TOO 3D."" It's part of the game. Reporting a bug won't fix it right away. The Devs need some time to make the patch and program the game.To all of y'all who think you can do better than the Devs why don't you try to satisfy WAY over 10 000 people worldwide. THESE GAMES AREN'T EXACTLY EASY TO MAKE. So everyone who doesn't recommend this game JUST BECAUSE OF THE FREAKIN' BUGS why don't you go to a tech university or college and why don't you study programing. Then I would like to see how far anything that you make goes. Bugs in games aren't intentional. They are programing/ modeling errors. Every game is TRIAL AND ERROR.Grand Theft Auto had a ton of bugs rockstar fixed it. Super Smash Bros had a ton of bugs and nintendo fixed it. Don't you think the devs will try to fix the bugs in this game? Yes they will. Even if it take months.This game is fun and a few bugs here and there might ruin one or two rounds but I don't think its fair that you don't recommend this game because you're salty you can't win a match. Whether you being a killer and the hook is blocked or being a survivor floating in the air for the killer to see.

I couldnt have gotten luckier with buying this. Now that is not to say that it is not a pretty and polished finished project. There are still issues that need to be fixed but that said that game is still very fun!!! This game when from something I would play occasionaly to one of my main games. ( I dont think there are many others out there that can say the same thing with a price tag of $20) The only warning that I can give to those who are looking to buy this game is that it HIGHLY and I mean HIGHLY FAVORS THE KILLERS. This does not mean that playing survivor is not fun but it is easly more a challange which in my opinion makes the game much more fun. Think of this like dark souls only you cant fight back you can only run. If you are looking for a great game on a budget then give this one a chance.

How would you feel hiding behind a corner hoping nothing is lurking just around it? How exhilerating is it when you find your victim and you give chase?This is what this game explores and it does so perfectly! The simplified UI as to not distract you from the hunt relying solely on audio cues (with a little extra help for the killer since they are supposed to be supernatural) to navigate the little area.They play the suspense role flawlessly you are at the edge of your seat when you start running (whether you are running to kill or avoid being killed.)I highly recommend this game to anyone into the horror genre! It does get repetitive and I am starting to have trouble finding the motivation to keep playing the same maps over and over again.

2016-06-14,1,1,322,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a very interesting game. Bringing us into the land of Slasher horror films. Something not a lot of games venture into if at all.You can play as a Slasher or a Survivor. Survivors have a third person perspective and have audio cues to know if the Slasher is close but not its exact position. A small red light on the ground shows the Killer's vision letting you know the Killer is RIGHT behind you when you're being chased if you even DARE to look back. When you're being chased the Slasher is slightly faster. But this is balanced out with ways to avoid the killer. Throwing down pallets to block him while you run off in tall grass or hide in a closet or something. Your objective is to activate 5 generators with 3 other survivors and then escape. Sounds simple but it's a lot harder than it sounds. There is no voice chat in ranked matches so plans cannot be made.There are three Slashers each with different abilities. You have the Trapper who uses Bear Traps to trap survivors in choke points during chases or stop them getting to the generators from helping survivors etc. The Wraith who has a cloaking ability. Many users are complaining that this slasher is Overpowered. The cloaking prevents survivors from hearing the audio cue that plays when the Slasher is near. However before the Wraith can go invisible a bell toll plays announcing that he's cloaking. Players then have the option of continuing what they're doing or be more careful.Then you have the Hillbilly that has a Chainsaw dash ability able to cut down a survivor in one fell swoop.All three of the Slashers have a melee weapon that takes down a survivor in two hits. One makes them bleed two downs them to a crawl. When slashing there's a slight cooldown for when you hit a survivor. When you hit a survivor the Slasher wipes the blood onto his sleeve and he slows down for a few seconds allowing the Survivor to get a headstart. Fair trade in my opineon. If the slasher was able to do two swings in rapid succession it wouldn't be very fair.The goal of the Slasher no matter the type is to either kill or sacrifice all the Survivors by putting them on meat hooks. Once again this is harder than it sounds. Survivors can help eachother getting others off meathooks healing eachother helping repair the Generators etc.The game has one core gameplay mode but two ways to do it. Ranked is as simple as it sounds. Play as a Slasher or Survivor against random online people. Or you can do Kill Your Friends mode which is the same but in a private match for at least 2 people(One person HAS to be the Slasher). Now the big difference between the two. In ranked mode you score blood points which you can use to upgrade your character. Give them new perks and items to use. However in Kill Your Friends this stuff is blocked. I'm guessing this is mainly to stop people from farming points. If this is something that bothers you you might not want to spend money on this. Be warned.Speaking of points. There is a character customization point or loadout. Which allows you to add items to your character.(As stated above) There's not many choices of clothing and cosmetics as of yet. This is likely to be added in future updates along with new play modes.Maps are of relatively medium to large size all of which are dark and forboding and are procedurally generated. Generators in a place you might know now will be switched in different plays.I think this game is quite fun and is a pretty good horror game that will make you tense up.Price is pretty damn low for something of this kind of quality only $20. Ten dollars more if you want the Deluxe edition.Go ahead and get this game if you wish and enjoy yourself you masochistic maniac you.,Dead by Daylight

I enjoy playing with friends sometimes on my own and I can enjoy playing the game as killer. I'd just say that you have to be patient. Don't take the game seriously just play the game as it is a game and if you have a bad time during one game leave a gg and just move on. You'll have a much better time that way. Have fun in the fog potential buyers!,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,333,False,Recommended,Its a pretty awesome game. Its almost like Evolve except the survivors are the ones worrying instead of the killer because they cant fight back. But the game is still a bit buggy like with survivors dying on the hook the entity cant grab their souls or downed survivors cant be picked up by the killer. Still overall its definitely a fun game,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-27,0,0,1420,False,Recommended,Edited 7/27/2018Honestly? The game is so much better than it was when I originally reviewed it and still much better after I edited my initial review. I'm gonna keep the old review in but in parenthesis. That review is outdated but feel free to read it.Since the dead by daylight team at bhvr seperated from starbreeze I have been nothing but impressed. They have a very voherent plan laid out for their game and it seems like they are actually focusing on making a game they love rather than making it for money. The changes are well welcomed the balance changes were much needed and the pallet changes are excellent. Most of the negative reviews you will see on this game recently are people very upset about the balance changes. The balance changes have actually made things more balanced and they don't like it because they aren't as good anymore. Which is understandable since if you bought the game for that reason and don't get that feeling anymore I would also be disappointed but you also have to realise this is more how the game was envisioned.The community for this game is to be honest terrible. Only in rust have I seen a community more toxic and abysmal than the Dead by Daylight community. However the game is still extremely enjoyable and fun and you can also just hide the chat so you don't have to deal with people. All in all this game is easily one of my favorites and I only see it getting better in the future.However I still stand fully by my statement that the doctor is the actual worst part of any video game I have EVER played. But that's just an opinion.TL DR This game is fun the community is the devs are working on making the game a better experience and I couldn't be happier with the direction they're going.8/10 OUTDATED REVIEW BELOW (This game is very fun though also extremely frustrating due to mechanics and the way players interpret those mechanics into some less than fun playstyles. The game has always been fun but i would not have reccommended it back when i first got the game or even just a few months ago. i believe that with the seperation from starbreeze bhvr can really make this game into something great that i know it can be and so far from what ive seen in te dev streams and the roadmap they're pushing for that as well. It is by no means a perfect game and they refuse to patch the biggest bug in the entire game (The Doctor) but it is an enjoyable experience when you can get past all the upset people telling you to off yourself.),Dead by Daylight

2017-02-17,0,0,208,False,Not Recommended,Was a fun game at launch many bugs as was to be expected but at this point the amount of bugs is unacceptable. Each update breaks more than it fixes and the devs have given up on listening to the community whatsoever. Communication between the devs and community was already pretty bad but now they just pump out awful buffs and nerfs that usually aren't needed cuz it seems like they listen to the extremely loud whiners rather than looking at the data and proper feedback. The gameplay has become stale frustrating unfair and not worth playing. DLC is heavily overpriced and is usually nothing good maybe a new killer that's overpowered and eventually gets a nerf or some crappy accessories. Don't buy this crap used to be good but now it's far from it.,Dead by Daylight
2017-02-17,1,1,93,False,Not Recommended,Game was nice and fun i enjoyed playing it. You can feel the thrill being chased by the killer when playing as a survivor and one match doesn't take time too long even though this game is a PvP game.the cons are the matchmaking system is weird and maybe i spent 60% of my total playtime in game just to search matches. But i can still tolerate it because if you actually know when to play it doesn't take time that long. But the real prob is everytime this game releases a new patch and you update the game it becomes worse for no reason. On the first patch my fps dropped from 40 50 to around 20 30 and after i updated the latest patch(today's patch). The game becomes literally unplayable. i can't even get into the main menu. the game tells me to verify the game but it fixes nothing. So the conclusion is for you guys who want to play this game Don't buy it if you're not lucky enough. Because actually this game worked for some people that are lucky.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-13,0,0,510,False,Recommended,This is a tricky review to write... The game is pretty well made and pretty well balanced. It's difficult to survive as a survivor and to kill as the killer so it does all even out although some of the DLC killers are OP and a little unfair IMO. As the survivor you have to repair generators open the exits and run around/hide trying to avoid the killer... as the killer you just need to stop the survivors and put up with being called a camper no matter how far away you go from your hooked victims. Seriously the community is salty... VERY salty... The game can be a little repetitive but because of all the unlocks it does have good replayability and so I would recommend the game. However be aware the community is pretty toxic and it is very frustrating to play at times.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-23,0,0,332,False,Recommended,"Absolutely a great game. Can be fun to play both solo and with friends. High tactical and mechanical skill cap. Don't get me wrong it's got its bugs but it is very clear that the devs are actively working to patch and rebalance the game while also consistently adding new content to the game.One major issue with the game is the ""loss of save file"" bug. THIS CAN BE PREVENTED by manually backing up your save files every so often (just a simple copy/paste). However I disregarded this advice myself only to lose 225 hours of progress when the Steam servers went down. I proceeded to email the devs to resolve the issue. After about two weeks I finally got all my progress back. I was also able to continue playing in the meantime and got to keep any bloodpoints I had earned in that period. I admire the developers of this game for actually taking the time to look into such issues and keeping in contact with their playerbase as so many other small studios fail to do.Update 310 hours in and this game is still great.

2016-06-27,0,0,564,False,Not Recommended,This game has become a mediocre game from when it first started in 2016 I rated this game 8/10 however I am giving it 4/10 going forward. Never mind the 450+ hours I ve clocked but the entire experience has been dreadful i've never played a game that frustrates me as much as this one. From killers camping &amp wrecking the game survivors simply disconnecting randomly when they sense they're gonna lose you name it.1.) Firstly they have this stupid Season Reset system which resets player's Ranks every so often. What this means is that everyone essentially starts back at Rank 16 20. So a person with 3 000 hours as a killer may face 3 4 survivors with 50+ hours and annihilate the game (and vice versa). This creates a very unfair game and you would want to quit as a new starter.2.) Unlike other team games (like TF2) where you can still carry across if you end up with dudd player or 2 (from the 4) this game heavily relies on ALL 4 so if you have a bad one in your team you'll most likely all end up dead3.) The Devs seem to Buff &amp Nerf various killers/survivors very frequently you can never master a player without either that playing being buffed or nerfed. This shows that after 2 years the game is imbalanced.4.) They try and discourage the killers from camping however they create perks that simply promote it like Dying Light where you have to kill 1 specific survivor to gain an advantage.Sorry for the new comers who don't understand some of the points above as they're specific but don't spend $19.99 unless you've played imbalanced games and happy to try and have fun.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-26,0,0,90,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is one of the most entertaining co op games I have ever laid hands on. Everything about the game is excellent asthetically there are some questionable underlying gameplay issues that leave room for improvement. The premise of the game is wonderful 4 defenseless survivors have to hide and attempt escape from a powerful supernatural killer. The game is an entertainment experience that fills me with a variety of feelings and emotions (mostly panic and fear). The music is intense and erratic adding to the feeling of hectic hopelessness. The environments are dark and dingy and the random spawn locations adds to the feeling of isolation. The sound of the approaching killer and the slaughter of a nearby teammate causes involuntary clenching that I rarely experience from video games. DbD is wildly fun to play with some friends as you can either be extremely goal oriented to work together to try and escape or you can play to rescue each other and try to create some highlights that belong on ESPN. There are some balancing issues with the various perks and attachments available to players but that is to be expected with any ""competetive"" player vs player game. The developers are much better now at acknowledging these issues and fixing them in a relatively timely matter. Overall I would highly recommend this game especially if you can pick it up for a decent sale price!",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-23,0,0,169,False,Recommended,"If you have a bad temper I wouldn't recommend this game. There's so many camping killers and selfish survivors. I think the game mechanics are too reliant on your perks and fellow survivors where as without the proper perk you cant heal after being injured nor can you escape the hook without another survivor saving which they can take advantage of you and use you as a diversion/sacrifice to espace on their own and get their extra XP.What I have to say for the future of the game's development is that The killer shouldn't be allowed without 2 feet of a hanging body unless another survivors enters the invisible barrier while the killer is allowed to enter the invisible barrier upon the other survivor entering where the killer may hack at the hanged survivor's savior or go after the pre hanged survivor to finish them off. While I think the hanged victim should remain immue while in the invisible barrier of the hook to avoid campers to constantly pick them of. But if the previously hanged victim remains in the invisible barrier for more than 10 seconds the invisible barrier vanishes and the killer is free to go all in at the survivor. However the survivor's savior will not be immune while in this barrier if the killer is within 1 foot of them.In the most recent update for Dead By Daylight's Anniversary Match Making took a major turn for the better. I used to queue up with 3 friends and it took 2 hours for us to find a match. Developers finally patched this and match making is quicer and it's much more reliable if you want to have a quick match then having to find friends to create a private match with.I personally think the bugging and some of the dlc killers need to be patched/fixed because things such as Michael Myer's not having a heartbeat outside of stalking and The Hag's teleport is just ridiculous and overpowered. I also think Michael Myers and The Hag's speed should be lowered some I was one shot by a Michael Myers while he chased for for bout 3 seconds as he hung my body my friend came to save me as she was also one shot. One game with the hag I was found at the beginning of the game where the hag used her incredible speed to catch me and knock me down as she hung me She camped me. Meg Thomas and William ""Bill"" Overbeck had both been knocked down attempting to save me as the other survivor cowarded out as The Hag hung and killed each of us off one by one.I would recommend because overall it's a fun experience expect for when you want to win and you get camped by a bunch a s. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to play a game that's so early in development and hasnt had time to reach it's full potential. If you are here to simply have fun and enjoy the experience of Dead By Daylight as the game rises to greatness then this is the game for you.Good Luck don't get slaughtered!",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-04,0,0,500,False,Recommended,"At first I just saw annoying gameplay where teamwork dosen't exist and constantly getting ganged up on as killer. But as I ranked up players stoped using cheap tactics and overall the toxicity subsided. It's an interesting concept with the killer using various abilities (depending on the killer) to hunt down survivors and hang them on hooks. This is a big deal since there's only 4 survivors killing them as soon as you catch them all the time would make the game to fast. Speaking of survivors they have to power 5 generators (which they all somehow know how to do) to open a door and escape. After all the generators are done there's still the matter of opening the doors. This was pretty clever of the devs. Just because the exit is there dosen't mean the killer can't stop you. You could be right there in front of the exit but a fellow survivor is stuck on a hook. You can either leave the game (and get salt) or risk your life. Many people say gens progress too fast. But I say it's a good choice. DbD has no way of chatting mid game unless you use something like Discord or Skype so coordinating outside of a private chat is hard. Faster gens will compensate for that.I have two problems with this game however. One problem is what the devs are doing with this game. They said they're not dealing with scummy tactics like face camping (Staying right by a hooked survivor) or pallet looping (dropping a pallet to block the killer and just leaping over it whenever the killer gets to close.) Though if you have a group of friends to play with (which I don't ) you can work around face campers and with pallet looping you can just ignore the troll and partol some generators.My 2nd problem is the community. Both killer mains and survivor mains alike can be annoying. While killers are usualy ok there's a camper every now and then that will just tell you git gud. Survivors are even worse in my opinion. A toxic survivor will usualy get mad at ""camping"" (which to them is just staying on the same half of the map as a hooked survivor.) And act like they're compleatly innocent. This is never the case. Suvivors can be found palletlooping windowlooping flashlight spamming bodyblocking etc. while asking for respect the whole time. A toxic survivor can easily be compared to a spoiled 6 8 year old brat. However the community is a mixed bag. Every now and then you get paired with a fair respectable group that are good winners and losers. Those kinds of games always make my day no matter how well I actully preform in the match.All in all DbD is a pretty good horror survival game that you can pour many hours into. I reccomend it.",Dead by Daylight
2017-03-18,0,0,29,False,Recommended,"Ok so after I played way more hours I think I can update a little bit my review.GRAPHIC 6/10AUDIO 7/10GAMEPLAY 8/10COMMUNITY NA/10PRICE FOR THE VALUE 10/10OVERALL 8/10Now in details GRAPHICS Not much to say here it makes what it has to make but even though it use the Unreal Engine and Autodesk Scale something the graphic is compareable at Halflife 2 with some extra poligons. It could be Paragon...it's crap...but a 6 because it is sufficient to enjoy the game (SUFFICIENT).AUDIO The music itself is ok nothing too good nothing too bad but all the tiny details the screams the footsteps and more it makes the experience really enjoyable but doesn't excell.GAMEPLAY Funny and addictive probably at long it will get boring as Survivors doesn't have any ability other than run and Killers has just 1 ability that most of the time is crap. I would like few more abilities like a moba but still the game is enjoyable and I keep playing and want to play more so is more than ok.I have to admit that the matchmaking is somehow broken (doesn't exist) and sometimes as a beginner I find myself against people that played probably for months (you can see that from the PERKS they have PERKS are items that increase your performance and you get them levelling up).This for now didn't ruin my experience I took it as it is sometimes the game is harder (they have more level) sometimes easyer (I do) no matter what you will take your experience (bloodpoints) to get level and sometimes is fun to try to beat someone stronger than you (and sometimes it happen and is SO GOOD).COMMUNITY Everyone in other reviews blame the toxic community...HOW? There is no in game chat of any kind you start a game you end a game you leave! At the start and end of a game you can chat IF YOU WANT and the few times I did everyone was nice (nice game gg had fun and so on).If people think that this is a toxic community probably they never tried League of Legend or any moba in general!Then of course unskilled players will always complain and blame on others....they are everywhere! There are people complaining about camping (Killer stay at the hang after hanged a survivor waiting for his death) and sometimes I do that...sometimes survivors got away with that grouping up using items (flashlight that blind the killer and more) and this is how it should be played but noobs doesn't know how to do that and blame the killer...just noobs being noobs!Still community is ok (I even posted on the community site here on Steam and they answered in a really polite way explaining me few things of the game).PRICE FOR THE VALUE 12.99 when on offer 19.99 full price...I pay that when I go out for a dinner few hours and what I eat will become poop ... for the fun I had until now I am already ok and happy to have paid those money.OVERALL Great game probably not for all I didn't meet any of the problems that blamers wrote in other reviews.I had really few problems with the lobby (maybe 10 times I click on start game and after less than 30 seconds I am back to the main menu) but is nothing that ruined at all my experience with the game.Probably who blame about it has crappy computer or internet connection often happens I work in customer service and ""why I can't use your software on facebook everything works fine so my internet is great""...it's their problem and they should get a decent computer and internet connection before playing games online...or they should go playing with a console maybe offline thou...the game WORKS PERFECTLY.All my games as survivor or as killer starts in less than a minute (well lets say 2 minutes as after the game has to load and that takes usually longer than the waiting for a full lobby).That about the lobby sometimes (1 out of 5 maybe) as the game session rely on one host (that is a player) the game become laggy almost unplayable (well totally unpleyable) just die get anyway a little experience and start a new game worst case scenario will take 10 minutes.Overall this game worth to be played absolutly worth the price and it works fine.If you do not like survival horror or multiplayer game leave this game be otherwise really try it worst case scenario you trashed 12.99 (but I am sure that most of you attracted by this game will enjoy it ... people who will not enjoy it would not even have the doubt to buy it or not).All this people blaming this game for internet connection and stuff should try a triple A game 69.99 like For Honor where there are way more connectivity issues and bug on a 5 times the price game from a such famous publisher (damn you Ubisoft....damn you).",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-20,0,0,870,False,Recommended,I've played this game for a long time. I started from the very beginning with just three killers and four survivors. I've been through every DLC update community outburst and horrible patch update. I can say for sure that this game is absolutely worth it to play. The recent anniversary event was fantastic and brought a lot of people back including myself. The developers have actually improved themselves and listen to the community much better than they did before. Now I look forward to patch updates. They constantly add new map variations to old maps which is a very nice addition to the game. They also ACTUALLY FIXED the horrible queueing system from the past! They also added loading bars which provides so much clarity in case you do crash. With different promises such as console releases a new chapter for free coming up and community support there is no better time to pick this game up. It's also a very reasonable price gate to begin playing at $20 without sales.Simply put this game is just extremely fun. There is something really addicting about running away from the killer or murdering every survivor on the map. The problem was in the past the developers were hurting the game's growth through different means. Now it can't be farther from the truth.Is this game perfect? ABSOLUTELY NOT. There are still a lot of bugs peer to peer connection and face camping.Even with the flaws I recommend you pick this game up. Before I couldn't say this with certainty. Now I can.

2017-07-02,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,"I definitely can't recommend this game. The premise and even the gameplay are incredibly compelling but execution is sloppy on so many fronts.Icons numbers and game concepts are explained so vaguely (or not at all) in game that it's difficult to grasp intricacies beyond the basic premise. The wiki has more detail but it's not always enough. It can be helpful to play as a survivor or killer to learn their special abilities but if they're behind the DLC paywall you might never really understand exactly how they work.There are a lot of game design choices that feel bad. If you take items with you on a round you'll lose them always if you're the killer and if you die as a survivor. Since it's impossible to know before a match begins whether it will be a close fight or a struggle for either side there's not much in the way of tactics when making the decision to bring gear along. So most of the progress through the bloodweb is transient and not very meaningful.There's no meaningful matchmaking. I've played with teams of all first time playing level 5 rank 20 survivors and ended up in games with rank 1 killers sporting huge perk and add on loadouts. What a terrible experience to expose new players to. The last game I played the killer took out 3 of us and then proceeded to carry the last survivor around the map holding the player hostage for 15 20 minutes while they racked up points. The player might wiggle free only to be chased struck down and carried back again once more. Since none of the generators were on the trap door wasn't available and there was no way for the player to escape or finish the job due to the killer's detection perks. Without any sort of time limit or event to break long term stalemates players have only two options wait until their opponent gets bored or disconnect and suffer huge point losses.The software decisions are really sloppy. Finish a game with friends? Your party is disbanded and you are put into a different game mode. Have a killer quit your lobby? Your party is disbanded. Temporary connectivity issue with the servers while trying to load a game? The game shuts down entirely. Accidentally get disconnected from the game? No way to reconnect. Interacting with the game is a chore.Fun trick about the game shutting itself down if you wait a few seconds after it tells you it needs to shut down and asks you to click ""Ok"" you can instead hit Alt F4 which will pull up an ""Are you sure you want to quit"" dialogue instead. On that dialogue you can hit cancel and skip the whole automatic restart thing which merely confirms that there was no reason for the game to shut down in the first place.This game *is* a lot of fun if you can find 5 friends of similar skill and experience to play it with together. Of course this requires dropping a collective $60+ on a title that doesn't have much value outside of that very specific use case. The rest of it is pretty thoroughly bad though. A pity too since the core of the gameplay though simple is very compelling.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-03,1,2,170,False,Recommended,Positives The killer and survivor designs play styles and perks. The map designs and artwork. The fear the game's music and atmosphere creates for the survivors. Controls are simple and easy to learn. Gameplay (when the game works as intended) is fun for the killer and intense and scary for the survivors.Negatives Current gameplay is buggy at times. The game should have remained in early access for a few more weeks. There is no Looking for Group option at this time. You can either queue for randoms and click back and re queue until you find your friends or you can play a game with your friends but without a full party (unless you have the friends to create a full party). I definitely recommend this game to people but anyone playing should expect bugs ranging from funny (survivors floating through the air instead of running) to game breaking (survivors stuck in trees after being saved from the hook). The DBD devs are working out these kinks and have already released 2 patches and multiple hotfixes since the game's release earlier this month.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,3,1,32,False,Recommended,Honestly this game deserves Much more praise. the whole feeling to the game is amazing and the soundtrack is so thematic and really puts you on edge. The gameplay is nearly solid with a few screw ups. such as range of weapons (for example getting hit while already vaulted away from a window and was a step away from the opening) thats about it.Pros! great soundtrack Very VERY fun with friends the character design is wonderful. The killers have this nice familiar but original feel to them. Map design is IN my opinion great! the perks and addons for each character cand really help you out at times! Cons! Rarely you are randomly kicked out of a match with no reason told Nurse is just annoying not really a bad con (It can be avoided easily if your a regular to dodging the hunnies) it would actually be cool to have some seperate lobby music. something similar to what it is now. but i like the song so much i dont want to hear it over and over again and get bored. (but it does have a very long runtime and has awesome sounding parts so its not just an annoying short loop. The game is a very fun game to me and i dont think it deserves all this hate!sure the matchmaking connectivity can be a little annoying. but its just because its free weekend currently. and its pairing you with squads of survivors who can be people in 3s looking for 1 more person or a squad of 2 looking for 2 more. just a player group complaint and i cant say thats a bad game bug or design. its mostly player complaint.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME WITH ALL MY HEART,Dead by Daylight

Survivors are rewarded for working with each other and aiding in progression to the exit gates. Gameplay is made dynamic through different killers survivors maps and a large assortment of perks to suit your playstyle.Gameplay Very fun to play with friends and a pleasure to play solo as well. You're always a winner whether you successfully escape the killer or not promoting a style of gameplay that almost completely excludes selfish plays (you can't really do much about the purposefully selfish players). Teamwork is essential to survivng this game and with over 200 hours in this game I'm always on edge waiting for the killer to sneak up on me.Servers In a previous iteration of this review I commented on terrible MM which seems to be fixed now.

The new hunter ""The Shade"" is faster than the other hunters and is way to op this is imparitive and needs to change immediately. (2). The new map that came with the halloween dlc is small which is fine but they put the same amount of hooks from the other maps in the small map this makes it very hard to not get caught by the hunter. (3). I've noticed that hunters ranging from rank 1 rank 20 have been camping the runners when on the hooks this is making the game not fun anymore. when the hunters are camping they should have a penalty to some degree. (4). The hunters that camp and hook the last person want to get rid of ""Survive with Friends"" . If this happens then it will almost make the game impossible to play with friends. Please do not get rid of Survive With Friends.Until these changes are met I cannot recommend this game.*Update*Im glad the developers did not get rid of Survive with Friends but 9 out of 10 killers are still camping and it seems that with every single update and ""expansion"" the devs are making the killers faster and faster also this is a note to the devs ""Stop making the killers faster and stop listening to the players that only play killer"".",Dead by Daylight

The higher ranks don't complain much because they have perks to counter Freddy.

2017-12-18,0,0,235,False,Not Recommended,I put down no because there are many other bad things then there are good things.1) The CommunityThis game has the most TOXIC community out of every game. Even worse than Overwatch. Everybody is just rude and cancerous. Nobody respects people anymore. When I first got the game I guess I was in a small zen period when people are nice. Now it's just toxic/salty survivors and killers/survivors.2) The GameplayThe gameplay isn't bad at all. It's just when it comes to Killer v. Survivor. Survivor has so many better options to survive than the killer but the killer has so many cancerous methods that ruin the game for everyone. The balancing for killer/survivor is not good. Survivors are OP AF devs. Pleae fix this.The main problem this game is bad is because of the SWF ( Survive With Friends ) Mode. It allows friends to tag along and go against killers with friends but the problem is the toxicity of these SWF games ruins the entire game. If they lose they get salty and triggered accuse you of being and trash talk. If they win the STILL TRASH TALK.3) The Perks + ItemsPerks are unbalanced as . Survivors just keep getting buffed and killers just keep getting nerfed. All because the opinions of the new players who say everything on killer is OP. And the devs of the game ACTUALLY LISTEN TO IT. I can't play killer anymore 1/2 the time because i'll get put against somebody who is so much better than their rank. When ranks reset it destroy's everything about this game. P3 people with over thousands of hours get put against people with less than 100. It destroys the game makes them salty makes the devs nerf killer and make the game even more unbalanced than it already is!Survivor items are also way better than killer addons and stuff as well. Nothing more to be said.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-20,1,1,1,False,Not Recommended,"It was on sale. I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. Played it for an hour. Regret buying it.As a survivor there's no real reward in completing generators. Sure you just move on to the next one (where there's 5 in total) and so on. Whenever the killer gets you there is a ""Press to wiggle"" function. This gives you a chance to break free from the killer and escape. He then drags your over to a hook. where he will impel you untill a survior comes to your aid. It would've been a great feature if the hooks weren't 2 inches from each other. And if you are new to the game and are a low level character there's not much fun in it for you. You have to grind and grind your character to a certain level before you can start to have a slight of a chance. And those perks includes things like tool boxes which makes you repair generators faster a simple flashlight so you can see! and so on. This game introduces itself in the worst way. Looks like fun when you watch someone else play it. And it doesn't explain you that you need to put hours into it before you can perhaps enjoy it.

2016-11-23,0,0,496,False,Recommended,Nov 2017 This game is reaching the potential that it first had the developers are far more thoughtful when it comes to problems they dont rush to bring out unbalanced DLC to make more money. This game is a lot of fun.You need a thick skin to play killer you will always have salty survivors you killed being toxic. BUT if you play this game with the intention of it being for fun and dont care about dying or about making sure someone dies on a hook (camping) then this game is a whole lot of fun. Try it you might just love it.Nov 2016 This game all depends on your outlook. If you are easily triggered by other players features in a game that make it unfair or developers that dont fix issues that are underlying in the game (camping Infinites etc) then this game wont be for you.Its got issues which are slowly being worked out. There should be a patch on the day I am writing this review to lessen the grind for perks and prestige. HOWEVER if you play this game for fun (and not too focused on getting points or the full win) then this game is fantastic. If you play the game how the devs envisioned it to be played (its not too hard to work out what the wanted dont be a and ruin the game for other people i.e camping) then this game is very good fun especially with teammates. You must have a thick skin though and be prepared to ignore the salt that happens at the end of every game from the people that will whine at you. Killer get this much worse so many surviors will rage at you regardless of what you did in the game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-22,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,"I honestly never do reviews and could care less to do them but this game has really struck a cord. I bought this game while it was on sale a week ago and as soon as I played it I ""screamed"" with horror and joy. There was finally a horror game I could play with friends and have fun with. However once I started playing more I noticed some killers seemed a tier above others and completely overpowered. So I looked at the list of killers and soon realized that those characters were the ones you had to buy. I initially shrugged it off and thought maybe it was just coincidence that those were the ones always beating my friends and me. But the more we played the more I saw the trend of us losing to these ""pay to win"" killers. You would run into someone who has over 400 hrs in game but were low rank with these killers and being new players to this game we would get creamed.Now I know it isn't all fair with the normal killers so I think things should change there but my gosh the skill difference between these paid killers and normal survivors (especially for new players) can just ruin the entire game! I mean it gets pretty annoying when you have Michael Meyers slashing you from 4 ft away and follow you through every obstacle and gaining on you to be killed. Then have the killer at the end of the game calling you ""an alternative name for a cat"" and to do better (even though he has 500 hrs in game and ranked the lowest you can be).Honestly I would rather watch Zombeavers than play a potentially great horror game.",Dead by Daylight

Developers listen to the community as they implemented the ""Survive with friends"" mechanicCons Could be repetitive for some people in that case you would feel the game costs much more then it should.

We've waited more than 20 minutes before giving up. If this was an early access title most of the problems could be forgiven. But it isn't.

2016-09-24,0,0,787,False,Not Recommended,A great game concept with a lot of unfortunate issues. Still plenty of fun to play when you get to play.If they ever fix matchmaking I would definitely recommend (latest patch indicated issues were resolved that were not. At least a step in the correct direction).11/13 Update I am still going to leave this as a negative review. Matchmaking is still ed however you can now play a game (it's just not going to be matched very well). The developers focus too much on introducing new content and doing cash grabs rather than fixing the game which is a very unfortunate thing. Still fun to play just a very much broken game that they show no intentions of fixing.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-27,0,0,631,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight has always been my favourite game to play there's always constant updates on the game to improve the game. For example the revamp of the blood web to have have lesser nodes and the choice within 2 perks instead of one. Really helpful update! The idea for survivors to have infinite health when being hooked the first time to encourage killer not to camp you is also a really good idea. I love Dead by Daylight hahaha,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-25,1,3,588,False,Not Recommended,This game was fun until the Devs decided to nerf survivors over and over along with buffing a Killer that was already overpowered. Unless you can play with friends then this game is definitely not for you. What was a fun game has turned into a broken bug riddled and biased game that will eventually die good riddance.

2018-07-25,1,1,130,False,Recommended,The game is fun the community what's ruining this game. Killers want to nerf Survivors to death and Survivors want to nerf Killers to death. In my opinion just remove all the perks and item add ons and maybe some offerings too. I really hope that the devs are not just buffing only killers/survivors and nerfing the other to death. The minor bugs in my opinion are funny so it's not that big of a problem but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be fixed. The game is fun overall and I really like to play the game I play for fun. Other people take the game too serious that's why they are just toxic as hell. Devs keep up the good work and don't listen to the community just play the game yourselves and balance the game by your choice.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-23,0,0,961,False,Recommended,Really a nice game. Original dark atmosphere fear and tension.Killer and Survivor can increase his powers just some matcihng problems (playing against characters with level more higher than you... really it's not easy) but you can see the current level of players in the lobby and you can leave for change it.Be a Killer is funny like to be the Survivor.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-23,0,0,104,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I played 11 hours of this game over the two days it was available for a free weekend. I love it. It's my favourite game and I dont even have it now but I definitely plan on getting it ASAP.The killers all have a unique killing tactic that the player can customise slightly and use in whatever way they want and though the survivors all start off with only different physical looks to each other with the exact same skills you can get a lot of different perks of different availability and ease of use leading up to their unique perks.I'm in love with the art style and gameplay as a whole though I do struggle against The Hag but oh well. It's an awesome game and I really do recommend getting it.Edit Having now bought the game it remains as my favourite. I've levelled up a lot and the game never ceases to get better in my opinion. I really think it's worth it. Anyways enjoy!,Dead by Daylight

When you reach a certain point in the game where most player knows the ""best places"" to run to when they see the killer this is where the game have completely broken. It is intended that the survivors must hide or work together to outwit the killer not just use ""infinite juke spots"" where it is quite impossible as killer to stop or catch the survivors.This makes the killer to suddenly completely miserable it is a bad section of ""Tom and Jarry"" a stupid hunter being ridiculed by a small mouse and it's not the one compares measurements with a dangerous killer.It makes me sad because it's a great game right up to this point and I would like to see it done otherwise I do not think it can develop more and probably ends when the other games in the same genre is released.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-30,0,0,248,False,Not Recommended,This game may be fun in concept but it is the most bug filled game I've ever seen. The way you get most out of it is just to screw around with your friends to have fun. Every other game you WILL find a bug that prevents you from doing something. YOU WILL find a killer that has likely over 300 latency that rubber bands your character all over the map. Devs WILL refuse to cater to the public opinion and refuse to balanced or patch things. It is so blatantly obvious that the devs wanted to cash in on some quick bucks with an unfinished game. It's fun if you have a group of 4 friends to play this game with. But if you're a solo player trying match making? I would never recommend this even with a gun pointing at me.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-26,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"No ai poor tutorials very little chance to start playing without everyone off.I can't recommend this game because I don't feel as though I'll ever have the chance to start playing without ruining it for everyone else. It feels like I'm trying to enter a club and I don't meet the proper requirements when I start. This would be less of a bother if I had ai bots to fail in front of a proper tutorial or at the very least a method of organizing players by their ranks so I'd fail as much as everyone else. This game has none of the above. (IF it does have a method of organizing players by rank then it seems awfully strange how everyone is already at their top ranks and nobody seems to be new to this at all considering how I was just dropped in the middle of expirienced players. Twice.) As a killer you can't just kill a survivor. You'll have to attack the survivor then drag his/her body to a meat hook HOPING that another survivor didn't break it all within a certain period of time. I've been told that you CAN kill a downed survivor if you can find a ""memento"" which I find to be completely rediculous. If you're a killer aren't you supposed to.....well kill people!?As a survivor fixing a generator requires a quicktime action. Because the developers will not have mentioned this ANYWHERE you will most likely fail the first time you touch a generator and either get slaughered because of it or hurt your team's chances at survival because of it.This isn't tf2 pd2 csgo etc. where you can fail in front of ai bots or recieve proper tutorials. This is a polished yet unfinished game that you have to pay for in more than one way. It MIGHT improve over time but as of now I wouldn't recommend you play it at all unless if you know 2 3 other people who also play it.If you want a good slasher game where you play as the killer I'd recommend ""Party Hard"". It's storyline is decent most of your attacks are stealthy and strategic and the best part You aren't expected to know what you're doing before you're supposed to know what you're doing.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-06,1,2,182,False,Recommended,Product received for free. The direction of the game is very well. I would definitely recommend it to people who love games with endless hours of playability and a new difficulty in every match. While there are lots of cons to this game such as no party system and hook camping the game is in early access. Pro tip If the killer is a hook camper continue to work on generators. As the hooked survivor is hanging and being camped you will have plenty of time to repair generators.Why should I buy this game? Dead by Daylight has unlimited playablility. While the objective is the same it never feels repetitive to me. Just like CSGO or any other game. If you want to sink your heart and soul into a game Dead by Daylight may be the game for you. What's to come? The developers are working on a party system as of this review and plan to add more maps items survivors and killers. The game in its current state is well priced and really worth it. Why should I believe you? Maybe you shouldn't. But give the game a go it's definitely worth your while. Most negative reviews are about the bugs but I find the bugs to not be that game ruining at all. Playtime as of review 47 hours,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-27,0,0,41,False,Not Recommended,The fact that the killer can leave mid game and cause you to loose a survivor rank is just idiotic and should have been fixed before they even released the ranking system in the first place... not happy with this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-27,0,0,1208,False,Recommended,"Alright. First check how many hours I've had in this game. That alone should be saying something. (I was job hunting and had plenty of time alas those days are over)I could write a 10 page review on this marvelous masterpiece but I will keep it short and sweet This is why you NEED to buy Dead by Daylight.Best 18 20 bucks I've spent in AWHILE. As a lifelong gamer I really can say this is a top 10 favorite.The pros ++ The music and sound effects alone make the experience literally get your heart beating faster. Hell I think it even boosts your metabolism because of how on edge you can become.+ The game looks pretty cool. I like the style of landcape etc. The maps they have now 3 main areas with smaller sub areas are incredible as they are now but there are still updates and new maps in the future. I've played easily over 100 matches and in 3 maps I can say with confidence that it has NOT gotten old. I'm really impressed as being someone who plays everything from Dark Souls to Elder Scrolls to Fallout.+ If you are like me and loved hide and seek and tag when you were a kid and also now you'll love this because basically this is a ""grown up"" version of that game.+ The team aspect is excellent. Banding together makes repairing healing and basically ensuring your survival a lot easier and it doesn't feel poorly done or forced. I usually like working alone but this game really makes the working with others aspect appealing.+ The items/loadout works very well. Plenty of offerings to put forward and the items available are straight to the point.+ The stealth aspect and hiding behind objects etc. works nearly flawlessly and the feeling you get when the killer runs RIGHT BY you is unparalleled.+ The multiplayer aspect plus the ability to play with friends makes it that much more entertaining.Negatives Several glitches even in the introductory part of the game while you are waiting in the lobby. That one can be overcome but then there's some really frustrating ones in game especially if the killer's internet is because you rubber band all over or it's choppy and there's lag delays. Although I love the 3 maps I would definitely say more maps would definitely not be out of the question.I'd love to answer any Qs you may have as I almost literally know this game inside out!",Dead by Daylight

2017-11-06,0,0,1016,False,Recommended,I do recommend this game but a little heads up. Its a huge grind fest. You will get trolled by killers and survivors And if you think getting a better rank will stop you from being tunneled and facecamped your wrong. lvls 15 to 10 is the more trolly killers they are on that brink where they still think rank matters and are super try hard.

2017-11-22,0,0,591,False,Recommended,Reccomending this game is very difficult. This game is loaded with gamebreaking bugs and glitches that can make it a frustrating experience. However if I was not frustrated I wouldn't care and this game is one of the best experiences I can have in steam. This game is not beginner friendly in the slightest but that just makes it so much more rewarding when you can finally escape the killer. The meta shifts greatly and currently I am not a fan of the whole pallet looping meta we got going on but that's okay. Constant new updates keep the game fresh as well as fix many issues with the game. Personally I liked daily rituals better when there was a big deal and you could get over 100 thousand bloodpoints but I guess it's okay. Overall this game is highly competitive and for good reason.

The night I purchased this I bought it along with four other friends and we played a few hours in a private group the issue came when one person left....We quickly realized that this game has no public match group support so you can solo q or well you can solo q. If you dont happen to have a full group of five people then you arn't even able to private q so basically you are unable to play with friends. More over not only can you not play with friends you can't even play with the community. Basically there are no redeeming social aspects to the game and for that I give it a huge thumbs down. I have read that the dev is ""working"" on making group play a real thing but before that they want to make sure people who drop out of games early are punished better. I don't understand why this game even has a ranking system or trys to promote any kind of e sports functions. If it was a lets try to survive a psycho killer with your friends that had all the fun and screams that I enjoyed with a full group of people then it would be a home run.

BUT i've been having loads of fun playing this game it's competitive it's a bit scary although you always want more! It just makes you feel so awesome when you survive or when you actually outsmart the survivors and sacrifice all of them.

2018-06-18,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"This is one of those times where I wish that Steam had a neutral setting I don't feel absolutely qualified to give the end all point of view on this game but I think the first look of a newcomer is a valuble perspective to look at.The game is an absolute thrill to jump onto with a group of friends and is the only way I can really recommend the game. From the menu screen to the perk tree from the game to the afterwards eveything is downright atmospherically creepy. The ""uneasy"" horror feeling is very well captured. Whether you're screaming and running from the killer or desperately fixing a generator the game succeeds in bringing out that heart pounding exhilaration of Outlast or Penumbra.However after a few hours you can already see the writing on the walls. The game takes itself a bit too seriously it seems. IMO this game is best as a scary casual experience but like with most games a few select people want it to be more than that. You might be a little noob laughing your off and running around aimlessly with your friends... The killer has over 500 hours of experience has mastered their character of choice has memorized every map layout knows all spawn location patterns all generator points etc. The game's counter to this is a constant balancing tweaking reworking everything from perks to villains. This again in turn supports the feeling that the game is trying to be something its not... some kind of actual competitive skill based gameplay for the few who take it way too seriously rather than the masses who just want fun.I will return in future dates with my friends and update my review accordingly I just hope they make the game more casual terror filled fun as opposed to a competitive wipe the floor meta experience )",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,110,False,Recommended,BRILLIANT AND FAVOURITE GAME!This is an extremely fun game to play with friends. In some cases it is okay to play online however you'll find barely any team mates will help you. Other than that this is a really good horror game!With the addition of Survive with friends it has made the game greatly better you can have hours of fun with your friends with a new experience each time.Additionally some of the killers are annoying *cough* the Wraith *cough* and many killers will just camp you on the hooks like they are babysitting you but everyone has their own play styleSome killers are actually quite cheeky and will team up with you and help you repair generators if you help them kick down barricades/ hit you a few times for points. GETTING INTO GAMESAs of patch 1.0.5 trying to get into games is absolutely horrible you could be sitting in a lobby getting 'no matches found' and then finding that the killer leaves because he is matched with high level players. KILLERS STOP BEING S.OPINIONSPersonally i get randomely taken off the game whilst normally playing due to unknown errors where a message is displayed asking why you were taken off the game which i suppose is good for the developers and their future enhancements.The ranking up system is slightly bad you have the skill tree level which is fantastic then the survivor/killer rank where you have to win numerous games in a row to rank up an XP system of some sort would be prefered (opinion)Again the game is really fun when managing to get into a game and i play i have much fun playing it for hours on end,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,2,4,247,False,Recommended,I don't really feel like I need to review this game. Because of its popularity by now everybody should know what they're buying.It's abit like hide and seek but the killer is always it. You're trapped in an area and need to fix generators to restore power to the door. Open the door to escape sounds pretty simple right? You already know anyway?The replayability of this isn't amazing. I can come back to it occasionally but as you can see I don't have masses of hours on record. Thats because its the same thing over and over. I would still recommend it though especially if you have a group of people that own it. A major downfall for a Twitch streamer is they also VERY TEDIOUSLY don't allow you to rank up in Custom games. If they don't want it to affect ranked they need to at least a seperate system so you actually have a goal or get benefits from playing games. I grew tired very quickly because I play with friends/viewers alot and no end game reward kills it. It's not even that hard to implement. Dev's if you're reading this just please.I'm not a ranked try hard. If I was I would probably say playing Ranked on a broken game would be way too stressful. I'm out on it completely. The glitches are REALLY f**king annoying and you can do really well but t**ts will just immediately leave when they get killed.I feel like the developers are working on this I recommend because of this. I know I've torn this game to pieces but they'll probably add more characters and alot of content. You know what its about you know what you're getting. If you're reading this you think it looks fun. Thats because it is (for a bit) its something you can go back to with friends occasionally when you're. Just be warned it needs alot of work.twitch.tv/LeftResponse#SellOut,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-24,0,0,2,False,Recommended,"After reading the reviews (yes even the bad ones) I decided to give the game a try. I'll address the popular negative review points.**BUGS** I haven't encountered a lot of bugs just one. Sometimes when i'm trying to crouch and move I just stop moving. And I'm not sure if it's my computer's problem or the map's. I have played all 3 maps and it happened in all of them.**LOBBY ERRORS**I had wait times of less than a minute connecting as a survivor you do get the ""failed to join lobby"" error but you just have to re click the ""join lobby"" until you get one. Never took me more than 2 clicks. I feel like the issue is mostly not enough killers (killers make lobbys) and too many survivors. Reading the reviews made it sound a lot worse than it actually was and this is at best a slight annoyance like seriously REALLY minscule. **PARTY GAMES**Devs are working on it and by their developer updates it seems like it's coming along swimmingly. Honestly I don't have anyone else to even play with so this is not a deal breaker for me. **BETA VS FULL RELEASE**As I did not have access to the beta I cannot really comment on this The only issues I kinda have with this full realease I wish there were more maps survivors and killers. Hopefully more will be coming I haven't heard anything about that.Whew! Now that we got the main complaints out of the way. Let's talk...**GAMEPLAY**I actually had a lot of fun with this. The soundtrack is great and the mechanics are awesome. Fortunately I didn't deal with any window chessing people rage quiting and my rank managed to stay inttact. Playing as a survivor is actually wikcked fun and it's actually stressful. You can't attack but you can outsmart Just be aware of your surroundings As a killer you have awesome traps and abilities. **IN CONCLUSION**This game has great gameplay and if you're willing to do a few clicks to join a lobby then this game is for you. Definitely worth it hopefully it will improve with future patches.",Dead by Daylight

I know you said you aren't doing anything about camping after it being abused but at least try no matter how much abuse it gets. Make that 15% that are fair and play the game normally happy and try. If not your game may die from F13 (it unlikely but it's always possible).Or another thing pallet looping or sitting at pallets. Bloodlust helps a chase end quicker but they can fall into a pallet looper's tricks even easier now and get stunned over and over and OVER! I have an idea to stop this or at least make it harder for those who sit around make it so only a pallet can be dropped while running.There are many other things I could complain about but i would be sitting here for hours.Please BHVR step up your game with this.

2016-07-08,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,"I really want to love this game. It has a ton of potential and really hits a niche really well. It falls short in the execution however. Things I wish I'd known before I purchased Skill Tree. Sounds REALLY fun BUT (there are so many ""buts"" when describing good parts of this game) you can only earn bloodpoints (which you spend on skills) in public matches. However you can't queue for public matches with your friends. So your options are 1) Be able to take advantage of the skill tree and improve your character 2) Play with your friends. Not both. Honestly I wish I would have known that when I purchased because I would have waited for it to be added.Load times. Holy hell. After you wait about 5 minutes to finally put together a group due to people constantly jumping in and out of lobbies (if you and a friend both enter a quick play game at the same time you have a chance of both being entered into the same lobby so people are CONSTANTLY trying to do this) you hit the loading screen for a good 2 minutes before the game finally starts.Balancing....or lack there of. Let me tell you how a typical game goes as a survivor. Killer will eventually find you he grabs you puts you on a hook killer camps your body. One of two things happens now. 1) You die because no one saves you. 2) Someone saves you but the killer immediately hits you and you puts you right back on the hook and then you die immediately. Neat.Between the glitches the horrible mechanics around punishing (or not punishing) for DCs (this has been mostly addressed it seems but should have been done and perfected during beta) and the skill tree nonsense I outlined above (how hard would it be to have a ranked and unranked skill tree?) I can't recommend this. These are the problems I'd expect from a beta or an early access game not a full release.All that being said I do think this game can be good given the amount of effort they appear to be giving after release so assuming the updates keep coming and we either get a way to have an unranked skill tree or the ability to queue for ranked games with friends I'll update this review.",Dead by Daylight

I don't have an issue with any of them really. What I do have an issue with is bloodlust III. It is an inevitable down. Doctors add ons give him far too much reach which is why players dc the second they see he is the killer.Other Fixes pallet drops on killers holding victims... the killers aren't dropping victims when they are flashlighted AND blinded or when a pallet is dropped on them. This is a major bug. Also 99% sabotaging hooks and then having to start them all over again... this has killed me several times in my mose recent games. It seems to be a bug. Also unhooking from all directions needs to be fixed so it actually works.... or even just take it out I ve noticed it encourages camping even more than the encouragement it had before. Also the NEW POINTS SYSTEM... No One likes the 2 hooks for everyone and one kill or 2 kills for pip system... we'd rather have to get x amount of points.Aesthetic things If it looks like I can fit through the space between a damn tree and a rock I should be able to run in the space between the tree and rock or whatever the hell I m trying to fit in between. This has caused many deaths and not all of them are my own. DUDE I VE A SEEN A SET OF TIRES SPAWN IN FRONT OF A CHEST!!!!!! That means ithe chest can't be opened! &lt Fix thisAlso face camping is very encouraged as of late... which is anooying when the new hooks aren't working.And not enforcing the rules by banning or suspending players or deducting blood points or anything of the sort that may be used as punishment for cheating or unsportsmanlike playing is building a pretty toxic community. Where in end game chat we read things like ""blah blah blah"" ""u salty idiot"" ""moron"" and then the person talking to you dc's before you have a chance to ask if something like if the game was bugged or if they were cheating because a totem they didn't play just happened to be in the game. DBD really needs to start enforcing rules and looking into/at reports and gameplay to see which players should be banned/punished even if for a short period of time.

Everytime I was put on a hook ""Well the killer clearly sees my teammates getting ready to unhook me and then decides to either face camp or bait my teamates into thinking the killer didn't see them as they ""walk off""... ""Hey trapper I can clearly see you sitting in that bright corner."" That too killers think they're the smartist in the world will guess YOU'RE NOT!

I pored over 1 000 hours into this game as well as my salt sweat and money for these ing devs to release dlc and too neverf patch bugs. I've never in my ing life wanted glitches and bugs to be fixed.

2017-11-02,0,0,954,False,Recommended,"This game is an amazingly fun game even more fun if you find and play with friends. For the time I have played I loved this game as a challenging and competetive game. The base of the gameplay is that you can choose to play either Killer or Survivor. If you select Killer you host a match. There is one Killer in a round and 4 survivors your objective as a killer is to kill or sacrifice the remaining survivors to please the entity (A mysterious spider like being) If you select survivor you are placed in a lobby created by the killer. The objective as the survivor is to communicate with other team mates to survive. To escape the wretched entity's trial you must fix 5 generators to do so it takes about 2 3 minutes to fix one gennerator. While fixing a generator a minigame called ""skillchecks"" randomly apear if you hit the skillcheck in the white or outlined area you pass the skillcheck with no problem if you hit it in the white area you get a little boost in repairing however if you miss the skill check by hitting it too early or too late it notifies the killer visually and gives away your possition. Once you repaired all the generators you have to open an exit gate. The exit gates are revealed to all survivors for a prior amount of time however the killer can see it for ever. to open the gates there is a lever you must take about 15 30 seconds holding the lever down to open the gate. Once opened you are able to escape. That was the base point of the game as a survivor the killer must hit you 2 times to be able to put you on a hook. The killer is able to grab you from generators or other obstacles to automaticaly be able to hook you. Team mates are able to heal you and unhook you. One of the best ways of escaping the killer is to hide or use Pallets flashlights or faking out to slug the killer. As the killer you have a ""Power"" using this ""Power"" allows you to catch the survivors easily. I love that every killer has a unique power.One thing that i wouldn't like for them to continue is that they keep adding popular Horror movie killers. Don't get me wrong it is amazing and fun to play them but i would like a bit of originality like the huntress or hag. But over all I extremely suggest this game.

2018-07-25,0,0,641,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is flawed but extremely addicting and fun.The flow of gameplay can make for some tense moments in gameplay. Though if you're goint into it to be scared I think you'll be disapointed. Each killer has a unique and interesting ability to shake up gameplay. However with each new patch new bugs are introduced which can take you out of the experience very quickly. On top of that the fanbase can be very toxic on both sides which can often detract from the experience both in the game and on the forums. For example Many people complain about Killers not being strong enough so when the devs try to buff them people move on to freaking out about the buff making the game unplayable.The game isn't going to be for everyone but despite its myriad of problems I wholeheartedly recommend it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-17,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A review Comparing DbD to Friday the 13th The Game. (Since these two fanbases butt heads a lot and draw comparisons constantly)It's a solid experience but Dead by Daylight just isn't scary to me. It feels too much like a video game and not enough like a horror movie. If that makes sense?Like I played DbD and found it to be tense but less in the fun way more in the game y way. I don't like how you have to hang people on hooks and a big monster comes from the sky. That all seems less scary and more silly to me. I don't enjoy that it feels like a game show with an arena and clear exits that need power to open. I don't like the consumable items that carry between rounds. That also detracts from immersion for me. I wanna feel like I'm seriously being hunted. Friday the 13th The Game even in Beta accomplished that for me.So for the kind of game I want F13 just fits better. It's my style. I like slower more methodical games and DbD is far from that in my experience. I love how many different kills there are and how visceral it feels and I adore the lighting in the game too. It just feels right to me.So in my opinion even though the beta was totally buggy the core mechanics are so strong that it remained fun to play despite it's glitchiness. That instills a lot of confidence in me as a customer.I just feel acutely aware that I'm playing a video game with DbD. I don't want to feel that way. I need to get pulled into the world. However all that said DbD is still a solid game and worth taking a look. I wouldn't say it's bad. That's why I still recommend it. Overall while not my speed I don't think it's a bad game. I can see what people love about it. It's just those same things they love I am not so keen on. But that doesn't make this a bad product. Give it a try! See for yourself if you enjoy this approach to Asymetrical MP horror.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-07,1,1,131,False,Recommended,"The game is in full swing and the game is really enjoyable however people will abuse the killers powers which makes the game lose its enjoyment. The game mechanics still need to be edited to where killers and survivors are on an equal playing field when all survivors are working togehter. I am not high ranking but I have noticed that most killers abuse their abiltites and some even use other glitchy methods to their advantage. I enjoy the concept and love the games design but further editing to the killers functions needs to be a neccessity and survivor teamwork needs to be buffed. My recomendation would be to add in a stamina meter for both the surviors and killers. This would mean that vaulting and putting down barricades wears down your stamina than just sincerely running away from the killer. The killer holding onto survivors will slow down when holding onto to them and will have to plan out attacks as stamina recovery for killers for each kill goes down each time. I feel if these last few changes are added in the game will be at its completion and I do believe revisory of certain perks are needed on both sides so that way ""everyone"" can be on a equal playing field.",Dead by Daylight

That's just a bonus. (Fun fact Play the hag if you REALLY want to off the survivors.) The perk system feels rewarding as each perk can provide a large advantage to it's user survivor and killer alike.

You start out with absolutely nothing and you'll end up paired with an experienced player with several perks and offerings. There isn't any form of balanced matchmaking because the developers don't seem to understand balance. On multiple occasions you will run into a killer who camps the hooks for XP making who ever comes near his next victum. If you aren't lucky your teammates will be trash and not attemt to help others but rather run around the map doing their own thing.

Killers are pretty overpowered and getting away from them is nearly impossible. With that being said i enjoy the challenge of being a survivor and 4 vs 1 definitely has its perks if you're playing with people who know what they're doing. The other thing that i would say causes this game to lose a star is the DLC. Why charge extra money every time you make something new for the game...

2017-10-07,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,Hide and seek... I mean Dead by Daylight is horror survival attempt that matches 4 players (survivors) against one (the killer). The players have a few cosmetic options and they can start the match with a selection of perks an item (if they are survivors) and loadouts for that said item (or their special ability in the killer's case) and each player can burn 1 offering that can alter the map give them point boosts at the end or some advantages during the match. Survivors have to repair 5 generators and then they can open one of the 2 exit gates (or both) and escape while the killer has to put them down and hook them in order to sacrifice them to the Entity.The outcome of the game is decided like this 1) If the killer has the execution offering he has 100% chance of winning. Only the last survivor standing can escape using the hatch (a secret exit which appears when the first 2 generators are repaired and opens when there's only one survivor left alive) and that still counts as a win for the killer.2) 60% map layout. If generators are close to each other the killer wins. If they are out in the open the killer wins. If not survivors have a good chance of escaping. And if the map has a decent amount of pallets walls windows and cornfields and the generators are not close to each other then it becomes rather easy to escape without even being spotted by the killer.3) 30% perks loadouts and offerings (besides the execution one). There are killer perks that greatly decrease the killer's terror radius (a survivor's strongest help in being aware of the killer's presence) perks that greatly increase the killer's FOV essentially making killers incredibly harder to escape and to hide from. Survivors have some handy perks such as self healing sabotaging without toolboxes walking twice as fast while crouching and short movement burst which really don't help much if the killer is decent enough to read your scratch marks which leads to &gt 4) 10% player skill the killer's skill in particular. There are some jukes you can perform to confuse the killer and escape from his LOS unless he has one of the 2 perks that increase your FOV if he has the frequent bleeding perk on a lit map... or if he doesn't play with his volume turned off and he actually listens to the sound FX.A good killer who's paying attention will NEVER fail to catch a survivor this is how this game is designed. A survivor running around leaves so many traces the scratch marks being the most over powered innate perk that every killer has. If you don't run away you will be caught very quickly and if you do you will still be caught in part due to the trail that tells the killer exactly where you went but hey you'll buy some time at least. The trail is really messy and easy to spot by the killer. It can be used to a survivor's advantage on a dumber killer and it will even work on a skilled one if you do the trick while out of his line of sight but if you've already been hit by the killer once it's over. Your character's regular moans will destroy your chances of escaping and all you can hope for is that the killer is deaf. Considering how the first hit is free most of the time a killer starts chasing you thanks to this game's limited means for a slow survivor to get away from a speedy killer you can guess the outcome of most chases in this game.Playing against a low level killer is a fun experience I don't find anything more rewarding in this game than escaping from a killer especially when you have no idea how he passed by without noticing you. But against any decent killer it comes down to hiding as well as you can and rescuing survivors and being rescued unless... you know... (1)Playing as a killer is simple. You can win without using any special abilities unless the map favors the survivors. Perks are not much of a factor except for the 2 types mentioned above which make the game excessively one sided as they negate/ any advantages a survivor has over the killer (the FOV and the ability to sense when a killer is near). The map can often obstruct a killer's sight but it can also obstruct a survivor's movement making the game more of a hide and seek. Skyping with your friends as a survivor while matching together can make things A LOT easier and while not that common in lower rank play it turns things entirely on the survivors' side giving the killer a game breaking experience. If you hook a survivor and camp him/her you will end up with at least 3 generators done if you don't camp the survivors he's absolutely going to be freed in no time.To conclude things I find DBD to be an unbalanced game. While this can spice things up at first it quickly becomes a nuisance.I'd only recommend this game if you have a group of friends to play with as a team or if you like to play as a killer out of a horror movie. I might be a bit harsh because this game failed to deliver what I expected from it. In a few words I can describe Dead by Daylight as acomplex hide and seek,Dead by Daylight

Dead by Daylight has been an awesome experience that I'm still enjoying and will continue enjoying for months to come. First off here is what bothers me (and almost everyone else too) The connection when getting chased by the killer will almost garuntee that if you hop through a wall and the killer swings at you youre probably going to take a hit even though you're well past the wall. This is aparently because the game is hosted by the killer when you're in the lobby. So you as the survivor you need to take that knowledge onto the field and attempt to escape another way if you think that youre going to get screwed going through a window. WITH THAT BEING SAID. I love this game. Almost every game I enter my heart starts beating and the adrenaline rush hits me. You probably wont be good at this game for a day or two until you grasp some of the main functions of escaping the killers grasp. Like hiding breaking the running marks enough to confuse the killer using your perks the correct way and applying team work when you cannot communicate with the other survivors.The maps have some of the same looks but theyre all each procedurally generated so nothing is usually exactly the same. This witholds both the killer and the survivors the ""home field advantage."" However if you play the game enough youll begin to learn how to out manouver the killer so that youll have just enough time to make a quick getaway. Each killer has their own special ability so you'll get to learn how they each function and how to best beat them. The same thing goes for the survivors. Everyone has their own thing that will help out their teamates and make it about teamwork. All in all I'd give this game an 8 out of 10. Try it out with a friend. It's a lot better than playing solo.",Dead by Daylight

2017-01-30,0,0,1244,False,Recommended,My first rewiew so bare with me.This is a really fun game and simple enough.Four survivals trying to get out of a compound and a killer that are trying to slaughter them. You can choose several killers (like Mike Myers or a crazy hillbilly with a chainsaw) and several survivals depending on your preference. The leveling system is easy. You get bloodpoints for winning or loosing but of course more for winning. You spend them on perks skills offerings and some items that you use in game. At the same time the more bloodpoints you spend the higher level you get 50 is max level. The more games you win the lower rank you get starting at 20 (lowest) and max is numero uno (highest).Play solo or with friends. I d say that its a bit more fun to play with friends but unfortunatly i dont have that many friends playing this game so its more solo for me still very funny.Now to the sad part the game is buggy. It gets better all the time with patches but still buggy. I cant play survival without playing a killer game first! and i cant play two games in a row as a survival. As a killer there is no problem so i mostly play killer. Its a bit sad because it would be fun to mix more between killer and survival.If you can endure these bugs this game is a diamond in the rough. As i said earlier the game gets better with each patch. Enough? I dont know only you can decide that.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-30,0,0,436,False,Recommended,"It takes some time to figure out which killer suits you best in order to have fun as killer. I started out as the Wraith (Dude with bell that goes invisible) and Hag (Green small female killer long arms) only to find out that I have most fun with the trapper (Bear trap killer)FRIENDLY / SALTY INGAME COMMUNITY? The community is pretty much as salty in the game itself as people complain about on the forums. I often see killers and both survivors ""gg"" ""nice teamwork ""nice chase"" after a completed game. But the overflow of ""ez game"" ""trash killer "" ""camping TFUZGUZ"" "" )&amp (? Killer"" on the survivor's side massively overshadows all of that.People tend to complain about camping killers or looping survivors. Survivors can be cocky at times. Like all 4 survivors sitting in front of the exit gate until they see the killer approach and then escape together. Just to let the killer see how they all escape into his face. Then after the match write ""Easy"".Even tho I am a Survivor Main I would say that its the survivors that try to abuse the game more often when at the same time getting really salty on the killers. These things started happening to me when I got past rank 15. So a little bit later in the game like 30hours gameplay.NOTE the devs say camping is a valid strategy surivors should do gens when the killer wants to stay at the hook forever. after all it takes 3 minutes to get a survivor from 1st stage to entity summoned. STEAM COMMUNITYI like to send out friend requests to killers/survivors whose gameplay i like have a chitchat on steam and then play together for a while. People really appreciate friend requests as noone wants to play alone on survivor after all. In case that the team and killer are more or less equally skilled it comes down to the map offerings (more fog less fog spawn close to each other which the players use before they spawn into the map.Offernigs do help like they are supposed to however they totally dont win the game by default. BALANCE?The gameplay feels balanced a good killer will own an averge team a good team will own an average killer. Some maps however are quite disadvantageous for killers i m referrring to the Kornfield Maps. However one map is really bad for survivors being The Game. BEING SURVIVOROverall the game feels tense and scary/panicy when the killer owns but controlled/collected when the team owns on survivor mode. Monolog on survivor is sth like this"" f f f f f f f ff f ! ! ! "" ""where is he where is he where is he??????"" ORhe hehe he he second generator doooOOOne biaches! Ok LETS DO THIS!BEING THE KILLERwhereas the killer s gameplay feels fun and exciting when winning or frustrating when failing.HOWEVER! I personally only feel frustrated on killer when i didnt hook a single player. Killing one or more for me is already like a win and the game gives you as killer the most points overall just for chasing injuring and hooking (without en doing the actual kill). Being a killer that doesnt really camp a lot survivors often compliment the match with a ""gg"" ""nice killer gameplay nice chase"" which lightens up my mood even if the scoreboard doesnt.YOUTUBEI watched about 40hours of gameplay on youtube before i decided to purchase the game having seen most of the content before playing it myself didnt take any of the fun away in my opinion.You might think that you always do the same stuff and you basically do. Its your job to do generatos get to exit escape. however there is so much happening inbetween that it does not feel the same. The haste of the match is decided by the kind of killer you encounter the teammates and the map. DLCs Next to that we got many DLCs which are not exactly cheap but 100% not required to play the game. You can access dlc maps without having it purchased you also fight the dlc killers and survivors. the dlc only restricts you into not being able to play the dlc killer/survivor yourself. You can even get the DLC content specific skills/perks by the shrine which resets every 7 days.",Dead by Daylight

While in the first week or two when it was the 3 killers and 4 survivors to choose from I played this game for hours upon hours now I can't play it for more than a single match or two. In its current form it's grown far too much for its own good and this is a classic case of ""Less is more."" With each new killer/character they release comes new perks that can be learned through the Bloodweb which sounds great in theory being that new content is usually a welcome thing in the gaming universe. In my personal opinion all this does is break the balance that game was capable of in the early stages add convoluted new systems and even more potential for perk abuse. Which leads to my next point.The community of this game is the most toxic community I've ever seen next to League of Legends. It's a constant ""Us vs Them"" mentality between Killer mains and Survivor mains where both sides do nothing but cry and complain about broken perks abuse of abilities and how easy the other side has it. As someone who has played both killer and survivor my personal opinion is thus. With respawning hooks to negate sabotage more hooks on the map ability to kick generators being added killers have such a distinct advantage that it's actually boring to play as killer because winning every game only stays fun for so long... and as survivor unless you're playing against a killer who has literally never played before it's going to be fairly uncommon to actually win in the conventional way.TLDR Unbalanced gameplay toxic community too much content to allow for balance and a fanbase too divided to ever allow a happy medium.

2016-06-25,0,0,200,False,Recommended,If you like old horror films or enjoy a good rush of adrenaline this should be a game that you'll enjoy. There are plenty of killers to pick from multiple survivors with their own unique perks and a plethora of levels with varied design to entertain yourself with. That being said the community is quite hit or miss and the game itself can be buggy at times. The lobby is one of my major complaints about this game. Half the time it'll join a game only to kick me out and make me re search for another lobby. This is only one of the many problems I've had with this game. Surviving with friends is damn near impossible to get into a lobby for some random reason. (See Edit below)But those issues aside the gameplay is solid and it's good for short bursts or long sessions. It can be something you can lose yourself in.Overall I'd say try it out for the price. Play a game or two to see if you like it. If not refunding is always an option.Edit The lobby issues have since been fixed (including Survive with Friends) since this review and the bugs are less prevalent.

2017-02-01,1,2,253,False,Recommended,"UPDATED REVIEW I wrote the bulk of this back in February '17 and things have changed since then. Check the bottom for the updated parts. If you read through the negative reviews for Dead by Daylight you'll generally find two things genuine complaints about the bugs and people who simply aren't good at the game talking about how this Killer or that Survivor perk is ""broken"" or ""nerfed.""Let's be real for a moment Lots and I mean lots of people are just bad at this game. You'll see them trust me. They either can't learn to work as a part of a team (or can't find others who try which is only a real problem at the lower ranks with all the other newbies) or they don't have the stuff to take down a team on their own. So to start don't pay attention to these particular complaints. They are made by people who as the kids say suck at either specific aspects of the game or the game as a whole.CONS Now on to credible cons. The bugs too often render the game unplayable. I'm looking at you loading screen bug. If you're like me and used to playing buggy games this will be tolerable for you I mean having to exit the game several times and reboot it is by no means an issue to people who make a habit of playing games in their alphas we're almost surprised when we *don't* ever have to relaunch a game. If you don't like the waiting you may struggle with this and that would be a valid reason to avoid Dead by Daylight. Until such a time as the developers finally fix this issue (among others of course) I expect and encourage a lot of complaining about the loading screen bug.Sometimes you'll get put in a lobby with someone either way above or way below your rank. It happens. You'll get butchered by a rank 4 Killer (who isn't really enjoying it either mind you you're too easy) and you'll make a far too easy getaway from a rank 19 Killer who hasn't yet learned how to look in the bushes. This is frustrating for everyone in the lobby and you'll probably catch some flak for it if you were the one misplaced the Survivors in particular (usually ranks 15 10 the ones who have gotten good at the game and are still in their angsty phase of play where they think everyone else sucks and should be told so) can be a salty bunch.More often than you'll probably like you'll get put in a lobby with an Old McDonald's WiFi Killer and you'll lag badly enough that you'll either die because of it or be disconnected entirely. Yeah it's frustrating but that happens in any multiplayer game hosted by one of the players. Somehow people seem to attribute this flaw to Dead by Daylight in particular which is absurd. That being said dedicated servers should they ever become available for the game would be fantastic and that's the half of this complaint that is completely valid.PROS Now that we've addressed the major cons of the game let's look at some of the pros. The way the leveling system works at its core is that you gain points and ranks based on how many points you scored in a match. There's four ways for Survivors and four ways for Killers to get these points. That on its own is a fairly basic and simple system. The part of this system that makes the game great is *what* those ways to get points are. For example as a Survivor you gain points towards leveling by assisting saving or even just being near your fellow Survivors. You make progress in the game by helping each other a seamlessly introduced method of encouraging players to stick together. As a Killer you get points from using your chosen Killer's special power (chainsaw short range teleporting etc.) meaning that you're inherently going to level up as certain Killers better than others you do in fact make a special kind of progress by playing to your strengths. Speaking of leveling while your rank is static across all the different Survivors and all the different Killers each specific member of each group is counted and leveled individually. This means that most of the time a Jake Park player is a Jake Park player that's who you're good at that's who you play. It leaves room for diversity among players because it's not as simple as ""this one does more damage so naturally everyone plays him."" There's no one Survivor or Killer that's better than the next they're all unique in some way and they all play to different types of players' styles and tastes.Finally as a horror game enthusiast when I initially played Dead by Daylight I found that the fear that accompanies hiding from a monster that isn't an AI that is in fact another person was far more satisfying than waiting for the programmed beastie to finish its programmed patrol and move on when I knew it was safe. You can't predict a Killer as easily as that because it's not nearly as easy to know what they're doing. Are they really gone or did they take a few steps away to wait for you to come out? Is he revving up that chainsaw because he actually did see you or is he just trying to scare you out of hiding? Do you stay or do you go? As I played on of course this fear eventually left me. But it didn't fade away it transformed into strategy. I'm not playing a game trying to figure out the patterns of the AI monster I'm trying to either outsmart and outrun or outsmart and run down another person. This dynamic may not be as prevelant at the lower ranks which is natural given that at lower ranks players simply aren't as experienced but should you stick to the game long enough you'll find a unique kind of game that you're going to love just as much at rank 1 as you did at rank 20 if you're anything like me. tl dr If you can't handle bugs waiting and lag this game probably isn't for you. If you're prone to outrage when someone's better at a game than you this game probably isn't for you. If you can appreciate strategy skill and teamwork this game is for you. 8/10 do recommend.UPDATE Dead by Daylight is an ever growing ever changing game. And it's changed a lot since I started playing and since I wrote this review. Lots of new killers and survivors new maps new perks updates to the way things used to work... I won't get into specifics but one thing you can definitely count on is that this game is not a stagnant one. It's still evolving and it's still improving. The community however has overall gotten much saltier since last writing. That's something that can't really be helped by the developers or by other players it just is. All of this being said I've found that the longer one plays Dead by Daylight the *more* hooked one becomes. It's not a game where playing for the first 100 hours is the highlight and it fades from attention after that. In fact you don't even really begin to understand the game until you're much further in. At 171 hours I know enough to stay alive and kill people a lot more efficiently than I used to but I'm still a rookie compared to some of the people that play this game with 500 1 000 3 000 hours logged. If you're looking for a game that'll stick with you as long as you stick with it this is the place to be.Score remains at 8/10.",Dead by Daylight

I don't want to come against rank 1 Killers as a rank 20 survivor after my 3rd game / And getting pulled out of windows after you've already done the animation and you're clearly out of the window already is something that needs work,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,0,0,5,False,Recommended,So after watching some guys on YouTube play this game and looking like they were having a total blast I decided I could risk the seventeen dollar price. So I'll do a pros and cons thing first and then tell my experiences as survivors and killers.Pros Fantastic premise for a game. Four almost defenseless survivors against one bloodthirsty killer. Love it! It's been quite some time that a game has gotten me this immersed. Like when I'm mere seconds from completeing a goal as a survivor and the killer is coming at me at full speed makes me heart pound. Getting to slaughter a group of young adults in a brutal fashion is a blast.Cons Rampant Disconnection. My very first game had the killer disconnect and shut down the match because us survivors were already opening the exits and he hadn't even injured a single one of us. This has happened about a total of three times out of about ten games. I've noticed a few surivors on my team as well disconnect the moment they realize that we couldn't save them. Only about two times for this. From the forums this looks to be a massive loophole that helps save a players useable items and rank. Devs said they have fixed this. It's not scary. It gets my heart beating from some close calls but I've never been scared. I'd blame this on the 3rd person view survivors always have. Now I almost want to give this a pass since this is first and foremost a multiplayer game survivors need to have 3rd person to survive. The maps are kinda randomly made but not enough to notice any difference. AKA not something that should be advertised as a feature.P.S. These are just issues I have noticed. As a killer I never had a survivor make use of a multiple windows to avoid me forever something a lot of people have brought up. Same goes for Killer perks being useless and survivors being OP.Now onto my little tales.As a survivor I've had multiple close calls. Like I mentioned above opening the gate to escape with only two seconds left until it opens and having the killer be in full site coming at me full speed. These moments are awesome. As are the times you are running for your life with the killer right behind you. Or even hiding in a cabinet as the killer wanders by hoping he doesn't decide to search for you. The only survivor I've played as is Dwight.As for Killers I've done Trapper and Hillbilly. As Trapper it is so fun to lay a perfectly hidden trap and then watch a survivor get caught as they try to save their team. Hillbilly... well I sucked as him. Big time. All four survivors got away and I only hooked one and didn't land a single chainsaw attack. Overall you feel super powerful knowing that the survivors can do barely anything to stop you. TL DR From my experience this game has been a blast. It's intense as a survivor and brutally fun as a killer. For me the sheer amount of fun I've gotten from my short experience is enough to make me feel safe in my purchase.,Dead by Daylight

It would'nt let me join any games and when it did i would get kicked out secounds before the match started. Also during a match if i was caught or someone else was and we were rescued or had escaped. That person would still be floating up in the air as if he/she were still hanging. Alot of killers that i have encountered tended to camp with the cloak guy. Which could get boring and annoying after a couple games. But besides that and some lag it can be really fun.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-03,0,0,19,False,Not Recommended,Interesting concept but terribly executed. Aside from the large number of glitches terrible netcode and broken matchmaking there isn't any replayability. Every match is identical from the maps themselves and especially at lower levels the killer strategy is the same every time put someone on a hook and sit there. It's a guaranteed win for the survivors if they ignore them which they never do if they're PUGs because there is no way to communicate but it makes the game boring for both sides regardless of what happens. The maps are barely distinguishable and your survival hinges solely on if you're lucky enough to be near an abusable infinite use window hopping back and forth because the killer so vastly outspeeds you and kills you in at most two hits. This might change at higher levels with perks but there is no incentive to put in the hundreds of hours to get to this point so its largely irrelevant.,Dead by Daylight
2018-02-14,0,0,649,False,Not Recommended,For few first games its fun till you start to notice everyone has all the most powerful perks.It doesnt even matter whether how skillful or not you are. Because you will get defeaten (survivor or killer) because you just cant do anything to assist teammates or to finish any players off.That said add a gamemode where perks are completely removed or just remove and remake at least 80% of the perks.Also looping is t bloodlust doesnt work game is unfair.,Dead by Daylight

There is no point in trying to evade the killer as hacking is rife in this game and the devs refuse to do anything about it. In fact apart from making new events this game is now pretty much abandonware. Also software issues and design flaws these happen a lot. One of the most amusing is when half the team crashes. All that nice shiny rare loot you took into the game? Prepare to lose it because only 2 survivors made it into the game (if you die you lose anything you take in) and there is no way you are going to defeat the killer with half a team.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-17,1,2,57,False,Not Recommended,Part 4 Another post update review. I'd once again like to commend the developers for being total . Instead of working on matchingmaking services like any sane game designer would do they decided it was more important to release another killer and provide useless scaling patches in order to undo the damages that they did with the previous ones. Only in Dead by would a person decide that having your users play a ready up simulator for 45 minutes prior to getting a game with friends is a praise worthy event. Part 3 Re updating my review again. I'd like to add that after multiple updates the match making system is worse than ever. Not only is it nearly impossible to get into a match but when you do you get put against the who have been playing this game since its conception. If sitting around for 30 minutes without a game trying to queue with your friends prior to getting skull ed is for you buy this game.Part 2 Improving my review from to mediocre. The group matchmaking now actually works in the sense that if you wish to be placed against people that consistantly butt you without any type of lube. Thanks for placing a new player against chodes that have been playing the beta for more cumulative time than they've seen any woman except for their mother.,Dead by Daylight

While this was frustrating before it could be worked around by grabbing generators while the killer was distracted. Newest killer however has the ability to set traps that grant vision and teleportation to any 10 areas on the map. This gives her the ability to camp multiple locations at the same time. The downside to this omnipresence? N/A.",Dead by Daylight
2017-10-04,0,0,344,False,Recommended,Game is very very cool but as of now it's unbalanced. I'm a survivor main but recently I've started to lose more and more games and I've tried to play killer for fun (and to try to understand why I'm doing this bad right now). Reason is simple game is easier for killers by far. I use the Huntress with only 1 perk (and a bad one) against a premade team of a rank 4 rank 6 rank 7 and rank 17 survivor as a rank 17 Huntress. They all have perks yet I still managed to sacrifice all 4 of them rather easily. No perk practically no experience as a killer vs a team of organised and kindof experienced survivors with good perks and yet I still destroy them happened more than once. Now imagine if I was not colorblind and could actually see and follow the trail survivors leave behind them while running had experience as a killer and ran some op perks like whispers... I agree with the people that claim survivors are 4 vs 1 and should have a hard time escaping but now this is ridicoulous as a survivor there is almost no way to escape the killer because there is less pallets than before killer breaks them faster and killer vaults through windows too fast for me to lose him. If I go fast he just follows the trail I leave behind me. If I go slow I don't have enought distance to break the line of sight. Winrate as a survivor is less than 50% and winrate as a killer is more than 70% (3 or more sacrifices).TLDR Would I reccomend the game absolutely even with the lack of balancing there is still plenty of room for fun ESPECIALLY with friends and the game is totally worth his pricePS sorry english isn't my first language my grammar and/or orthograph may be very bad,Dead by Daylight

Either way loads of fun.And the developers are awesome! The put out a weekly podcast to let the players know what they are working on next. They are always looking for ways to improve the game and have a real passion for making this game great.

2016-08-06,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,I will start off by saying that this is a fun game you play as a killer hit survivors to down them then hang their bodies on hooks to sacrifice them or play as a survivor and work on generators to get an exit open to escape while avoiding the killer but that fun is soon sapped out of the game when you run into these flaws.1. Continual window hopping survivors. Now to be fair they have tried to address this issue but it's still an issue every map has at least 1 spot that survivors can run around in an infinite circles and it becomes a game of who's going to mess up first. Only problem is you wil get survivors who will not mess up and now you have to give up and go check generators or if all generators are done you have to wait for them to make a run for the exit. Which could be in 10 minutes or 30 minutes how ever long they feel like or until they mess up. 2. TERRIBLE MATCHMAKING. As a survivor or killer I was constantly matched against killers/survivors who were 20 30 even as high as 40 levels higher then me. Now for those of you who don't own this game what this means is im running around against a killer or multiple survivors who have high level perks which will buff them and assist them in some wayand they have multiple of these perks dues to their high level while you have 1 perk available and its a low level common perk. So let paint the picture for you your the killer level 10 rank 20 you get matched against 4 survivors level 30 35 32 45 you have 1 perk you can use say sloppy butcher ( makes them bleed more when you hit them) they all have 4 perks at their disposal lets say one has Saboteur (can disable your hooks and destory traps) and some other ultra rare perks to your common perk. You start the match finally knock down survivors to find there's no hooks nearby (due to saboteur) to hang them on and the nearest one is so far away that they can wiggle free from your grasp before you get there. Annoying huh? especially when all this could be avoided by matching you against players of a similar skill instead of throwing you in a blender against the best of the best as a new player.Now some things to mention these problems could change and some of these problems could be addressed in the future but I would avoid this game until then. Now some people may be fine with grinding and being used as a punching bag to higher rank players until they can level up and rank up themselves but im not if your fine with it then you may not mind this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,This game is great tons of fun always something to work towards.The game has LOTs of potential.but it's far from living up to it at this moment.i will change my opinion if they change things.The major issue is matchmaking.I played even before the free to play weekendand spent almost 3 hours getting rolled by killers...they had 3 4 red perks lvl 40 50 and sometimes crazy high rankwhile i was lvl 1 rank 20 with zero decent perks or items.Not only that but if you get downed and hooked you are DONE.Because when you start out you have people who won't save you.Either due to also being new and unknowledgeable or afraid to or just selfish players using you as a distraction.i had 3 games where I popped every generator by MYSELF.and 2 games where i got 3 or 4 BUT and then got caught out.OR... you get killers who hook you and then sit there watching as you die waiting for AGES as you bleed out.Making it impossible for you to be rescued.Which if you don't know the game actually is BAD to do as killer.Because you get no points no exp no score.and you deny the survivor you hooked score/exp.you just gimped both of your scores. for nothing.and new killers do NOT understand this.so you get perma campers every game.and it sucks. very anti fun.the game doesn't really explain that ensuring a killdenies you points from doing other objectives.This is a major issue as the things you unlock via bloodwebare huge factors against others with good perks and items.ESPECIALLY if you are new.Once you understand the game items and perks matter less.but getting low points/exp at the startreally slows your progress to a crawl.The game is EXTREMELY unfriendly to new players though.The only way to play is against others with no clear explainationof most of the mechanics of the game when you first start out.You have to stumble around in the dark LITERALLY.Most of the advantage comes from knowing the mapsand since it throws you straight into ranked...there is no way to really mess around to learn them.I will say this though.I like the game concept and gameplay.But the amount of work and time that I have to playto catch up to the majority of the playerbase...all the while being at a disadvantage...while being matched against much higher ranks...tl drWatch others play the game on twitch or youtubelearn the game through other's eyes firstbecause you don't have the luxury of learning thru your own.also nurse is broken as hellteleporter with auto aim attacks...,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-22,0,0,31,False,Recommended,As much as I love this game and enjoy playing it I find 2 major issues when playing it 1) Randomised spawning is great until you end up spawning 10ft from the killer. It's not fun when the killer can SEE YOU when you spawn. You get a poor score and no currency to spend on levelling up. Since there is ALWAYS a basement somewhere on the map with 4 hooks and a chest surely the killer should always spawn there so the killer can't see the survivers at the moment of spawn?2) Matchmaking can have you with a level 1 surviver no perks or very very basic perks against a killer with a full load out of pink/purple top tiers perks. Again... why bother trying at this point. Surely you should be matched with killers and survivers that match your level with the character you're playing so the experience is fair?Other than that this is a really really fun game but most of the fun is had with friends in a 5 man because of the above reasons online can sometimes leave you feeling a bit... let down by the unbalanced nature of things.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-12,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,This game looks good but I assure you it is total garbage!Accurrate reviews I have seen. Lobby Simulator 2k17 but I have a new one.....Never Ending Chase Simulator 2k17.You get to be a killer but you do not really kill anyone you put them on hooks and the other players just take them right back off......just an annoying experience of exploits. Since I purchased it on a 50% off sale I got a few fun matches but once all the new players left I soon found out why the wait times are ridiculous.....bc no one wants to be a killer so you have huge quenes of survivors and no killers. To make things worse the only way to be effective in killing anyone you have to tightly patrol the hooks you put people on which they have to stay on for a certain amount of time to die........which will get you hazed in the after game chat. Other than the visuals and a few good matches the only thing this experience was good for was seeing what other games people recommend instead of this heaping pile of elephant dung. Which is terrible since they would most likely sell a lot of DLC if it didn't suck. All in all meh spent $12 got $5 worth of game so I can feel good knowing I only lost $7.oh forgot the non esistant Match Maker so you will get paired against people who have hundreds of hours of gameplay and unlocks which I can't fathom why they hate themselves enough for that level of self punishment. Honestly the game would be 1000% better with an offline mode or PVE mode with bots that don't cheat. I mean it will have to be a PVE at some point bc no one wants to be a killer and for good reason. If it were done right this game would be epicly entertaining but it's utter rubbish!,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-14,0,0,453,False,Recommended,Its a good game once you get into it. It has its flaws (Major flaws are the loss of progress and other ingame gameplay related bugs). The killers are way too strong in my opinion. It might be different once the bugs that are in the game for months now would be fixed. Otherwise its a solid game. I recommed getting it if you are a fan of asymmetrical survival games. Get it now or the best option would be to wait until its on sale.Edit One last thing I have against the game is that it is using peer to peer connection. Its the 21st century... there is no reason not to get dedicated servers. These constant lag switches and laggy lobbies (I check my ping every lobby doesnt mean the killer cant start a download mid game to increase the ping) are the major cause why I keep losing interest in this game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-17,0,0,1112,False,Recommended,Review updated to match with 1.9.1Some aspects of this game are still flawed amount and stun range of pallets ranking systems priorities for certain interactions (f.i. self healing instead of unhooking after being hit) hitboxes of a variety of objects and bugs.The rank reset (on every 13th of month) puts high ranked Killers into matches with possibly prior low ranked survivors which also makes for a very easy killing spree.As of 1.5 it is no longer possible to view/look up the Killer's Steam profile which is also an issue as this does not allow a survivor to make sure he isn't being put in a match with Killer they had blocked earlier be it either for a style of gameplay they do not enjoy to play against hackers and so one.I am aware that there are some survivors who will block and report for absoletly ridiculous reasons. On the other hand some Killers will dodge the lobby for ridiculous reasons like having more than 100 playtime hours or private profiles.Also all it takes for the Killer is to click on the Survivor's username in the lobby to see their profile and check their information (unless private). Very biased in my opinion...However although often frustrating this game is a lot of fun even without friends.The variety of Killers with different abilities makes for more alternation in gameplay which also requires a certain amount of skill to be obtained.There is still a lot to be changed about the mechanics of this game but the developers are very active and keep their community up to date all the time.Though in my opinion survivors should get points for the Surviving category based on how long they've been stealthy/in a match and instead escaping should only give off 3000 points instead of 5000. This would also make for a higher change of not losing a pip when being camped/mori'd after only a few minutes in or at least getting boldness points when the killer just stays all around you the whole time.I've had many matches in which being stealthy saved my life but eventually a gen will explode in my face when I want to let go of it (bc they hate me) leading to my death because the Killer is just close enough for me to not find a good hiding spot in time and then there's the frustration of depipping even though I had evaded the killer many times throughout the game.Another big wish I'd have is for (repeated) exploiters and hackers to just be permanently banned from the game since it seems that they are just let off way too softly many times.,Dead by Daylight

Frequent rubberbanding dropping of players etc. Very low skill floor for killers very high for survivors (ie not balanced) Game mechanics encourage the killer to camp once you're 'hooked' (ie countdown to bleedout) Chase mechanic centers around survivors avoiding the faster killers by using obstacles. But using these too much is an 'exploit' and so a bannable offense. Corrupts save files because apparently this is fine even a year+ after release. Use a friend's save because you don't want to start again from nothing? BANNED!Could have been an excellent game in better hands even with all its faults it's kind of addictive but... just stay away.

Because its balance is utterly broken which thus makes the game unenjoyable.If you play survivor you basically have your victory handed to you since you'll be provided with overpowered perks and items. How exciting.If you like winning easily and with no effort you'll love By Daylight.If you play killer survivors will bully you. You'll be powerless to do anything about it because the devs keep nerfing killers to hell and back to the point that you don't play to enjoy yourself but to entertain survivors. That's right you're seen as their play thing to toy around with. They will tea bag insta blind body block pallet loop and insult you in the end match chat. Not the survivors nor the developers have any respect for the killer playerbase.If you like to have an incredibly frustrating stressful experience and play only to make it so that survies keep playing for our developer overlords you'll love By Daylight.Don't buy this turd.

They have made this game literally so killer oriented that is now impossible to juke a killer that is not blind and if you get hit once you will probably be instantly downed because their ""super rare perk"" that they added with the DLC is owned by every killer that has played more than 4 hours of the game. Their also used to be a free cam for survivors while they were running. GUESS WHAT?! It's gone. You can no longer predict a killer or learn to because you can't see him while running boards no longer stun for a proper duration and some killers can jump over them just as fast as you.

As a killer main it is nearly impossible to win at high ranks without using nurse or hillbilly and even than I have to hope for the survivors to do a mistake. And that's the biggest problem survivors are not weak. they got too many skills that downright counter killers and give themselve advantages that they shouldn't be able to have. For the survivors it's not a desperate fight for their survival it's a simple walk in the park that's not even challenging and I'm not even talking about pallet loop. Toxic survivors are rampant and doesn't help the overall experience. Bugs are still here and when they fixes something they break something else. Incompetent Devs + Cancer community not a fun game.Unless the game drasticaly changes the way killers and survivors interact in the game I won't see myself get near this game any time soon.After 100 hour of game I can safely say that I have seen around and that it will not get better.

2016-07-31,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,"This *could* be a really good game unfortunately technical issues and questionable design decisions kill the fun.1) NetworkingThe biggest issue is the lack of dedicated servers. The ""killer"" hosts the game. Listen servers only work well if latency is good. But this game doesn't care about regions. Your killer could be on an island in the middle of nowhere or with a crappy ISP. Or the host plays on a crapp rig. The result is lag.Even worse you do not know until your game has started.Besides being the host gives you a huge advantage as the game is running smoothly for you.2) No real party systemYou want to play with a friend? Tough luck because you cannot! Well since the last patch (July 2016) you technically can but it is incredibly difficult to find a game with two (or three) free slots. I guess the systems works if you are a party of 5...3) MatchmakingNon existant. It's normal to play against higher ranked players with more experience than you (and better perks). Perks are not everything but seriously it's 2016!4) Key BindingsYep you cannot change the default bindings on a PC. Welcome to the stone age of gaming! Truth is there are not many keys to bind in the first place. But I am NOT a WASD player. It's sort of OK if I play as the Killer but it's nearly unplayable as a survivour (sprint and crouch).The game feels extremely unfinished. I would expect a more polished game from a seasoned developer studio.In its current state I cannot recommend this game. This might change if they address the issues mentioned above in future patches.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-29,1,3,227,False,Not Recommended,"""Let's make an anti fun game.""Seems like the game design goal they got to achieve.DBD is a festival of unbalanced game mechanics focusing on making an easy life for the killer.Using only windows and pallets a survivor has little to no chances to evade the teleporting / invisible / sneaky and faster killer.Luckily enough for the killer s/he can easily break these pallets and do so faster if s/he decides to use a specific perk (in game ""skill"") Every single survivor's mechanic is easily countered by the killer's perks or basic abilities.A survivor can heal himself? It will show the killer where s/he is thanks to one perk.A survivor is far from a hooked mate? Her/his position will be known by the killer.If you decide to run as a survivor which you most of the time can't avoid to do jokes on you the killer can follow you without having you in sight.If the killer gets you s/he can easily reach one of the multiple hooks available all around the map making it impossible for the survivor to use the spam ""A D"" dodge mechanic.Good to know as well most of the time if you get hooked by a killer be prepared to get face camped until you die. It's not a problem for her/him since at the end of the game s/he will get more bloodpoints (in game currency) than the ""best"" survivor even killing just 1 out of 4. So why even try?Every update is a killer buff never adding new game mechanics for the survivor but implementing new ways for the killers to improve the ""anti fun"" policy.As a final point take into consideration before buying the game that most of the time at least one of the players rages quit may it be the killer or survivor.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-09,0,0,408,False,Recommended,DBD is a fun game but does have quite a lot of bugs. Matchmaking is terrible right now (Veteran rank 1s will get matched with new Rank 20s) which can be quite troubling. Sometimes I also encounter glitchy rocks which makes it hard for me as a survivor to walk/crouch. The peer to peer system is also something I and other dislike. Because of it you'll sometimes get laggy matches (due to Killer hosting it) which can really make it unfun.That aside you can spend quite some time just screwing around with this game. Seeing great teamplay by your teammates is really refreshing too (bodyblock killers distraction etc..) or when the killer decides to be merciful to you. However most people probably won't reach this point. After all this game has a quite steep learning curve. New players won't immediately become good. It takes time and experience on dealing with the killer to learn how to play well and efficient against them. Learn to be unpredictable in what you do don't ever run in a straight line. Watching videos/streamers play DBD will also greatly help you improve as both a Killer or Survivor (I highly recommend this!). So basically don't feel bad when you keep dying as a new survivor or lose against good survivors as a new Killer. The Experiences you go through (which includes learning from your losses) is the key to becoming a better player.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-20,0,0,433,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight was a great idea ruined by incompetent developers. The game was fun at launch but has only gotten worse as the developers insist on balancing the game based on faulty statistics and the complaints of only one side of the community.The game is still asymmetrical but instead of it being a horror game where the survivors hide and sneak around a nigh unstoppable killer it's little more than a bullying simulator where the survivors taunt troll and harass a wounded declawed puppy. Imagine in the Friday the 13th movies instead of the victims running in fear of Jason they take away his machete kick him to the ground and shove his face in the mud. That's essentially the Dead by Daylight experience nowadays. Longstanding balance issues making the killers a chore to play have remained in the game for nearly a year while new killers or mechanics that survivors don't like are nerfed into the ground within a week or two. This is especially true with the A Nightmare on Elm Street DLC where the developers announced their intentions to nerf Freddy into the ground because low rank survivors were having a difficult time against him. Despite the fact that he was already considered laughably weak in high ranks.Does this logic make sense to anyone?Releast a new killer intended to shake up gameplay put game on sale to attract more new players Rebalance new killer based on complaints of these new players. I'm starting to wonder if this is some kinda social experiment to see just how much abuse one side of a community is willing to take before abandoning ship. Bottom line stay far far away from this game if you have any interest of playing killer. It's going the way of Evolve.,Dead by Daylight

The killers tracking abilities are insanely good and they move too fast. Playing as a killer is quite fun but too easy. So most people play as a killer. This makes the matchmaking wait as a killer sometimes take 15 min. or longer. The survivors need to be buffed a bit to match the killer. Right now out of all the games Ive played as a survivor. Ive only escaped legit once. The other two times I escaped were because the killer let us. This is why many people dont wanna play survivor. And from my research in the forums. Many other players feel the same way. So all in all. It would be an amazing game if the Dev would balance it out a bit more. Perhaps make the perks a bit more useful. 12% Is not a number to get excited about on rare perks. Just my opinion but I have been playing Video Games since 1991.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-23,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,Meh I'm done with this game. It's so ridiculously stacked in favour of the killer survival doesn't become tense it's just a question of how quick you die. The only time it gets tense is if you hear the 'escape' alert. Especially with some killer perks. Perks that show where survivors are for a time if they are near generators which everyone is because that's the only way to escape. Nearly every map a killer can get to you in that time so you just have to crouch and hope he doesn't check your corner but he knows you're in that area so obviously he's going to. You can't outrun sometimes you can hide if there is a lot of crap around and the killer makes a mistake. Everything you do as a survivor except heal yourself notifies the killers. I've had 15 skill checks repairing a generator. And if the map is inside a building or a built up area there's literally no point in playing survivor. You get stuck on traps or have to run around to find a machine to defuse a trap that you may as well have a neon sign over your head.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-16,0,0,75,False,Recommended,It's hard to say wether this game is worth buying so I'm going to list off some pros and cons.Pros Amazingly fun to play with friends. Unlockable loot keeps you wanting to play so you can unlock new items to use in game. On High settings the game looks great mood is nearly perfect. Makes you rely on your senses and wits to outsmart your opponents. Perks/Items aren't trashed in private games. Unlike online matches you keep any perks or items used in private games.Cons Performance is below average. Even with a good PC I only get 40 FPS in game. Private or Public. There's no in between. You can't play with two of your buddies and fill the other slots with randoms. No in game voice chat. Communication is important when playing as a survivor. When playing online there's no way to talk or type to your teamates. Repetetive. Grinding out the same game type with only a difference in maps the killer's play type and your perks. Unless you play with friends this game will get old fast. I would say for me that it was worth the $20 because some of my friends own the game. I don't enjoy playing the online game mainly because I'm all alone due to the lack of communication. Though this game is great with friends there should probably be a cheaper method to buy a package deal to give to friends similar to the beta.,Dead by Daylight

The killlers is cool and all have unique perks and abilites. The humans or in this case the victims have unique perks aswell.Dead by Daylight got a lot of smal patches and the dev is also very comunitive and very open about what their vision is about the game.Negative Currently 17.7.16 there is a lot of big and minor bugs boosters and poor matchmaking.I heard and seen many players teaming up with the killers and grinding Bloodpoints and ranks.This game had a lot of ""disconnecters"" whom always disconnect if they die before they could rank up.On the bright side They fixed the disconnect for rank method by punishing disconnects.

Also some survivor perks are too over powered vs what Killers can have. I would also like to see some 2v6 2 Killers vs. 6 Survivors.,Dead by Daylight

Of course on some days a bitter woman will appear out of nowhere and shriek at you making your life miserable. Other days can feel like a minefield and you must watch your every step carefully so you do not end up walking onto a trap.But then occasionally you will get the opportunity to cut up a bunch of people with a chainsaw and sacrifice their slaughtered and bloody bodies to an evil God exactly like most of us does in the weekends anyways!

Every two or three games this happends.3º Sometimes the game also crashes when you are about to finish the load of the map. when you are about to start the game. also you lost the consimibles.This bugs needs to be fixed. Im new to the game but this is frustating because its not a fast game. this game take a lot of time to find a party to create a match and when this stuff happend it make you want to trow everything away and ask for a refund. and the only answer of the developers are we are working on that.....,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-31,0,0,202,False,Not Recommended,So what can I say about this game? The concept of the game is nice but implementation is poor. After releasing cosmetic DLC and the recent michael myers update the game still lacks dedicated servers. As for the balance of the current patch the trapper is incredibly frustrating to play against. The keybind to unhook and disarm are both on M1 leading to a scenario where you think you are disarming the trap and ending up getting stuck in the trap.,Dead by Daylight

So get prepared to face those rank 1 guys with the most powerfull perks right from the get go.I have had some fun moments in this game tho juking a killer feels great the hellplessness i felt when i saw the killer for the first time really got my blood pumping. But after the first few games when the grinding starts when you try to get better but its mostly dependend on luck and perks. The game falls short and gets boring really quick.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-29,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Love the idea and in theory this is a great game but in my experience this game has been unplayable due to bugs and lag. I have followed all the online guides into how to improve performance I've changed the settings and the game cache and am running it on the lowest possible settings just so that it can function fps wise. But even still a bug just took me out of the game and even with the lowest settings and the uninstallation of other things from my computer the fps was so low that skill checks were reduced to a total potluck no matter how quickly I responded the game would take a few extra seconds to process my action and I was unable to successfully complete more than half.

2016-11-01,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,This game is riddled with issues including but not limited to graphical glitches model glitches that end with you flying out of the map or getting stuck behind an object in game lag rubber banding you and jumping you feet ahead from where you thought you were network errors that disconnect one or multiple players mid game horrible matchmaking that in my very own experience will match a fresh rank 20 survivor with a rank 1 killer.All of that aside the game can be tense as a survivor. I personally prefer playing with a group but playing solo as a survivor can be fun if you're put into a good enough group (as with any game). The perk/leveling system is done well and the variety of killers makes it interesting to try and adjust your strategy to match the situation. The game can be fun even when matched against killers/survivors who are much better than you are but the game itself and the framework it's built on ends up stifling a lot of that fun. Either buy this game on sale or 3 4 months from now when hopefully a lot of these issues have been addressed.,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-02,0,0,924,False,Not Recommended,After playing 2 hours of this game as a completely new player (and reading guides about how to win as survivor) I must say this game has left really bad impressions on me.At it's key the mechanics are similar to Evolve it is a 1v4 arena showdown. The first game was really fun after the first few games the novelty wore off and the horrible balancing issues this game has really shined through.Playing as a new player survivor with other randoms is almost impossible to win the game heavily favors the killer (some of you may say that is how the game is built but I will argue it is a fundamental design failure).As a competitive game (which it has a mode for) it should be balanced but tipping the balance in favour of the killer is therefore a contradiction of the design of a competitive game. In a perfectly balanced game both sides should have an EQUAL chance of winning and that is not the case in this game.Take evolve for instance a beginner of that game still has a good chance of winning any game they play because the monster is balanced towards the other 4 hunters. This game however unless you have team coordinations and extremely good perks you cannot win.For instance playing as survivor no matter what I did it always alerted the killer. Okay so I go to hide? Well the killer can move freely and find me. Okay so I am caught? The timmer till you die in INFINATELY MORE FASTER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO SAVE YOU FROM ANOTHER SURVIVOR.It seems you need more skill as a survivor than a killer which is really un balancedIn a perfect world new players going into this game should win at least one of the games they play (e.g. evolve) however this game is completely not balanced for new players.I think the developers really need to pull this game off the shelft or make it open beta had I known this game to be this bad I would've never bought it.,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-02,0,0,398,False,Not Recommended,"I'ts been almost 2 years since the first time I tried this game. I have not played as much as I wanted and the reason is what everyone knows. The game is Broken.There's a debate going on about this for quite a long time. The issue is the balance. Killers those clowns running around the map have a problem. Is they lack control. I'm not going to talk about how frustrating is to have 3 guys running around you while carrying their friend to a hook forcing you to chose between camp or defeat and either way not having fun. We all know how that feels. We all also know how it feels to have a facecamper in front of us and having to let a friend die. Not funny. At all.How did it come to this? Well if you ask me the game has a good design with a terrible performance. Killers don't have any control of the match. When you play other games of the same style you are able to choose the hunting ground to remove players from the match with a bit of effort. To slow them and hunt them putting odds agaisnt the survivors. To make use of your power as the bloody Killer. But they can't do any of those things. To kill someone you actually need an add on. All you can do is run across the map praying for the dumbass to screw the loop. The lack of power of the Killer side is kinda sad. The problem of the survivors is they have the upperhand but only if they play as a team. And yes after looping some guys and making the killer mad you are probably going to get facecamped but to be honest if you dont face Myers Hillbilly or Leatherface facecamp is easy to deal with. But my point here is survivors are supposed to be a team. There a 0 mechanichs to reward selfish gameplay yet only those who make it out gain points. I believe it would be healthy to reward survivors as a team they work as a team and the guy who looped the mofo allowing the others to repair gens and got facecamped in the end deserves those escape points because without him maybe the rest of the team would not be getting them. I would not mind to allow the killer more ""killing potential"" and dying more often if I get that victory and those points after the match because the rest of my team made it. I don't get mad when I die in Siege but my friends win. So to sumarize Killers should have more control over the match. Survivors should be rewarded as a team. As now. I would not buy the game. I would play Friday 13 or other games where the roles of both factions are actually accurate.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-08,0,0,403,False,Recommended,"There you are crouched down slowly repairing a generator to make it functional again. You're aware of your surroundings and are on constant alert for the killer. Then in the silence a faint heartbeat is heard...you know the killer is close. As the heartbeat gets louder you decide it's better to survive than be caught so you slowly creep away to hide behind a boulder. But it was too late the killer spotted your crouched silhouette and starts lumbering right towards you. You sprint away not worrying about the trail you leave behind all that matters now... is escape. You run looking for any path that could throw him off your trail. The heartbeat is now accompanied by a anxiety inducing grinding noise...you know he's closer. You dodge around trees and hay bales hoping he slips up. The music and heartbeat more intense than ever and now a red glow shines on your back. You know he is right behind you know. Your blood flushes from your head and just as the killer swings their weapon you slam a pallet down between the two of you stunning the killer. As you hear his moans of frustration at his ruined kill you hop through an open window and slowly crawl out into cover. You crouch in hiding as you watch him search the area for you. He eventually give up chase and goes off to find another survivor. You crawl away looking for the next generator to repair and hopefully make way for your escape. If you've ever played Amnesia then you know about the water filled hallway sequence. Dead by Daylight is that...but for the whole time...and it's awesome!This is honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time. Are there balance tweeks to be made? Yes..But every game like this has tweeks to be made. It's a constant balance that doesn't ever really end and I think the devs are doing a great job at it. The feeling of escape or the feeling of a perfect kill is great. Being the last survivor and finally escaping through the hatch after a long cat and mouse game is also one of the big highlights of this game.

2017-05-25,0,0,93,False,Recommended,"This game is simply amazing. Being able to choose between the killer or the survivor i feel like it was the ultimate horror game. I will say I'm more of a killer than the survivor but bot are fun. Pros The killers all have different ways to kill you so the matches are always different in terms of what to expect. Playing as a team when being the survivors really makes the game worthwhile while also saying screw a team mate and running for the exit def gives you multiple options on how a match turns out. It is more than just fixing generators really push the killer to the limit and boost your score.Cons Killers camp a lot in this game so it takes away from the match. It has been out for a few so new players dont get discouraged when the ""experts"" run a match like you weren't even there it happens. Just keep playing and you will get it.

The ranks reset every month (The 13th of each month) And you unlock different perks and progress through the bloodweb. You also get the shrine where you can save up shards and spend them on teachable perks which any of your character can learn.

I recommend it if you want some game to play with your friends (4 vs 1).I thought it's just another multiplayer game where two teams kill each other for fun which is something i dont mind but I love how it's all about surviving and also team work based. It's laggy a lot of times but its worth the wait!What i hate most about it is the nose campers. Seriously a party poopers.

2016-09-05,1,3,190,False,Not Recommended,Ok first of all I would only recommend this game for you and a group friends taking turns playing the killer in a private game I'll explain later. but for right now I want to tell the main complains I have with it.1. This game loses it's scare factor real quick in public games I'd say in about 8 hours you will be used to it.1. FIX THE ING MATCH MAKING FOR SAKE! God damn dude this game has been out for 4 months. Stop being and adding new killers and fix the basic of the game or add dedicated server listings jesus even most basic valve games have that ... you know why? BECAUSE IT WORKS!2. The cheaters in this game the few I have come accross are pretty annoying and since you can't even fix the above MM I have no faith in any ANTI cheat you have in place for the time being.3. Holy prob going to get on here but what ever it just sucks starting any game new but this one omg if you are a low level survior or killer you are pretty much ed... they will find you like predator when the killer and surviors will evade like ninjas even getting off the hook with a 20% chance its sooooo t thats if can just deal with the MM to take like 30 mins to get into a game to get raped.I would wait till this game goes on sale really cheap and maybe alot new people will get it so you can enjoy it alot more or hell maybe if they can fix the basic problems one day we will have ranked games but for now I'm going to move on.....UPDATE Game is still pretty trash and I only really play it to troll and face camp the salty community in this game. Feels good man.I really hope friday the 13th kills this GAAAAAAAAAAAHBAGE!,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-24,0,0,971,False,Not Recommended,"I LOVE THIS GAME! Seriously I am like super addicted to this game. I play it literally every day and find it hard to stop sometimes. So why do I give this a negative review? The community is super TOXIC! You will rarely find a person that does not get angry salty and just be flat out negative no matter if they won or not. I have been called a hacker baby killer trash dumbass dumb prick and many more things that I care not to mention. Now that I have said this let's get down to the content.This game can be either a lot of fun or just the worst experience you having playing a video game. When you are playing survivor it can be rewarding to be chased by the killer and find ways to mind game and lose him/her. It can also be very harsh and unforgiving at times. I have had moments where I am being chased all game and when my team has finished all the gens I get screwed by the infamous ""Nobody Escapes Death"" perk. This perk gives the killer a speed boost and doubles their hitting power when all the gens are repaired. When that happens and the killer finally gets you they will camp and force everyone to leave the game so that you can die. That really takes all of the fun out of the game.When playing killer the survivors are always t bagging and bullying you and will try to pallet loop you for days and then when all the gens are done and you finally get that survivor down they use the survivors infamous ""Decisive Strike"" perk. The survivor gets one chance to escape the killers grasp and the killer becomes stunned for a moment for the survivor to escape. This can really hurt the killers experience and make the survivors over confident and just be plain nasty.So as you can see there are ups and downs with this game and unfortunately most of the time there will be downs that totally just suck all of the fun out of the experience. This game can be difficult to win on both sides and survivor and killer mains will always have something to about making the community worse and worse each day. Please save yourself from this highly addictive and super TOXIC game and stay away. It is already too late for me but it isn't for you. You have been warned.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-24,0,0,34,False,Not Recommended,There's no party system inside the game so it's impossible to play with your friend without the pain of searching every match till you get matched luckily with him.I got bored from the game quickly because matches depend on killer's skill (playing as a survivor) if he's quick and smart match is gonna be hard which will be fun but If he's not then match is going to be very easy and hence boring Same thing for playing as killer (survivors easy getting killed by you)Rating 6.5 10 for me,Dead by Daylight

Honestly if these are available the game will definitely turn to be very unfair as some "" friends"" can cheat together to gain blood points. ( such as the friendly killer let his friend survivors escape) Overall the game is good and it brings back childhood memories. In which I love hide and seek.

Second off the cheese in this game is unreal as a survivor there is so many places you can just jump back and forth over and over and the killer cannot reach you.. I mean literally you both can sit there for hours upon hours going back and forth if you want. And most killers just camp now because of the cheese system. The potential is HUGE but they really need to rework quite a few things for this game to shine or else its gonna turn into another titan fall or evolve and turn into a graveyard game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-04,0,0,19,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I wish I could select both yes and no for the recommendation of this game. It is quite fun all things considered and I will continue to play with friends but there's still a lot to be desired.Anyway.I got into this game recently and after I had seen a few youtubers playing it and all in all I find it a pretty decent game to sit down and play and rather fun to play with friends if you and your friends can manage to connect to a game with other players. I mean sure Private matches can be fun to play with people you know but if you and your friends want to earn actual points to upgrade you're likely to have more luck selecting to survive separately and then be randomly matched together than if you go in blind. And good luck if one of you wants to be the killer and yet still be paired with each other. For a multiplayer based game it's multiplayer system is lacking horribly.Is it a fun game? For awhile yes. Past it's buggy performance and flawed multiplayer it is an interesting game concept that isn't seen much of. Quirky and hilarious to play on voicechat with others I find myself getting really into the gameplay whether survivor or killer and I've gotten a few good jumps out of being found.Fleeing is satisfying sacrificing is satisfying.It's only fun for so long however. I hope they fix it up. A better matchmaker system perhaps for similarly leveled players or those playing in a small group. Bug fixes. That's all I ask for.This got a bit longer than intended. Anyway I say this game is a great concept. I hope they patch it up.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-11,2,2,155,False,Not Recommended,I love this game and I will keep playing it and yelling at it but as it is right now I advise no one to buy it. You will spend tons of time trying to find a game and failing to join lobbies. Once you actually get into a game you would think that the suffering has ended and you can finally enjoy the game right? Well that would be wrong too! Once the game starts it might be instant or might be 10 minutes in but you can be almost positive that your game will crash. I crashed in 3 straight games tonight played for 2 then crashed in 5 straight after that. One of the games was a friendly wraith so everyone just got a ton of points without actually playing the game. The other was a hacking hillbilly who just chain saw charges across the map directly at suriviors. So welcome to Crash by Buglight and I hope you have a better time than I do.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-03,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,Just going to drop a review that sums up my feelings completely about this game Worth a grab during a sale but this is definetly not worth the price right now.This is an early access game hidden as a full released game. High majority of bugs which still since release have not been fixed They lied during their beta saying that a lot of the bugs would be fixed by release Rushed the game out before E3 Lazy client side server hosting (which is actually really ing dangerous to YOU as the host can find information of yours if he really wanted to) Unbalanced maps perks mechanics Matchmaking is a ing joke A punishment system which favors more on the killer A highly toxic community (can't really blame them to be fair)The game is fun but only for so long which is why I put some hours into it. But 80% of that time was just annoying and rage inducing because of how when I mess up it feels like it's the game's fault rather than my own. And once you start to notice the lazy work of the developers (just released a patch beer time!) it gets to a point where in this day and age I can not see this as acceptableWe're in 2016 and you release an unbelievably buggy game followed by no patches to fix said buggy game weeks into its release.

As the killer I earn points to ""rank up"" by killing 2 out of the 4 survivors. This means that I can kill 1 playing the game normally and then sit in front of the second survivor and wait.

Dead By Daylight consists of 4 survivors and 1 killer in which the survivors have to activate 5 generators to trigger a door and the killer has to stop them.Positive points You can play with friendsEach survivor and killer has unique advantagesIt has several mapsThe game is getting quite optimizedYou have lots of fun.Negative points There are several bugsAfter patch 1.4.0 the game population disappearedMany campersThe game does not have its own serverThe community is quite toxicWell I'm going to indicate this game because it is my life 8.5/10,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Product received for free. My friend bought me this game so we can play as a group. So far it's a pretty good game.The game is great at keeping you in suspense and keeping you on your toes since if you make a mistake the killer will know.The heart beats the game makes when the killer is near makes you feel more scared. What really makes the game creepy is the way the killers look and how defenseless you are as the victims since your only escape is either death or hiding well enough to be able to escape.The matchmaking system has been improved since I last wrote this review.Overall I do recommend this game because its a fun horror survival game thats fun to play with friends.,Dead by Daylight

2018-12-13,1,1,50,False,Not Recommended,If you want to put a shotgun in your mouth while simultaneously being pile driven in you ejection hole by the equivalent of a horse s fifth appendage then you should try being a killer. If you want to waste some time grinding to level up three character so that you can pick a fourth and be invulnerable I suggest be a survivor. Either way the devs have essentially show what looks like a nice juicy triple quarter pounder but in really have taken a massive corn filled that for some reason has shards of glass in it and forcefully shove it down your throat while promising it s a balanced nutritional meal. I ve deleted and installed this game time and time again. Everytime I come back to it with a good heart and intent to grind through the crappy gameplay and try to be a good Killer of course I end up switching to survivor halfway through each reset because it is so much easier to play. And then I realize that one of three things will occur. 1. I will face one of three killers that everyone plays because they re the only viable option. 2. I will face a killer that has no hope of getting a kill unless the survivors are just truly awful. And 3. My favorite is that I ll run into a killer that so wants to be a successful killer so bad that they cheat. The most common I see is an ESP or minor speed boost which is just enough to ruin the game. Wanna hear something even funnier. The devs are absolute ing trash at the game. Unless they play with some high end items or they play with other devs or they play in a test built with their latest crap idea. You will never see a decent dev at this game. That s because they re all and most of the updates they make are to make them better. Funny how you always see them playing survivor.Lastly. Survive with friends. While I do enjoy rolling up with my friends the fact that you can use a third party application to voice chat with your friends literally ruins a match. Honestly if I see a party of three or four come into the game when I play killer I leave the lobby because i d rather tie my nut sack to a closed door in a busy building than play that match.Dev s I ve owned this game since it first came out. I ve tried to support it. I ve tried hard but I m done giving a about it and paying you salaries. Uninstalling for the last time and honestly if I had the option or the skill I d find a way to delete this game from all existence so nobody would ever inject themselves with the cancer that is DBD it s community and the development team.Go ahead and hide my comment go ahead and ban me from your game all I want is my 60 bucks I ve spent on this holocaust of a game.,Dead by Daylight

DAMN the killer got one of us. They need a hero. I'll be the hero. Rest of the team don't care it's up to me.Sneak up to the hook where the killer has my fellow survivor hooked up. They have only seconds left I must save them. I rush the killer and unhook my teammate killer knocks me down. Teamate runs killer chases and gets them again.I did my best. But alas it was not enough exit is opened. Start crawling for my life. Killer can't find me. Crawl across the whole map finally reach the exit.The killer is waiting. He is looking around in the grass I hide but once again it is not enough. I get picked up just a few meters from the exit. I wiggle as much as I can but the grip of the killer proves too much for my broken and bruised body.I die a horrible death. Game over.10/10 would crawl again.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-31,0,0,321,False,Recommended,This game is so much fun. Obviously it has flaws like gltches Overpowered killers Underpowered killers however playing with friends and even by yourself is so addictive and so much fun. I bought this game expecting to have around 10 hours played in total as i'd get bored however the grind to reach high levels doesnt feel like a grind at all with the daily challenges and it always feels like you're getting something new in the bloodweb which changes up your game slightly. In the recent update where they changed the hooks it has helpoed against the camping killers by allowing a hook rotation so they can no longer block the survivors from saving thier friends. Many people don't like the survive with friends feature mainly because if they main killer they dont want the survivors to work together this is kind of dumb and if you think swf shouldn't be in the game you're probably a salty killer that went up against good players. There is also a ranking system which resets monthly which helps you play against people your own skill level. is very good get game,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-16,0,0,241,False,Recommended,I love this game theres just a couple problems that I would like for the devs to do.Main thing is Bugs. The Devs just keep making DLC and with the recent adition of Leatherface I was a bit cause there doing nothing about the bugs. The opitimazion in this game is horrendus and even with the best PC's they still cant run this game perfectly. If they fix these problems the game would be perfect.(Now I have had a lot more time with the game these reasons are still accurate.,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-25,0,0,270,False,Recommended,"This is my first review and I'm sure you like myself have read a lot of them before making a purchase on steam. I bought this game on sale for 9.99 and within I would say within 5 matches I went and bought all the dlc (not necessary by any means to get extreme joy from this game). I did not know that I already had access to all the levels (trials) and wasnt limited to matchmaking by not having them.Anyways if you're searching for that addictive video game fix because you're chasing the ""gaming dragon""... stop right here and purchase. Watch gameplay footage on youtube. This game is so intense I still shout profanitys by being startled. So much fun playing the killer and the survivor. I have won as the killer about 3 games (managed to kill all the survivors) and escaped as a survivor about 20 (played many more games as a survivor). Even if you lose on either side you still get xp to level up any character of your choosing. That being either survivor or killer. Easy to learn with a very high grading curve of mastering what you're doing. I will pour many more hours into this game. It is heavily populated so it doesnt normally take more than a minute for a match to start when you search for a game. Normally about 20 seconds for me.My complaints and a heads up Host of the match (trial) is the killer and your latency depends on your connection to him. You can see the latency before readying up for the match. Red is bad. Don't play a match with bad latency or you can expect to rubber band a lot. If the killer leaves the match you get a win as a survivor and the game obviously ends (good). With that being said after the match is over and you're chatting up your gg's and what not when the killer leaves the lobby the chat goes with him (sad). Minor bugs in the matchmaking menu that can be fixed by restarting the game. This only seems to occur when I switch from playing survivor a couple of games in a row over to playing the killer. Idk... sometimes I have to restart steam otherwise ill get stuck in matchmaking. Easy fix minor annoyence.Thats about it. Watch some beginner tip guides on youtube before you start. Nothing more annoying than a survivor who gets himself killed within the first three minute of the game from sprinting down the middle of the map.I gave these guys like sixtyish bucks in all so I hope they use it and keep improving the game and not be spending it on cocaine and hookers.I use a 360 controller and remapped my skill check from LB to A. Feels more comfortable that way and didn't conflict with anything else.Enjoy. glhf",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-16,0,0,87,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. So I do recommend the game. Very much so. Because it has a large community and you can get into games generally pretty fast compared to other 4V1 games. I got this for free and then bought it soon after.HOWEVER the DEVS need to seriously get with the program!!!!!!! (You can either read the book I posted or watch this short video.)https //www.youtube.com/watch?v d31kV K0cXw&amp feature youtu.beAs of this review I have experience bugs and glitches that have not been fixed despite my game having to update constantly. Usually these ""updates"" are simply to add some cosmetics to the game or whatever. That urks me. You take time to add that pointless junk but not prioritize your major issues people are having. IT'S SAYING SOMETHING WHEN YOUR BUG FORUM IS THE SECOND LARGEST FORUM IN YOUR GAME!! It's about 15k posts!!!! COME ON ALREADY! THE CONS First off before you buy the game or test it be advised that you will get stuck in loading screen loops.. very often.. especially at lower survivor levels. This glitch doesn't seem to appear when you play as killer despite level. Second there are bug abusers you will find people able to use weapons that are not intended for the killer they have. Like Nurse is able to use Billy's chainsaw.. this is not intended but it happens.. and it's very absurd.Third your perks will randomize as a survivor.. like.. I place my perks in an order I need them in as a survivor.. so I can see the notifications easier each perk gives as a result.But despite so many attempts to keep perks at a certain order.. the game will CONSTANTLY randomize them in whatever order it chooses once you enter the match. This throws me off and makes it very difficult to see if the killer is nearby. I want my perks left the way I intended them to be.. not how the glitchfest wanted them to be.Forth you will find people with large egos.. you will find killers that will stalk you the entire match ignoring your comrades that run about them.. And some killers on top of this you can't seem to shake off you can crawl run walk they'll find you. They'll just keep following you around the map and finally if they do catch you which they normally do because you can only be chased for so long before it annoys the feces out of you.. they'll camp you and smack you when they hook you. Just to add insult to injury.. you WILL run into people like this.Fifth you will find players and experience this yourself where you bounce around as if lagging.. it's almost like you're losing considerable framerate and you're in one place at one minute and then at an entirely different place the next minute.. despite your ping being perfectly fine.Sixth the DEVS don't seem to want to or even consider making bugs a priority.. some bugs are annoying but can be overlooked while others are ultimately game breaking.People have been complaining and complaing.. the bug forums are filled with the stuff I mentioned.. and it doesn't seem like the DEVS even care. Eventually people are going to wise up or ANOTHER GAME is going to be released that has DEVS who actually LISTEN to the COMMUNITY.. but by that time.. it'll be too late for this game and it'll be old news. And when that happens the DEVS of DbD will have NO ONE to blame but THEMSELVES.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-30,1,3,353,False,Recommended,Now the only solid reason for me recommending this game is its very successful delivery of both immersion and suspense as well as it being a very fun game to play with friends in both online or private matches. However before purchasing their are some drawbacks you should now about that greatly affect the game's overall quality.Queue times may be long at times and certain loading screens may become forever stuck killers always have priority over the server as the host and this can cause inumerous amounts of lag at times that takes away from the games immersion and one of the biggest drawbacks for me is the fact that currently if a killer were to start the match fully with survivors they have the capability of leaving the match or disconnecting from the match for whatever reason it may be and this unfortunately can cause survivors to lose their offerings or survivor rank due to the match ending but without enough time to gather bloodpoints needed to advance.Certain killers have even exploited this against me and have left the match moments before myself and 2 friends were about to escape the map due to this killer not being able to capture any of us and this of course made us all lose a pip in our survivor rank as well as our offering.So overall the game is very entertaining to play but many issues need to be fix before the playerbase will truly be able to enjoy it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,101,False,Not Recommended,I wish I could rate this 1 to 10 or express a neutral review but I'm unfortunately restricted to positive/negative as a simplistic measurement. I'll summarise the positives/negatives for a clear overview of the experience. Positive Atmospheric procedural maps Unique tense premise Effective balancing Unique killer traits (Invisibility Trapping and Chainsaw Charge)Negative Minimal customisation to appearance (implied otherwise from concept art) Superficial perks Superfluous items 3 maps 3 killers 4 survivors Identical functionally to BETA Overall the experience is highly enjoyable but it's severely restricted in content which is impossible for the community to improve from a lack of mod support and the perks/items are shallow (at best) to have minimal impact on the experience for a higher dynamic playthrough each time. However the three maps which are sadly limited to three for theme/setpieces do have unique placement for the objective(s) and these do foster a degree of variety. For 15 it's worthwhile for those craving this unique premise no alternatives available but I'd recommend one to wait until there are competitors or this receives considerable updates as it's currently equal to the BETA overall in content.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-19,1,3,2051,False,Recommended,Wow so much going on here. Where to start.I've so far only played it for a bit over 6 hours total so I'll do my best to say what I think of it.I really enjoy it.I didn't think I would since it's not my sort of game ... But given the chance it's really not what one thinks.It's more than the standard type of horror game. It plays with the mind stimulating the fear if you're a victim and stimulating the psychopathic killer in all of us when playing as the killer.I'm still not sure which part of the game I enjoy more being the killer or being the victim. Pros It has a uniqueness about it I've not seen in any other game. Ever.I like the fact it has a first person view when you're the killer and a third person view when you're a victim.Both aspects have a completely different way of playing and both aspects are completely fun.Cons I've noticed a few glitches within the game. Each one was from a victim standpoint.Fixing the generator and killer clubs me and picks me up we both get stuck at the generator and even with another victim coming back to help me still couldn't help me.Another was being bashed to the ground to the point of crawling away victims came to heal me but couldn't and killer couldn't pick me up to put me on hook ...First time as a victim was on hook someone helped me off and I was wedged in the beam that supports the hook and couldn't get out at first. Can't seem to play with the same people unless you're playing against friends in private match mode ( not really a problem.. but it would be nice to be able to make new friends.. )Other than the few very minor bugs I HIGHLY recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight

For how much money they milk into this game there isn't nearly enough content. MOst of the recommendations for this are from people who played it for free for a week or so. They should really make that ""check this box if the game was free"" manditory if you haven't bought the thing. The game uses League of Legends systems to keep you playing the same thing over and over again. As you play you unlock perks which are incrimental statistical changes So once you get past the nastalgia and horror elements you're basically playing the same game over and over with people who know how to exploit every goofy mechanic and then whine afterwards whether they won or lost. I honestly wish there was a way to just turn off chat entirely or kick someone you recognize as an asshat or any way to remotely control who you play with but the game itself doesn't even really organize people by their ""rank"" which is your win/lose rate it just plops you with people who have every perk and know every glitch/cheap method to win with absolute beginners.I feel bad for anyone first playing this game thinking its going to be fun Its just waaaaay to expensive its a money milker.",Dead by Daylight

EA is that you hiding behind Behaviour Digital Inc.?Most of the DLCs add new killers and/or survivors. Each with a unique set of 3 perks which are very hard to obtain if you don't own the DLC. You can however obtain them through an ingame ""shrine"" which holds 4 random killer and surivivor perks which resets every week. The catch is however that the shrine may also contain perks that you already own or if you play one side only like killer or survivor it may contain 4 perks of the other side making it almost impossible to get the perks from DLCs that you need/want.And that's just the DLC point of view.The game itself is buggy as hell map design is a mess and the community is cancerous as hell.

2016-06-27,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,Alright. I love this game I truely do. My only problem with this game is the rank system. Sure rank doesnt dictate EVERYTHING. But it sure makes one hell of a difference when you are a level 19 killer with a blood web of (4). LITERALLY never having a match with anyone above rank 15.. with over (10) bloodweb! And i get that your goal is to get as many points as possible to RANK UP. So killing is not always the single best way to do so. The game just feels to easy for surviors you can heal without having a health kit! (not yourself tho) There can be more then one of the same charector which can make the game broken when you have all botonists healing themselves faster then you can chase them down! The game becomes unplayable when everyone surpasses your rank by (10 15) Levels per person. Also i feel unhook times should be slightly longer and maybe slap on a quick time event as well.. since you love those. Its no fun when the survivors always have you by the balls not the other way around.,Dead by Daylight

It honestly isn't even the biggest issue though. Since day one. The trapper. ""one of the killers"" has been incredibly over powered. For the simple fact. If he lays a bear trap at the feet of someone he hooks. And you watch him place it mind you. You can't disable the trap. Only the unhook option is available. It's so frusterating because at this point you have a choice. You can fully abandon your teamate/friend to die a horrible death. Or you can take a chance in saving them which WILL and I mean that. no way around it. One of you will land in the bear trap. If it's the hooked person. he grabs them. rehooks them. they instantly die. Or. it hits you "" the savior"" and you get hooked and likely get left for dead. ""or he just places another trap and wala.

Matchmaking taking 20 minutes to match up is annoying. Overall This is an interesting game that really has slipped under my radar until recently it does hide and seek really well and reminded me of those epic games of HnS I use to play as a child. The audio ques are pretty legit and the overall atmosphere of the game paints a real sense of danger and urgency to escape from. Well done .,Dead by Daylight

Once in a while I manage to escape or even better hook someone but I'll never be more than a rank 20 and that's ok.

2016-08-15,0,0,277,False,Not Recommended,I (Duck) solo queued as a rank 20 level 2 survivor after already losing many games as survivor. I was matched with 3 other survivors with a single perk (one had an uncommon and the other two had single rare perks). How is it possible that we were matched against a rank 15 killer with 4 ultra rare perks (No One Escapes Death Insidious Whispers and Spies from the Shadows)? I'd venture to say that the most important issue this game has is the terrible matchmaking. I think folks would be willing to cope with the DC's lobby issues lag broken infinites broken perks bugs etc. but the poorly designed illogical matchmaking system makes it boring for the high ranked people to play. At the same time the new people trying to enjoy your game are quickly discouraged from playing. I have had the same issues with trying to play killer. Low rank low level killers also get matched with high rank high level survivors. If the developers continue to keep the poor matchmaking in the game beginners will be frustrated and quit and experienced players will get bored with the game and quit. It's a shame. The concept of the game is great. The music goes well with the action. I won't recommend this to my friends until the matchmaking is resolved. I would hate to introduce them to a game that will put them in the situation I just experienced. I don't see it as anything different than the developers forcing high ranked and experienced players to cheat.,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-22,1,2,408,False,Recommended,I feel like it is time for me to review this game. This review will explain the premise of the game and what game play consists of!OverviewDead by Daylight is a 4vs1 horror game where one player is a killer and the other four are survivors. The killer cannot be killed so the survivors have to work together to stay hidden and finish five generators which will power the exit gates so that they can then escape. The killer has to hit the survivors twice to down them and then hook them on meat hooks where they can then be saved by other survivors.GameplaySurvivorAlmost every action is further progressed by doing skill checks for example when you are repairing a generator or healing at random points a circle will come up where you have to press space bar in a certain area to complete a successful skill check these can be a bit difficult at first but are easy to learn with practice.Actions will still progress even without skill checks but skill checks provide a quick small addition to the progress of the action though failing a skill check will slightly regress the actions progress!Perks items and addons are all gained through the bloodweb a sort of spider web where you can spend bloodpoints earnt in game every time you complete a bloodweb you will level up this goes on to a maximum of level 50 where you can either prestige or continue levelling to gain items perks and addons. The absolute maximum level is prestige 3 level 50.All survivors move at the same speed though perks certain perks affect some movement speeds a running survivor with no movement boosts speed is considered 100%. Survivor sizes differ with (from my experience) Claudette being the smallest and Bill being the largest. Every survivor has 3 unique perks that are unlocked at levels 5 10 and 15 and then become teachable (availible to all characters) at level 30 35 and 40. KillerAll killers have a unique ability which cannot be taught to other killers though same as survivors their perks can they also have the same perks unlock levels max level and prestige system as survivors.Killers do not have to complete any skill checks to progress actions.Killers also level up through the bloodweb in the same way as survivors and gain perks item and addons from this.Killers do move at different speeds with The Nurse being the slowest at 96% speed and The Trapper Hillbilly Wraith and Shape (Tier 2 3) being the joint fastest at 115% speed. These are the walking movement speeds not including things such as invisibility as the wraith or chainsaw sprint as the Hillbilly and are not including any movement buff perks or addons.RanksThere are 20 ranks which go from 20 (the worst) to 1 (the best) killers and survivor ranks do not affect each other for example if you lose a survivor game your killer rank will be unaffected and vice versa.Each rank has a certain amount of pips inside it (the lower rank have 3 mid have 4 and high have 5) ProsInteresting and addictive gameplay with a wide variety of killers survivors maps playstyles.Every game feels unique and fun you will always be on your toes ready to either pounce as the killer or feeling dread as you know the killer could be round every corner as a survivor.Has a ranking system which gives you a rough indication of how good a player you are.Killing survivors is extremely satisfying!Although the game is a bit of a grind it is definitely not boring to improve and level up.Games usually feel relatively fair.ConsPeer to peer system instead of servers (based off the killers connection) means that as a survivor if the killer has bad connection it can be a very frustrating experience!Some minor bugs which can occasionally be frustrating.DLCIMPORTANT Even if you do not own any of the dlc you can still play against dlc killers and with dlc survivors you can also play on all the dlc maps and see any dlc items.There are currently 2 free dlc addons to the game and 3 paid ones all the dlc are fairly priced and each adds one new survivor and killer to play and a new map for all to play.None of the DLC add an overpowered killer or survivor so you do not feel at a disadvantage if you do not own them.There are also a few survivor and killer cosmetic packs.SummaryAll scoring is out of 10 Graphics 8 Art Style 8 Customisation 7.5 Gameplay 9.5 Music/Sound 8.5 Overall 8.5 If you find any incorrect information spelling mistakes typos etc please inform me!If you found this helpful please up rate it as it took me a long time to write!,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-30,1,1,23,False,Not Recommended,I have to say that I really like this game. My hours playing are low due to the fact that to me this is a Halloween game and that is when I play. I'm on the fence about recommending it though as this is multiplayer and like most they have cheaters....the other main complaint of mine has been the match making time to get a match The best part to me is playing the killer and losing....I get to chase people and try to scare them while giving them a quick little horror story that they star in. It's like being the director of a horror movie and manipulating things and of course there will always be the odd death that happens. All in all it's a fun game and if they clean up the cheats and make the lobby match making work better it would be a top lister for me.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-29,0,0,683,False,Not Recommended,This game it favors the killers half the time. Lets say the doctor he has his shock therapy field. He throws the field out and the zone is huge. Then there is the killer speed the doctor is fast and with his field he basically knows where you are all the time. Then there is all the rest of the killers. When they swing to hit you then you dodge it and you have a good few inches away from it. The matchmaking sucks. You get killers that have like thousands of hours in the game. And they kill you with no chance of survival. Then there is the killers speed. You are running away from the killer and they catch up to you really fast its stupid. The Jigsaw chapter was a mistake because they make a killer for camping. I love this game to death but the game favors the killer all the time.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-16,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,"I'll rate this negative because I want devs and players pay attention also it means the game can be quite horrible if players in the game show no sense of morality Rewarding on the Killer side (pro) Punishing on the survivor side (con)I have fair amount of reasons for my review. So I recently started this game as survivor a lot of killers face camp or camp around their victim once they are on the hook however this can be prevented easily if developers develope an anti camp system for killers just like we have one for survivors (Camping somewhere throughout the game can end up reavling your location to the killer by crows which is a very good way to prevent camping and keeping the game as hostage)Also the bloodpoint and bloodweb system I just make it simply like this if you're a killer whether you kill or not you'll get fair amount of bloodweb and the main focus of your game will be on your rank (Which as you know on Rank level 1 you'll end up against Rank level 1 survivors so some killers favor rank level 20 so they can harvest as much as bloodpoint they want on newbies or baby survivors) and on the other hand you can harvest crazy amount of bloodweb and get your perks much much faster than survivors which will give huge advantages to the killer when you compare it to a killer without any perks.On the other hand survivros have to tryhard both for their rank and the bloodpoints they gain throughout the game. A guy who really performed great as a survivor against me while I was playing as a killer just got 7 000 bloodpoints while once all survivors escaped and I recieved 17 000 bloodpoints which I think it's not fair Killers should be punished as much survivors are. and this makes the game very unbalanced.If I give you specific examples It's some DLCs for example the Sparkle of Insanity The Doctor killer you can literally spam the out of the shocker then camp. without any negative consequence. So you have infinite number of shock waves sending to survivors.Those who has played against such killers understand when the fun is slaughtered by the killer because ""Blame the game not players with lack of morality in their gameplay"".Before buying this game realize if you have friends and fun is your first goal then be aware that there are Rank s who only care about bloodpoints so you might see your teammate on the hook and the killer standing right infront of him till he dies and entity gets him and they he has to wait for you to either die or escape which will make it insanly boring and screwed up from the fun aspect. or when the killer is just spamming and abusing things which can be easily prevented by the developers because the game at the current state is unbalanced.To those who say rank up on higher ranks it will get better it's not a solution It's called adaptation to a situation which has to be fixed by developers. We're not talking about facts like there are no servers in this game and Killers are the host which gives them advantages I've played as a killer and seen this advantages when he throws down the pallet but I hit him before it happens. It's very bad and since I do not have NASA internet or do not get any money from developers of Dead By Daylight I can not fix my internet so they'll get 20 30 ping. (Sorry not sorry)To those who say In real life it should be like this Killers should be stronger.We're playing a video game get out of your dreams some of us play video games to escape from the real life which some gamers have never ever experienced becuase all they've done is to sit on their and playing video games as their lifetime commitment.In the end I rate this negative. so it can be seen I play this game myself as both killer and survivor whenever I can but I want to warn other people if you don't have the nerve to tolorate people who can not play a game in a fun friendly and fair manner then do not buy this game.And It's the developers mistake. The game was all about Brain at the beginning when it was released but now It's all about perks and without them specially in the survivors' section you have high chance of dying over and over unless being CARRIED by your mates.Cheers !",Dead by Daylight

2017-12-08,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,As much as this game CAN be fun it gets ruined by the over powered killers that not only are already over powered but decide to give them perks that make them nearly unstoppable.

Making them intentionally overpowered is completely useless in playing a survivor especially if you are playing alone not in a group with no communication.

The graphics are nicely done with absolutely gorgeous or goregeous characters in it and astonishing maps to play on. With every new chapter that's getting released it becomes a little more interesting since this is not just a plain survival game but also has a lot of varities thinking of the many different killers that can be played. Since it is an online game it doesn't get boring over time even though it's always the same goals to reach yet it's a great place to meet people to play with.The Dead by Daylight community is welcoming sometimes full of male sex organs and sandbaggers but also full of fun people. And what do you do when you get sandbagged? Just do the same fluffin' thing and learn how to juke or tell the others your opinion in the chat after the game results are shown! Everyone loves nice criticism.But in all reality I really enjoy this game and am not going to stop playing it any time soon. I am fascinated by the design sound and ideas the developers come up with in every patch or chapter. If you're into routine like but also diversified survival game Here it is!Enjoy be nice (or sandbag and troll the hell out of people and open up a Funny Random Moments Montage on YouTube like some of us did) and just have fun because still it's just game. ) But a really awesome one so cheers to the developers even though it is still full of bugs!,Dead by Daylight

The killer designs are not extremely creative but they offer fun spin on the types of killers from horror genre. There is a lot of negativity surrounding this game because it must be hard to balance it right. Killers are complaining that it is hard for them to kill survivors and the survivors think it is too hard for them to survive so I really think that the game is balanced right because nobody is truly happy. There is a nice system of upgrading your character with perks and so on. It needs more maps and maybe different game mode with different objective for the killer and survivor but I am sure that the developers are doing what they can. There is a loud minority complaining about everything but I think the game is really worth the money and I personally never met anybody mean in game. On this forums....its different story!

2016-09-25,0,0,72,False,Recommended,Dead city Daylight is a strange kind of game you do not often see in the game world. This is a horror escape type game where it involves getting started 5 generator around the path you is placed into. a twist in it is that you are not alone as you have 3 other survivors with you. You have a killer that can quickly surprise you and take you down from the game by beating you down and hang up on a hook. Currently there are 4 types of killers that all have different types of ability suchs as invicibility traps chainsaw and teleport. This game is incredibly fun while very difficult for the killer or survivor is adept with his role .Be warned that this is my own opinions apon to this game so please do not get triggered by these.pros The game has a very balanced grading. It is very skill based. The graphic of the game is almost stunning when you play it on the highest settings making the game more realistic. Fast matchmaking easy to find a match (If you play alone) Different ways to play your charakter. meaning that you can be the leader who boost other players speed. or sabotaging the killers traps and hooks and so on which I really love. Its unique. by that i mean I havn't seen any survival horror games like this as a multiplayer. Cons Matchmaking system is terrible. yes you might find a match really quick but you might be coming against rank 1 killers and so on who are way more experienced then others or you could end up with people who are far less known to the game. This can lead you to a quick death in game. Matchmaking with friends... never seen such bad match making system for co op. it will start off by saying searching for a match and then instantly stop right after saying no match found. And if you were to find one you might be kicked because of the lack of space there is in one room. This si something that should be fixed by priotising people who play in groups so they can join the game. There is lack of story driven in this game meaning they won't say so much about the different killers and survivors unless you go on wikipedia or the creators webpage which i find quite annoying. I would love to see some sort of many gamemode that allows us to know more about the killers and survivors.Would I recommand people to buy this? yes ofc! 15 Euro is actually quite cheap for this game.I recommand this game to pretty much everyone who loves horror games and team based players because its really fun.This is just my opinions and I hope you find this usefull.

2017-06-14,1,8,3,False,Not Recommended,"So It's actually a pretty fun game. But it relies on ""leveling up"" and unlocked and stockpiling perks and add ons. This is dumb. It makes it so if you're a late comer to the party you wander in as a new monster expecting to get rolled and then some survivors with ""instant repair"" kits and such roll you so fast you hit them maybe once or twice. A half dozen games later and you understand it to a point. Being a survivor feels helpless fine. But then you hit end game and realize the monster could see you for 30 feet through walls if you were anything other than pristine (or in some cases even if you were fine and were healing someone else). You don't have that ability because you haven't played for 200 hours. Makes ing sense. Do away with this t.

2017-02-09,0,0,191,False,Recommended,I think the game is fun but being a killer sucks at the moment. If several suriviors have a toolbox or that perk that lets you sabotage without them they can literally make it so you have two options try to get them to the basement or let them bleed out on the ground which nets you almost no blood points. I propose that you should make it so that some hooks can be destroyed but not every aboveground hook on the map. Literally once they destroy all the aboveground hooks they just run around since it won't really matter if you see them. Seriously this is why people play survivor more than killer since you can beat the killer so easily with this strategy especially at higher levels where most people have the perk. And it isn't as if you can defend the hooks since the hitbox for someone when the sabotage a hook is strangely small. Also you need to get a better anticheat since their are people who can finish a generator solo with no toolbox instantly which is always annoying. That and the issue of people who use speed hacks since sprintburst isn't infinite. that fact that reporting them for cheating doesn't work most of the time makes them very brazen about it literally saying that they use hacks in the post game chat. Also the matchmaking system breaks whenever I try to be a survivor so maybe one out of five tries will get me into a game and I have to restart after each fail. That and there is always the issue of people not loading in all the way so we start with 3 2 survivors instead of four screwing the survivors over. this happens to me when I play killer or survivor.I'd reccomend this game but I'd only reccomend playing killer if you want to be frustrated since survivors are always cheating quitting or making ti impossible to kill them in any effective way. You could solve the no hooks issue with iron grasp or agitation but I have only agitation level one and iron grasp is annoyingly rare. Of course you could make it so the killer can repair hooks it just takes a while or make it so sabotaging hooks temporarily disables them allowing them to be used later or requiring th killer to interact with them first. either that or remove sabotaging hooks since that wouldn't hurt survivors very much especially since the game is currently unbalanced in survivor's favor.,Dead by Daylight

If you can fight through that this game is a must play online horror game. The game developers have consistently listened to the community and have been constantly patching the game since release. They have also released 2 3 very top notch DLC packs that have genuinely increased the value of the game and did not alienate/fragment any of the userbase.

2016-09-02,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Prepare to spend an average of 10 20 minutes finding a game. Then when you finally find a game don't be the first one to get hung up by the killer because he will just sit there and watch you die. Seeing as he only needs 1 kill to get a win and not lose rank that of course is the obvious choice for him. And everybody who's played for a little bit knows this and won't even try to rescue you knowing that. But should you win prepare for killers ragequitting as they are the host everybody will disconnect and you won't get rewarded anything. Which basically means that you've now succesfully wasted 15 minutes in a queue + 10 minutes ingame 25 minutes.Other than that this is a really awesome game once you actually play with proper people! If they manage to fix issues like making a proper queue system and giving penalties for a camping killer + adding that he has to get more than 1 sacrifice to get a win. THEN then they will have a really nice game! So basically unbearably bad when you're not ingame but really good fun once you get ingame! I'm running it on a rather old system but it still is sorta badly optimized as well. As I have hopes for the future of this game I would recommend it although at this state I would wait and give the devs more time to fix their issues with this game.

At times it can be frustrating and salt may reach maximum capacity but it's tons of fun and very addicting.Each character starts off different from eachother but after enough bloodpoint investment you can more or less use one you like as a template for various perks. There are also usable and passive items to help you each match. As you level up the bloodweb you unlock more perks and items to make use of eventually being able to turn the perks into teachables for other characters.The maps are fairly dark and foggy with plenty of places to hide and pallets spawned throughout the map to slow the killer. Each map is large enough for 7 generators but only 5 need to be completed to reach safety.

2017-01-19,0,0,610,False,Recommended,I have seen a lot of other people most negative reviews on this game. My review will be positive however. I actually really enjoy playing this games the sense it gives you when the killer spots you and you need to flee are intoxicating. The gameplay makes sense and is usually without issue. Sometimes however the game can be a real pain. Many times the game will not load up survivor matches and will instead give me an infinite loading screen which can only be gotten rid of through the Task Manager. Other times the game will have really horrible pairings. i.e. a noob survivor vs. a pro killer and vice versa. However even with the faults this game has I would still recommend this game to others. I recommend it to people who are willing to be patient with the game and wait until a match is finally started. It takes time but if you really want to know the truth it's worth every penny and worth struggling through its faults. If you don't like it get a refund. Side Note I will say though that the game's developers should really focus on fixing some issues of the game instead of adding DLC and cosmetics.,Dead by Daylight

Being a killer is like trying to open the worlds toughest pickle jar with your toes.

In fact it seems to reward you for camping a survivor which is not fun for either party. It is also worth noting that bugs are incredibly common and rarely fixed.

Especially since the last patches (lesser amount of pallets father lunge attacks by the killers) and the new introduced killer there is almost no counterplay for the survivors.

2016-06-20,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,The game has a fun premise survivors try to turn on generators to power the escape door while the killer tries to kill them. Does it execute this simply premise? The answer is.... kinda. There's a few reasons i don't recommend the game in it's current release state.First reason is balance and the severe lack thereof. Survivors are stupidly overpowered once you start giving them perks. 20 second cooldown speed boosts healing that is capable of recovering your bloodied state quicker than the killer can recover from hitting you being able to infinitely jump through sets of windows where the killer has zero chance of killing you. Those are just the few things the killer has going against them the other is the fact that if a survivor doesn't want to lose rank they pull the plug on their internet to D/C which comes with 0 penalty for the survivor other than you don't get your bloodpoints for that match but the killer gets nothing which results in them losing rank.Also since it isn't including in it's release state even though the devs have said they are going to implement it is for a game based on 4v1 not having the survive with friends mode available at launch is also bad.If you're playing as the survivor you better pray your killer host has a stable internet connection. This leads to another important issue that was overlooked for launch. In a game where the killer is the host why don't you have a region option for connections or a browser for games where you can see the hosts ping. Releasing a game right at E3 then going to said convention as your game is being blown up by critics for game inbalances D/C's going unpunished and punishing the killer for them seems a bit off.Now i've finished bashing the game there's a good game underneath the inheirant problems surrounding the game. The fact that they held a beta that lasted all the way until 2 days from game release was another oversight that if it allowed people to progress to test it further might have prevented these issues.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-21,0,0,139,False,Not Recommended,"Killer can swing and as long as you're in meter radius even if you're behind them 180 degrees they've added a system to where you'll automatically get hit. The killer is faster than you can hit you as long as your're close the only thing that survivors had to get away were a couple infinites which have been removed or ""Fixed."" Now when you jump out of a window if you dont have a certain perk youll be stunned for a second. THe killed got a new lunge which allows him to charge forwards and hit you if you're close enough even though he can already run faster than you. This game is atrocious and no matter how much the community complains that killers are OP you will always have those who defend and the devs are only making the survivors worse with each update. For example they just released a new killer called the Nurse. She can teleport or blink forward. Doesnt matter if you throw down a pallet or anything she can avoid those. When she hits you she has an ability to see where you're at in a certain radius. So lets say you're playing and she swings and hits you you will never be able to get away from her unless she is ing stupid. She will follow you until she kills you because she will know where you're at. Thats absolute garbage. Survivors cant survive anymore if the killer is good. THe game is horrible unbalanced.",Dead by Daylight
2017-10-30,0,0,147,False,Recommended,Yes i would reccomend the game for the first 60 or so hours it was a blast especially playing as survivor with friends. The main draw to this game for me though was the killers and around 50 hours into killer It's not really that fun. There's no sense of fear from the survivors who consistently pallet loop and run you in circles every single game which is really not fun for anybody really. This game is one of the most toxic i have ever played worse than cs go worse than pubg it's really bad. Post game chat as killer is a nightmare survivors have a go at you for every tiny thing whether it be patrolling generators or chasing someone who is trying to unhook their friend. SWF ( lobbied up friends) is awful too the game was made to have no communication between survivors but having you and your buddies in a discord really ruins the surprise element of some of the killers (MM Wraith Freddy etc.).All in all yes the game is great especially on sale and if you can look past the toxicity and blatant favouritism of survivors by the devs or if you play survivor this game is really great and even with all these flaws it's still probably my favourite game I've played this year.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-28,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED! I love the concept of this game. And it really pains me to do this but I'm going to have to give this a thumbs down. The game is beautiful. The rounds are pulse pounding and exciting. You find yourself jumping when a killer catches you off guard and you really get a feel for the immersion. The level up system is solid if a bit OP on the survivor side. The problem with this game and it's a big one is the fact that YOU WILL FREEZE UP. In every match. Always. I have frozen up temporarily in every single match I've played as the killer allowing the players to literally dance in front of me while they finish their generator repairs or looting. It's not a connection issue. It's a glitch that occurs when some loser quits a match early. Only the host a.k.a the killer is forced to lock up while the rest of the survivors go about their merry ways. I've lost rare one time use items and all of my points from being forced to quit a match just to end it. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! It should have been tested enough to work these problems out before launch. End of story no excuses. This is poor design and it harkens to the devs being too lazy to hammer out their product. I hope they fix this issue soon but I must recommend that nobody else buys this game without these bugs being fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED!,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-13,1,1,906,False,Recommended,This game is totally unballanced and unfair. Toxic community (really one of the most shity community ever). I had to block my comments cuz everygame when i killed someone as killer or juke someone as survi i get thrashtalked in lobby then blamed in comments. But.... this game is just good to play. U dont even feel this hours of gameplay. The best is ubdates and conntent really often but some patches are totally ts. And ye survivors are strong but balance team have no idea what to do with that. So they nerf everythink and checked how this gonna work. Bugs are problematic but meh gameplay is anyway good. I can reccomend that but u need to collect team because survive with friends is the best what game can offer to you. Really thats the best part of this game. Without this hmm.. this game would be really really bad and unplayable as survi. Randoms are totally random 9 of 10 only care about themselves and didnt help you even if u help everyone the whole game. You flashlight killer 3 times ? You help 3 people ? OH you first time get cought and you are at hook ? sorry survivors open gates see ya friend !! As i say community is and thats the biggest problem of that. But generaly game is really good and fun to play. One think is really hmm unfair ? Smurfs at ranks and ranking. When i have break or play survi not killer i get 17 16 rank im just winning 20 matches in row with 4 kills its boooooring sometimes. And unfair to survivors how people with 1 300 hours can play vs guy who have 900 hours and got another acc with 900 hours ? There should be some tiers like diamond tier platinium tier or whatever u named it and there should be ranks idk from 10 to 1. And reset is hmm 3 4 mouths not every mounth. That would make some balance in matchmaking. Other problem is servers orrr host servers with 130 150 ping its totally normal ping thats really funny to watch when killer got 300 400 but game priority is killer so in his screen u can be near him and he hit you but if u are idk 5 10 m from him u anyway get hitted. Dedicates servers are really needed. In rate from 1 to 10 i can give this game 7 5/10 facecamping problem no dedicates severs bags lags unfair ballance lots of but its high cuz gameplay is the most important think and that is why the rate is so high.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-13,0,0,517,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I love this game. It is a fun casual yet competitive 1v4 survival horror game with 4 survivors and 1 killer trying to sacrifice them all. It's different from a lot of other online games which in many cases tend to be some kind of team FPS game this game is a refreshing change of pace. Survivors goal is to try to finish 5 generators to open the exit gates to escape from the killer. Meanwhile the killer is trying to find and chase down survivors to put them on a hook to sacrifice them to the Entity. There are a lot of killers and survivors now to choose from and the game is constantly being updated with new maps characters and DLC. What keeps me coming back to this game is the perks that both killers and survivors can get. The perks can drastically change the way how you play the game and always keep it fresh and interesting. You can play this game with friends as well if you like. If you are tired like me of playing the same worn over FPS shoot em' up games try this one it won't disappoint you.,Dead by Daylight

2018-05-28,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. RIP TotalBiscuit you magnificent prick. While he s probably in a better place criticizing God s character model and the framerate of the pearly gates I m stuck down here only wishing I was dead by daylight. This game is 2 years old and I wonder to myself has the development team learned nothing from the failure of Evolve? Nothing at all? Really&gt Apparently not which like Evolve sucks for anyone who paid full price for this abortion. Could ve been a fun ride. Considering its only direct competition is Evolve or Depth it wasn t exactly a fair fight and the less said about Friday the 13th the better. The selection of killers seems robust the survivors seem equally capable. Interesting if predictable selection of DLC with everything on offer except Jason for obvious reasons. Matchmaking seemed reasonably quick comparative to eternal load times. The blood web felt counterintuitive. The weapon and customization options seemed somewhere between adequate and generous. Having to level up each killer / survivor independently feels cheap though not nearly as cheap as the design choice to favour 4 buffed up survivors over one completely sluggish Killer. The development team must be mentally ill. I don t appreciate having to pick a character pick a side and then commit to it. It s a far cry from a Left 4 Dead 2 killer although its certainly cheaper than Vermintide 2. As far as Online Only 4v1 Multiplayer games go this is #1. Terrible graphics. Input lag has cost me many kills I honestly believe I otherwise would ve made. Slow load times terrible match making and a complete lack of bots in this day and age is bloody inexcusable. I tried 4 different killers and 2 different survivors. Wasn t a fun experience. Hillbilly nurse and doctor seem to be the top 3 killers of choice. Still I find myself wondering why all of these minor balance issues still exist? I see missed potential. Like so many other games of this genre the developers are fine to pour on DLC like it s the last day on earth but they can t seemingly be bothered to fix simple gameplay issues. Again this game is 2 years old full of bugs and the community is as toxic as the game design is functionally broken. Pallet loop needs to be addressed. I don t care if it used to be good. It isn t anymore. You couldn t gift me this game because I d still refuse! Anyone who paid full price for this cancerous game deserves to be strung up on a meat hook and sacrificed to the entity.

2018-12-14,0,0,902,False,Not Recommended,"So I used to love playing this game a while ago. I stopped playing for a little bit as I was getting to rank 1 pretty quickly and rank 1 is just no fun its only full of try hards. I came back after I saw the new chapter come out. I liked the idea of this new killer and I wanted to learn this killer playing this killer was okay I guess. I think I got 1 kill with them as I dont really know how to play them. I do like the mori tho best one by far. So far the killer is pretty cool I like them yet the perks could of been better tho. Same with the survivor but breakdown seems pretty cool if you are gonna be tunnled off the hook. Now that brings me to the next point I'm going to make. Tunneling is a main thing with this game also camping. I pretty much get tunneled all the time its even worse in the higher ranks. Its the only way killers know how to play it seems. Camping well you have ds on well most killers love to camp if you have that one perk. Now before many people comment on this and say what about toxic survivors dont worry I'm about to talk about them. Survivors yes they can be toxic. Survivors with flashlights if they know how to use them you bet they will blind you when ever they can. Yes I use a flshlight a lot but I only use them on killers that like to tunnel or camp but I mostly will use them to save people as thats what they are meant for. But dont get toxicness mixed up with good players. I know to some killers survivors that teabag or pointing can be seen as toxic and I can see why it is annoying when they just sit there doing that stuff. Now onto this new update that we have yes the killer and survivor are pretty cool and its nice to see this new change but a long with all this is so many bugs and I mean there is so many I have not seen this many bugs in one game this bad before like wtf happened to the game. Yes they have taken the new map down to fix it as people have been reporting that they have been crashing due to that one map and I'm glad to see they are trying to fix that but lets be honest now they won't fix it as they never fix things. They say they do but they never fix it right. Like the bug where you couldnt move at all many killers took advantage of that bug. They said they fixed it but it was never fixed took them over a month to fix that bug. I thought that was bad but these bugs we are getting now are even worse. Killers not been seen at all and getting hit from out of no where by a killer you cant see. Putting a pallet down and slidding around the map. Oh there is many more I can list too. But this review is all ready getting long enough. Now the new map? well I cant say much about it as I havent got to play on it just yet as I never got the chance to get it and they have taken it down so who knows when we will get it back so I can see how the new map is. So now I have said all the bad what about the good? Well I guess the only good thing anout this game is I've met some really great people on this game. Really good friends. So I guess this game is only good for playing with your friends or meeting new friends. KYF (Kill Your Friends) Is pretty good fun to just mess about with and have all the perks so you dont have to grind all the perks. So if you want to get this game make sure you have some friends to play with so you can play KYF. Now SWF is okay I guess if you want to play lobby simulator for an hour or until a killer isnt scared of a 4 or 3 man or even a 2 man yes killers will leave if there is even 2 SWF. So all around thoughts? Well I think I'm gonna be uninstalling until they can fix this game or do something with it. So go a head and buy this game if you want to try and find the game inside all these bugs. But what I would say is to not buy this game. I think it will only get worse then it already is. So ""pretty good job so far"" if I dont say so myself )",Dead by Daylight

2018-09-02,0,0,98,False,Recommended,"Rating 8/10A horrorfyingly fun game! There two perspectives you will either play with in the game. The lone killer which the main objective is to is kill every survivor by hooking them onto a sacrificial hook while the ""entity"" slowly takes your offering and kills them. While the other perspective is the survivor which your job is to escape that killer by fixing generators and breaking the killers many totems around the maps. Both Killer/Survivor has a giant perk tree that can sometimes give you items and sometimes gives you perks that helps you in the field. Do not mistake this game for a walk in a park because you will be suprised when that killer could be watching you from afar or even behind if your not aware of your surroundings. This game has given me hours of fun with friends and by myself. Gameplay varies with certain people who play the game. Some killers will kill you on sight some killers will play with there food some killers won't even chase you. It all depends. Always coming out with new content to keep you out on your toes.

2018-06-14,0,0,316,False,Not Recommended,I was gonna give this game a good review but well the new update came out. Where do I start...lets start with the good things shall we? Wait... I dont think there are... oh wait! There are jumpscares! Those are fun right? I mean its fun to hear your friends scream into the microphone after the killer just appears in front of them out of nowhere or if they are being chasedLets move onto the bad things! Matchmaking isn't very good from what I've heard and experienced as both Killer and Survivor. Playing as the Killer is not so much fun since the survivors can troll and make fun of you for not being very good. How? Well they can pallet loop you (this mostly happens at lower rank killers higher ranks can counter this from what i've seen) they can open up the doors and wait for you to come just so they can tbag you or they can just camp in a locker somewhere on the map after the generators are done and gates are opened just to waste your time.The last few DLCs all cost money not even one free DLC. Besides this the new update arrived with a lot of microtransactions! Yay! You basically pay 5 euro for a pair of shorts when you can get a lot more customizations by buying a DLC instead of using the new currency in game. Along with this new update there had been some changes to The Shrine the perks cost a bit more than usual you seem to get shards a bit slower than normal (you get them by lvling up) and you get a lot less bloodpoints if you buy the perks you already had from the shrine. Most of the good and easy killers cost money of course there are a few free like Trapper which is pretty easy to learn or maybe the Wraith or Huntress...yeah those aren't easy... This is what I have to say for now about this game. It can still be a bit of fun here and there but I dont think it is worth 20 euro or 30 euro (if you want the digital deluxe edition which doesn't really gives you an advantage)If there is anything I missed if I did some mistakes or if I said something wrong please feel free to reply here just dont be hostile.,Dead by Daylight

Game also provides purchasable DLCs for killers like Michael Myers (Halloween franchise) Freddy Krueger (ANOES franc) and Leatherface (Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise) a fact that really adds up to the fun of the game.

2018-06-28,0,0,430,False,Recommended,It's not perfect but it's worth every hour and every cent! And playing with friends makes it sooo much better.If you're looking to buy the game there are plenty of video tutorials out there for new players on YouTube. By watching the tutorials and regular gameplay videos I was able to get a better sense of how the game worked and how I needed/wanted to play. There are many different styles of gameplay and not everyone plays exactly the same way with the same level of skill so this keeps the game dynamic and suspenseful. Yes you'll encounter some rotten apples in the game. And no not every match will go your way. But that goes for any online multiplayer game. You've just gotta brush 'em off and realize there are better people and games to come. But if you're triggered enough go ahead and be toxic your next game. Everybody's been there. After all this is just a game and you should play it the way you enjoy it most.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-28,2,1,2159,False,Not Recommended,"It's really not a coincidence that more and more people are leaving the game and its pretty sad. Killers are at a ""balanced"" state among Rank 20's. Where even if they are bad at the game and are completely new to the game they can at least 3k in a game against other rank 20's. Now this is fine until you consider Rank 1 game play. Because killers have been slowly buffed over time and already skilled killers are getting the buffs it is really difficult to win a game as survivor. The 2 000 hours I have playing survivor doesn't change that. Get to a pallet and get hit with broken hit boxes with (enduring/spirit fury/both). Run for a window (bamboozle). Oh and by the way no more pallets or windows over here so might as well 360 (auto aim with M1). If that somehow works and I manage to anger the killer in any way shape or form then they will (lag switch/camp/tunnel/all of the above). It's actually insane how far killers have gone in terms of power since 1.4 which was a time when survivors legitimately needed nerfs and now. And honestly like around 1.9 they finally had some balance between the 2 sides. However the devs were still on the nerf train to accommodate Rank 20's. This should have ended at 1.9 and instead should have been reworking the lower tier killers to be better because it was balanced at Rank 1. This is a time when survivors weren't op and skilled killers that got 4k's deserved them. But no the devs don't care about the current player base they only care about new people coming in to start playing. It's to the point where if you have any playtime over 100 hours then you can consistently 4k with ease. It really doesn't help that they manage to break the game more then they fix it with every update. The one thing they actually need to change is to (buff survivors/nerf killers) and nerf gen speed or add a 2nd objective because that is the only way to have a chance at beating a killer is with the power of gen rush. If this would happen then the objective would take a little longer but survivors would be stronger so that if you are actually skilled at survivor then you have more of a chance to survive in a chase instead of the incredibly boring 20 second chases that the devs insist they want for the game. It wore fun for killer and survivor in my opinion especially without having the stress of all the gens being done in 3 minutes even with ruin. I say this just because holding M1 and pressing space occasionally is more boring then being chased. Adding a fair and not incredibly tedious 2nd objective then it would spice the game up and give time where you could potentially be chased in. Will this happen? Probably not. But hey maybe some day...",Dead by Daylight

But I wouldn't recommend this game for you because developers aren't doing anything with bugs unbalanced perks and add ons and even more things. If they do some update it is all about costumes or some new killer or surv or both. But repairing their game is too hard for them I think. Survivors are all about practice (but that's in every game that you have to practice) and teamwork but with this garbage community you have to play rather solo than with team. This game has really bad anti cheat. Killers are about perks and add ons (if you don't wanna play nurse that is hard and boring to play). Well you can play without perks and add ons but it will be a lot harder bcs not many players play this game so you will almost always play against good survs with good perks and items. But even if this game has so many problems I still like it but the devs should work with game and not doing updates that will give them some money. And the last thing is that you have to pay if you wanna play more killers or survs.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-06,0,0,175,False,Recommended,A Fun game that can be played competitively or for $hits and giggles.Sometimes you are hyperactive dodging hits hitting your pallets and skillchecks and the next day when you run into the killer around the corner you might jump out of your seat.Can recommend especially if in sale for $10!,Dead by Daylight
2017-10-28,0,0,1094,False,Not Recommended,A game of hide and seek where you cannot hideIn the light of recent events it's high time for me to give an honest and unbiased review of one of my favorite games in the library (which I don't always do). Just a sidenote I own this game for almost a year and played significant number of hours as a survivor main so I guess I can be a rightful critic.I regret to say that I DO NOT recommend this game because of 2 main reasons. The new killer is blatantly unbalanced and it's not me being a . I am pretty good at adapting to various unfavorable conditions like Bear Grills but Freddy goes far and beyond everything. His abilities cannot be countered in any way. He is completely invisible which makes The Wraith a mere joke. However you can spot his footsteps in the grass but let's be honest they are still barely visible and 90% of the cases you are busy with other stuff such as repairing the gens which are often located behind walls/inside buildings. He can see you whenever you are outside of his terror radius if you are asleep which mocks the whole concept of stealth gameplay and hiding. Speaking of sleeping it is also hard to wake yourself up you either need a friend who will (oh my God) clap his hands like a cheerleader instead of giving you one big healthy slap OR failing a skillcheck. People do not often play SWF so finding a teammate can be tricky. Oh and btw you will probably have to go out of his terror radius to find one. Y'all know what happens next. Another way to wake up is to fail a skillcheck a gen or self healing works just right. Do I have to say that doing this will give away your position to a killer with a bright spotlight? You also fall asleep way too easy. Why don't make the killer focus some sort of a crosshair on a survivior for X seconds? Once in the dream world all you gotta do is pallet looping. Some salty killers expect you to sprint away ignoring any windows/pallets because they suck at this game and mind gaming is a rocket science for them so pallet looping can also get you facecamped to death. Good job BHVR. As I said before you cannot counter his abilities. None of Laurie's perks seem to be working neither in reality nor in the dream world (according to the Reddit thread). TL DR you are hopeless. I gave this killer a benefit of the doubt and assumed that the problem is in me. But the overwhelming amount of negative feedback and other on literally every social platform kind of says that Freddy is OP not in a good way. You can even see the Steam notification on the product page saying that there are suspiciously a lot of reviews from 26th to 28th of October. The graph also shows a peak of negative feedback. Y'all connect the dots right? Another thing is absolute ignorance of the devs. Instead of fixing a whole lot of bugs they put their efforts into creating another P2W killer. One of the major issues seems to be a massive loss of progress. I personally experienced that 2 3 weeks ago (note that I've been playing DBD for a year) and STILL do not have my BP back regardless of the reports. My buddy lost his progress twice in a span of what...2 weeks? If this does not change WinRAR will be a much better purchase than this game.To sum it all up I think I would have to boycott the game until they nerf Freddy or publicly announce anything related to fixing him. It is fantastic how you can up the whole game set the community on fire and turn them against you without double checking the killer. Well done BHVR.,Dead by Daylight

You now have to go through them fully to throw them down which i didn't enjoy because it make my job harder however i find it a fair fix but if that was removed why wasn't the same mechanic for killers removed. I just played a match where i could've escaped but the killer was able to put me on the hook from almost behind the hook.

2018-05-15,0,0,82,False,Recommended,Overall Rating 6.5/10Dead by Daylight is an amazing concept and in certain circumstances the actual strength of that concept can shine through. However it suffers what many of the larger and more popular communities suffer from and that's a very toxic playerbase. The game rewards behaviors that can easily ruin the game for newer player and frustrate players of old. PROS Innovative Concept Allows for very enjoyable situations when paired with the right people. Balance This is iffy but I personally feel a lot of the character's strengths and weaknesses really play well together. Level Design Again this is inbetween but there are some levels that compliment the general concept really well. Movie References There is just something special about being chased by the man in the Kirk mask. Teamwork It's a game meant to be played in a cooperative spirit and the game feels like every decision you make can be weighed against your team's chance of surviving. CONS Toxic Playerbase Many campers trollers griefers and general unsportsmanlike behavior. Hitboxes These can be really iffy could be due to conncection(lag) but it feels like they are often just wrong. Seasons The rank is reset every 'season' which leads to high ranks ending up back with newbies it turns into a massacre for a good week or two after. Lag There are no professionally hosted servers everything is hosted by the killer which leads to insane bouts of lag and connection jitter. Glitches Things such as ending up on the wrong side of the pallet or losing items due to connection dropping. Camping Yes it's so bad it warrants its own con. You will get camped and you will lose points/items/pips as a result of it. Rage Quitters These people will wreck your games when you encounter them. The game works on a basis of 4 people 5 generators. If someone leaves midgame you don't lose a required generator as you would if they disconnected while loading. So you get stuck with three or even two people stuck having to do five generators by themselves. So I know there are a lot of cons and some of them have ruined many other games. But despite those cons I still feel like the game is fun every now and again. Yes there are matches that are ruined by the community yes there are people that disconnect (rage quit) and kill your chances of survival. But I think it's a good game to pickup especially if you have a solid group of friends to play it with. This isn't really a game to play alone it's definitely a game that's better with a group of friends.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-21,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,It's a good game but the killers tend to disconnect once all gens are done or they use lag switches making the trial you just went through useless and boring whilst filling you with discontent and rage... Yes there are some good matches but 75% of the matches im in the killer usually farm disconnect once were winning and use lag switches. The other 25% are the good matches! Im asking for dedicated servers just like people did with For Honor It's one of the things that'll make the game better other than balancing.Also the animations are wonky with the polygons being stretched out making it look weird.Gameplay and the mechanics are good but the community and the matches are trash(adding more later im tired),Dead by Daylight

I never use after match chat there is no ingame chat and unless someone else got my account banned (which is more than unlikely due to the fact i change my password every 3 days) means that you game devs are careless. 360ing is not toxic at all and its one of the few ways a survivor can defend themselves besides perks like d strike which i never run EVER.

The matchmaking connection is crap sometimes (you'll accept an invite and you'll be stuck in a loading screen indefinitely).Give us handicaps if they're high level? Have a solo only option?

2018-08-01,0,0,1028,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun if you play as survivor with friends if you want to play as killer dont do it. It is frustating as hell. Survivors will do their objectives very fast and if you manage to find them you will have to chase them which is extremely painful and frustrating because of the obstacles (pallets and windows). They will run in circles arround them. When you finaly catch them survivors will have half of their objective completed but that is not all you have to hook them and it takes long time before they die. So you have to go away (if dont want loose the match) and see how you have to chase them another two times. Perks and addons are unbalanced. Even playing as survivor is not that fun because game have only one mode and it is repetitive and grindy. Devlelopers are rather adding microtransactions than balancing their game.

2018-04-15,0,0,1158,False,Recommended,Many people will disagree with me (Mostly people saying oh new emblem system ed up the game) But I'd recommend this game to every single person that asks me if this game is worth it. Is the game worth it? yes the game gets many negative reviews for no reason imo. How can someone that wasted over 1k hours into something go out of their way to say ' this game this game is and not worth it' (15 mins later he's already playing the game he was calling garbage) You'll have lots of fun playing this torture sim. First experience as a survivor (That's how I felt while playing the game of course you may think differently) At first while playing as a survivor you'll be in' your pants just be hearing a heartbeat. Your first couple of hours will be tense as and you'll most likely feel like the killer is way too overpowered and is just a powerhouse that can't be topped. With time you'll learn how to play around the killer and your fear will go away unfortunately. The game is also amazing to play with friends it's one of those games you'll have lots of fun playing with your buddies and I'm pretty sure that if you have a party of 2 3 friends to play with you guys will have a blast! First experience as a killer My experience as a killer I could say was mixed feelings I had loads of fun and I was frustrated at some points. (Mostly because I was bad and kept losing people constantly) but with time and by getting experience with the game I started to have loads of fun (And I wouldn't be scared because of no hideous monster that was trying to sacrifice me to some entity) so getting to the point playing killer requires a bit of time to get used to but it's what I enjoy playing the most and have loads of fun doing so. Community You'll find all sorts of people in game such as Ochido wannabe Does not like gens Likes pressing ctrl a lot Is always looking to annoy you somehow and loop you all game usually ragequits. And you'll eventually come across the 'god like survivor' These ones I have a lot of respect for Likes gens you don't want them to do Knows how to mindgame you Actually knows how to hide Doesn't only loop like a mongoloid and thinks he's good (looping isn't an issue everything can be 'countered' to some extent) As a survivor you'll find some really interesting creatures of the night such as Insidious Leatherface Likes corners a lot Is usually eating while playing with his foot gets easy 4k's (makes me proud for knowing how to use his 'skills') The salty guy Doesn't like when survivors use decisive strke if is looped once will probably rage quit if you window juke him he'll punch his mum if you get caught you're getting face camped. (Please don't complain about being facecamped just accept and move forward) The cummunity isn't as good as I hoped. Many complain about every single change the game makes which I think it's a bit stupid. The game will have lots of people complaining for every single new killer that is released they'll complain basically for any reason they can find. If you guys care about the future of the game don't be afraid of changes embrace them! About balance issues 90% of the disscussion section complain about the game being survivor/killer sided and I'm not gonna address this in this review. But all I'm going to say is the game surely isn't 100% perfect but it's not like every single game you'll face a really good swf group. Final thoughts 11/10I feel for anyone that lost their precious time reading to this useless review buy this game now and it comes with extra salt!

2016-08-13,1,2,433,False,Recommended,Don't get me wrong I love this game and I play it a lot with my friends and would recommend it. But there's a few HUGE problems with it that the developers need to fix.Main problem KILLERS CAMPING.I've lost ranks so many times because of this. The killer will hang you up and just stand there and none of the other survivors can do anything to save you. This needs to be stopped. At least come up with a system where the killers lose points if they camp. It makes the gameplay a lot less entertaining when you're being camped 95% of the time. And sadly that's around the right percentage of camper killers. I come across them in almost every game.Here's another problem the killer is way too fast. Maybe slow him down a bit? Also fix the glitch where he can hit you through windows. I've gotten caught countless times this way. One more thing chainsaw guy is way too overpowered I've never won against him but have won a ton of times against other killers. Other than these problems I love the game. Hope the developers can do something about some of these things. Please stop the killers camping. It's getting really old.,Dead by Daylight

My review would've been more positive if this was early access.The games core idea is great it's like someone had an idea for a best selling novel but then asked a 5th grader to write it. The whole game just seems so poorly executed.Bugs still litter the game even though it was released in June. I've gotten stuck in a wall warped through the map was able to farm a hook that wouldn't be sabotaged among other things. The bigges of which was my skill check bar was slightly off in every single game the UI was actually a earlier in the circle and ended sooner than it indicated.The matchmaking is something else that has issues. I downloaded the game and tried out survivors. 1 out of 2 games I was vs a max level killer with full perks. Other times just close to max level. That could be an issue with the amount of people playing the game. So unforunately not easy solution for the devs.Anywho if this is cheap maybe pick it up.

2016-12-18,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This might be the most glitched non working game at times... That being said let's talk about the game play.... By which I mean if you're a survivor be prepared when you do get caught to be hung on a hook and camped until you die. Not a single killer in this game plays the game correctly they just camp you ont he hook until you die. Or you get the killers who use cheats and see where EVERYONE is at all times and i do mean EVERYONE. Lastly not having dedicated servers and letting the killer be host lets the killer CHEAT AS MUCH AS THEY WANT. This game would be fun if they made it so killers cant camp if killers wernt the host so they can use cheats and if killers didnt camp and cheat. I have yet to see a game where the survivors win at all because moment survivor is caught its camp time everytime every killer. Hopefully when Friday 13th comes out next year they fix everything wrong about this game. P.S. if i had paid money for this game legit i would take this company to court for my money back with all the bugs/glitches/cheaters/camping.,Dead by Daylight

Soon later I picked the game up again and the difference is unbelievable. It's incredibly fun to play with your friends or to play competitively solo or in a lobby. The new maps and killers have really added a different feel to the game and it's all around mechanics are largely improved. The developers seem to be taking the games need for progression very seriously which has saw them release both visual updates to change up the game and allow more personal customization as well as updates to constantly fix any bugs or glitches that are hurting the game Along with the huge improvement of the server quality it is an all around great game.

2016-07-11,0,0,785,False,Recommended,"This will be my second review about this game. I am going to talk mostly about pros and cons of Dead by Daylight. Let's start with some pros Great fun Able to play with friends Patches every month 3rd and 1st person game After you get the hang of it the game becomes a lot easier Private games with friendsNow some cons Unbalanced perks add ons for both survivors and killers Maps are unbalanced due to infinities and low amount of barricades Teamplay game which means if you play solo it'll be hard due to ""noob randoms"" Lots of bugsMy overview It costs 20 euro not more not less.

2017-03-27,0,0,1528,False,Recommended,This game is fantastic easily one of the best I've played. The community on the other hand can be terrible. There are many people who have unrealistic expectations of other players. They expect killers to let them live or save their friends and complain about killers that act to ensure that their victims die instead of working on objectives.I highly recommend that you find a group of friends to play with regularly. Queue times can be very long sometimes and it's too easy for killers to dodge a game when they realize their opponents will probably have more experience than they do.Still the developers are constantly working to improve the game and new content is released regularly and for a very fair price often for free.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-01,0,0,1100,False,Recommended,"This is the second change I've made to my review FYI. I've changed my opinion back to a recommendation for this game as new updates that have been released have fixed most if not all of the major exploits that ruined the game in certain matches.I feel it's quite rare that a game dev can listen to it's community as well as these guys have but the dev team here have clearly worked hard in order to ensure their game is balanced and that their player base is happy with their product. Top job guys!The game itself has a wonderfully dark atmosphere to it and the variety of playable killers map layouts and minor game changers in the form of ""offerings"" really keeps this game fresh and enjoyable. I cannot recall a multiplayer game prior to Dead by Daylight that has had my heart racing as I near my objective goal with all other survivors slowly being picked off and the killer nowhere to be seen in the fog. The chases you can end up in are genuinely tense so if you're after a thrilling multiplayer horror experience this is it.Minor complaints I'd like to make is that it can feel a tad repeptitive at times (please take that with a pinch of salt since over 100 hrs of play is bound to feel repetitive). A few more creative ways to sacrifice survivors instead of just using a meathook exclusively could be a novelty. And trying to get into a lobby as a survivor can be a lengthy process at times the game could benefit from a lobby list showing the lobby's ping this would stop the need of people to test their ping in the chatbox and instantly leaving if they're unsatysfied with the timing.Overall I am madly in love with this game and I cannot keep away from it. It's really nice to change my previous 'Not Recommended' to a 'Recommended' status as this is a very unique and fun game that deserves to be played.

People need to expect bugs and glitches not every game is perfect after all these games can take up to years of work. The character customization is amazing (Not sure why every character is refeering to left 4 dead 1/2 though).

The developers have finally responded to the community which is nice but we keep seeing additional DLC without the major issue of NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME MOST OF THE TIME being resolved! They updated it just prior to me discontinuing play. I quit because after the update the game was more broken for me than it was before. Survive with friends was fairly stable until the patch then it became difficult to play at all as a survivor. Also I experience freezing after the patch that wasn't occuring before. It is just a major pain to pay money and to like the game when you can't get it to work to have all these issues and them not be fixed for so long now. I would suggest finding another game or 10 to play. If you start hearing DBD is fixed then maybe purchase it as it really is a fun game at least for a while.",Dead by Daylight

2017-05-06,1,1,240,False,Not Recommended,I'm confused to what to think about this game. Me and a friend bought this game and started playing it together yesterday. I have played about 10 games summing up to almost 3 hours of.+Its a lot of fun.+It's original. Its VERY unbalanced I played 10 games managed to escape 0. Killer always gets 10k+ points I get between 3k 7k depending on. There is no counterplay you can run all you want but 7/10 times the killer catch up to you. Doesn't matter if you wiggle there's hooks literally everywhere making it impossible to break free. Beginners is being matched up with experienced players with 100+ hours of game time. THE CHAINSAW. which strikes you once and you're done. Unless you have 5 friends who own the game you can't play as killer with friends. As the game is now I would not recommend anyone buying in. It's way too unbalanced game favors the killer even if you get all the generators running it takes forever to open the door to escape you get matched up with way too overpowered players due to their perks and experience which you don't have and can't catch up to since you won't earn any points due to the fact that you basically can't win.UPDATE So I have been playing killer lately.It is not fun. I'm actually a decent killer do this is not just sad complains from a scrublord. Survivors can loop you as much as the want if you kick a pallet they shine the almighty flashlight in your eyes which you are too stupid to turn your eyes away from(devs please) the t bag banter and are obnoxious. They are like little rats running around always missing the traps and still get the cheese. I want to stomp them.

2016-06-20,0,0,88,False,Recommended,"The game itself I love! Who doesnt want to be a killer from old movies we use to watch as kids? However still some things i would change/improve upon.Gameplay BUG! Have any sort of special characters in your name will reset your survivors/killers levels but not your rank. Beware (had to start off at lvl 1 all over again) Was hoping for more than one type of game mode (instead of just grab generators and run like hell) Maybe introduce other game modes or different twists. Would love to be stuck inside a haunted house with one of these creeps. Vaulting is to op sometimes this coming from a survivor player some instance of the maps where you can just vault over and over again to keep away from the killer is sometimes a bit op. There was one instance with 3 windows all next to eachother and no way for the killer to touch you. Survior co op play this has been said so many time I think I dont need to state it once again. Map generation is another thing winning a match is based on how lucky your generators spawns are Ive seen maps where 4 generators all next to each other making it impossible to get with a killer able to cover all 4 at once.Ranking For a game about survival and escape you loose rank if you escape to fast seems to be more based on ""grinding/farming"" that actual escaping and surviving to rank up As a killer if a survior disconnects/rage quits after you capture/hook/pretty much anything you loose those points you should have gained thus loosing rank/blood.Matchmaking Notice alot of bugs when it comes to match making either having to relog or spamming join lobby to get into a match Needs to be some sort of matchmaking based off level/rank. Having a lvl 30 hunter and 4 lvl 5 surviors with no perks doesnt make for a very fair match.These are just my random thoughts. I still love the game and will continue to play it.",Dead by Daylight

The maps are really well designed in detailCons The balancement is probaly the worse and iest thing I've ever seen Killers have a huge advantage of survivors and the only way to really survive is to not be altruistic pretty sad since the guide they made in the tutorial says to be kind of sad however survivors had there fair share of game (Sprintburst Balanced landing Adrenaline Decisive strike) Ebony memonto mori wouldn't be as if you didnt depip from it but because it deranks you it is pretty to have in the game.

2016-12-17,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I've been looking forward to playing this game after hearing so much about it and this free weekend seemed like the perfect excuse to finally try it out. But it seems not everything is always as it first appears to be. (That's why you should never pre order as well.)Negative Peer to peer hosting. No dedicated servers. The Killer hosts and the survivors try to fight another horror Lagg.Boring repetitive gameplay. You find generators fix them with occasional QTE and avoid the killer.Random skillchecks for fixing stuff healing people and probably other stuff as well that I haven't found out yet.Pretty much just cat and mouse gameplay. You hide go do something hide again or get caught.terrible UI It feels off and just doesn't really give you a good indication of what everything is about. You have to figure everything out yourself and even then you usually don't get any idea of what is really happening.The matchmaking Usually as a low lvl char you get matched up against people with rare to ultra rare perks who know what to do. Hook camping.Really... this one is just annoying as hell. Killers just stand in front of you while you slowly die. No way for your team mates to come and help you out. It's just a slow and painfull death.Character perks seem to be randomly generated and you can't build out a skill tree. You have to get everything in your tree to lvl up and get a new randomly generated perk tree for this specific character.The game doesn't explain much. Just the basics of survival. Everything listed below you get to figure out by struggling.There's icons appearing at the beginning of the match. What do they mean? What do you do with them? I wouldn't know cause the game doesn't even give you the time to read everything if you hover over it. You just get tossed into a loading screen and you just have to figure out yourself what the hell those icons were about.When you're alone you have to look for a hatch but it's never explained how. You just have to find it somehow or fix even more generators for your daring escape.No explanation on how to sabotage hooks and other things.Positive The bloodweb flavor text is interesting and makes for a good read.It's got a nice setting and the maps are interesting to navigate.Interesting concept of a game but very badly executed.Conclusion My initial enthousiasm did fade quite quickly as the game is tremendously flawed and actually pretty boring after a while. Even with friends I had a feeling it was a massive grindfest after just a game or 2. Despite having fun just messing around with eath other and the game it just didn't live up to the expectations. It felt a lot like Evolve had a baby with a horror game and dumbed everything down even more. It's the same boring grind the same boring matchmaking experience and just genrally badly optimised. The game doesn't feel like it's complete yet.,Dead by Daylight
2016-10-29,0,0,91,False,Recommended,An excellent game to play with friends strengthen teamwork and die of fright at the same time. You'll hear the heart of your character beating but what you'll realize and it'll impress you is that yours beats even stronger because of the fear of being caught by the killer.While the game is quite repetitive (little amount of maps and game modes) it is very entertaining and you will definitely have a good time.The only thing that I find awful and that the developers should fix is the matchmaking as it is very uneven. If you're a newbie the chances where you have some games with very specialized players with many hours of games are likely 98% of the times which will make you feel that the game is unfair. If you are a novice survivor and you are always killed or a rookie killer and every survivor escapes don't be disappointed and keep practicing! After much practice you'll be at the level of the best players (or perhaps not lmao),Dead by Daylight

2016-06-22,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,Bought the game after watching many streamers play. It looked fun maybe even challenging. But then I started playing the game myself.This game honestly is hardly even fun.Playing as the killer is a complete waste of time the odds are stacked so hard against you you almost want to just afk. Be a rank 20 killer and 3 lobbies in a row have ranks 2 4 survivors with all sorts of ultra rare perks speed boosts fast healing etc. How do you expect me as a rank 20 killer with no perks to hit someone 2 times while they move double my speed and heal themselves before i can catch them. Be a survivor. Unless you know the endless loops in the game to just aggravate the killer and ruin the game for all those in it its really not worth it. It is far too easy to play as a survivor especially when you have people that know these loops.Overall the game is maybe 3/10. Until they update and balance the killers its not even worth the money. This isn't even to mention that there is no party queuing system. This just put the cherry on top. A bad game and I can't even play with my friends to try and salvage what little entertainment is left in this failed abortion of a game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Game is quite buggy...match making doesn't seem to work properly frequently disconnects you from Steam.The gameplay itself is sort of fun but pretty shallow. There's a cheap thrill in being chased around by someone that you can't actually kill and can only really escape from but winning as the survivors seems almost impossible against a semi competent killer. It's a nifty concept for a game but there's just not enough too it and the progression system is overly convoluted.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,11,False,Recommended,This game is a very well made multiplayer suvival horror game that has an interesting concept done right. Each map and killer is very balanced and make sure that the game is neither too hard or too easy. My only complaint for the game is how badly the flashlight needs to be buffed. I've tried so many time to blind the killer with it but it always ends with me on hook. Its practically garbage and makes me want to have anything but it.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"First off I'd like to say I love ""Dead by Daylight"" so far. I've currently invested 13 hours total into it and the concept was exactly what I was looking for. I have my complaints but none of them will stop me from playing this game. So I guess I'll get into them As you now know I have enjoyed almost everything the game offers. But what I don't enjoy is waiting for people to stop lobby hopping to find their friends. When you quick join as a survivor it's not so bad but when you start a server... ugh. Basically it seems like the game sends people to your lobby in waves. The first one hits and it's usually comprised of said lobby hoppers. The second wave hits and you may get some players who ""claim"" to be ready. After the third wave you've either lost all but one or some other scenario that usually ends the same way. So you wait until that one person leaves and then you back out. After this you boot up a lobby again and go through the whole circuit once more. The second time usually seems to be the charm for me though. But don't let that information discourage you from buying the game this is the worst case scenario I've found and doesn't happen every time you start a lobby. As previously mentioned I've heard that the reason for this situation is because people are trying to find their friends and leave a game when it's not the correct one. Though I don't know how you would create it a party system would benefit those (like me) who don't care about who we play with. This system would also help the lobby hoppers (of course) as they could find their friends in a much easier way. Remember if you're reading this and you know you're a lobby hopper please refrain from it! It's not enjoyable for those of us on the receiving end.My second complaint is with the ""Wraith"" killer. Unfortunately I have found him to be extremely unfair and unbalanced. His invisibility power does not seem to have much of a cooldown and does not take as long to de activate as it should. If the amount of time the de activation took were longer and stalled the killer survivors would have a moment of grace to react as they see fit. As of the time of this writing almost every match I've joined has ended with me dying purely because the Wraith is the most popular character. I have only escaped once from the Wraith and it was not an enjoyable experience. It seems as though the Wraith is the character the cheaters tend to use as their playing style is always the same We'd start the map and the first thing we'd hear is the sound of bells which indicates that the Wraith has gone invisible. This appears to be the pattern for the rest of the match. After crawling around for fear of a surprise attack we'd finally work up the courage to start a generator. If we're lucky we can sometimes fix it a quarter of the way before our hearts start beating or we fumble on the skill check. This is where it gets cheap. After running around a little I'd join another survivor in fixing a different generator. We'd stay there for a little while until all of a sudden the Wraith appears behind me out of nowhere and strikes. With any other killer this would be thrilling as if it was punishment for foolishly sticking around too long. But with no warning from the Wraith it just feels unfair. Once he's put you on a meat hook the person playing as the Wraith begins to camp around you using his invisibility to catch anyone who thinks he's gone. This behavior is less like a murderer and more like an unjust bully. While I love this game the Wraith almost always convinces me to just play as a killer instead. I have only played as the Wraith once and absolutely refused to use his invisibility power. Upon testing this I found that the Wraith really has no advantage otherwise and can only really win when his cheating ability is used. I am not cutting down the people who created this character and his abilities I am merely trying to point out the way that players are wrongfully using him. It is because of this that I truly believe this game would benefit greatly should the Wraith be removed. At the least that his powers be lessened to an enjoyable state.My third and final complaint is directed to certain people playing as survivors. On rare occasions I have run into players as the trapper and tried to subdue them accordingly. Unfortunately specific cheaters have found a way to evade the killer in a manner that is quite irritating. first they slide through a window. Then they wait until you're at the halfway point before sliding through again back to the side they started on. While this may seem like a smart tactic at first they take it too far. This annoying dance continues back and forth as they know you can't catch them. There really isn't a way to stop this as they run away when I try to put a trap down. This is the only time where I would use the Wraith's ability as I am not a fan of such cheap tactics.Final note I just wanted to finish by saying I really enjoy playing as Meg and the Trapper the latter whom I find the most fun killer to play. I think both these characters perfectly fit the atmosphere with the Trapper's clunky Jason Voorhees style really hitting the mark for me. Overall I'd say this game is most definitely worth it just hope that you don't end up stuck with the Wraith.",Dead by Daylight

Add to that the fact that you are plunged into the game without any sort of tutorial to show you how the game works (there are videos which are a little helpful but it doesn't show you anything useful in terms of gameplay what buttons to press etc)... It's not very intuitive to play either when you find something in a chest the game doesn't tell you what it is you have to work that out for yourself..

2017-09-17,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,The idea of this game is great. But it is boring and linear to no end. There is no fun in it. As survivors you only have to fix generators and escape the area. That's it. That's your only goal. And as the monster you have to kill the survivors. I appreciate the original idea but it is not ambitious enough. There are a number of survivors and different monsters with different abilities and it is kind of balanced. But there is something about this game that prevented me from continuing to play after only one hour. I prefer to go back to Left 4 Dead 2 versus mode which is way more fun than this and by surviving you feel you actually did something.

But the fact that you aren't able to party up into a quick match is honestly ing stupid. The developers complain about stat padding. But really not many give a about stat padding. This isn't going to be a game played at a pro level. The fact that the developers decided to leave the party system out because of ""Stat Fudging"" really hurts this game. It's fun for a while on your own but falls short when you want to play with your friends. If you are really afraid of stat fudging then make the xp gained by a party halved or quartered depending on how many people queue up together. I would not suggest this game if you are looking for something fun and different to play with friends. I wouldn't suggest paying full price for the game either because of the lack of party support.

When you are a survivor Its pretty scary sometimes but still you can hide in a dark corner start crying and wait until the killer goes away. When you are the killer Thats a different story you can use your friends (Hooks) to entertain the survivors and watch them as they are enjoying their last moments with the hook And you can even take them to the basement... The matchmaking is sometimes a bit of a problem. It takes some tries to get into a lobby if you want to play as survivors When you want to play the killer you are hosting the game so no problem at all.I definitely recommend this game for people who like being chased or like to chase someone ),Dead by Daylight

This last remaining survivor was one of those special kinds of people that repeatedly window hop try to interrupt your sacrifices always seem to get away etc. Well not this time.Caught him off guard by the tractor and landed a shot on him. He began to limp away to the cornfield in a desperate attempt to break line of sight. But I was ready for this special friend of mine for the field was littered in traps. In not too long I heard the most rewarding SNAP of a beartrap and came over to find him knees down in an upgraded trap. Hoisted him up on my shoulder and brought him to the top of the tractor not the hooks the tractor. Why? I had something special planned. And that specialty was a Memento Mori with his name on it. Dropped him on the tractor and let him crawl around for a bit basking in the glory of catching this slippery . After some time placed my boot on his back lined up the machete and went to town on his neck.Ever So Satisfying.12/10 would question my moral compass again.,Dead by Daylight

I however would not know from first hand experiance since i waited an hour for 4 other people to join my lobby with no success. If i search as a survivor no games are found even if there are 18 659 players in game according to steam. The game looks great and i realy look forward to actualy playing it in future but i cant wait days for a game lobby to succesfully launch.Update...Since this review they made some changes to the matchmaking and it works better its an amazing experiance and realy good gameplay. if you heve the time to wait for a match I would recomend this game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-09-14,0,0,2,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. PSA Got this game for free from a friend.I'm not going to sugarcoat this review talking about what the game manages to do well. Watch any twitch stream or youtube video and you can see that the game only aims to succeed at its most core elements which is 1 killer 4 survivors 5 generators try to escape. Despite the lack of variety it's very fun.The matchmaking however is terrible and ruins an otherwise really fun game. Not only will the game not automatically put me back into queue after it ""fails to find a lobby"" 2 seconds after I click to join but it will also not put me back into queue when a lobby falls out or a lobby couldn't be found(note this is a different error than failing to find a lobby). I have to keep reclicking Join after anywhere from 2 to 200 seconds of sitting there waiting. And 75% of the lobbies I find fall apart. 90% of the games I played my first day just dropped randomly before we could finish. I guess the killer left the game. I don't know.And there's bots/point farmers too. It's really obnoxious. I can't sit down and enjoy myself when I wait 5 10minutes queueing for this game only to feel unsatisfied when my games stop short or the game just ends up being really for me for any number of reasons. Hard to justify dumping my time and patience into this. If the matchmaking weren't bad I can put up with the occasional game where I get chased down by the killer from the get go and nobody comes to save me so I die in like a minute or two(I'm not very good yet). It's part of the game. Whatever. But that's a risk I have to consider every time I invest my time into trying to find any game at all.I will recommend it because if you play with friends and not by yourself I imagine it's still worth playing and I will probably end up doing that instead of trying to play solo but I'm also hopeful that it will be worth playing in the future once these issues are fixed.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-21,0,0,1122,False,Recommended,This game changed a lot since 1.0.2 now its 1.2.1I recommend this ONLY for someone who is really interested and actually saw it and like it. Definitely not for casual players. because It's time consuming (I have over 500h and still don't have all achievs/characters) It's not newbie friendly. People are being butchered in first 100h of their gameplay Bugs (what game that is constantly changing does not have them) Kinda toxic community (always complaining about something) You may have really long waiting time to get into game (they are working on it)It's not only negatives Fun to play (once you understand the game) Play with your friends (that is really strong factor in this game) Leveling is well made and now you don't need to level up everything. Use Shrine of Secrets to get you new teachable perks. / Also level grinding is going to be smaller. Free DLC (what game gives you that) Huge community (salty most of time but you get all help you need) Developers and mods are communicating with players!Also dont forget there are developers that make every week a hour long stream about what is going on!! Thats huge plus in my opinion.#################################################################old review (negative) When I get this game I was curious about the hate this game already has.Couple of games HOOKED me (yea.) and I just keep playing.Sadly now after 100+ hours i am kinda There is so many glitches and actually few exploits that makes this game unbearable.Rank up system is a joke. There is no point in escaping unless you did less job then the other survivors and you need that sweet 5k for escaping.Also killer doesn't need to kill anyone. He can just run around them and do nothing and he will still rank up.But don't take too bad impression from this. It's fun as long as you take it as a game.Developers are actually listening to people about glitches/bugs/hackers and trying to remove it but in the current state its game full of bugs.Once its all fixed matchmaking balanced. Super idiotic dev ideas removed/reworked. Then and only then ill give it a recommendation.Also don't forget that there are no key bindings option or advanced video options.21th July 2016,Dead by Daylight
2017-10-22,0,0,93,False,Not Recommended,Stale gameplay and horrible matchmaking.The only real difference I've noticed between survivors is how visible they are to the killer while hiding. With killer the only real differnce is the special ability which will nice doesn't greatly impact gameplay.The matchmaking of this game is horrible. It'll put brand new players with the lowest possible rank up against full teams of rank 15+ or up against random spreads of a few low ranks and then one increadibly high rank player. I've seen games with a rank 19 killer two rank 19 survivors 1 rank 14 and 1 rank 8.Not only is the matchmaking toxic but the community as a whole can be as well. You'll get teams of 3 or 4 who will refuse to actually work towards the survivors goal until they've farmed everything AND everyone on the team is healthy. Who will body block you and taunt you when try to do anything and equip themselves with the BEST flashlights possible and then the second you try to do ANYTHING will take the first possible opportunity to shine said flashlight in your face. And then mock you in chat for not being able to do anything.TL DR If you like toxic communities or have friends to play this with go for it. Otherwise skip it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-06,0,0,952,False,Recommended,This game definitely has some potential I just wish they had a bigger development team.There are constant changes to the game not too constant but I'd say constant that can sometimes make obvious sways towards one side or the other. They have Twitch streams every Thursday at 2pm EST to give a little insight on their development of the game and also Q&amp A.As far as gameplay goes it can get stale after a while but watching Twitch streamers play this erupts a fire in my heart to play the game. If you want the best experience in this game play both roles. Do not develop an opinion on this game until you have at least 25 hours in each because you won't know the true hardships of either until you do. Most of the bad things in this game have been fixed especially matchmaking so I'd say this is a great game worthy of being 20$. Go ahead and buy it it's worth it but beware the salty community,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-26,0,0,447,False,Recommended,I love dead by daylight it is a great game here are 5 reason why you should play 1. A good horror game if you want to be scare play this.2. A funny game it is funny when you play around with the killer jukeing him or her. 3. Jumpscare if you dont watch out the killer can come of of nowhere and scare you for a laugh.4. Killers when you play as killer it is fun to scare them or play around.5. Players if you play with your friend as the killer play around and have a good laugh.That is why you sould get the game even though it is $20.00 it is worth it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-30,0,0,525,False,Recommended,items are stupid hard to purchase with blood points. one item you have to purchase for an acheivement with the trapper took me 23 hours of gameplay to even come by. after said 23 hours of gameplay waiting to find this item i join a game where i only find one of the four survivors in a 3 minute game before all of the generators are running and the survivors run out the door (i know that is just part of the game but almost never happens). so i lose my one chance to get an acheivement i have been waiting very patiently to even come by the legendary item. as survivors the only item i have even come by is a medkit. i have probably 100 parts collected for tool boxes maps and flashlights but only ever see them while serching boxes in game (which the 100 parts collected are useless at that point). and even the medkits are too far and few between to purchase. literally one million bloodpoints (i got the acheivment) equals one valuable achevment item 5 total medkits and 100 useless parts for items you cant even buy. fun but frustrating to the point of why am i even playing this game..,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-14,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"Earlier today I saw YouTube videos of this game being played. As has happened only a few other times in my life as soon as I saw the game being played I knew that I would enjoy it. What I saw was a masterwork of game design distilling everything I liked about the old Evolve experience into a game that didn't also want to be a shooter. What I saw was a perfectly balanced game of cats and mice. What I saw was something I expected to spend thousands of hours playing with my friends over the coming months.I could not have been more wrong or more disappointed.In my illustrious 42 minute career I was the Killer three times. In the first round I successfully ""downed"" my opponents three times and all three times I was too far away from a hook to actually kill them. In the second round I did not see a single enemy even while watching the exit. In the third round the players actively exploited me to get as much experience as possible eventually dancing within the safety of the exit. One probably out of sympathy briefly hopped out of the exit to let me get a single hit in before escaping.One of Evolve's greatest strengths was its rich soundscape. In this game on the other hand the soundscape is actively deceitful. Your own footsteps and grass rustles drift behind you and the only noises I heard my opponents make were healthkits and barricade drops. The upshot? The instant my enemy was no longer onscreen they were safe. Often I would surprise them around a corner successfully marshaling my Evolve instincts to ""head them off"" but they always saw me and walked away before I could hit them with my stubby little arms.The strangest thing is that the game I just played looked like it was months of concentrated development effort behind the game I saw in the videos earlier today. What happened?P.S. This will be the first game I ever refund on Steam.P.P.S. Now I know how the pubbies who hated the old Evolve felt.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-05,0,0,68,False,Recommended,It's a great game although the connection (to the host/killer) can be terrible at times. One of the biggest problems I've seen in this game is that sometimes the killer will not kill survivors but rather befriend them and boost points with them. There should be a way to report this behavior.And honestly if you're a survivor and you boost with the killer you're a nerd who cares more about your rank and points than you do about playing the game right.,Dead by Daylight

It does a good job of balancing the 2 sides at low level ranked play. The music is good and the atmosphere is creepy. If halloween is close by I'd recommend playing. There are quite a few killers with unique perks the survivors however are mostly similiar. Tension is what this game does best mostly from the survivor side. Turning around while working on a generator to see Michael Myers staring at you is as creepy as it gets.,Dead by Daylight

Possibly because it is absolutely atrociously boring to play as a killer?Play as a killer Get a lobby instantly. Go in game hit a survivor with your club. Hmm easy enough. Survivor some how gains speed while limping and bleeding out of their so it's impossible to catch them. If there aren't any hooks within 30m from your position your survivor gets away. When survivor gets away you are stunned for far too long and your fast moving limping survivor already has you beat. Your abilities are Each killer's ability is beyond . Bear traps that you have to be literally in the center of an invis that isn't invis if the survivor has his screen brightness up at all. You need to wipe the blade off of your weapon in order to swing again? This one has to be some sort of joke because that is straight . You put a survivor down they crawl. But wait they're impossible to see in the grass when crawling so you have to pick that one up run to a hook and by the time you get back the other survivor you were chasing is long gone.No map overview,Dead by Daylight

Work together to repair 5 generators to power the exit gates or at least 2 so if your are the last remaining you can also survive if you find the escape hatch. Meanwhile a killer is hunting you down trying to place you on hooks which sacrifice you to a 'entity' which reaches down from above and snatches your corpse. It is somewhat of a cat and mouse game but more complex. Items levels different killers and survivors with skills you can learn and train keep it refreshing and different each time you play.

I started hating it because of how out of character the mechanics are.I was playing the killer and was waiting for a victim to be sacrificed. Suddenly one of the other survivors came RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME DESPITE ME HITTING THEM WITH A ******* HUGE *** MACHETE TOOK DOWN THAT VICTIM. After that I chased the person I hit and put them on the hook. Right after that the very same person I had impaled on a meathook before TOOK A MACHETE TO THE ******* FACE AND TOOK DOWN THE GUY ON THE HOOK. ARE YOU ******* KIDDING ME??I liked this game when the atmosphere was scary. Now its just a joke game a game with no elements that make you think that I dont know but maybe IN A HORROR MOVIE? This is the entire point of this game to feel like a horror movie but right now it is a damned disgrace to the genre. When I saw this game I imagined a scary game a game where it feels like you are fighting for your life and running away from a brutal serial killer.Now when I think about it I think of a game of ""Monkey in the Middle"" where the ""survivors"" bully the serial killer and make HIM feel scared of being infinite window juked or constantly denied kills in goofy ways. How scary would Friday the 13th be if the main characters ran circles around Jason and window hopped constantly. How scary would Scream be if you saw that one of the characters just played Benny Hill with the killer and had the sole goal of wasting their time?If you are a person wanting to play a horror movie as a game dont buy this.

2017-02-26,0,0,804,False,Not Recommended,Its a fun game and all but only in rare cases. Kill your friends when you actually have enough friends who don't crash every game is really fun but when we want to have a random killer and/or its just me and another friend the survive with friends match making is just... its awful. There is so many lobby dodges from killers and when we finally get into a game it either crashes for me or them or the killer isn't even a good killer.Being a killer match making runs better but I can't play it well because sometimes my internet likes to be a butt.This game is too glitchy crashes too much match making is awful and it takes forever to find a match especially with survive with friends. But it is a fun game when it works right. It isn't really worth the 20 dollars but if you want to sit for 15 20min every time you want to join a lobby risk crashing when you finally get a match experience lag ingame due to the killers internet and/pr risk getting a noob killer who either camps or just plays the game so wrong then yeah the game is pretty fun would reccomend.,Dead by Daylight
2017-10-01,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Although it's classified as a horror game I find it to be very funny when I play with some friends. We'll all take flashlights except 1 person who might take a tool box and while they're fixing generators we'll troll the living day lights out of the killer. When playing alone it does get that very creepy feel especially when you hear the terror radius heart beat very suddenly when you're about to finish repairing a generator. Do you finish it? Do you run? Overall though it's fun but it varies from game to game depending on who you play with.I've had a couple very frustrating games when either my team mates don't help other's get off hooks and when the killer just face camps. Besides that though it's a lot less rage inducing than CS GO.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-20,0,0,72,False,Recommended,look this game is fun but there has to be changes if your the murderer you should be able to reach people and get a hit or two you shouldnt have to worry about them jumping over 5 different things all in the same facinity they shouldnt be able to repeatedly jump over them either forcing you to break an item letting them get away or stepping over it letting them get away or manuevering around it LETTING THEM GET AWAY. i was in a match as the trapper and there was two survivors i get a hit on one then both jump over a window so i was like okay lemme just walk over because theyre healing but when i do they jump back over while i cant hit and they start healing so i go through a door and guess what they jumped over again so finally i get a hit on one and hook them and put a trap infront but you know what happens? HE FREE HIM AND THE TRAP DOESNT GET SET OFF now dont get me wrong i love this game and cant wait to see what gets added in but if something isnt changed with these machanics then no one can play because theres no point being a killer if u cant kill i hope this gets to you guys because i want to be able to play this and not waste 18 bucks id be happy if u could just step over stuff faster or break barricades quicker. love what youve made but it infuriates me to see a good game have cheap mechanics besides even if i did want a refund i couldnt because ive played for ten hours besides that and my ranting keep up the good work.would reccomend,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-20,0,0,102,False,Recommended,"Probably the best multiplayer horror game I've played. Music details dark mist crows surroundings made of damaged and abandoned things and buildings everything works perfectly to create an immense and scary atmosphere in which you are supposed to survive / hunt others. The goals are quite simple yet are difficult to achieve. Overall gameplay is pretty good but it is true that the survivors have more chances to escape the killer who is faster then them but cannot jump through windows or other obstacles and if the survivors are cooperating enough it can be very frustrating game for the hunter. However whichever role you play it depends on your SKILLS not on some flashlights traps bells medkits and other things mentioned in many reviews. This game was made for mature audience not for children who and it is understandable sometimes cannot understand the true potential of this excellent game and are angry because they cannot win. It is true that there are some bugs and lags here or there but it occurs in around 1 in 10 games so it is not so bad. Many people complain about the matchmaking meaning you can play with 5 friends or with none of them (no duo trio is accepted in this game). But it has its point the game stands on the idea that four people find themselves on some place and only their fear and feeling for survival connects them. Would it be fun if 3 of these survivors were sky.pe friends and tell each other where is the killer where are the traps and whether or not repair this generator? I think not the game would lose all of its magic. So please understand this and enjoy the fear not your drinking buddy on the other side of team.speak.Nevertheless you are playing with real people against real people therefore the gameplay is much more scary and realistic than in majority of others.The cons (small bugs survivor buff"") are so tiny that it do absolutely do not ruin my impressions from this game. If you do like fear and horror atmosphere buy this game you will not regret it it contains everything you need to play it until daylight!9 5/10",Dead by Daylight

2017-11-11,0,0,91,False,Recommended,*MY EXPERIENCE* Great game scared the out of me at first but I got used to being hunted down pretty quickly. My game crashed quite a bit within the last month or so and also lost all my progress but emailed the DBD crew to get a fix and it was sorted within two weeks. Being one of a tonne of customers/players I personally think that is a fast service. The game is fun playing as both a survivor and a killer with many strategies out there to try but I think if there were a walkie talkie available for the survivors to communicate to each other with then that could make it more fun. Of course the walkie talkie would make noise so then it would be fair for the killer I guess?To me the game is definitely worth the purchase if you're into the whole survivor horror thing or if you like slaughtering people and hanging them on hooks.... I'd give it 8/10 because I love the game but there are a few tiny things that could be fixed. Definitely not a negative comment. Love it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-03,0,0,62,False,Recommended,"I've never really tried posting official like reviews before so forgive me if I get some sort of formatting wrong. Dead by Daylight to me is a great game and I've enjoyed it immensley however after taking a bit of time to skim through some reviews both positive and negatives I get where the problems lie. So here's my attempt to go through the good the bad and the homicidal. The GoodThere are plenty of good things about this game at least from the bit I've played. The aesthetics music enviroments and everything else really do help to build up the setting of a good 'ol slasher flick and even things as simple as the faint heartbeat I hear that signals a somewhat nearby killer can set my hairs on end. Leveling up is nice and rewarding and it always makes me smile to get a new perk or the next rank in a perk I find useful. Some of the items are a bit versatile (Like the Toolbox or Map) especially with add ons (I'll go more into those in a bit) leading to there being a few different ways to go about things. The BadOf course not everything is perfect and I find that I have to agree with most negative reviews that claim that there's more flaws than there are good things. The difference between a low level character and a high level character is vast. During my playthroughs after a while I noticed something. I was winning far more matches than I was losing (I tend to play survivors) and all of a sudden I seemed to be great at the game. While that feels good to me personally I eventually figured out that it was because my perks were a bit OP. Again great for me bad for the poor sod playing the killer. More balancing will definitely be required. Second and I'll be blunt I think this ranking system is a crock of s**t. Mostly de ranking if you don't ""do enough to help your team/murder people"". I sort of like the idea of the ranking system but losing a rank just because I was unlucky and spawned close to the killer was caught immediately and was bodycamped (I'll also go into this later) is unnacceptable. And this has happened to me many many times. And while I never experienced it I watched a Youtube Let's Player go through the hassle of a survivor abusing the vaults and pallets. I have no real ideas on how this could be solved but abusing the enviroment happens all too often (I try not to do this when I can but I'm guilty of it too sometimes.) Also the all time game ruiner for me bodycamping. My god. Do I hate bodycamping. It basically ensures that nobody but the most ballsy of people will help you and then you'll die and probablly lose a precious pip. Ugh... Now the main problem most people seem to have is that there's no party sysem (Besides kill your friends) and honestly I play solo so I haven't had too much of a problem with it. I get why the devs didn't put one it and it doesn't really bother me as much as it seems to bother others. There are plenty of bugs and glitches in the game (some that I've been on the recieving end of. Ouch.) and it can ruin the fun plenty. And while it's a tiny problem and I know it's going to change the customization is sorely lacking. I don't like walking into a lobby to see that everyone is not only the person I'm playing but also look exactly like me (which has happened). Again small thing but I'd like it fixed. Summary Wow. All of that bad with only a little good. So why is this still reccommended? Well no matter how you cut it this game is still at least a little entertaining. The concept is good the style and sounds are excellent the enviroment is great and while there are many problems the devs have said that they will try to put in a patch to work towards fixing these at least once a week. So there's still hope that the game will get even better and for the most part I trust these devs. (They haven't betrayed it yet.) Could this game have used more time on the planning and developing boards? Sure but I still think it's a great game nonetheless and I reccommend it.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-27,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Very fun game however it is essentially an early access game hidden as a complete release. I'll start with the positive side. POSITIVES There is a ranking system which adds a sense of competitiveness to the game. It also makes you feel like what you do and how you play matters. Also you now as of a recent patch can survive with friends. Make your own lobby and then queue for a public match you can also make private matches. Surviving with friends has made the enjoyable experience that I have found within the game. However this is not to imply that solo queue isn't fun it still offers close to the same amount of fun. There are 4 different characters to choose from and with all of them you are able to customize what they wear or slightly change what they look like. Each have 3 preset features head torso and lower body. In relation to these 4 characters is a long list of perks you can achieve with them. Some perks you get random some are specific to the character. For me it has made me genuinely like the character I play and only play for that matter (Dwight). With this long list of perks comes a plethora of different kinds of collectibles you can use in game such as tools offerings and add on's. All these things give you a slight or big advantage in the game. The game is being actively worked on and patches come out on a consistent basis. NEGATIVES As stated at the very beginning this game is essentially an early access disguised as a full and complete release. There are some cons that could and do ruin the game for people. The first one that comes to mind is the queueing system. If you queue with your friends which more than likely you'll be doing more than often every time the game fails to find you a lobby you have to manually select ready and queue again. It is indeed very annoying and frustrating since it already takes a decent while to find a game and you don't want to have to think about floating over the game to check if you need to ready up again. There are also a lot of bugs with queueing and connection as you will enter a game and find yourself on the escaped screen (end game screen) or you will disconnect. Personally I do not recall if I have ever disconnected but it happens to my friends fairly often. Speaking of connection every lobby you join the killer is the host so you WILL lag in some games you play. It'd be fair if it happened to everyone but it doesn't. It helps the killer catch you and everyone else much easier than what it should. In other words the killer has a huge advantage in this way. Another thing that is a very frustating thing about the game is that killers camp. Yes after you get wounded they place you on a hook until your health runs out and you are sacrificed. Usually with some decent players they can unhook you and you can escape. However killers will camp these hooks and there is no way to combat this in terms of having a perk or a certain mechanic in the game. This behavior as I think I should call it makes the game less enjoyable for everyone and instantly ruins your run you know your run is done if the killer camps you. This is all the negatives I can think about as of now. CONCLUSION Although the negatives look like they far outweigh the positives I still recommend this game. In the end I still have fun and have a for the most part enjoyable experience. What I think is that if you are the kind of person that likes to play a more than complete game and can't deal with essentially game breaking bugs and/or glitches this game is not for you. You will have to truck through the inbalance and bugs that are within this game. All in all I think this is a quality game and the pricing for it is very fair in my opinion. I recommend this game in general and ESPECIALLY to people that plan to play this with friends. A high 7/10 and it will only get better as patches come out.,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-16,0,0,61,False,Recommended,I really like this game. It captures the feeling of being in a horror movie and helps the player feel more immersed with the use of not only sight but also sound. My review will cover both the survivor aspect of the game and the killer. SURVIVOR The game puts players who chose to be the survivors in a great feeling of becoming hunted by a killer. They have the advantage of having 4 people to work together and outsmart the killer while completing the tasks at hand. I love playing the survirors but one thing I would like to see is diffrent objectives that they have to do inorder to open the gate that allows them to exit. Otherwise I like playing the survivors. KILLER I like how the killer is put into the position of a hunter. He is at a both an advantage and disadvatage. His advantage is that his goal is simple. But the killer is also at a great disadvantage because its a 4v1. But still killer is fun to play and each one has a diffrent style of play. I love the killer role also because each player plays diffrently. Some people like to camp while others like to roam. It makes the game more intresting to see how each player acts as a killer. Nitpick Sometime there are glitches like once my characters level progression got deleted back to lvl one from lvl 4. Also sometimes the game lags. None of this is so bad that it makes the game worse or harms it in anyway.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-17,0,0,5,False,Recommended,Did not have very long with the game yet to write a PROPER review. But within the hour ive played so far I enjoyed myself and can see further enjoyment with the game. Played a couple rounds as the survivor and as the killer. Each time you play the game changes bringing all new obstacles to the game. Ive played each killer so far and two different survivors. My favorite killer so far has to be the wraith killer the 3rd one added in. Graphics are ok but at the moment im only using a gtx 550ti as my 980ti had to be RMA'ed. Game runs smooth I havent experienced any lag issues yet. Games load realtively quick. All n all so far it seems to be a solid survival game. Its definitely worth the 15$,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-27,0,0,121,False,Recommended,I've been watching this game for some time and then decided to buy it. It's really cool but nowhere near perfect. Here is the judgement.Pros + original idea that inspired F13 The game and Last Year + sets up the horror atmosphere nicely feels really intimidating + variety of killers and survivors + each of them has unique perks and abilities + developers are adding new content + rewards for leveling up + bloodweb system + pretty well balanced + you can play as Michael Myers 3Cons HORRIFIC textures altrough this game runs on Unreal Engine 4 its graphics are average numerous bugs and glitches often unable to connect and somtimes it disconnects you from the game sometimes laggyAlso this game has paid DLCs but in my opinion id doesn't fit into any category. Each DLC cost 7 each gives you one killer + one survivor new perks and skins. I also cannot decide where to put price of the game 20 is kinda lot but in my opinion you get pretty much everything this game promises.Judgement This game is cool but it still has a long way to go in order to be great. Until at least the bugs and textures are fixed i cannot give it higher rating. But this game IS addicting and it'll keep you busy for some time.7.5/10,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-18,0,0,1017,False,Recommended,"Okay so I've read other comments and played the game myself experienced and bla bla bla.Time to rate.So the game has a simple concept Survivors need to escape but the killer needs to sacrifice them.This goes down a long path and seperates on the long path into more long paths.How to dodge the killer how to be tricky tricks tips and etc.So this game is very much fun but when I get teammates who just don't care about me hanging on the hook it's annoying.SECONDLYthe new update is just horrible.The nurse is just so OP. You can literally dash through the map and insta kill survivors because the teleport is insanely hard to dodge if you are against an experienced nurse. You can't escape from the nurse but you can't even ""duel"" with her. You can try to avoid her teleport by going close but this is the thing She can see you and hit you while on the way of teleporting and you can't all you see is a little white trail. Plus the wall passing ability is bs. It's just too op. If they nerf my opinion will change but for now the game is a bad game because of the 100xjoin lobby button presses and the nurse.ay don't take me seriously I probably had 200 hrs in the game and I was salty as boi nurse isn't op ok go awaythough teh game is good the updates are bad. Wait did I just read ""out of beta stage""?(insert heavy laugh)Nope. This is not even beta stage early access tbh. And man does this game gonna ever get a larger discount? I hope so. I'd buy the game but those 18 99 s are a lot for a simple game like this. Maximum price should be 15 and maybe get atleast a 50% DISCOUNT!!!So um prices aren't a problem but it is for me. Because maybe HUF is like idk stone against diamond? bear against fly?But overall the game is good except for some bad updates they or he/she need to think the updates through more and more.

2016-11-27,0,0,995,False,Recommended,My view of this game has changed alot from the last time I reviewd this game. This game is fun to play for a couple of hours but after that it can get frustrating becuase many players both killer and surivivors may play in a way that you may not like. Playing with people with your same level if fun but when it goes above that or under it becomes anoying or even boring to play. A good group of survivors can win most games because of the comunication factor and killers may camp the kill if they feel like it but if you decide to comit to this game and spend time playing it you will always have a soft spot in your heart for the game. Might be buggy sometimes unfair or who knows but aslong as you don't take anything to heart and just be you then you will find yourself spending alot of time playings this game. I wouldn't recomend this game to EVERYONE but only people who I know will enjoy it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-04,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,I like this game.... a lot.So why you might ask do I not recommend the game.It's simple.This is a game about a killer trying to kill 4 people. Simple. His tools are his powers his weapons and hooks a local god/devil/demon entity provides. So far so simple.In a game. About a Killer. Trying to kill people. Should what never happen?That the friggin people you try to kill actually bodyblock you into oblivion. Literally. Survivors can run circles around the killer bodyblock him from getting people or hanging them and all of that they do completely unpunished. No literally unpunished. As of right now the survivors have far too many tools at hand to fend off the killer. Which would be fine if the killer wouldn't need 2 hits to down someone and then take a stroll through an insane asylum to find the nearest hook... which by the way the survivors can destroy except 4 who are in really hard to get to places. Playing it as a group of 5 in a private match super fun. Playing it alone and trying to kill people ing frustrating to the point of quitting. Save your money or play in private matches as 5.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-02,0,0,22,False,Recommended,This game has a great amount of potential... But that potential is not there just yet. I have a laptop with 8 quad core i7s and even on the lowest graphic settings I can get 25 fps (tops!) And although that is a personal issue there are many issues in game that can easily ruin every game you play all relating to the survivor. First off if you get downed as the last survivor and the killer decides to dance around you there is no benefit to healing up your character nor moving anywhere. You will be trolled until you bleed out. Secondly and this is a big one when the killer puts you on a hook the killer will puppy guard your dangling body waiting for either you to die without anyone nearby or for someone to try to rescue you which will get you and that said player killed... not fun at all. And while on the topic of being on a hook attempting to pull yourself off said hook is a joke! Out of the multiple games I've played in Dead by Daylight I have only seen ONE guy free himself. and he had a perk to help him. Enough of hooks *shudder*. The last thing I feel needs to be improved is the teamwork or lack thereof. Teamwork implies a group of people (the survivors) working together to achieve a common goal (escaping). Playing with random people usually means they will not help you. They will 3/4ths of the time stay away from hanged people and if the killer is after them try to put the weaker players in the killers crosshairs. If you are unsure if you want this game or not my answer is do not get this game NOW but always keep an eye on it. With the right patching this game can be the next great horror game. But as I mentioned at the beginning this game has a lot of potential. To give a good comparison this game is like Tom Clancy's The Division's the Dark Zone after the gear score update and could be much better with the right tweaking. Don't make this review a final decision for if you want this or not. I still am happy with my purchase but not with SOME features.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-06,0,0,386,False,Recommended,"BE WARNED!!! This game has a lot of issues. Issues that for some can make this game unplayable. The servers are P2P. Which for those who don't know instead of connecting to the GAME you are esentially connecting to other players which is highly unstable and often results in massive lag. In. Every. Game. You. Play. And if you are ever the killer and any lag happens... expect a lot of hate and death threats in your comments. Check my page for proof.... I play this game with friends and when trying to join a game instead of the lobby constantly searching for a game until it finds one it says ""Failed to join game."" and Every time that happens each friend I play with has to press ready again. This wouldn't be a big deal if it was about 3 times we had to ready up. However you have to do this about 20 50 times before finding a game and sometimes if a game is found one of your friends is kicked out randomly. These are the biggest issues. It definitely feels like it should still be in alpha. There are so many problems that it hurts me because the concept is the most amazing multiplayer concept I have seen in years. HOWEVER!!! You probably have seen many reviews not recommending this game because of all of these issues. I will tell you. Me and my friends persevere because it is so incredibly fun when it actually works. If you can have the patience to deal with these problems than get it... because it'll be worth it.",Dead by Daylight

I decided i would treat her as any other killer and try to advoid her as much as i can.Moving on to the end of the game. i was almost done with the generator 2 people have died and the huntress no where to be seen aswell as the other surviver. I missed my last skill check and all the sudden the huntress was near. I ran away from my generator trying to be as sneaky as i could be but to her luck she saw me. she ran towards me while i ran away from her (even tho i just wanted to hug her). I may say i didnt care if i lost now. I felt a weird connection to her. I stopped running standing on one side of a pallet while she stopped on the other side. We starred at eachother for a while. the other surviver had fleed and we were alone in the map. i stood up and walked to her while she still was standing still. we now stood face to boob and not one tried to either run or attack. Then she turned around and ran toward the exit. she stood infront of the way out where she nooded. Was i suppose to walk out? we both knew that we couldnt walk out the gate together.. Her last wish was for me to live my life so she let me go. she could have killed me if he wanted to but she didnt.

Also it seems almost impossible to escape a monster once they've spotted you even if you use the traps and windows. But despite all this I had fun.6 7/10.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-16,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Great concept I love the gameplay! However the p2p connection concept here is horrible! Horrible load times going into games and sometimes would get kicked out of the room. I know it's not internet speed either I have 100 Mbps speed. They need dedicated servers! Not everyone has a system capable of handling such a load.It just sucks when you load up to play and you spend 30% of your time waiting for the room to load versus actually playing and I'm not really exaggerating. Load times were well over 10 mins in some cases. I timed them that's how bad they were. That's a huge wait to only play 20 to 30 mins.I'll still recommend the game because when it is actually played it is really fun but expect to wait awhile for the room to load.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-03,0,0,116,False,Not Recommended,"As fun as this game was when i were finally able to get into a game with my friend in public and might i mention that those were the only times that playing the game was actually really fun there are so many flaws and bugs in this game that whenever you go in a game and this is without exaggerating there's a 50% chance that you'll encounter some sort of bug in the game that either gets you killed or leaves you frustrated as to why people are charging money for this severely underdeveloped game.It's very clear that this game TRIED to focus on some sort of fair ish gameplay and almost competetive ish like gameplay between the killer and the survivors.The reason i'm emphazising ""TRIED"" is because it miserably fails at it and is left half way while combining the worst of both worlds.I'd like to go more into detail as to why i feel this way but honestly... there's so much wrong with this game and so very little that's right with this game for me to even start.To sum it up After a few matches you'll start to get the feeling that this game is still in the very early beta stage which in all honesty i think it actually is and that the developers all know that it is as well. The only reason it's released is because we as consumers have ridiculously low standards.If you're okay with the way the game is set up and you're in it with a more...competitive manner in mind then you'll be disappointed (unless you're lucky) seeing as they're constantly trying to shove unfair advantages down our throats by encouraging us to use addons/offerings every single game and which ones you get ofcourse is completely random meaning that the outcome of a game more or less depends on how lucky you were when you opened up your blood tree.The fact that you're not even able to group up with your friends to play online is ridiculous. People who have played it might try to bring up the argument of ""HURR DEY R TRYIN 2 MEK IT FEIR SO SURVIVURS CENT COMMUNICET DURR"" okay so what you're saying is that they're focusing on fairness between the Survivors and the Killer? Which is then contradicted by the fact that this game relies HEAVILY on how lucky you are with the perks you're able to purchase in the blood tree.Imagine a team of survivor and just 1 of them having the sprint perk and the Killer's been unlucky with his blood tree and he has something like Deerstalker.. Yea no that one guy he's gone don't matter if you on his he gone.Oor a team of survivors with a perk like ""HURR WE CEN SEE DUH BEAR TREPS WITHIN 2 METUR REDIUS"" while their killer is someone like the Wraith with the crow perk yea no they're all ed. Every single Survivor? Yea dead. Just dead.I mean... one positive is if you actually have an abundance of friends with this game and at least 3 of them are ready to play 24/7... then yes by all means it's only like 20 bucks or something and you'll probably have a good time.If you DON'T have 50 friends with this game then skip skip skip save your money for drugs and alcohol and your next door stripper",Dead by Daylight

I will not name anything positive about this game because it's pretty obvious that if the game din't have these problems it would be a 10/10... it really is that fun... but NOT with these problems this game in its current state is at most a 7 out of 10. and possibly not worth buying at this moment consider waiting a month or so before they fix all this stuff don't keep feeding these guys more money for no reason. 1. NO group queue available for ranked play so if you wanted to play ranked with friends like it's meant to be.. you're outta luck you CAN'T.(biggest problem with this game)2. in the settings menu you have VERY little options available.3. you CANNOT change any of the key binds you don't like crouching with left control key? too bad get used it because you can't change it... you can't change ANY of the binds.4. there is no way of communicating with other survivors once in the game no hand cues no voice chat and NOT EVEN a team chat where you could simply type and let the other survivors know if they should come for a rescue or if the killer set a trap in front of the hook etc... no communication AT ALL inside the game. technology not there yet i guess?,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-01,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,I've spent a lot of time reading about this game and got excited for it's gameplay. But once I started I found out very quick that it is an extremely difficult game to play.What I mean by difficult is that the game teaches you by reading tons and tons of text explaining the game. I personally found that once I played actual matches that there was a disconnect from learning the game and playing it. This game desperately needs an AI mode where you can train as a suvivor or as a killer. But all in all there is too little in the early game to keep me interested in leveling up to get better gear. I get matched with players that have way more stuff than I do both as killer and survivor. Makes it nearly impossible for me to feel like I'm progressing in the game. The game mode itself is extremely short. At least it seems to be in the early game. My advice #1 Get an AI offline mode#2 Help us noobs learn in other ways besides reading walls of text,Dead by Daylight
2016-09-10,0,0,1324,False,Recommended,its good fun however to have the best chance of surviving you need the top tier perks which you need to gring for. you can get by without them on new killers but the odd god will make you play yourself.

2016-11-09,0,0,814,False,Recommended,The devs can only do so much. Most people disagree with recent patches but I believe patches to the killer provide a more challenging game for both the killer and the survivors going against him or her. Playing with friends is fun but note that it CAN (not always) take over 15 minutes to find a match when queued with friends. the Dev team has taken note of this and will be working to fix these kind of things! Don't let these patches discourage you for the game is worth my 150+ hours and my $20.00!,Dead by Daylight

Only as 5 in Private lobbies in which you cant ''level up'' . Still if you are 5 or solo the game makes a lot of fun.

2016-09-17,0,0,51,False,Recommended,I main Dwight we 'ight. It's a great title that's basically the only good game in the genre. It's slightly buggy (nothing gamebreaking in my experience) they need to implement some more configurable game options and leveling up perks is a bit too grindy in my opinion. That being said I really enjoy the game playing as Survivor has super intense high skillcap competitive gameplay the game has a great soundtrack and solid graphics with a nice art style. These all culminate into an utterly chilling atmosphere and combining that with The Survivors intense gameplay can lead to some horrifying highlights. Furthermore it's highly rewarding coordinating plays with a group of friends. As for Killer it's also extremely fun but it s completely different. Playing Killer is much more laid back and is great for having a good time and relaxing. Overall the game is easily worth its price tag.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-24,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,"This is a great game!But don't buy it.Yeah the ranking system sucks but I never played it to be MLG survivor.being a survivor is USELESS. out of 30+ games I've made it out probably 3. The game ITSELF is worse than an early access game. You vault away from the killer to be downed once you cross the other side. You rubber band from place to place because the servers suck.You get saved and fly away off the map to be placed onto a different hook??? because the killer sees you on the ground.You open chests to fall off the map and say youve been sacraficed. YOU DON'T BOTHER SAVING YOUR TEAMMATES BECAUSE THE RISK REWARD IS SO LOW BECAUSE THE KILLER WAITS TILL YOURE DEAD. AND YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IN ANY WAY SAYING THE KILLER IS STILL THERE plus if they manage to get you off you cant outrun him and vaulting is too broke to lose him. best thing to do before a match is say ""spam m1 if hes camping you""YOU CANT EVEN HIDE BECAUSE YOUR VIEW MODEL STICKS OUT OF CLOSETS. but its not like anyones going to save you anyway.THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE SO FUN WHEN THEY FIX ALL THE But you'll be playing something else because this will be old news.

2016-06-15,0,0,155,False,Recommended,I'm truly sceptical on how long this game is going last here in Oceania before every server is empty usually the case is about a month or less with this type of game. But other than that the game is extremely fun when you're not getting kicked from lobbies or searching for one. I played as the killer for all of the BETA and it was extremely fun especially when you had clueless victims. Now on release I play as the survivor and if you're the paranoid type this game will definitely keep you on your toes. And when teamwork comes around and you find people who are actually willing to work with you the game is even better. In all honesty though if I were you I'd keep the $20 and wait to see how the game goes after time by that I mean how much content the devs decide to release if it's free and most importantly if people keep playing for what you would consider $20 worth if so then pull out that piggy bank mate.

2016-12-18,0,0,743,False,Recommended,Really love this round based game! The killer hunts for survivors and hooks to sacrifice them. 4 survivors repair 5 generators in order to open the exit. Though at first you find yourself hard to survive/kill but as your skill accumulates you know how to free yourself from the killer or how to catch survivors from the back. A highlight of this game is different killers and survivors have their own unique perks sabotaging hooks with bare hands for instance. Combining different items like toolbox or med kit with certain perks will make you an escape artist. Also you can provide offerings to the entity and it will reward you like prevents 3 hooks from appearing or grants you the ability to execute any one of the survivor. No worries about people will remember the spots because they are randomly assigned on the maps! The rule is simple escape or kill but various elements make this game glow.Death is not an escape ),Dead by Daylight

2016-08-25,0,0,96,False,Recommended,I really enjoyed dead by daylight (when i could get a game). They basically toook the concept of evolve but did it MUCH better. The only problem i have with it is that it takes forever to get a game because it only searches for a couple of seconds and if it doesnt find a game it says no matches found and you have to click search again which can get REALLY annoying. If they fixed the searching i would say it is one of my favourite games but i just get bored of waiting to find a game and its not like you can go watch youtube or anything cause you have to click search every 5 seconds.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-05,0,0,67,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game for me and my girlfriend and although we both absolutely love it I can't honestly recommend it. Why?The biggest issue is probably the fact that there are no dedicated servers or I assume there aren't because almost every single game is laggy. We have a 100mb connection and the problems are ridiculous. Survivors lagging out before the game starts me or my mrs lagging out whilst connecting to the lobby the killer lagging out within the first 10 seconds of a game. Even if no one lags out the connection is almost always terrible. In 8 hours of playing the game I think we've had 2/3 ""perfect games"" without lag or people disconnecting.I can look beyond the ""cheap"" tactics that the community uses I don't care if we win or lose the atmosphere of the game is superb and being chased by the killer is intense. There's no other game that I can sit playing with my mrs in silence and then my pants because she suddenly screams because the killer is chasing her. This is honestly one of the best multiplayer games I have played in the genre if not the best it reminds me of the old Splinter Cell Double Agent multiplayer years ago (which also suffered exactly the same issues). Such a shame that the lag and technical issues spoil it.Tl dr Put your f*cking hands in your pockets devs and make dedicated servers it's not like you haven't made millions from your other games you're not an indie developer so there's no excuse.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-03,0,0,26,False,Recommended,"Alright I rarely write reviews but this ""mixed"" review status is absolute nonsense. Main complaints.Does the game have bugs? Sure. Lobby issues? Sure.

Think of all the triple A games released this year now think of how long it took those games to get fixed guess what those games had millions of dollars worth of funding behind them and multiple dev teams for each seperate glitch. Dead By Daylight is a tiny dev team and they release patches VERY frequently and they listen to feedback all the time so is it full of bugs and some bad game design sure but its being worked on and I'd like to see you come up with an idea like this AND make it a reality.If you got through all of this and 100 % agree add me on steam and we'll destroy enemy killers.",Dead by Daylight
2016-12-17,0,0,264,False,Not Recommended,Key note I would not recommend this game FOR NOW. I still play it however because the concept is good and I enjoy matches now and then.The main problem right now is that the game itself is riddled with bugs that the devs have not yet fixed. I got this game when it was newly released and while it was glitchy before it has since become worse.Playing a killer is relatively easy as you host the game. You can barely play a survivor now because you fail to join lobbies 90% of the time or get stuck on loading screens before or after the game starts.Hence I cannot understand for the life of me why there would be a free to play weekend for DBD when there are glaring issues with the game.Fixing this problem would change my review to 'would recommend'.Aside from that I feel like you have to rely on luck sometimes when playing this game. I feel like some perks or skills are imbalanced and make the game unenjoyable at times. I'm not sure if the issues I'm going to write about are actual problems that should be balanced as they might be countered by strategy or simply luck.&lt b&gt &lt u&gt Killer&lt /b&gt &lt /u&gt I've played only one round as a survivor against the hag.Was the last survivor and fixed the last two generators as I couldn't find the trapdoor.

Once I teleported over the map until the killer got me. And if the killer gets you he has you on the hook. He waits. You're done game over. Teamwork is crucial or so to speak a ""play with friends to succeed"" game. I enjoyed to play the killer much more than the victim. Unfortunately this game has only one mode and the mode itself doesn't provide a big scope of action. In its current state I wouldn't buy or recommend it.",Dead by Daylight
2016-12-18,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. To start off i only played this game during the 24 hour free period but these are my personal beliefs. The game is great when you can actually get into a lobby the problem comes from trying to get into a lobby. About every 2 times you try to join a lobby you will either get an error message of it will try to connect you to a lobby and 15 minutes later it will still be trying to connect you with no way of backing out leading you to exit and restart the game. Once you find a lobby it's pretty straightforward you ready up and a minute later you're connecting to the game. However if the killer backs out of said lobby before the game is finished loading you will be stuck waiting another 15 minutes before coming to the realization that it's not going to let you join. The lobbies are also generated off of killers being host which causes problems with lag sometimes i had this happen in about 4 of the matches i played as survivor. Now lets say you got into a lobby and a game with a killer and 4 survivors the game is tons of fun especialy when you get that feeling of juking a killer or saving a teamate from being sacrificed. To me the game is not worth the $20 dollar price tag when every other game you can't even connect to and have to restart the game. If these glitches were fixed it honestly would be a great game but after playing it for free im gonna take my money somewhere else.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-28,0,0,66,False,Recommended,This game has drawn me in pretty hard I have mainly good things to say but some negative as well. To start this game combines a cohesive multiplayer experience with a nerve wracking thriller. The game of cat and mouse between survivors and killers is a gripping experience that sets it apart from its competitors. This game employs a risk and reward system that drives it to be fast paced and dangerous. Repairing sabotaging and even healing can draw the killer down on you if you fail to perform the necessary skill checks. There is a fun leveling system in place that gives the player an assortment of items add on's and powerful perks that change the way the game plays. On the other spectrum their is a diverse cast of killers that all play differently giving the player options to tailor his choices to his preferred play style. There must always be some bad with the good ill lead this by saying that everything i list below is fixable non game breaking and has not ruined the game for me. The first thing is something I am sure the Devs know all about. The cheaters are a pox on this game whether it be cheats or exploits it seems like in 10 games you will run into at least 1 2 cheaters on both killer and survivor side. I'd love to see a dev crack down. The second thing nearly ruins the fun of playing a killer. The sabotage system needs to seriously be nerfed or a system needs to be implemented to balance it for the killers. In the first few minutes of the game every hook but the basement can be sabotaged easily by two survivors. Everyone has this perk now because it was on the shrine of secrets during a double blood point xmas weekend. Last night I played 6 games as the killer and to my annoyance i only had one game without a full scale sabotage on all my hooks. Im not a rank 1 killer these arent pros they are just normal players. Once your hooks are gone you can count on all players avoiding your basement like the plague and unless you have the final rank of Iron Grasp good luck carrying them all the way to the basement. If you do make that attempt you can count on them to run to the corner and let you hit them knowing that you cant take them back. You have a knife in your hand but are unable to use it to end them without the use of a single use rare item that must be pre placed. So you think. Okay I will just leave him here and go find someone else he will eventually bleed out. Wrong the other survivors automatically know where that downed player is at all times. You can camp him but they will just stay away and bring up generators. With the loss of all hooks the killer is left defenseless and with little hope of 'winning.' You can only just chase and attack as much as you can to try to Eke out extra points before they eventually escape. The killers need an option to combat this. The third and final Negative thing I have found about the game is a problem with disconnecting killers. This is real minor but if a killer disconnects early on in a match player ranks are not protected without getting enough points to maintain your progress to the next rank you will lose one tick. That is not really fair its not the survivors fault that the killer left. A great game for sure with a few fixable things I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys multiplayer edge of your seat experiences.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-23,0,0,393,False,Recommended,I love this game so much fauvorite game hands down. but every other week i come up against some sort of problem like daily i get the heartbeat problem. when i launch i also get 2 games and have to go to task manager and take off one of them. sometimes my anticheat is messed up. i feel they need to fix the problems but i really like the game,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-04,0,0,394,False,Not Recommended,"By far the worst match making i've ever experianced in a ""competitive"" game. If you're a new player prepare to be on constantly by vets with all the best perks unlocked while you're able to flop around like a fish with your one minor. I can understand match making issues with players ranking down but atleast let me play with players of a similar level that only have one or two slots unlocked.Other than that the gameplay is very frustrating too. I'm supposed to be a scary killer but the other survivors crouch in front of you to block your movement and can pretty easily 360 spin away if you actually try to hit them. The game feels heavily favored for the survivors especially if they are coordinated with voice chat. If a survivor is getting someone off the hook and is hit they should be interupted. If you want to play killer against a coordinated team it feels like you're a clown there for their entertainement and they'll BM all the way up to making sure you watch them escape.Honestly don't see what the fuss is about i'm sure it gets more fun after you get the OP perks but i'm not going to invest 60 hours for the chance at fun.EDIT* Now have the meta perks for most killers at 250 hours and the game hasn't gotten more fun. The devs are low rank survivor players and the game is HEAVILY survivor favored. They have so many crutches it's amazing. Really don't play this game as killer unless you like being on as the survivors can pretty much make you their for entire matches.",Dead by Daylight

2017-10-24,0,0,524,False,Not Recommended,honestly the developers dont care about the survivors the killers have no truly real downside for when a killer is camping or afk every killer i have come across always takes the game hostage minus a few good ones out there but most killers camp people that are on a hook even when they leave traps down they get the most over powered perk abilities and offerings and there are only like a few like 8 good survivor perks brand new part is a lie in the description and does not instant repair anymore he escape hatch cant even be found till at least 2 engines are done and you are the last one left if you play survivor be ready to have your hole rammed every chance the killer gets.and yet they say the huntress is abnormally slow but she is faster than the ing nurse freddy is supposed to have a speed penalty yet he is fast than ing sprint burst i mean at least make him have a long ish recharge for his dreamworld other wise there literally is no escape and he literally hits you through windows and catches up so god damn quick honestly put a ing recharge on his ability and i believe it works like the doctor because he was chasing someone and some how on another side of the wall i was put in dream world sure you gave us ways to get out but literally all the time its not like you get a chance to snap out of it. honestly pull your ing together developers. and help the ing survivors out for ing once. and now they pretty much killed flashlight use against the wraith oh sure you can still burn him but as soon as you do you now have less time to run away while he is stunned oh yea just give one of the fastest killers in the game more speed huh? because that just makes it so different from every other killer made now more speed for killers because survivors yet again survivors are ignored and only killers gain really good buffs and changes because you can tell the creators of this game only play as killers this is why people leave mid match is from all the bull from the buffed killers.

2016-08-05,0,0,721,False,Not Recommended,Incompetent DevsThis game just has so many issues that still haven't been fixed in a whole year. I'll just list a few problems with this game for you. When all the new items came out (in this patch) deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com most of them didn't work and some of them still don't. Infinites still exist Trapping under hooks was just fixed after being an issue for 6+ months (it was obviously an unfun mechanic that was hated by the community because it made it impossible to save teammates) If you bring an item into the game from your inventory and drop it you can't pick it back up There are lockers on maps that a killer can't open if a survivor is in it. You can get out of the Asylum map with a regenerating hook bug because they developers didn't remove the hitboxes clips.twitch.tv Lag is still a big issue because you can't see your flipping ping for some reason clips.twitch.tv Another funny lag clip clips.twitch.tv The lost save file bug that happened Flashlights are still bugged clips.twitch.tv They release paid DLC with a perk that doesn't even work (decisive strike exploit) Bugged pallets on some maps that the killer can't get passed. Released the new DLC with major bugs (Spark of Madness). The Doctor can swing while carrying a survivor and it doesn't have any effect on his movement speed. Also I've levelled up the new survivor 10 times and I have no perks/items/offerings. The new maps are terrible all maps are exactly the same (jungle gyms). Facecamping is still a thing This pallet bug that happens all the time. clips.twitch.tv Is it worth buying?No not really considering they keep releasing paid DLC when half the bugs and other bad things in the game haven't been fixed. I used to give the developers credit but I quit for a few months and they didn't change anything. I've had to deal with losing all of my progress a few times already but I just downloaded a save file off of the internet. Now with this recent patch I've started losing all my items for my killers.Edit Friday the 13th The Game came out a few days ago. Most people gave it a negative review because it had server issues (Dead by Daylight never had this because it doesn't have dedicated servers). I would put your money towards this game instead it has a better chance of actually being fixed loved and updated. If you're complaining about it being $40 Dead by Daylight costs more with all of the shít DLC combined.,Dead by Daylight

If you don't get into the game the system will kick you out and make you queue up again. Queue should not have to be entered multiple times the player should remain in the queue until he or she finds a game. Easy ways to exploit the blood system in multiplayer No blood given for playing with friends as the killer. (And while I realize that allowing this would allow some serious exploits they could have given a seperate bloodpool for offline play so you and your friends can still play together and level up in a different manner.)Overall I think this is a great game but certainly not for everyone. I'd recommend watching some videos before you get it just to make sure it boasts the type of gameplay you're looking for.

It takes too long for games to take place. Why don't you reward players that press 'Quick Match??'2. I play mainly killer and i hate camping/campers. You fixed infinities so why don't you make camping not a viable strategy? It is anti fun and killers still get points because altruistic players do dumb mistakes. If survivers don't have infinities why do killers have camping?3. Why are killers unique but survivers are not? After you unlocked the perks you want you can just play Claudette.4.

2017-03-20,0,0,524,False,Recommended,"its an okay game. wouldnt say its 20.00$ more of a 15.00$ game. many players complain about waiting in lobbys for more than 15 minutes. it depends on what region your set inMost player's regions are in Chicago (that is if your in the US)as for DLC. 7 dollars for 2 playable characters new perks and a new map.map is playable for all the dlc perks can easily be bought at the shrine so its basically 7 dollars for 2 characters. which is okay price for players who have money to spend. Over'all i would have given this game the 8/10 it could have deserved but with the constant changes to the game keep in mind most updates that come out for the game are Changes. not many fixes to maps/balancing to perks and fixing glitches. my final review for this game would be a 6/10. For Updates 1.4.1 to 1.4.2 these two major updates solved alot of dead by daylights balancing problems.Iron Grasp is weaker Killers can now damage gens leaving no gen to 99% all the time.etc.for my final thought ""infinites"" now when on the surviving team most map layouts have what players call an ""infinite"" which is exploiting the layout of the map for your personal gain killer will end up catching the survivor but just ended up wasting time.",Dead by Daylight

2017-10-23,0,0,460,False,Recommended,I started playing this on a free weekend. I was not too impressed to start. After playing over that weekend with some friends i started having a lot of fun as a survivor. Enough fun that i bought the game. I am around 80 hours now and i still want to go back for more. It's most fun with friends. As far as balance I personally feel like Killers are over powered. When i play as killer (i don't much) i always get 3 out of 4 survivors on average and 9 out of 10 games i double (rank) pip. I also always gain about 30 50% more bloodpoints then any survivor. Between all the perks that give me half a$$ wall hacks as a killer and the bloodlust and lunge with 3 hooks at every corner i basicly never lose or do bad as a killer. Do the devs on this game want the killer to be this way? It feels like something is wrong here. That said a good survivor will still do good but ultimatly in the end it hardly matters. As for survivors? I see players who main as Killers every game say that survivors are OP. As a killer i never seen an OP survivor. As a survivor i am always feeling overpowered by the killer. That's just how i feel.To the Point It's a good game. Fun to play with friends.Community is full of Salt. Killers hate survivor players and Survivors hate Killer players.Mechanics are decent and simple to learn. Games typically last from 12 30 minutes.Graphics are good but not the best a bit glitchy at times. A few minor bugs.Killer is strong and survivors are weak. In the begining you will get sh*t on.(UPDATE)coming up on 300 hours and i am still having a lot of fun with this game. Aside from some things that seem a little broken I think they did a pretty good....job so far.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-27,0,0,866,False,Recommended,Super fun game and its hard the first few games you try but the further you get into the game the easier it gets.The characters unlike most games have different perks from everyone else. The survivors aren't just different skins to play as and you will need to test them all out to see who you like the most. Leveling up takes a while since you need a lot of points but all in all its worth it.Overall I really enjoy this game but its way more fun if you have some friends joining you even if it's just one.,Dead by Daylight

This game was gifted to me by a friend but i can say that i would have payed for it had i had the money. Some people have had network problems which i haven't had and a few things are unsettling such as the fact that after a game you have to recreate your party if you still desire to play with those friends.I haven't played as the killer yet and i dont desire too i like how it plays as the survivor so if you would like a full review of everyhting this game has to offer check another review but the pure luck you can encounter as the survivor always amazes me definitely a game i don't regret installing.,Dead by Daylight
2017-10-04,0,0,761,False,Not Recommended,This game don't get me wrong is somewhat fun for the first hundred hours or so until you have faced against so many campers and tunnelers that the game becomes a joke. The game idea is an amazing concept but the devs are so far up the killers behinds that no matter how strong they become they dont get nerfed. Each patch that is released the killer in some way is buffed making the game unfair to the point of you might as well just not play. You'll come across the second most toxic community the first being league of legends with the killers often post game saying you are noob for using the game mechanics that availble if anything is not to the killers like the devs are quick to change it so that is not in the game anymore. According to the killers the suvivors are over powered so they had many of the only defense taken out which was the pallets but no according to killers the survivors are always the over powered ones even though they move slower and cannot fight back dont worry the devs will quickly nerf the survivors more so that the killers can stop cryin. I would not recommend this game to anyone as it is not worth the 15 pound price tag also did I mention that all the killers that you pay for are incredibly over powered which makes this game a pay to win.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-17,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,I was very excited to get ahold of this game. There are very few survival horror games out there like this. The game is a good game but only if you ever get into a game. iv owned it for an hour now and have only got to play 2 games. both of these games lasting only about 4 minutes. It has great graphics and I wish they would have put more time into servers and the match making. Everytime you click Join server it just says it failed and then doesnt do anything. Huge let down.

2016-07-05,0,0,106,False,Recommended,I feel like its time to update this review. I still think this game achieved what it set out to. It is by far the best example of how to take asymmetricla multiplayer and make it fun. That being said it does suffer from a lack of variety and the devs have decided to introduce the same content they always have rather than to invent on it further. That's not a bad thing but I feel like it lacks staying power as a result. I would give this game with all the time I've spent on it a loving 7.5/10. It's a great example of how to build a good foundation but I feel that is has failed to iterate on that design over the years. Still worth picking up and playing.,Dead by Daylight

Survivor Pretty basic similar to most survival games SURVIVE by fixing generators and powering the exit gates for an escape or the good ol' fashioned hatch if you're the last alive drop down without consequenses.

2017-09-12,0,0,207,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight feels like two great games in one. You can play alone as one of many killers in first person view or as a survivor on a team of four in third person view. Each survivor plays very similar to the others while each killer is different enough from the rest to warrant lots of gameplay. Playing as a survivor is very intense and made even more fun when playing with friends. You may also choose a mode that allows a party of two to five friends play together where one is the killer and the rest are survivors. This mode is unranked and you gain no levels but everything is unlocked for you so you get to experiment with different builds and strategies for both the killers and survivors. For the price it is an amazing value.It isn't completely without its faults. With any online game you'll run into the occasional bad apple of the online community. Don't let this sour you on this game. Instead let a random disconnect put a damper on your experience. In the 14.5 hours I've played in the past week since picking this up I have not personally been disconnected but many of my friends that I play with have which really stinks for the survivors. The game can also be a little unintuitive making some knowledge almost impossible to learn without using an external resource such as Reddit. The UX leaves a bit to be desired but overall I would still highly recommend this game as it is fun enough to see past these minor gripes.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-11,0,0,348,False,Not Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a very fun game that I still can't recommend as it's still not finished. As of the date of this review you should consider this game early access.Gameplay The core gameplay is very fun when bugs toxic players or bad peer to peer connections don't hinder the experience. I find playing both sides to be challenging and rewarding. I personally like the killer because of the frantic nature. However I still enjoy the careful and thoughtful play required to win as the survivor. Both roles can be surprisingly tense and I love it. The ranking system is stupid. You are penalized for being efficient as both killer and survivor. As the killer if you find everyone and do a good job of chasing them down never letting them escape you get far less points. It may even be possible to kill the entire team and get deranked (I know it was before the patch that increased some point values). As a survivor you're heavily penalized for doing well. For example I soloed three generators opened the exit gate and healed another survivor without getting spotted once. I even waited for the killer at the exit which is a cheesy way to get some bonus points for being chased and escaping. I got 9 300 points which is 700 shy of ranking up. When you come up short of 10k not only do you not gain rank you actually derank meaning missing out on a few points will cost you two ranks. You'll often see survivors repairing generators after a match where the killer was dominated because they know if they escape they won't reach the 10k thresthold and will be deranked. Controls Functional but with issues. The fact that there is no keybinding certainly doesn't help matters. No crouch toggle either. My main issue with the controls is how fiddly it can be sometimes when there are multiple things to interact with and those actions share the same input. As a survivor it can be difficult to disarm a bear trap under a hooked survivor because depending on placement you sometimes have to back up a little to find the sweet spot where the unhooking prompt goes away and is replaced by the disarm trap prompt. As a killer it can be tricky to pick up a downed survivor next to a windows as &lt space&gt both picks up survivors and steps through windows. It can also be difficult to find the sweet spot when attempting to pick a survivor up who is caught in a bear trap. I'm sure there are more examples but the point is there are too many actions assigned to the same inputs which creates problems.Graphics Pretty meh. Muddy textures a very aggressive depth of field effect (probably a style choice but I find it obnoxious) level geometry pop in is pretty obvious as well. I wouldn't say it detracts from the experience too much except for perhaps the pop in.Sound Excellent. Stellar. Masterful. Praise worthy. The music the sound effects. The ambient sounds. Top notch! I'm glad they nailed this because sound cues are very important in this game. If you don't play with headphones you're missing out and putting yourself at a disadvantage.Technical A hot mess. No rebindable keys. Very few graphics options beyond presets. I experienced several in game crashes until I tried unplugging my controller (played with KB+M but had my 360 controller pluged in). I've also had the game freeze on the menu 4 times. Terrain clipping issues. Animations will decouple from time to time. Lousy peer to peer connections. Failed to join game failed to join game failed to join game. I'll say that it hasn't often been something game breaking but a lot of little things that make this game feel like a beta or early access.Story No lore explained in game. Go check the website if you actually care. Personally I don't give a toss.Community/player base Highly cancerous. This has nothing to directly do with the game yet it's important as this game lacks any kind of single player mode. There is a very vocal segment of the community who is upset because the devs removed some crutches such as OP perks and some unintended exploits that allowed people to play survivors recklessly and without having to worry about being spoted by the killer. It feels as though that sentiment has bled into the gameplay as people disconnect (aka DC) as survivors all the time. Not only does the killer lose potential points but it's not fair to the other survivors because even if that person is likely or guaranteed to die staying in the game for as long as possible helps the other survivors. Killers DCing is even worse. There are killers who DC just before the survivors escape and while they don't get deranked they do get cheated out of an earned rank as well as they points they would have got for escaping. The devs tried to fix the issue by penalizing DCers and rewarding killers with points for a DC however as far as I know people are still able to do it without penalty if they DC in a certain way. Regardless DCs happen a lot. My last 4 or 5 matches somebody DCed. DCing can also cause weird issues for the killer in the time between the cheating scrub pulling the plug and game updating the scrubs status to DCed. I once was stuck in front of a hook for about a minute because the scrub I was carrying decided to DC as I was hooking him. I couldn't move or even look around until the game sorted itself out. PROTIP If you don't want to play the game in the way the developers intended and you disagree with the fundamental concept as they've laid out in their Twitch Q&amp A then uninstall the game and play Domination in Call of Duty if you want to rush around capturing objectives. I don't often play as a survivor anymore as I've found I like playing the killer more. When I do play survivor I die... alot. Most of the time it's because I made a bad decision or got outplayed. Sometimes it's bad luck. Deal with it people. Stop your whining and ""git gud.""Conclusion It's a fun game with meh graphics and amazing sound design. If you're OK with early access then I'd recommend picking it up. If you expect a released game to be finished then wait until things have stabilized and basic features are added with bugs fixed. I will update this review/rant when I feel the game is suitable to be sold as a finished product.404 out of 10. Would get DCed on again.",Dead by Daylight

If you are thinking of purchasing the game I suggest you wait. The developers need to address the weird balancing issues the lack of a party system the strange survivor/killer rank system and the lack of consequences for people who DC early to avoid giving the killer points. Give this game a few months before you buy it unless you have 4 or 5 friends you can play with.,Dead by Daylight

First time making real review about any game.Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer horror game which you can play with friends / solo / premade lobby for fun.

2016-06-20,0,0,364,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is Awesome! It's 4 v 1 and there are no bots or singleplayer. While the game has a few glitches and crashes it still holds true to what I hoped and envisioned for this game to be. Please pay no attention to the negative reviews regarding being able to play with friends online. Those people writing the bad reviews would be the same people writing a bad review if friends were able to join. Communication with teamates during this game would ruin it. If you want to play a survivor horror with your friends go play the million other games out there in which you can. Dead by Daylight has elements in the game that are meant to make the player extremely anxious nervous and panic. My wife son daughter and I all take turns playing this on the big screen as it works well with the steam controller. We all scream when we're being chased!Again don't listen to the bad reviews about being able to play with friends or how the killer just camps the hooks. It's all strategy. If the killer camps the hooks it leaves time for the remaining survivors to get some generators. The game is very well balanced and the graphics are great. I can tell there was alot of work put into this game by Behaviour and this is with no doubt a successfull launch! 9/10P.S. Thank you Behaviour and Starbreeze! For Father's Day we got to do what I wanted to do all weekend and that was play Dead by Daylight!,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-09,0,0,65,False,Recommended,Alright real talk time. I love this game to death (pun intended) But unless you have perfect internet connection 100% of the time do not spend your money on this game. I've spent more time failing to connect to games then I have actually playing in matches. And when I do get into a match the chances that I will be able to accomplish anything for my team other then being a punching bag for the killer are so small that I've gotten used to it at this point. This is an amazing game with brilliant ideas but the amount of problems that come up from the connection issues for those of us who can't afford perfect internet needs to be fixed before I would feel good about telling my friends to buy this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-20,0,0,119,False,Recommended,"This Review is after 15 hrs of play and 1 month of the game being out THIS GAME IS A TON OF FUN but there are multiple issues that have yet to be patched Matchmaking is very good for if you are matching alone. The newest feature ""Survive With Friends"" is still glitchy and takes a very long time to match up with a killer if you try to match with 1 or 2 other friends. If you match with 3 other friends as a full team of survivors killers tend to leave the lobby and drop everyone out to the main menu rather than going back to the party lobby. There are a few game glitches such as falling out of the map or getting stuck in the map occasionally. On top of that there are times where your Bloodpoints are counted up but you don't get them after you leave the match.Overall the game is very good for its price and how long its been out. The devs have been very responsive to the community and have been releasing patches to fix the game. I highly recommend this game if you have a friend or two to play with.",Dead by Daylight

Being messed with because people want to rank up is SO BORING.All your firends are dead? Hide in a corner till the monster quits.Already have the exit open?

2017-09-14,0,0,571,False,Not Recommended,"Bought this game beginning of early access. Had over 70 hours played before I was able to complete my first match. 1.5 or 2 years later and I can finish about 30% of my matches now at best. Have never succesfully completed a match that I burned party streamers for every single time I get a crash to desktop. That's on a 6 year old core i5 on an asus z68 board with a radeon 380x and the new rig I built is a core i7 6800k 16 gigs dom plats ram evga mobo and evga gtx 1070. Exact same results on both. Took both rigs with me on my vacation to portland oregon and even on comcast roadrunner and fios game has the same damned problems. This game is STILL not in good enough shape to be out of ""early access"" over a year after ""release"". Then it came out on console and it's an inconsistant mess even worse than pc. Yet they are still deleting support threads warning people about this game let alone answering any of the threads asking for help with anything other than the auto generated response. This company does not deserve to have a game on the market. All these problems reported by so many people for so long and they are still cranking out paid fluff dlc as fast as they can rather than fix things. Don't be one of those morons that thinks a game company this small and with this little capital can afford to do both competently. Just look at the way this game's been handled and you'll see the proof of that. And even when it works it has swapped it's polarity so to speak. It started with the killer being the strong one and the survivors had to really out think the killer to escape. Now people play like blind drunk chimps and walk out with 2 pips even if they don't survive. literally a dozen or more ""no brain no skill"" perks have been released for survivor but not killer. A 200% bloodpoint buff perk was put into the game right before a 3x exp event survivor only then decided they were gonna nerf exp perks before giving the killer a taste of the same thing. Pays to be survivor in this game. Then did another 2x exp event before the nerf lol. You wanna play this game and get the survivor feeling we got in the beginning when it actually worked? Play killer. They are the ones that get bullied they play the entire game perfectly and they can still get crap for points and 1 pip they are the ones having to really work at it are constantly stressed and have to deal with a survivor community that is now used to being treated like kings so they are so entitled they think they have the right to tell killers how to play even after chasing off so many killers that the survivor queue times are now 4 times longer than they were just 6 months ago.

Although if you like doing either of those things in the company of friends... well you better have atleast 4 other friends with 20 bucks in their pockets.TLDR Good game would recomend if you like to play soloThe week leading up to the launch of this title I was very excited. Watching a multitude of streamers play this game with their friends made me wish I could do the same. The hype was real. When the game went live a friend of mine and I bought this game anxious to cower in fear at the likes of machette clad macocists. We then spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to play together. Surely there was an ""invite a friend"" option we were over looking. After hosting and rehosting lobbies we discovered no such option exsists... What a let down! Dead By Daylight seems like the perfect platform to have a real horror shared experience with friends but the only way to accomplish this is in a private game. To me this seems like a huge over sight. Now understandably I can see the developers side of this decision. Sure playing this game as a survivor with a friend could lead to some already unbalanced game play however I think that the whole soul of this game revolves around surviving as a group and what better way to experience that than with a friend. In my opinion if the developers were worried about competetive balance they should have just made the match making system allow friends and then work on developing a more competetive game mode in the future.Rant aside let's talk about the game. Overall i really enjoy the game. The ambianceis perfect. The maps are creepy the character modles are pretty terrifying and the mechanics are pretty solid. The feeling you get as a survivor being chased through a cornfield by a psycotic chainsaw massacre ist is second to none. Likewise hunting survivors as a nearly invisible wraith is awesome. Sure there are some balance issues that are being addressed that is fine. I am happy that the developers are quick to patch this title.Dead By Daylight is certainly worth the money with one caveat I hope you like playing by yourself! I however do not and will probably not be playing this game too much until i can actually match make with my friends or somehow convince more of my friends to make the purchase.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-28,0,0,32,False,Recommended,It's a really fun game Survivor or Killer. Most of the problems people have are just them not being that good even the perks that most higher levels have don't affect the game that much. I as a killer have been capable of killing someone who has four perks while I have none. As a survivor I've been able to escape a killer with four perks while I only had a perk for chest detection. There really isn't any balancing issues in my opinion but there is one big problem I'm having. In the FOUR hours I've played this game I have crashed SEVEN times. I'm averaging almost two crashes on hour. It's probably just something to do with some kind of file in the wrong spot or missing one steam can't seem to catch with Cache Validation but it's almost unplayable for me. Despite the constant crashing I WANT MORE. Killing Running Hiding Fixing Trapping Chasing. It's all so satisfying nothing is greater than chasing that one annoying survivor who has saved everyone or fixed four generators already. Or juking the killer as the last survivor and spending ten minutes skulking about before you drop through the trap door It's a very fun game and I reccomend it I just hope you have better luck with the crashing.,Dead by Daylight

And as the devs continue to punish these players it becomes harder and harder to find a match. All this on top of the endless cheating (for which the devs care little) and this game becomes more frustrating with each day.There is a good game in there somewhere but as time passes the survivors become better and better with each perk and the killers become worse and worse with each patch. Matches now all flow the same the survivors get each generator to 99% and destroy every hook on the map. It's boring and very un scary to play as the survivors and infinitely frustrating to play as the killer.In the off chance the killer is pared with 4 bad survivors w/o the op perks its just boring. It's all feast or famine.",Dead by Daylight
2017-09-24,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,"Let me be upfront first. This game is very fun and keeps you on edge. It's fun to play the many different survivors and killers and experiment with their perks and addons during the game. Now I'm by no means and expert at the game but I can say it is worth buying. However I cannot give it a recommendation for one reason. The game focuses on the killer capturing the survivors and placing them on hooks to sacrifice the survivors to an creature called the Entity. This is a cool concept as you have a limited number of times you can be hooked (Or how long you can be on the hook) before you are emanated. The problem with this is in a 4v1 game this is taken advantage of by killers who camp survivors. Because survivors can get each other off the hooks easily they find it easier to simply camp and bait than to use their killers perks and a bit of skill to find survivors. Depending on the level of camping it makes it very difficult to near impossible to save your fellow players and results in the killer having an unfair advantage even with perks like Barowed Time (Which allows you to take an extra hit of damage before going down after a short period). I tend to see a lot of this in my games and in games on youtube and it's a very serious problem and needs to be addressed by the Devs now. They fixed all of the other issues that put killers at a disadvantage so how hard is it to program a system to punish a killer for camping? And I'm not alone in this matter as other fair players have pointed out these flaws. Worst the community has become quite bad to interact with because if players aren't looking out for themselves in the game then in the after game chat things can get quite heated and toxic.I have not experienced the dreaded progress wipe bug I see everyone talking about but I do have some issue with losing my progress. Especially if this bug has been around since the game launched and hasn't been fixed yet with over a year of time after launch. Also issues with lag losing rank when your internet crashes (Even though you didn't quit) and glitches in the system are among several other mounting issues.RING RING RING said in his review quote Don't buy. or if you do only do so for fun not to actually play ""competitively"" "" and I whole heartily agree with him. To be fair I intend to keep playing the game but I'm not supporting it any further than I already have.Also a message to the developers if your reading this. I love playing this game but I've seen and read about so many problems the game has that have not been fixed or addressed. Some of which I have experienced first and often. The rest such as the progress loss and your bad customer support center I hope I never have to experience as that would be a full deal breaker for me. I had planed to buy all of the DLC but until the game sees some improvement I'll not sink any more of my money not one more cent into the game until at least some of these issues are fixed.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-04,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,Great idea half executed by developersIs dead by daylight a worth a buy? Before you start reading this review please note that I am well aware that the game is still in an early stage. It should have been released as an early access in my opinion. I ve played the game for around 20 hours so I feel after that time that I've gained a good understading how the game plays out so I feel like I can write this review. Start So to start off I love the idea core and how the games looks but I do not find that is enough to justify the price or an purchase. I think that the developers have not been listening to the community and I m still extremely annoyed that matchmaking with friends didn t exist at the release It s such a basic function but it was still missing at release which I find incredible stupid. I love the core of the game and I haven t seen any major bugs other then some at the release of the game. From what I've seen most major bugs have been fixed. I m not going to get hung up on the bugs in this review because I ve found no major bugs that will completely ruin the experience. In this review I will mostly focus on the things which I find important content and balancing. Missing content after going back to the game when they added in matchmaking I still feel like the games is still missing too much content. To put it simply the game just feels to repetitive after a couple of hours. Personally I m not a big fan of third person in a game like this because I think it ruins the experience. If the game was in first person it would probably feel a lot more scarier at least the developers could have changed it so we e.g. when you hide in lockers you go in to first person. A game like this also need something like communication. I think dead by daylight would work very good if they added in direct communication so you can talk with your fellow survivors when trying to survive together. With direct communication there would at least be method for people to talk to each over a short distance. An idea I have is that the could e.g. could add in something like a walkie talkie which you could use to communicate. But they should make it an item you need to find or unlock in the skill tree. Something dead by daylight desperately need is different game modes other then just powering up generators and escaping. The developers have to add in more game modesotherwise everyone will just stop playing after a couple of hours.I would like to have to have do different objective under a certain time period to be able to escape or maybe even kill the killer by setting out traps. I have a lot more ideas that I haven t further discussed in the review but there is probably people with a lot greater ideas then me so we will just to have to see what types of games the developers add in the future.Pros Great idea Good core Different from most horror games Scary (could be better though) Cons Unbalanced perks mechanics A system which favors the killer Broken match making Bad optimization Lacks content Unstable hosts Not moddable I feel like some of the perks in the game are highly overpowered. A good example of this is the perk self heal which gives the survivor the ability to heal themselves. Perks of this sort has to be removed to make the game balanced. When match making and if the host (killer) leaves then all survivors are punished and loses points for leaving the game. If the survivors does disconnect then of course it is good that there is a way the system punishes the player for combat logging but what they need is to change it so that the host also gets punished when ending a match or losing connection. This is of course an easy fix but I feel like it should have already been implemented from the start. I haven t seen any hackers yet but I can imagine that there is no anti cheat system in place which might lead to some big problems later in the development. I m getting a constant 60 fps but I still feel like that it s way to low if you compare it to other game. I ve seen a big part of the community playing the game and having constant low fps. Something that also need fixing is the Unstable host because it ruins the experience while playing if everyone is just lagging. An easy fix to this problem is allowing people to host dedicated servers or before the game it checks everyone connection and chooses the best host. As you can see the cons outweigh the pros meaning that I find it incredible hard to give this an thumbs up. Conclusion My end conclusion is that the game isn t worth a buy because it lacks to much content and that the cons outweigh the pros. The core of the game and the idea was great but it was just poorly executed by the developers. I would have maybe recommend the game if the game was like 5 10 euros but I feels that I can t justify the price of 20 euros. I would give this game a 5/10. Extra I think if the implement some of the things I mentioned then I might change my mind about whether or not the game is worth a buy.Similar games If you haven t bought the game yet then I would recommend to check the game Friday the 13 which still hasn t been released.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-20,0,0,339,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE Camping is STILL not a viable or respectable tactic.Do something so that the killer can't camp the hooks. I've played for the past 4 hours today and out of the 20 something matches I had only 4 didn't camp the hooks. As a survivor I get up to 3 crows flying above me that giveaway my position if I stay in the same place. That's fair but the killers deserve something like this that deters them from just camping one specific hook. MIND YOU I don't have a problem with patrolling. Unlike camping patrolling is revising and hunting for survivors in the vicinities near me and still checking up on me to see if there's no survivors getting ready to pull some cheeki unhookings. Camping on the other hand the killer doesn't leave my general area OR just hogs one hiding spot and hides behind it. Waiting for a survivor to come and unhook me.This IS NOT how the game was meant to be played and I get less bloodpoints (and so does the killer) if they do this kind of thing. It's even worse when the killer is someone like leatherface or Michael Myers where they can one shot me with their attacks leaving me and whatever companion that's unfortunate enough to attempt to help me powerless.And I get it some of you will say that this does not warrant me to give the game a ""Would not recommend this game."" and I would agree if it weren't for the fact that every time I play this game I'm guranteed a bunch of matches with killers that camp.Dear Behaviour Digital P L E A S E do something about the killer camping.

Not gonna lie this would've been a fun game if it hadn't been for this release. I jumped over a wall and the nurse teleported right through the fence.. As if having no items or perks at the start was hard enough. Thanks to the free weekend for letting me have an experience of the game. I found the game very fun when it was a hunter that wasn't the nurse. But any game with the nurse just isn't fun as she can traverse through the wooden crates u throw down to get away.Update Played the game a bit longer. Being a survivor is pretty demoralizing people don't do objectives or don't go for saves. You can't say anything til after game.

Additionally it is glaringly obvious this is a set up to sell constant small dlc's to futhur take peoples money. Simple things could make some of these issues less bad.

2016-06-14,7,53,44,False,Not Recommended,Updated 29/8/16Note I've stopped updating this guide because the developers haven't made a decent patch yet.It s now been a handful of months since the release date of DBD and when I made my first review of this game.It s gotten marginally better but overall little has changed.1) MatchmakingMatchmaking is looking worse every update. Each patch the developers seem to break or cripple matchmaking times for a day or two before fixing it. Furthermore there is still no evidence of a calculation done for players when they match make meaning a totally new player can get matched to a very experienced set of player(s) that will make short work of them as a new player.An example from a match I just had http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 752856827Lots of new players find this very frustrating to be outmatched and outgunned so heavily. And from an experienced player side it makes games very boring and grinding.And yes the game is still P2P hosted so the killer has a big network advantage on you if he decides to plug his 200m Ethernet cable into their neighbour s modem. That is all assuming that you actually find a match. I ve been waiting in lobbies for 20 minutes with over 18K people online.2) BalanceIn terms of matchmaking little is being done about the overall balance of gameplay and how each side reacts to each other s decisions. There is still a lack of a push or pull mechanic meaning that games are over very quickly or very slowly depending on who has the better perks.The developers seem to favour the killer over the survivors every update the killer gets noticeable buffs while the survivors get nerfs or nothing at all. Last update the killer even got an auto aim feature for the lunge attack meaning you could lunge at a survivor as they turned a corner and majestically ballroom dance your way round the corner while lunging to hit them. This makes games very unfair for the survivor.There are maps themed around each killer the problem is that some killers are very useless on specific maps maps you have very little control over playing. This leads to very biased games which can be a stomp or very frustrating.3) ProgressionProgression is getting more and more tiresome each update. The progression tree is randomly generated which means you can get very lucky and get one of the most overpowered perks in the game early or get completely screwing and get one of the many broken or dysfunctional perks that still aren t fixed.If you love grinding games DBD is very much for you. Your rank will be reset every month as standard and the skill tree is full of clutter and fluff to bulk out levelling. You will get 1 perk per level on your tree but the rest of your tree will be add ons and other consumables that will buff you. The problem is you lose these after every game so the skill tree is flooded with useless consumables you need to buy before you get to your perk or more useful items.This means you could spend almost triple the value of the perk you want just buying the 3 or 4 add ons to get there. This would be fine if the add ons were useful. But many are not.Firstly the descriptions of the items are frustratingly vague. Slightly increases the chance of being sent to Autohaven wreckers when used Well what is this slightly you speak of? Is that 1%? 10%? 40%? More? Less?You can possibly find these figures on the wiki (if they are correct) but if they are on the wiki is it really so hard to put them into the item description? The answer is no it isn t . It is just lazy not to do so.Furthermore the value of perks seems to be all over the place.For this example let s say perk A is worth 3000 points it sits right at the start of the skill web.But then slightly further out you see exactly the same perk but it s worth 5000 points this time.What gives? It just seems like a ploy to get you to throw away more of your hard earned points to string out the progression more. The game lacks so much content at the moment that makes progression tedious in order to make the illusion that it s much more than what it is.4) Overall qualityThe main cause of all these problems is mainly the developer s choices. Update notes are very unhelpful containing phrases as vague as the add on descriptions. Adjusted the catch up speed for the Nurse no reference to what this means just a single sentence that really isn t helpful. There are plenty of other examples where the update notes are just increased or decreased . If the developers are trying to make this game some sort of e spot like they so badly are they really need to put more effort into their update notes.And yet game breaking bugs like getting stuck in objects will still get youhttp //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 752822872The developers also have a habit of addressing the symptoms of a problem and not the disease often completely missing the problem people have been complaining about and change something related to it instead. Like the way map exploits created safe zones for survivors so the developers made the killer s lunge much longer and let the non abusers have a miserable time trying to escape an impossibly long lunge rather than just boarding up the exploits or changing map design.Another example is how they nerfed many of the reward values for performing actions then they threaten players that farm points with permament bans. Even though in some games players get barely enough to rank up due to the nerfs.This game also has an anticheat but it commonly bans people for no reason and still allows cheaters into games.Conclusion This game should really still be in early access.The developers clearly have no idea what they are doing the game is progressively getting worse and more and more people are not playing each month. It has barely improved but has a very long way to go before it will be playable.By the time it gets to be playable the community will be so small that matchmaking times will be long enough to make people quit. Proof of decline http //steamcharts.com/app/381210Friday the 13th is on the horizon and that will most likely blow this show out of the water.The community is also pretty unbearable and technical support is borderline non existant and the forum page for it is a graveyard of bugs going back to the beta that are still not solved.Save your money and avoid.,Dead by Daylight
2018-02-17,1,14,1,False,Recommended,"Dead By Daylight is the ultimate horror themed online multiplayer game. The killers ooze with personality while the survivors not so much but I'll go through the important things about the game.*In case you are wondering ""Why only 1.4 hours in a multiplayer game?"" The answer is because ultimately I refunded it. It's a good game just wasn't for me.*The graphics are meh running the game in ultra settings I found the killers' models shine in the game everything else looks bland in comparison but the devs may have made it this way to highlight the killers. Maybe also so that anyone could run the game (not sure what engine it runs on but at least you'll know that lag will be a bigger concern than optimization).Sounds is amazing everything from the brushing through the cornfields rambling of the chainsaws footsteps and other effects create the atmosphere for this brutal af multuplayer game! The music is also on point.The gameplay is what you'd expect from a match based multiplayer game which has its rankings reset literally every month. It can be pretty chaotic and/or unbalanced. The game has events every so often which rewards players with cosmetics so that means there is alot of ""farming"" here where players can cheat the system.The game is focused on match ups and not so much skill so if you're a new player expect to grind grind GRIND before you git gud. After all you're going to need all the perks to be unlocked before you do well against people who actually know what they're doing. You will not win on skill alone just hope you picked the right perks to help assist your win.So I thought to myself should I be a part of this community when I don't have the time to put in hundreds or thousands of hours? I slept on it and refunded it as soon as I woke because I have a belief in which if I can't be 100% committed and excited about a mp game then I shouldn't be a part of its player base. I don't have the time or energy to put in even a hundred hours in one game so my answer was clear in the final moments.If you are a horror buff or a multiplayer gamer you should get this at least try it. I enjoyed the little I played but my heart wasn't in it. Doesn't change that the game is a great one for the hardcore mp community though. I thought I'd respect the player base and devs enough to write a positive review.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,0,0,344,False,Not Recommended,Game is fun at first but extremly unbalanced when you face people that know what they are doing.Survivor is contrary to the point of the game a side stronger than the killer's side.Get ready to be bullied all game by entitled survivors as killer and have a really bad time and when you finnaly catch up to them after breaking 20 pallets in the map see them escape from your grasp by the very balanced decisive strike perk sprint burst to safety (or a loop) and heal all by themselves.If after a 2 minutes chase 10 more pallets and several flashlights in the face you'll learn that you have to bury your face into a wall to carry a survivor and if you somehow manage to reach a hook they can just use the very balanced borrowing time perk to allow them to take a hit and not care at all. If if they don't and die be ready to be insulted in end game chat because you didn't behave like a bot and did well. Because all the killer really has is to be able to capitalise on suvivor's mistake. (If you don't agree i suggest you try playing wraith or freddy in rank 5)Also during the mid time the 2 3 other suvivors not being chased can just complete the objective of the game under 4 minutes.That sounds fun for you?It's not really for any side. Power should be on killer's side he's already 1v4. He's not feared it's not a horror game if survivors feel safe all game and have fun bullying the killer there is litteraly popular channels on youtube built around being toxic toward the killer.Edit game is showing some steps in the right direction but as in it's current state it's not as enjoyable as it should be. It's very cancerous and frustrating to playDouble edit And they plan on buffing the already strong enough survivors because they posted negative review and cried on the steam page if it goes trough and gen rush is still a thing i'm affraid i won't be able to bear with this game anymore.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-11,0,0,942,False,Recommended,I do not review often but I wanted to say this game is by far the best multiplayer horror game out there in a sea of failures. Granted there are still some bugs but the devs have been awesome about keeping up on them and giving us a Q&amp A Twitch stream on thrusday's to let us know what they are doing. They are awesome unlike other companies about not keeping you in the dark. If you want a fun game to chop up your friends or be a survivor and try not to get chopped up this is a great choice for that. The game has only done nothing but improve. We now have survive with your friends so you can team up too! Anyway I think if you were on the fence about this game it is time to jump on over and come play with us!Update I am gonna update and say I will still give this a thumbs up but the devs are listening to the community a little too much now and the game is becoming a bit one sided. Some bugs that have been here for a long time are still there. Not to mention the community is very toxic and little seems to be done about it. The game is still fun yes but it is very frustating at the same time. At this point in time I would say get it while it is on sale I would unfortunatly not pay full price for this untill a lot of things are addressed.,Dead by Daylight

This is what keeps me alive and have so for a while. If I were to advise further I would suggest you harvest every forsaken location for anything that might thwart the horrors that lurk within. And keep an eye on the gates. If they open you must flee. I hope my scribbles have not been in vain. If you find this lore make use of it and pass it on.

You either hide and fix generators (fun?) or you catch people and hang them on hooks (fun but repetative). That's it. The players might as well be bots because there's hardly any room for getting creative and doing something other than what the game has already defined as your only options.Good audio good graphics just lacking depth in the gameplay imo.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-26,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm more than a little masochistic. But sweet ing lord what the actual is this game and why are the developers not being roasted harder than ing EA by literally everyone?Let's start with the most obvious problem The game is fundamentally flawed due to the fact that I assume whoever made this thinks that 100 ping is normal. No it ing isn't stop giving me people playing as Killers who are apparently playing on dial up internet somewhere in western ing Siberia. Because I've hit ping of over 1000 in this and the game didn't autodisconnect me. That's a big ing ""No"".Next to the biggest issue Whoever is balancing this is doing it is absolutley ing awful at their jobs. First the survivors held all the cards so the Devs apparently took this to mean instead of ""Reduce the number of palletes on the map"" to ""Remove all but 5 pallets from every ing map"". Next each side no matter what rank you are will almost always use perks that can only be considered bandaids for bad game design. I've been hit by a Huntress who was between 5 and 7 meters behind me when she finished her lunge animation. That's not an exception either. And that isn't to say that survivors don't have more than their fair share of t including a timing based ""Get out of jail free"" card but when you have to rely on three variables those being killer skill survivor juking skill and the random spikes of lag suddenly deciding to hurl your halfway across the map only 1 of which you control your game is ed up the Another problem is the fact that with the exception of an EXTREME minority the fanbase of this game can make the elephant's foot at Chernobyl blush at how toxic it can be between Killers deciding to just let you bleed out instead of actually sacrificing you or Survivors doing a long list of things that would end up being about as long as that one SSBB fanfiction that broke a record not to mention the fact that the developers don't exactly ing help this situation. To read more of this click on this link because it does a better job explaining it than I ever could https //steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1698294337777387674/So let me put this politely If you actually want to shove your testes inside of an live blender just do that instead. It would somehow be less painful than playing this game for any protracted period of time. If you want a game with a strong community that is actually fun to play save your money and buy Borderlands. This game isn't horror unless your idea of horror is gameplay terrible game developers and a community that if you could turn their toxicity into a weapon you'd be arrested for crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. Or better yet buy Slay The Spire. It has exactly none of the above complaints and it actually requires skill planning and good execution in order to do well in. This game is also riddled with microtransactions including most of the killers and survivors who have perks that are actually worth getting.TL DR This game is cancer.

2018-04-18,1,5,351,False,Recommended,"What you are about to read could be considered biased but I guess that's based on how you interpret it.I really like Dead by Daylight. The game in itself is very likeable. The Survivor playstyle can be very tense and stressful at times based on whether or not you have a good team and whether or not the Killer is good. While the Killer is something I'd play if I want a relaxing game as I don't really mind whether I win or lose. It totally isn't because I want to satisfy some of my more inhumane desires or anything like that.Anyway I know people don't consider buying this game because they believe the players are really toxic. Well isn't that just a given with online multiplayer Video Games? I mean in every online multiplayer game I've played there has always been a toxic personality of sorts. While you may not consider yourself toxic you won't really know until either someone points it out or you go back and look at how you reacted. Another reason people don't consider buying Dead by Daylight is because they believe it's filled to the brim with glitches. Now I can't really prove that considering I haven't really experienced any as far as I know anyway. Isn't that saying something though? While the glitches exist they really aren't as common as people imagine them to be. And again glitches exist in all games some just more common than others.But you know what people are really forgetting? The fact that Behaviour Interactive started with around 30 40 people working on Dead by Daylight and have around 70 80 people now. This is based of the information we got from the video ""This is only the beginning."" And since Behaviour Interactive is working on Deathgarden who knows if the 70 80 people value is the amount of employees currently working for Behaviour Interactive or the amount of people within Behaviour Interactive that are dedicated to working on Dead by Daylight. And if you were willing to go further then that based on the title of the video mentioned earlier just assume that the last year or so that Dead by Daylight has been out we were just playing an Early Access version of the game.So cut Behaviour Interactive some slack. They started out small and were still able to produce a wonderful game. If you think they aren't working hard enough remember they are still considered a small developer company when compared to other companies that have produced a game just as successful if not more than Dead by Daylight. And they're also working on another game right now that game being Deathgarden which I mentioned earlier. If anything it isn't Behaviour Interactive destroying the game or it's reputation it's the players.Let's end on a good note shall we? Here are two jokes about Dead by Daylight I really like ""I think we did a pretty good job so far.""""Behaviour Interactive! There's a game in your bug!""P.S. I probably won't read any comments you post. Sorry. It's more because everyone has opinions and someone will probably have one against mine. It's one of the main reasons I stated that the review could be considered biased. If you do write something rude/mean about me just so you know I pity you. How come? I feel sorry that you can't say anything nice to someone or learn to keep your mouth shut if you believe what you say might hurt the other person/parties feelings. And if you believe you can say anything over the internet without fear of repercussion I pity you even more.EDIT Disabling comments just because I can. Tired of Killer mains complaining.

2017-09-15,0,0,504,False,Not Recommended,Why is MLGA a good addon to use to block killers? What if you encounter a killer who is not laggy in the lobby but becomes extremely laggy in the game and you don't want to play against them again.. well you used to be able to block them using Make Lobbies Great Again so you would know if you connected to them in the lobby before the game even started but now the devs have blacklisted that feature so it is possible to become banned while using it. Giving a negative review until they make MLGA (Make Lobbies Great Again) not a bannable addon when it had been whitelisted for ages simply because they do not like people using the IP blocking feature that has been in the addon since it's inception. Now they don't want people using it because there were dumb people using it to block killers playing as The Nightmare Freddy and I can understand the author of the addon being P.O.'d that they're asking him to remove the IP blocking feature causing that feature to be bannable when it has been around forever.For those wondering MLGA lets you back up your saves because the devs couldn't fix that very game breaking bug in a timely fashion (and still have not for another month or so) and gave you a ping indicator against survivors or killers and let you favorite or block killers or survivors that were people you didn't want to play against or wanted to play with in the future.So if you want the devs to whitelist an addon again that was always whitelisted but can now get you banned then let your voice be heard please. IF Make Lobbies Great Again's full functionality is no longer bannable I will finally change my review of the game and all of it's DLC that I own to positive. I know the developers try their best and listen to the player base but this is something they should leave alone and let players use if they want. Not every survivor wants to play against a laggy killer across the world. This is rhetorical but how does the game require you to log into it's dedicated server to access the game but then have the killer host and if the killer is across the world in lagsville then you as the survivors suffer? And now without MLGA's blocking feature we have no way to combat this. The only thing we can do is maybe disconnect but that is a crappy move to do and it removes a lot of your rank anyway.Keeping my past review for archiving purposes when I bought the game in September 2017 until they allow the full features of MLGA to be used again Connection ErrorConnection ErrorConnection Error5 6 hours laterConnection ErrorConnection ErrorConnection ErrorDuring Free Weekend Friday Evening... Seriously? Dev's release DLC before fixing issues I rarely see in other games on Steam. I see they know it's an issue currently on Twitter but doesn't seem like they're working very fast to show their dedication to their own game.Played for 2 days straight almost and had a ton of fun. Then the game wanted to update in the middle of a free weekend to introduce Leatherface which is cool except the update wouldn't update and it broke my game. It took me a couple hours to realize that the only fix was to just uninstall and reinstall the game with the new update. Now it is saying Connection Error on the main loading menu even though I just played earlier today.. so now after checking online for no answer I am going to attempt to uninstall and reinstall AGAIN. Probably the buggiest game on Steam to play but when it does work it's a LOT of fun. Just wish the devs could get this stuff working properly.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-28,1,4,682,False,Not Recommended,Fix the game now. You literally added a killer that can THROW axes please tell me you're joking stop giving the killers all the buffs. What the hell are you all doing ing stop please im literally about to quit the game because it's nothing but buffs for the killer and de buffs for the surviviors. Killer mains dont say anything under this because you know it's true it's literally stupid how we are completely defenseless besides the useless flashlight and pallets. please the killers needs to be fixed. something that can like kill the killer. I understand you're supposed to be defenseless to make it scary but this is literally getting to the point where it is ridicoulous and no a peice of glass (decisive strike) does not count as a weapon. I'm literally losing all hope in this game please just try and balance it out instead of letting the killers cry and get buffs but for the surviviors to get debuffed. I understand it's 1v4 ig but like I said we can't even fight back so it's basically a 1v0 and please fix camping morons i know you tried with the victory cube but that seems to not be working. If you had to where the killers can only stay within 3 to 6 feet of the hooked survivior for 15 seconds then make a barricade around the hooked survivior and the killer can re enter in like 7 seconds or maybe even 6 just please fix this game. It's getting so bad i'm seriously considering going to friday the 13th. Which yes it maybe buggy but at least you can attack them.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-26,1,4,444,False,Not Recommended,This game Dead by Daylight is quite a fun game. Actually when I bought this game I really had alot of fun playing it. At the time a bought this game (14 months ago) survivors were really strong. If you had some friends and you played SWF you could definitely make the killer ragequit. It was kinda like cyberbullying (insta flashlights vacuum pallets 100% healingspeed with selfcare infinites and so on). I am a survivor main myself (and a nurse main) and I defenintely agree with the recent patches which removed/changed broken survivor items perks or like serveral edits to maps. The only thing that annoyed me is that in nearly every patch the survivors receive a nerf. These nerfs aren't necessarily big but over the time the game it gets different the gameplay the items/perks you use the game you used to know. I personally don't like the current state of the game not because im a toxic survivor main just because the game changed alot. If you're a good killer you know how to play against survivors and get a 4 man almost every game. If you are planning on buying the game this will probably be how the game will look like for you at first sight. A bit unbalanced (LOL A BIT... A BIT.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME! LMAO ROFL) but it is still fun to play I guess. As long as you don't turn out like an Ochido wannabe have fun in your games of Dead by Daylight!Also wtf is going on with lobbysimulator and laggswitching killers.

It's something which pretty much completely locks out people who suffer from motion sickness.My only choice is to play survivor atm. which isn't really the reason i got the game for allthough it's far easier then killer since i at least get a decent field of vision and it doesn't make me feel like i'm gonna get nouses.The game's also also not exactly what i was expecting majority of the matches i've been in now it's usually just survivors trolling the killer stunlocking him with flashlights and palets doing circles around palets and making it impossible for the killer to do much. The killer is suppose to be feared but instead he's more of a laughting stock people like to torment during a match. The community is extra hot garbage mp gaming communities always tend to be pretty shi*t but dead by daylight def. takes a pretty high spot on the list every single thread on the forums is nothing but toxic behavior with people attempting to troll non stop and in game everyone abuses every possible cheap way to get more points even if comes down to harming their own team mates in the process. If i could refund it i probably would but i got it in the spook bundle on humble so i can't even bought copies for two of my friends since at the time it seemedl ike a pretty fun game to play with friends but they also at the end found the game rather lacking and not all that fun with the problems it has.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,1,4,22,False,Not Recommended,I am sorry to say that in the current state I can't recommend this game. The feature where you choose what you want to be before you enter a queue is complete bs. It is impossible for me to find a game due to the fact that if I wan't to be a killer (arguably the most fun in the game and the reason people buy the game) I can't because EVERYONE wants to be a killer. Everybody is sitting in their killer lobbies waiting for people who want to try and hide from them and repair generators (yay) which won't come because everyone is trying to play a killer. And if you try to play a survivor (GIving up on the queue.) You can't get into a game because you get one or two people and everybody else is a killer waiting for survivors. There is an easy fix for this and that is to randomly select the role for every quick game. And no I don't mean keep the option on the side because EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A KILLER. I will keep following the game but until this feature or a similar one is added it is unplayable. Because all you do now is wait in a queue for god knows how long only to be chased by a killer die (Which would be a fun experience if not for...) and then sit in a queue for another ridiculous amount of time and when you want to play killer good luck because if you go afk during the MASSIVE wait time and you get into a game you are losing time in your precious 10 20 minutes of actaul fun.PS I'd like to note that in my 2 hours of playtime I've been in 2 games each of which I was a survivor got my kicked and the games were over in 10 minutes.

THIS IS NOT A COMPETITIVE GAME it's all a screen.I personally think all the problems from the game derive from the fact the core mechanic/gameplay is too simple so there's no room for making any big changes. I guess you can tell because the devs keep trying to ""fix"" it by just messing with numbers. This needs a huge if not full rework you know rethink the game as a whole. The current recipe its just not cutting it. ""Do 5 gens open door get out. Killer finds you run in circles drop pallets"" That's pretty much it and since the game comes down pretty much to the chase you can't really add killers with interesting mechanics because they automatically are low tier if their power doesn't directly help them in the chase.A few layers of complexity are needed because of the simplicity of the game (everything comes down to the chase) a lot of the current mechanics aren't even used/relevant anymore like stealth. Then there's all the items/perks that in combination pretty much gives you god mode like bringing 4 bnp or having infinite evil within 3 or 1 shot hatches you know things that trivialize the game objectives to me that tells me all these things were added by paper never tested in a practical scenario.I think it's a pretty big red flag when half the ""mechanics"" of your game are in there JUST to prevent exploits (this is an online game is nothing new they should have known that ppl would find those holes and exploit them) like the hooks regenerating after being sabotaged the windows getting blocked being able to unhook from any angle blood lust etc all those things don't even blend into the game there are just there to address problems the devs didn't foresee which tells you they weren't ready for making a game like this which is understandable all asimetric games so far were true vs as in each party could eliminate the other not like in this one where one side's goal is to eliminate and the other's goal is to escape.

Wraiths every freakin game discouraging newbies to play smartly only played once against Trapper and it was the most fun I had. Wraith is just plain boring you can't anticipate the fear just look out for those bells idk it's meh. Escaping is always the same story of timing LB to avoid generators from exploding. You don't feel implicated since you can just hop off to another lobby once dead. Killers aren't fun at all like I used to experiment it in Damned where some players would just screw with your head but weren't there for killing you 10 seconds in. Random levels is...meh like you just look for the generators anyway everything else is a bit pointless when you think about it.Ranking and progressing doesn't feel rewarding at all you lose items you unlock (seriously where the fuuu is my flashlight ??) and the ranks thingy seems very punishing. And I can sense from here the dlc incoming with new killers/survivors/items and skins for everything + maps. Just look at Payday 2 if you doubt it this game as like 150$ worth of DLC'S and a pricetag of 40$ on release same publisher behind it.Apart from that graphics are pretty good but only 3 levels seems kind of weak.

Loads up a lobby with the other players. Kicked to main menu.Start new lobby with friend. Ready up. No games found.Friend starts lobby. Ready up. Finds game loads us in to lobby. UI disappears so I can't ready up. Once I finally got into a game the atmosphere is on point. It's creepy the sounds and particles all add to the edgy vibe. But the gameplay is just... lacking. The game seems severely skewed in favor of the killer and that's fine. But survivor gameplay boils down to quick time events and that's it. There's no way to punish the killer for wreckless play. There's very little you other than running and pressing Mouse 1. The game just lacks any meanful actions on the part of the survivors. It's not surviving.And the newest killer can outright teleport through walls. Negating you only current defense against them. So there's that. It plays and feels more like an early access title. No recommened in its current state.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-07,0,0,114,False,Recommended,Survivors must work together to turn on a series of generators located in the maze like compound in which the game takes place all while hiding from the killer or fleeing for their lives if spotted. Once enough generators are powered up the doors to the compound open and the survivors next task is to find the door and escape with zero voice or text communication. For the killer his task is to hunt down the survivors knock them down and carry them to and place them on one of many meat hooks located throughout the level. Once hooked survivors slowly begin to bleed out though they may be rescued by other survivors should they display an altruistic streak to their in game personality.To balance the struggle between good and evil the killer s view is first person while the survivors enjoy a third person perspective giving them the informational advantage over the killer due to their much wider field of view. Actions in game be they altruistic or self interested reward the player with points used for character progression allowing them to acquire tools and abilities. The game also features competitive elo based matchmaking to ensure that in each game players come up against opponents of similar skill.Graphically this game is on par with many of the Triple A titles unveiled at E3 this year with gorgeous lighting high res textures and well designed UI. This doesn t seem to come at a cost to performance an issue which plagues other first release indie games with many users reporting stable frame rates above 30 fps across the board. Gory visuals and strong killer style really make the prospect of being caught as a survivor horribly frightening.Sound cues are an important feature in Dead by Daylight and as one would expect from the creators of Star Citizen the sound in game is both well conceived and well implemented to create the game s immersive feel. Survivors hear their heartbeat grow louder and louder as the killer draws near. This coupled with a crescendo of the standard horror score fare instills the unfortunate survivor with a strong sense of panic as he/she struggles to finish powering on a generator or rescuing a hooked teammate.The game s design may hurt its success unfortunately. Survivors can work together but are by no means a real team . No in game voice/text chat support means that when you re in you re on your own. This choice does however give advantages to the impatient player. When a survivor is either dead or has escaped they can immediately find another match instead of having to wait for the match s conclusion as in many other team based multiplayer games.,Dead by Daylight

The game becames repetitive and I had over 70 hours in beta. I can't find this interesting in a long term even with parties. If I can then this game would be released in a year if not even longer. The hype at the beginning is high but later it ends. No philosopher like the main Dev Mathieu Côté can save this game. Release has already began and what can I say.. The game will be dead soon. Also blur in the farm map is terrible I couldn't look further than 10 metres. Devs seems to do their job really slow I can't imagine huge updates.. Only kids dlc. Settings menu is also terrible not much to choose. Theme song is repetitive and it starts to getting in my nerves. Will do a refund this can't be played atleast I can't. Thanks if you read it comment if you disagree with me and make sure to don't be bs and harsh. Peace!,Dead by Daylight

Spent 45 minutes tinkering with stuff like compatibility mode or run as administrator which launches TWO windows and then gives an error that the anti cheat is already running. But then you get new audio which almost indicates the game is working but surprise it really isn't. The real nightmare of this game is getting it to run realizing you can't because the developers are braindead and having to sign out of Windows completely because Task Manager has no idea how to kill this monstrosity. I certainly experienced sheer terror but not in the way the game intended. I'd rather watch Manos The Hands of Fate a hundred times over than deal with this again.,Dead by Daylight

I should have more hours in this its really fun kinda addicting. optimization is crap but i look past that i can look past a lot of things to just have fun in what i play which brings me to the part of this game the killers.....I swear most people that play this game and play killers they have nothing else to do but troll you and the worst of all FACE CAMPING. i got face camped or a teammate got it in 3 matches in a row one day i decided to play. While i dont give a crap what so ever what anybody in this game has to say f you all if you think for a second that freddy is not the worst killer in the game. he can pull everyone in the dream at the same time and track you on any part of the map at all times. BUT i can over look him because most people dont actually play him a lot. but the camping problem is by far the worst part of this entire game. they laugh and joke about camping you in the chat after the match. When i actually played killer i never EVER camp when i hook i walk really really far away even if the doors are even open. fair and fun. EVERYONE wins. Until the devs can actually get off their asses i cannot even come close to getting more people to play this. i will tell as many people possible to stay the hell away. No amount of DLC will make me come back to this game. Not even if pennywise is ever added one day to make our dreams come true i still wont come back unless they fix it to stop camping killers.

2018-02-02,3,3,2406,False,Not Recommended,1.5k hours+ in this game... they absolutely spoiled the fun after introducing the emblem system... If you're a killer who gets 4 kills (the maximum) you won't get rewarded a double pip (the maximum reward)... on the survivors' scale of things they've made it competitive/all around (must do some of everything) but what does this promote? Survivors must now follow a meta.Anything that gets proposed to reduce the overall meta of the game which is nurse/billy for killers and Decisive Strike/Sprint Burst/Self care perks for survivors.... neither side of the community will agree on their metas being nerfed (killer mains will defend the top killers survivor mains will defend the top survivor perks).... so the devs always bait themselves into this viscious cycle of always choosing the side that cried the loudest for the other side to be nerfed (resulting in an imbalanced game)... and this has been going back and forth for years. It calmed down 6 months ago (nearly 40k people were playing back then... we're down to 20k ish) but now we've had so many perks/killers kicked out from being viable (the survivors learnt how to counter doctor and huntress at this point... they're not really viable... only full proof huntresses remain and they're rarer than a full proof nurse... whom would still be stronger).Overall... the devs are too afraid to make balance changes for the game because they fear a backlash from either side... the only changes they make are to further nerf perks barely anyone was using. The devs actually need to man the up and nerf both sides... let the survivor mains and killer mains cry it out. Get over it and watch them stay. They're not the ones who left. I'm finding this game super boring got the t shirt for the meta builds etc... I want to see something different... I had fun with other builds they've nerfed (i.e. leatherface for killer... or dead hard/sabo/no mither for survivor)... the devs just won't make changes for most of the unused perks/killers in the game... only a 1/3rd of perks get used (killer's perks too)... only a 1/3rd of killers are competitive.,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-20,0,0,1770,False,Not Recommended,"Bad game. Bad optimization fps drops annoying bugs at every new patch that take weeks to get fixed and the graphics are straight from 2010 at best. The only reason it's so popular is because of the gameplay which is quite unique and can be fun at the very start but as soon as you'll reach enough hours of playtime you realize that playing at high ranks it's a complete joke.The game is completely in the survivor hands and not in a fun way. You're best bet to survive is rushing the gens (which is not fun for both sides) hoping that your teammates do the same. If that doesn't happen the Killer takes the lead and forget the old good days when you could carry your team looping the Killer for hours because after all the survivor nerfs you're lucky if you last a couple of minutes in a chase. And that's because the devs decided that ""the chases must be short"". What a great idea. And to make sure that happens they even added a Killer who can literally vault pallets and fast vault windows. Brilliant! ArE yOu HaViNg FuN yEt?? So what if you play Killer? Well as written above it's all about gen rush. If survivors mess up and they are too slow on the gens you are very likely to succeed. But unfortunately high ranks are filled with SWFs which are teams of organized survivors who often use some third party voice software that are very very good at rushing gens. And even if you somehow manage to win you really don't feel awarded for that because you know that it wasn't you being good at the game. It was them messing up.Also it's good that the devs are trying to balance the game but I think they are just doing that in the most unfunny way possible. For both sides.

2017-10-28,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"I never write reviews I like to keep a low profile on the internet and mingle with others as little as possible. I prefer to play as a killer. Not to grief other people. Or ""troll"" as others call it I just want a fair fun game. The problem is this game does not deliver. I CAN LITERALLY NEVER find a match as a killer. In THIRTY minutes of lobby idling I FOUND ONE MATCH!!!!!!!!!! ONE MATCH! I didn't grief and had fun playing the nurse. It reminded me of Silent Hill one of my favorite titles. I know I will probably be attacked for this but I cannot recommend this title. If you are a new player you WILL ALMOST UNDOUBTEDLY BE GRIEFED! Since I could not find one match as a killer. Playing as a survivor has to be fun right? Nope I was endlessly pursued by someone running the huntress. I was endlessly caught killed and put on a hook. I IMMEDIATELY was sacrificed for some reason. No other players helped me they just literally scurried off and allowed me to die for being level one. I wanted to put it to them and quit. But I didn't. I literally lasted 2 minutes because I was as the old euphemism goes ""thrown to the wolves"". I WATCHED THREE PEOPLE SIT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME and not help. I couldn't enjoy this game solely because I am a noob. NEVER have I seen a game so hostile for people just starting. I cannot express through any vernacular how unfair this game feels. You are at the mercy of others if you are new and this led me to exercise my right to enact a refund. I cannot play half the game! If you are new the only enjoyable aspect is of course you guessed it being the killer. I FOUND LITERALY ONE MATCH in an hour of play. As stated Thirty plus minutes was idling trying to find a match as the nurse. The game could be great if more balanced. Some people also grief in a form I never thought I would see. The last guy alive was killed the killer stood right by him he escapes the hook. He then instead of even attempting to escape sits and starts incessantly crouching in a repetitious manner. Known as ""tea bagging"". This JACKASS Sits there and crouches till getting a hatchet thrown at him and lo and behold we all lost. I then received barely any points because I was griefed the whole match. Yeah I know ""Stop whining yack yack yack git gud yack yack yack"". No when I am literally unable to enjoy a title and left at the mercy of jerks I want a refund. People ruin this game. The jerks refused to aide me for being new. You know what? Everyone is new once why be an to new players??? You were one yourself once. I guess I should stop lamenting and wrap this up. Do not purchase this game now I have heard Freddy horror stories and I am just glad I have not ran into him. Even though I barely played. This game is so unfair to new players. Do not buy this speak with your wallet. This game needs work. 4/10. Would sit for thirty forty minutes looking for a match as the killer again.",Dead by Daylight

2017-01-18,0,0,1773,False,Recommended,1000 Hours / 1 year review Noveember 12 201742 of the last 365 days of my life have been right here playing Dead By Daylight. More than 11% of the year. If that doesn't say how much I like this game I don't know what will.If you're looking for a game that's multiplayer and different than all your others then you're going to like this game. Most of the multiplayers my friends and I played were FPS but this was far from that. That's probably why it was so intriguing and dragged me in.I play this game every day for at least a couple hours. Either I have no life or I just love to play this game. I must say I did not get into this game when I first started playing it. &lt 10 hours in this game and I was not a fan. The tutorial (or lack thereof) was terrible and it did not prepare me to play this game. Once I figured out how to play I was playing daily mastering the skills it takes to play and becoming better and better. You can do the same if you put the time in. WATCH STREAMERS if you want to learn how to play quickly. A mistake I made was not watching people stream this game when I first started playing. It is a very entertaining game to watch people stream as well as it'll give you some good tactics to take with you in the game. Plus they aren't opposed to you asking them questions. I'll put a list of recommended streamers at the bottom of this section so you can know who will be good to watch.In this game you're living in a horror movie each game. With one killer trying to kill you and your 4 friends. The killer is different each time and every game you play feels different. This is the aspect that Friday the 13th missed. Their game is always the same and you can't effectively choose who you want to play as. If you want to play killer you play killer. If you want to play survivor you play survivor. There can be multiple of the same survivor skin in each game too so everyone can go in as the same character and you don't have to sacrifice playing as your favorite character.This game is exciting toxic and unique all at once. I started this game when trappers could trap your feet and facecamping was 90% of the games. I've been through the lobby simulator and came out on the other side. I keep coming back to this game and I love it.The community can be super toxic but I've made a lot of friends through this game. Ironically most of the friends I've made has been as their killer.The game has definitely improved from when I started playing. Survive With Friends works the majority of the time now the game is fairly balanced on both sides as it stands. I get both killer and survivor to rank 1 in each reset if I put the time into the game.Streamers to watch Survivors 72hrs The original juke god. Although he doesn't play too much at this time you can watch his youtube videos to see some good juking. As many are old some of the jukes might not be able to performed in current game.Swind420 3500+ hours in game and streams dailySlickfoo Amazing jukerPickleDream She'll give you a pickle if you ask nicelyCrunchyeggrollzz Survivor mainOhTofu Former killer main gone survivorUnumz Former killer main gone survivorMorf_uk Mustache man with the jukes at handJendenise One of the most followed / subbed DBD streamersNo0b3 Mainly a youtuber. Super toxic survivor gameplays.Techguru808 Super funny and underviewedThere are a lot of other streamers some bigger than the ones I listed. But theses are the ones I mainly watch and they are really good at the game.The cool thing about Dead By Daylight is playing with streamers. I've played with/against all of the people listed above except Morf.Killers A lot of good killer mains have gone to the survivor side.Hexy (formerly sxyhxy) Trying to stay true to killer lately but he does a lot of survivorOhtofu Lots of survivor games as of lateHybridPanda Cross survivor / killerMarth88 One of few killer mains who continues to play mostly killerTheSwiftLegend Nurse mainI hope this helps you and I'll see you all in the fog!100 Hours Review January 18th 2017If you're looking for a thrilling competitive and sometimes scary game then this will be greatly suited for you.DBD (Dead By Daylight) is a 4v1 competition game where up to 4 survivors attempt to turn on generators and open an exit to whatever map they are on. While the 1 killer is trying to track down attack and sacrifice these survivors. Players must use their whit tools and perks to survive and win each match. The survivors and killers each have their own unique abilities to help them win.Each match feels somewhat new and fresh. You play with new people with a ranking system designed to try and match you with players of the same skill level. The generators will randomly appear on each map so you always have to look for them there's multiple different maps to play on each killer has specials that they can use IE the trapper lays bear traps nurse can basically teleport a short distance Michael Myers is more stealthy etc. You have to learn each of their strengths to play well as either survivor or killer. The game is meant to be challenging on both sides. If you can easily escape the killer and win everytime it wouldn't be fun. If you die by the killer every game it wouldn't be fun either.CONS MatchmakingThis game is great when you are able to play. Sadly while the gameplay itself is quite fun often times the game will glitch and put you in a loading screen that doesn't end when trying to find a solo match. You will have to force close the game and open it and try again. The current fix to this is to Survive W/ Friends but hit Ready and don't invite anyone. It works a lot better to try and find games this way. When trying to find games w/ friends sometimes it'll kick you all back to the lobby when it acts like it finds a game. You have to reinvite anyone you're playing with and requeue whenever this happens. Really the biggest flaw this game has is the headache of trying to find a match sometimes.Overall I would recommend this game if you have the patience to deal with the current matchmaking problems (been dealing with this for the 3 months I've been playing.) Hopefully the devs can fix it soon!,Dead by Daylight

Survivors will have you feel the exact opposite. They're the loudest voice in the community and that's why they keep patching in the survivors favor. In the rare event you actually want to play killer you have to pick the most broken boring and unfunniest to even be relevant. If you play any other killer you're basically r word. Games usually last about four to six minutes. And by the time you down a single person if a person is SOMEWHAT decent at ""juking"" 2 out of 5 gens are done. And that leads to camping/patrolling which in survivors eyes is a big BIG no go. They bring insta meds purple flashlights brand new parts and whatnot but give you hell when you bring a mori or add ons. I've been repeatedly told to end my life but that's just come and go in DbD and I've come to terms with that. Moral of the story is don't play killer. Play survivor instead and call every killer a doo doo head if they don't play like how you want them to. (Every game basically)Do I recommend it?

As with most games like this there may be one or two bad eggs. PThe Developers did a good job with just about every aspect of this game.

2016-12-26,0,0,0,False,Recommended,"""Death Is Not an Escape."" What a motto!?Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer horror game one player takes on the role of the Killer and the other four players play as Survivors trying to escape the Killer. That's the recipe for a great game and it is one hell of a game indeed. What I like the most in this game is not only the genius multiplayer but also the cliche moments of every horror movie from the 80's and 90's. You feel like you're actually playing in one of those movies and if you're a huge fan of the genre like myself you're going to love the rush of adrenaline.I highly recommend playing this game with friends while chatting on TeamSpeak you'll find yourself laughing at your friends as many times as screaming for help or feeling helpless and frightened. It's the perfect coop game for the horror movie fans.",Dead by Daylight

2017-08-18,0,0,476,False,Not Recommended,It is my personal opinion that the devoplers of this game does not care about the feed back provided by the community. I have played the game off and on for about a year now and I can honestly tell you that it gets worse with every up date. The game is clearly sided toward survivors those that play with friends. The killer being a sole player has perks with limited set up or at best particular circumstances that need to be met where as survivors get always powered perks or ways to constantly thwart all killers not just some. This makes having a playing a particular killer worthless. Now some can play this game and some can do well. Those are the people that have the time to invest above what a casual player can really offer. If you're going to play. Play survivor because everything is geared towards thwarting the killer verses sneaking around and avoiding the killer like it should be and like it was that drew so many players in the first place. It used to be a game of strategy and you could get scared about getting caught. But thanks to the work of developers it is now a game that survivors can litterally taunt a killer all game and unless you're an allstar pro and even if you are you can lose because a group of people decide to constantly blind you with a common item like flash lights. Or have perks that cann take being hit several times depending on the combination. This game is clearly unbalanced and I will not be returning or recommending this game to anyone.10/21/17I attempted to come back after a few DLCs and try out some of the new changes. At this poinnt and time I still find the killer survivor process unbalanced. One survivor can thwart the entire process with a simple flashlight that can be obtained through basic leveling. There is no real skill in the process either. They introduced blood lust which I feel was a step in the right direction but it can take to long to obtain the needed speed and dependent upon map layout it will break to easily or not pick up players clearly infront of the killer. I have played both survivor and killer and I feel that even with the new additions they still are not focusing on the aspect of the game they're selling. 1 killer against 4 survivors. The concept should be that the killer is stronger better faster and scary. It feels they've tweaked hear and there but still do not offer anything remotely close to a decent game. Half the time I do things as a killer because I am worried about what a survivor might do to me. How is that fair I ask? As a casual player this process is to one sided and favors the survivors in power instead of a killer that is supposed to be hunting them.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-07,0,0,201,False,Recommended,Game is mostly fun but killers are way too in op at the time of me writing this. Windows are useless you just get smacked through them any way if u dont have sprint burst good luck and there arent enough pallets to compensate for the uselessness of windows. The game was best balanced after the very first patch after the beta ended and the game released. Then was a time when windows were useful killers were escapable without sprint burst and playing killer required some measure of skill.Take this for example I have been putting all my bloodpoints into survivor since starting this game and I am still a high rank killer with 0 perks. (not saying im low rank survivor theyre about the same but the fact I can be the same rank as my survivor on killer without perks is ing stupid.) The game is still fun and I recommend buying it but dont play survivor until you have some basic perks. You'll just get destroyed.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-29,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"It turns out the way to survive a serial killer is to just run in circles jumping in and out of the same window. Who knew.In essence this game is trash. All the survivors do is run in circles jumping through windows and all the killers do is camp hooks when they've gotten one guy. If you don't camp the hook the person just escapes and proceeds to run in circles jumping through windows.There is no groupplay and the matchmaking system felt appropriate to match a Rank 20 Level 1 killer against a Rank 1 Level 20+ survivor. What promised to be an interesting game is unfortunately ruined by insanely cheese tactics that the entire playerbase seems to have universally agreed to. Want to play this game as a killer? Prepare to have survivors who just instantly run to their favorite infinite juke spots and then sit at the exit crouching and uncrouching. Oh and it is a hilarious exploit because while they're just running around in a circle jumping through a window they're exploiting the game to get ""boldness"" bloodpoints.There are only a handful of maps and 3 killers to play as two of which are basically worthless and serve no purpose. Your match is basically pointless when the entire team of survivors just window jukes and destroys the sacrificial hooks like they're SEAL Team Six.Oh yeah that's the kicker. Unless you have a special offeriing (an expendable one time use item) you cannot actually kill anyone yourself. You have to drag them to a hook to sacrifice them. There are only a select few hooks that cannot be destroyed and rest assured you'll basically never be able to get a survivor there without losing them in a juke loop.On the flipside if you're a survivor you'll just end up with a killer who turns on BitTorrent the moment the match gets going because it uses peer to peer hosting because the developers were evidently too cheap to buy their own servers and too inexperienced to not see that coming. Honestly I can't recommend this game to anyone. Exploits cheaters lagswitching and all kinds of hamfisted cheese that the developers seem to have no honest intention of fixing. The community gives them the best way to fix them and instead they basically just break the game even further.That said it is a pretty fun concept. It just has execution.

2017-10-15,0,0,405,False,Not Recommended,Killers The Doctor killer is broken and not fun to play against. You scream when you're within the terror radius easily exposing you to the killer. If he's tunneling/chasing you when you're in insanity level 3 (Which he easily puts you in as the shock goes through every object/wall) you have little chance of escaping him and snaping out of it without screaming thus giving you away all over again. Not being able to pallet slam or interact with anything in insanity 3 is rage inducing. The Hag plants too many traps. Annoying for late game with few generators. Especially when they are close together. Freddy doesn't work for this game. He's has too much of an advantage and it's not fun playing against him.1.) Totally invisible unlike wraith's translucent blob so you can't even tell if he sees you without wasting a perk slot. 2.) The children humming (terror radius sound) isn't directional so you don't have a sense of where he is or if he can see you. Looking at blades of grass to track his movement isn't reliable because most maps are barely grassy. (Mostly patchy grass here and there among mostly flat ground.)3.) His putting people to sleep gimick is terrible. He can always see you in dreamland. You have to stay in his terror radius meaning you can't reasonably wake yourself up blowing generators or having someone snap you awake or self heal without him hearing it. Everything in dreamworld is slower so relying on skill checks isn't happening. He'll easily hear you if you're injured so that makes things even more impossible. If you somehow get woken up he'll just quickly pull you back to sleep. Finding games where killers camp hooked survivours are common.Perks/Offerings Hex Ruin is too common and shouldn't apply to all survivors. If you play this game on a wireless network it's bad enough missing regular skill checks can be frequent. Other Hugely annoying Bad lobby system. The amount of time wasted manually inviting people and telling people to accept their damn invite adds up a lot (Additional time telling people who aren't afk to ready up). Dev's need to add an option for people in the post game lobby to to back out with friends (to a new lobby). Trap door is nearly impossible to hear even with headphones on. (Ambient audio is over powering). Generators often spawn in bad locations (often 3 too close together. Unless you're playing with 3 other friends this can get you screwed over late game).Not a bad game but there's a lot of inconvenient things add up.Hiding from killers and being chased/escaping killers is fun but a fair ammount of killers ruin one or both those things (Doctor &amp Freddy enemies with too long a range for melee attacks.),Dead by Daylight
2016-06-16,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,TLDR Game has been out for 2 days now. Balance connection issues and lack of communication are huge problems at the moment. Isn't currently worth the time and money BUT has HUGE potential to be incredibly fun with some work.Adding to this review game has been patched twice now. The most recent patch was a knee jerk reaction to low level players complaining. The intent of the patch seems to make low level play much easier for the killer. It has made it almost trivial at higher levels of play. The devs had an overwhelming amount of feedback on what should have been done but instead changed the game to cater to the lowest level of players. Meanwhile disconnects lag switches and hacks still are present in far more games than they should be. I still don't recomend spending money or time on this i regret doing so.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-29,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,Overall the concept of this game is great you and three other people are to repair broken generators across the map while avoiding a killer. But that's where my appreciation for this game stops. I've pumped out a lot of gameplay in the past few weeks trying to force myself to like the game but there's simply too many issues with it right now for it to be playable. At first it seemed as if the devs were taking into account the communities complaints and fixing things based off of their suggestions but the past few weeks this has seemed to stop. The biggest issues of the game in my opinion While their update claims to have 'fixed' the matchmaking issues finding a game can still be excessively long and will often throw you into a game where you're playing people across the world. Game is currently incredibly unbalanced IMO makes it more frustrating than fun to play. Some perks need to be evened out a lot more and there absolutely needs to be a consequence for killers camping people who are hooked. Graphics customization is very limited as well as sound balancing. The main menu music is incredibly annoying and can't be individually turned down. Matchmaking has a HUGE skill gap. I'm either in a game with brand new players or people with 400 hours in game there isn't really an inbetween. TL DR at the moment I wouldn't spend the $20 on this game it's not quite a finished product yet. I think if some of these issues (along with others) are addressed it will be a really fun game.

2017-02-04,0,0,119,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is bad game. Still fun tho.tl dr An amazing survival horror experience and my favourite indie game so far this year you ll sure as hell see this one on my list of top 5 games of 2016. The seeds of greatness are here but with plenty of room for refinement and clarity to improve the experience. Dead by Daylight is a good game but it lacks of content. Hope to see more soon. It lacks polish but Dead by Daylight is a genuinely tense ode to 80s slasher movies. Despite of lack of content in its launch Dead by Daylight is an original adventure multiplayer game that it is worth and captures perfectly the style of classic movies of horror. Dead by Daylight executes the concept of a competitive horror game well but only to a point. The idea is great and it's really intense and fun when played with friends. However it's not the most polished experience so it might be worth waiting and seeing how it improves in the upcoming months. Disastrous scoring system encourages some players to cooperate with the killer instead of running from him and reduces promising gameplay to nonsense (e.g. when the killer picks you up throws you into a trap resets it picks you up throws you into a trap resets it picks you up throws you into a trap resets it picks you up...). 09/2016 p.58 Dead By Daylight is a fantastic concept that in practice needed much more work put into it. None of this stops Dead by Daylight from being enjoyable at times or even tense but a horror experience it is not. Nor is it particularly well fleshed out well documented or even well executed. Game would probably be amazing if they had bothered to do any optimization at all. The graphics settings are preset so literally the only thing you can do to optimize it yourself is choose 'Low Med High Ultra' but even on the lowest settings a decent rig will struggle. More than a few people on Reddit and Steam have stated that the framerates are subpar with a unanimous. I have never played such a good horror game before. Resident Evil was fine and Dead Space too but I see a potential on this game. Keep up the good work Awesome game and Awesome Idea. There always gonna be bad feedback but that doesn't mean anything. Everything takes time to be improved. I hope all you guys like it! Good Luck Getting Away From The Killer! DbD creates a a very tense atmosphere in particular as a survivor where you walk around and try to avoid drawing attention to yourself. The difference in perspective (Survivor in 3rd person killer in 1st person) feels strange to start with but quickly feels very natural and well balances the different roles. First game in a long time that has given me jump scares and keeps me coming back for more. Very boring and is somewhat fun it's no element of surprise graphics are bad and it feels like a rushed version of something that could've been way more fun and I believe it tried to rush out from the Friday the 13th that's why the game has some bugs and just doesn't feel the best especially the graphics.Awesome premise and tight gameplay but definitely needs updated content from some free DLC's to make a decent following that could expand the franchise profitably it doesn't cut it for a full release even one at budget price.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-07,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,"The gameplay and the idea of this game is fantastic !Each game can be unique because of the perks and the different killers so the game has an incredible replayability because of that.It also has a good learning curve when you're learning the game as well as unlocking perks which make you play differently.But that's just the theory.In fact the game is a pain to play and is a frustrating experience both for killers and survivors.First the matchmaking is a totally mess. As a fresh new player with maximum 5 hours playtime you can be matched against a player with full tier 3 teachables perks memento mori and 100+ hours playtime.Then the devs aren't listening to their players (another one) and are praising things that makes no sense. For example killers that are camping when you can't do anything and is a """"""""legit strategy"""""""" for the devs. Survivors also have their incredibles strategy like looping with a pallet/window for 5 minutes. And then when you think you can catch them there's the 'Decisive Strike' perk or/and their torch. For this last thing they could only buff bloodlust but who cares to have fun right ?Next there are performances issues and bugs.The menu is clear and simple. In the game the map is pretty small constituted by the same tiles every games and there's not a lot of visual effects.But Dead by Daylight manages to take forever to load every single thing on the game (menu included) and it needs to be low/medium on graphics to be played correctly while i'm playing openworld games on high way more beautiful than this game.We can also mention that there's no dedicated server which means you're likely to play an unplayable game as a survivor if you have a high ping with the killer hosting the game.For the bugs I can say there's the ""lobby bug"" that is a thing for something about 1 year I think which consist of a lobby that has 3 survivors but the last won't join until one leaves which makes froze lobbies for nothing. It's a real bug since you can quit and relog instantly on a lobby that is full in a second.There are also bugs while loading when your game exits without saying anything.When you're playing with friends as survivors there is also something that annoy me which is the fact that you need to reinvite your friend in a new lobby everygame or every time you leave a bugged lobby (1/2 of lobbies) which make a flood of invitations on the game chat history. I don't know why the game can't remember a group Deceit is doing that great why not Dead By Daylight a paid game with DLC and IAP.Last but not least I think that the economy system of this game is a complete joke. If you're not buying the game with all its DLC it will be a disadvantage because you will miss powerful perks that you can unlock by playing DLC survivors or killers like 'Ruin' which is completely OP or 'Haunted Ground' and 'Barbecue &amp Chilli'.Some will say you can unlock these perks in the 'The Shrine of Secrets' which is right but you'll need patience because you can wait 3 month before there's something good in this.Anyway I think this would be advertised as well as the IAP on a non f2p game (even if it's cosmetic) because I totally think it's a scam since it's worse than a p2w system.",Dead by Daylight
2016-09-17,0,0,449,False,Recommended,I love Dead by Daylight.This game has its bugs here and there but the dev team I see a dedication close to that of Warframe's team. A group that love their game and are constantly working on it. They listen to their audience and use hard numbers to try and balance things just right.The power trip of beating people to death and the feeling of escaping unscathed on either side of the fence are just great experiences. For such a cheap price it provides a lot of fun.,Dead by Daylight
2018-01-07,2,2,772,False,Not Recommended,"Overall score 2.5/10Let me preface this review by saying I USED to LOVE this game. Before we got patch 1.4 the game was in a stable but still enjoyable state. I'll give you the problems it had then and still has now in a minute but I wanted to get that out of the way first.Back then survivors had to avoid the killer or they would die quickly losing their pips and going down in rank instead of up and they knew it. Back then killers were't overpowered but most still needed some bandages to their kits to help them out and even then every killer had a playstyle. Let me go ahead and list out the good the bad (What could easily be fixed) And the ugly (What clearly needs to be addressed ASAP)The good*Depending on your experience with your killer of choice you can be EXTREMELY powerful. As for myself I am a Hag and Huntress main and do not regret it. Both are solid killers with playstyles I like.*Graphics are very solid. Prestiging killers especially feels rewarding with bloodied clothing or new items to use for customization and bloody weapons actually drip blood if you pay attention to them. *Map generation is almost always randomized and you will almost never get the same map twice because of it.*Windows block survivors after they or the killer total 3 vaults over it.The bad*The devs never solved the problem of ""Infinites."" Infinites are basically pregenerated map pieces that include pallets and windows in specific places making actually catching the survivor take a MUCH longer time to do wasting the killer's time. More on that in a minute. There was a minor change to map generation to help solve this but it did not work.*Some killers are completely outclassed. The Wraith the Shape and The Nightmare are the ones I'm looking at here. All three have decent kits but with infinites being a huge problem right now they can almost never get a kill.The UGLY*Pallet Looping is an absurd problem and if you don't know why go watch someone streaming this game as a killer and I guarantee it will happen in every game. ""Pallet Looping"" refers to a tactic when the survivors use hitboxes to their advantage. How? Survivor hitboxes are smaller than the killer and any area with pallets will have something else around to act as obstacles. Trees boxes things of that nature. The survivors can run laps around such things and since their hitbox is smaller than the killer's they can not only gain ground this way but they can also decide to wait for the killer and throw the pallet down to stun them but if it were just one pallet it wouldn't be too bad. Most of the areas on the maps have more than one pallet in close proximity and survivors will loop the killers around EVERY ONE of them to waste their time. Which leads me into...*Time. To escape survivors have to repair five of seven generators which doesn't sound too bad. Four survivors one killer and the gens take a decent amount of time to repair. But coupled with infinites and pallet looping you will watch multiple generators get done in the time it takes you to down even one survivor if they have half a brain and loop you well. To actually KILL a survivor you need to either (A) Mori them after they have been hooked once (B) let them bleed out on the ground which takes about 2 3 minutes total or (C) hook them until the entity sacrifices them which can be up to 3 times depending on how altruistic the other survivors are. Why is this a problem? Here are your options.(A) Down a survivor and camp them which they will then spam the struggle button instead of hold it so they raise their arms up and down alerting their friends (Who can see this arm waving) that you are there and to do generators(B) Hook a survivor and walk away which will prompt one of their friends to save them and let them start infiniting you again*Survivors WILL be s to you. This is a fact of life. With multiple clearly overpowered perks and no counters to any of them survivors know that THEY are in control of the game not you. Yeah you can kill them as the killer but killing even one rank 1 survivor with the game in the state it is in will cost you the entire game and you will sit there watching them T bag you taunt you stun you with flashlights/pallets and constantly get away from you for FREE laughing at you the entire time. Closing statements? The game right now is NOT worth playing. As a player with over 650 hours and counting in hopes the game recovers at the moment I would say wait for it to be on a heavy sale if you REALLY want it but otherwise go play something else. The killers are supposed to make you be afraid of them they are supposed to be the ones in control and with the power but the way the game is right now there's nothing they can do. Survivors are constantly getting buffs and killers are getting nerfed and the devs will not address the clear problems that would solve the issues killers face to make the game fun on both sides. Nobody wants to get trolled every game being frustrated and angry that they cant kill a single survivor. It will make you extremely unhappy and make you feel like you wasted your money.If the devs fix pallet looping and put decisive strike back the way it was (Where only the obsession can use it) then the game can go back to a state of relative balance. Killers will be back where they belong as the ones in control. Until that happens save your money and spend it on something better. If I see relative improvement I would happily recommend this game and would gladly change the way I see it.",Dead by Daylight

2018-02-16,0,0,142,False,Not Recommended,The game has potential to be fun but if you have a life (job friends etc.) I wouldn't recommend playing it. To be able to have the full experience you have to grind an insane amount of hours to be able to unlock everything for the different killers/survivors. The gameplay doesn't justify the time spent grinding especially considering the community is as toxic as it is on both sides. If you play killer you're a camping cancerous . If you play survivor you abuse infinites or otherwise. Terrible community grinding takes way too much life for those who want to go outside and it has bugs (like the mouse cursor going off screen and you can't interact with the game even when it's fullscreened) that make it frustrating. Don't buy it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-02,1,2,5,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game a few weeks ago because i was bored and wanted a new game. This game was fun to play with times where i have mugged off the killer by getting off the hook without help in 4 rounds in a row to being scared s###less by killers who are wrecking the whole team by using something called SKILL. With this new killer its makes the game unplayable as you can't see him can outrun you and see you all the time when he is not chasing you. Also the fact you can not exit the dreamworld without help in which you lead him to other survivors. In my view they should nerf the F### out of him like for example a way to get out of the dream world by using the 'snap out of it' function from when you play against the doctor. Overall a great game but i would avoid untill they fix the new killer or buy it and grind the killler on people who can't do jack about before they nerf him if your that type of person,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-14,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Amended the review Original Game is free for 5 days you'd think there'd be people.... just waited 15 mins as a survivor with a blinking ""waiting"" sign once i finished reading reviews on my phone and nothing had happened (still alone in my ""waiting"" lobby no one came and went) the game wouldn't even let me leave the waiting queue (esc made a sound.... but nothing else) had to go click the windows taskbar close for the game to offer me the option to quit.Might try it again at prime time... but it currently smells like a dead fish.Edit So i did get to play a few rounds it's ok. I played mostly with noobs like myself and it felt balanced... but at the cost of anoying handicaps.As a survivor you either are on the radar or not... which means you're free to do what you want or doomed to run trying to outrun a killer that is slightly faster than you. Only way to escape is by dropping obstacles (which hulks should be able to just pass... but they can't) or use the poor visibility to get out of sight.As a killer you're just roaming untill you see a rabbit... if they see you they run if they don't it's a free hit... but just one cause you always wipe your blade an enoying habit that is basically a stun you can't even trun the camera to keep track of your prey I often lost it that way frustrating. The killer abilities are ok.... but not very helpfull. One can lay traps... which seldom get triggered one can stealth and increase speed... but is somewhat stunned when he leaves the state (and rings a bell) so it's only really usefull on newbies but at least it helps getting in the vicinity of victims faster.All in all I feel that there isn't very much depth in the game. The concept is fun if you like playing hide and seek but there are many frustrating balances (like if a prey you captured flees from your arms... you're yes stunned). And the execution mechanism makes it so a well organised team will manage to flee quite easily or take down the generators if you camp the victim cause it's way too fast to release them (you'd think being impaled would slow down people..).So yeah I remain on my negative review it can be fun but there's a lot of frustration points and well the theme is offputting to be honnest.Bonus tried to log on again this friday... servers offline....ok.... there's no exit button esc only tries to connect you again so back to manual close GG.",Dead by Daylight
2018-11-03,0,0,263,False,Not Recommended,Playing as killer is fun but takes about 10 15 mins to find a game. Survivor can be fun but very rarely this is becuase the killer can easily get you.Micheal Myers is one of the killers who were alright to go against until they decided he need to see everyone on the map making it extremly hard to play as a survivor.Also client side is a big problem with this game because on multiple occasions the killer as swung and hit nothing yet it registers it as a hit rather than a miss.Finally camping is a big issue with the game and just makes this game boring to play and makes you realise that there isnt much point in trying to save your friends if the camper literally stands next to them.Progression system is pretty as you will have to spend ages to get the perks and addons you want and the match play of rank overall makes it hard to experiment with killers.,Dead by Daylight

2019-02-06,1,2,52,False,Not Recommended,So the only good thing about this game is that it was only $10 on sale and so I got this minigame called hide and seek with a scary twist.... Followed by a crap load of bugs! PROBLEMS 1. Terribly unbalanced. Some killers have perks which for the most part seems to be balanced but when there are only a couple or just one survivor left its over powered. For instance a clown camped a hatch chucked his gas things and had literally no cool down. This allowed him to keep spamming it and camp the hatch and the remaining generator which was close to the hatch as well.2. Broken hitboxes. Absolute garbag hitboxes. I thought FPS games had horrible hitboxes but this game takes the cake for being the absolute WORST. A killer can hit you even though he swung at the air. 3. Broken animations. A killer can lunge at you from a mile away because this is how the animation works so it completely ignores the killers original speed and goes Usain Bolt and hits you. Other times you see a pallet and you try to throw it down but it doesn't because it doesn't show the space bar option even though you are directly in front of it and looking at it.4. Extremely toxic community. Surviors will disconnect at the beginning for a pathetic punishment. No points and a potential derank. Wow! This is even worse when it comes to killers who disconnect because the survivors got all the generators and so the game just stops. Ridiculous how abandoners get absolutely no cool down whatsoever for ruining it for everyone else.5. Awful servers. Your connection as a survivor depends on the killers connection. If the killers get 300 ping then so do you. If the killer lag switches and unplugs his ethernet then you freeze as well. Plenty of other bugs but these are the main ones that truly ruin the game.Anyways enjoy playing a twisted hide and seek with a bunch of bugs!,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-07,0,0,322,False,Recommended,It's just so unique. 4v1 multiplayer and one person plays as a serial killer. Minimalist HUD and dark spooky atmosphere make it the most immersive multiplayer game I've ever played. It will scare you if you play it right. It has a bunch of RPG elements that I don't care for. New players are at a distinct disadvantage because you have to level your characters up before they are competitive. The rules are also kind of... vague which leads to a lot of players getting mad if they don't think you played the game right. Communication isn't allowed in game which gives an UNBELIEVABLE advantage to people who play with friends and communicate on Discord. A really stupid design idea imo. It does add to immersion but that isn't worth it at the expense of competitiveness.Overall the game is so cheap and unique that I still recommend it despite its flaws. It is the best scary multiplayer game I've played in a few years. Just don't take it too seriously or it will be more frustrating than fun.UPDATE AFTER 75 HOURS I have two things to add after playing this game for a while.1) The playerbase is truly awful. I know a lot of people say that about most multiplayer games but this one is extremely popular with 12 year old boys for some reason. More than half of them have private Steam profiles to hide the fact that they have over 1 000 hours in the game. About 10% of the players that the matchmaker puts me against have VAC bans on their profiles. This wouldn't be too bad if the game had a good matchmaker but...2) The matchmaker sucks. I have 75 hours in the game and the matchmaker matches me against pre made teams with players who have 1 000+ hours in the game with max level characters and top tier gear.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-01,4,2,18,False,Not Recommended,Wow. What an amazing game. What an amazing community. Quite easily the best game on the market right now and arguably the best community around (sarcasm). Almost every single game my teammates are either spastic trolls or completely braindead morons who unintentionally sabotage the game. Oh but it gets even better. About 70% of my games have toxic sweaty TriHard killers who do nothing but tunnel one person at a time camp hooks and bm by slashing your hooked body while camping. On top of that all killers possess ungodly speed that even Usain Bolt would marvel at. Oh and did I mention that the moron developers have no clue what a hit box is? That's right! You'll get hit from a country mile away because you transformed into Apache Chief and have the largest hit box known to man. Even Riot Games have a better understanding of what a hit box is. Looking to do daily rituals to get bonus blood points to level up your characters? HA HA HA HA HA! Good luck because half of them are glitched and will not reward you for completing them! There is a reason why they gave this trash game away for free on PS4. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game at all costs. If you qualify for a refund go request one.

2016-06-14,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,I normally don't write reviews but I'm skeptical about this game. Sure it's scary and even more fun for your first few playthroughs but it really does water down the effects of the game after about 2 hours (atleast for me playing it for some time in the beta). My biggest concerns lie with the online functionality aswell as content itself. 1. Online works fine so far on day one but the co op functionality should have been present in beta. As of this review you can't join your friends and find a game unless you want to plan on spending ten minutes matching in the same lobby. This is rather obsurd in todays times and why there is no party system bafffles me.2. Content in my honest opinion is rather sparse. 1 gamemode 3 killers 4 survivors (with no special perks to who you decide to be) and an assortment of randomly generated maps. The perk system works well for what it does but the overall issue with content is that there is only one game mode. Turn on the generators to escape or kill the survivors depending on what you are. This gets VERY repitive and I don't understand why we could'nt get other modes even if maps had to have different layouts to do this. Overall the concept of the game is creative but limited to what it has so far. Not sure if there will be free updates or if dlc will lurk into adding more content for what costed $16 for me at the time writing this.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-17,0,0,113,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a 4 person survival game where you and your team mates go and power up generators to open 1 to 2 other doors to escape while being chased by the killer (another player). I do have my pros and cons so here they arePros Makes you feel like you're in a somewhat of a Scooby Doo game. The environment as well as the music for the killer is very creepy but not the scariest. When last man alive there is a random chute that opens allowing you to jump down it and escape rather than powering on all generators and opening one of the main doors.Cons Big thing which is the PC optimization where even at low settings don't do much. When trying to escape the hook it rarely happens (last time I did it was the start date of the beta). More buildings to explore (more preferably a small school house or office building).The game came out a few days ago so as more updates roll out an updated review will come.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-16,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,"On paper this game should be awesome but it isn't.The idea where there is a killer (tank ish) and you are hunting survivors sounds awesome. However in the execution is where this game falls apart.When you are the killer you're suppose to be this unstoppable monster that is something to be feared. The reality is that you couldn't kill a fly. You can only down the other players once downed you must then hang them on a post where after a long period of time they will die. Yes you can't actually kill anything yourself. Even when you get someone with your chainsaw you only down them.It wouldn't be so bad if it actually meant something to be placed on the post/alter. It takes somewhere around 2 minutes for someone to die on it. That might not seem like much but the objective for the survivors is to turn on 5 6 engines. You can either go after those survivors or watch your ""hung"" survivor die. I bring this up because it is painfully easy for someone to get off the post once they've been placed there. Either they have a perk or they have another player get them down. In which case after a quick heal it's like they were never downed.This would be forgivable if there was actually any tension in the game but again there isn't. You and the killer are only slightly faster than the survivors and I mean this marginally. If you take one small turn off they will have grown the lead. You can spend an entire match chasing a single person in circles and never hit them. Which brings us to the next issue as the killer it takes two hits to down someone. The reach of your weapon is very small you have to be right on top of someone to hit them. This combined with the fact that you are only a percent faster than the survivors means good luck actually getting a hit.Each map is essentially a square with various objects inside it none of which you can really interact with. Every map feels the same and are devoid of any interesting features for either the survivors to use or the killer.There is potential here if some of these issues could be fixed. Starting with making the killer something to be feared. I could go on but I've already given this more time then I would like.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-22,0,0,109,False,Not Recommended,You will spend more time mad at the game then having fun with it. #Angersimulator2016Update After putting in a few more hours and getting more in touch with the community on the discussion boards I have decided to update my review. The game is actually pretty fun when the killer and survivors are fairly new at the game. The reason for this is because the killer and survivors don't know the current meta don't exploit the map very well and don't have those popular perks. The game becomes significantly less fun when the skill level increases. This is because of those reasons previously mentioned. The games become either very short because the killer slaughtered everyone in a matter of minutes or it becomes a giant chase fest for the survivors and the killer starts to wonder who is actually king of the arena. The game would be better if the Devs tried to capture what makes the game fun for the reletively new players. Those moments where no one is trying to use cheap exploits (looking at both sides here) to get an advantange over the other group. The game needs more hiding perks for the survivors and better chase perks for the killers. Survivors should actually be afraid of getting chased and killers should actually have to struggle with finding survivors. The devs need to go back to the basics because I doubt that the game in its current state is what they envisioned.,Dead by Daylight

The goal of the four survivors is to repair 5 generators to power the exit gate and escape. It takes 70 seconds per generator to repair it. The goal of the Killer is to seek all survivors and hook them for the entity to consume. Gameplay Dead by Daylight is an amazing game but is let down by lots of bugs. Here are the cons of Dead by Daylight Not being able to enter Survive with Friends with the message ""Internet connection lost""Awful matchmakingUnbalanced MechanicsThe ranking system might as well not even exist due to the fact you get matchmaked with really bad ranks when you're a really good rank.Salty PlayersPallet LoopersFacecampersPros Friendly teammatesUp to 4 players that you can play with.Scary for the first 3 matches but then you're not that scared.Variety of Survivors and KillersLicensed Characters (Laurie Strode Michael Myres (Halloween) William ""Bill"" Overbeck (Left for Dead)You can prestige 3 times.Good GraphicsFree DLC and it's the DLC is not must have.

2016-08-10,3,2,1,False,Not Recommended,"Absolutely horrendous matchmaking is the only real complaint I have about this game. It works the same general way matchmaking in Dark Souls works in that the game spends several seconds searching for a suitable match before automatically quitting and forcing you to ready up again rather than actively searching until you connect with someone doing the same. In other words it is a requirement that another person hits ""Ready"" at the exact moment you do for you to be matched together otherwise the game will stop searching after quite literally 2 seconds.Somewhat recommended if you want to play alone or with TWO other friends as finding suitable matches is much simpler and faster this way due to the fact that solo players are often teamed up instantly with each other or teams of three. However I can't remotely recommended this if you're only here to play with one other friend as finding a suitable match is extremely rare and tedious when you're two teamed players.To conclude in its current state I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend this much money on a MP only game with such a broken matchmaking system.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,0,0,280,False,Recommended,The game is good right now and it is getting better. For the longest time this game has suffered through an inbalance between killers and survivors. Survivors were given too many tools to prevent or prolong the killer catching them. Then in the latest patches survivors have been nerfed to allow the killer to actually kill them. Many games I played I would get in chase after chase after chase being able to down them quickly and do my objective of putting them on a hook but it wasn't enough. Despite my best efforts and doing my objective as fast as possible survivors were able to do their's faster and they all escaped. The new patches aren't even that bad for survivors it's just that certain playstyles they did that were unfair towards the killer are now being looked at and taken out. Killers are being buffed to make the a viable option in the higher ranks and more perks are (survivor and killer) are being buffed to make them also viable in the higher ranks. The only reason this game is mixed is because survivor mains want to win everytime and now that they can't use t mechanics or crutch perks they are losing their rank and complaining that the killer always wins. Do not trust them if you have to wait. The bad reviews will soon go as people realize that it is childish.,Dead by Daylight

With people online it's a real crapshoot. As a survivor you find hardly any trolls and for the killers that face camp it's only at the lower ranks (I'm considering 20 as low because it has you know lower skilled players) and even then I have not really seen it a whole lot of camping (DISCLAIMER. Big *** difference between face camping and patroling but more on that later) And the other survivors don't often block your esacpe from the killer. It's usally calm and cheery even with killers somtimes with everyone saying gg and good job and all that. BUT.....BIG FREAKING BUTT If you go as killer that's where the toxicity appears suddenly as you are frequented by low ranked veterans who only stay low to troll noob killers. Each match will probably have someone ranting how you were camping. This being you as a killer just standing in front of them not even moving untill they die (but as I said ranks higher than 19 don't do this because it gives the survivors SO MUCH TIME to get generators) but really as smarter killers tend to do you were patrolling around the area of the hooked survivor However the most extruciating thing of all follows this set of patterns. Whenever you go into a new rank with a pip and think to your self ""Well I got nuthin better to do let's see what kind of players are in the next rank"" and then proceed to click to create lobby...... You will get chewed up spit out and pitied trolled and worst of all........................ they still lose thier at you when you ""camp. Even worse the killers all get perks *ahem* they get good perks at first but Devs quickly nerf them down because of the outcry of y trolls and ""Elitists"" who play as survivors. I don't really know wether to recommend or not. It's great with friends with the gentleman's agreement to not use perks or at least not op ones but that is it unless you like reading a book as your charecter fixes a generator and everyone else trolls the killer and you know there is almost no way you can die.AfterthoughtsSo overall dont come into this without friends. It's almost a requirement to practice with them as a killer if you don't want to chuck your computer at the wall in frustration. It's a great game and there are some really chill and friendly people in it but as always the few s who find no other enjoyment in life then sitting behind a screen wasting away to troll others who as they say sit behind a screen and waste away.I hope this was informative and I sincerely hope that my expierience as a killer main was just an unlucky one and not reflective of the expierience of others. Particularly the killers.SignedSome chick with a moustacheP.S.Once again I fervently urge you to buy this game with others or at least know some people who already have it so you can play and have fun as both survivor and killer.",Dead by Daylight

A large variety of killers survivors and perks to mix and match make this game replayable for hours and hours. After 6 hours it becomes less spooky and more about the mechanics. There are still moments that will scare the out of you but playing with friends and hearing them scream as Michael Myers rounds a corner is priceless.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-11,1,1,74,False,Recommended,"Now that the party system is there I think it is time for a review.I have about 20 hrs of gameplay playing mostly as killer (Hillibilly to be exact but that does not matter) spending bloodpoints into various trees completing daily rituals burning different add ons and offerings and aquiring perks of different raritys.To start off this game is a slasher / hide and seek game in which 4 survivors try to repair 5 generators in order to escape the map in which the killer haunts them. It is definetly fun for both sides and best enjoyed with a full set of friends but alone online is fun too. Here is a +/ list to give you an overview+++ different maps in which the objects are generated at random points ""skill"" trees in which you hunt the most rare and useful perks and offerings Now with party system different killers and survivors let you choose your playstyle intense gameplay balanced. The devs bring updates even to the smallest balance issues Sometimes crashes although I haven t experienced it much myself no tutorial and near to 0 videos make it hard to understand for beginners. Especially when trying to figure out how offerings are used and when you should burn them graphics. This isn t really a negative point but its unreal engine 4 for crying out loud. But still I m happy with it 20$ cost. IMO it is worth but especially if you haven t played the beta this price might keep you off buying this gem DC s. Often a survivor isconnects only giving 1250 points for sacrfice and 650 points for quitting. This might be too few to give you the rank up and might leave you frustratedSummary IMHO this game is worth the money. It is not enough for a 40$ game (see verwatch) but definetly worth the 20$. This game doesn t focus on the graphics but on the balanced gameplay and the sheer fun you can have with friends or alone. And since the game is new I am sure that they will fix a lot of issues and add more killers / survivors and even maps ( They confirmed this if im right).This game deserves a 8 / 10 in it s genreᑫ ل ᑷ",Dead by Daylight

2018-03-18,0,0,622,False,Not Recommended,"19 99 Euros. Completely wasted. Why? Well I kinda followed DbD while growing and developing not only as a player but also as a fan of their gameplays. The advertisments are great the idea and the execution is well done... But why are 20 Euros a waste of time and money then? Bugs..happen. I mean it's all code right? But what about bugs that reset all your achievements? Bugs that let you get stuck on barely nothing in the middle of the map? Bugs giving killers extra weapons or letting them get stuck too? Bugs making walls invisible or not letting you to do the main goal Running out of the exit gate? Gamebreaking bugs. What is a test server there for? Surely it can happen but not as frequent as it does on official servers.Gameplay.. has a huge variety because every killer/survivor behaves differently in a specific situation. But there are black sheeps everywhere right? If one decides to give away every survivor's position to the killer again gamebreaking and you get punished for it (loose rank) or even players that open a lobby (killers) wait until the game has loaded and then exit the game and you still get punished. These are minor problems that could be solved easily but yet are still ignored by the DEVs.DEVsSpeaking of wich the devs are another topic that needs to be mentioned. Lately almost every experienced DbD player got banned who had like 900 hours spent on this game. Why? Noone knows. Especially the famous Youtubers are part of it. How do you learn DbD as a newbie? I asked my friend. She replied Ochido. No0b3. Oh wait but.... you banned them permanently with no given reason. The only bugs they showed were appearing in the KYF ( Kill your friends) and like the DEVs told themselves This mode is buggy. They never exploited but described and teached others what is useful and how to play the game. But you does now? And especially Why are non YTers also part of your Purge of the Best?I found interest in the game as many youtubers shared their ""Funny moments"" on Youtube and decided to check it out too. The game got promotion and fame without loosing one single penny others pay loads of money to come quite that far. Instead people are buying a game and investing in DLCs also me ofc. Well okay if the DEVs show us what they can do I don't mind. I like to invest into a game that is loved by their own DEVs and treated ike that. Paragraph 1 2 are things that I ignored and thought ""A big game is a big issue. Sure they're working on it."" But as time goes the DEVs seem to turn against the players no responses no help banning people and not even giving a reason to it.If that does not stop the Game will break. There are tons of other games to play on steam So many costing the same amount of many and providing the same fun. DEVs you know that you could be easily replaced And that's what YOU are going for.

The Stealthy sneaking around the place trying to duke the killer and screaming for dear life... once again amazing Not only that... including Mike Myers! Brilliant! however... there can be room for improvement... i was in a game on the micheal myers map and a guy on the game i was in kept going back and forth to the houses with 2 stories and activating the generators whats more is that everytime i got close to trying to hit him he would always dive out the window or take advanted of the fact that the killer gets out of windows slowly. But all in all i definantly give this game a 10 out of 10 and would reccomend it to the people who love suspense and horror in general. Thankyou Diablo UPDATE I have been in so many games where the Survivors just disable pretty much all of your hooks and i really hate it... afterwards they tease you about it... Please make it so you can only disable like 2 or 3 per game because honestly i hate it when they do it to the killer.Thankyou Devs for the awsome killers!,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-17,0,0,474,False,Not Recommended,First thing first I actually think DBD is a good game with good potentials.However the way the development team balance the game is based on top end players/steamers &amp that basically means its getting harder and harder for new player/new blood to get into the game now. The way the team buff and nerf key perks of the game is doing more harm then good. Borrow Time used to be a prefect way to counter camping killers like wraith low rank but they nerfed it so that is doesn't really act as a counter no more. This actually doesn't change the top end game play too much but it's encourging killers to face camp at lower lv &amp it's showing.To be honest instead of buffing and nerfing skills they need to change how the ranking system works. Hopefully the game will take a step into a right direction &amp becomes the rainbow six siege of horror games cuz I actually enjoy this game. P *fingers crossed* Else it will just slowly lost it's supporter base given a year time &amp ppl will move on when the next big/new game hits the shelf. PS Toxic comunity didn't help as well. Same as all games some ppl just can't take constructive criticism &amp will shut you down at all costs. )PSPS I starting playing killers with nothing but basic lv 1 skill to proof that killer is simply too cheap... ) Rank 13 in less then 2 days slowly climing.

2016-09-26,0,0,2238,False,Recommended,My first actual horror game never really liked them because scary )Watched a streamer (Admiral Bahroo) playing this game for few months and I really liked the gameplay mechanic and the intense moments. I had some previous experience on pc gaming but as a fairly new player I bought this game on a fair price. I fell in love with the game right away and now maybe month later I have over 200hours of gametime in this game. I ve played equally both killer and survivor and leveling them up pretty equally. I like the rng in bloodweb and getting random items. The combinations of perks and add ons really makes the gameplay interesting and adds a twist in every single game.The game has many qualities like the add ons and perk combination the bloodweb and the selection of killers and survivors. My favorites so far as a killer are hillbilly and wraith (yes you read it right) and for the survivors maybe meg and claudette (obviously). Although the pizza dwight is op in every way.lolFor negative things about the game comes to mind a few things there are few glitches and bugs that makes the game sometimes not so much fun (f.ex the pallet stun where the killer gets stuck in the pallet) the huge grind you have to go through to get some decent perks and possible prestige levels and the somewhat wierd performance issues in certain maps and overall in the game.There is a lot of discussion about the balance between killers and survivors what I have noticed is that as you climb up the ranking ladder the harder the games are. But that s the way it should be the better you get the better opponents you should face. Maybe the only real issue is playing as a killers against a well organized survive with friends team with mic communication. That makes the killing much more challenging although not impossible. I have had multible fun games both high rank and low rank games.Overall I think this game is very enjoyable and exciting at times and if you are looking for a survival game with some grind in to it then this is your game for sure! See ya out there on the fields of horror! D,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-28,0,0,324,False,Not Recommended,"First of all i would like to say that this game is an amazing game for being in beta still! Honestly thats what it is. Rushed out before it was finished like most games nowadays. This game is tons of fun the concept is fantastic and addictive. However the mechanics and proceses that come along with the concept are either broken or lacking. The join lobby is not a queue rather a quick join. With that you get a lot of ""failed to connect"" issues. There is no party system so you cannot play with your friends on a ranked system. You are left with a create a friends only lobby that nets you nothing. A party system was promised on release since it was not in beta as well harking back to why this is still beta.The some perks are broken vague or worded wrong. For example the ""Insidious"" perk says ""unlocks the stealth ability. By standing still for 3 seconds you reduce your terror radius to zero and become stealthy until you act again."" You would think that you would become invisible because the game teaches you that as stealth from the wraith but you do not. it just reduces your terror range to zero despite it leading you to think there are two properties. The survivor perk ""spine Chill"" is completely broken and does nothing. A lot of the skill tree is vague as well. When i fist started playing and getting items some would say ""increases your blood points for Boldness."" What is Boldness??? I had no idea b the game never explains it nor is there a way to look at it in the menus. It just shows quickly at the end of the game.Add on's there are add on's for you to add onto the items you bring. Some are also broken others don't do what the explanation says. There is no punishment for stalling leaving games or dodging a pregame if you think the players are to hard to play against. You can literally wait an troll for Hours in game. For example I got glitched into the floor while opening a chest no reason why it just happened. I couldn't move no one could save me and the killer couldn't hit me. So it became a waiting game of ""who will leave first?"" You can do the same thing at the exit leaving the killer to wander and hope someone massively slips up. If no one does then its whenever they want to end the game. Further more people can disconnect from the game without punishment and further punishing players who want to play. Another personal example is that I was running for the exit and just about to get there and the killer pressed Alt F4 causing the game to end. The game brings you to the victory screen and says ""you escaped"" but you don't get any additional points. You Have to escape using the games mechanics to get those points the killer robbed us of that and didn't get any lesser points then what he was going to get nor a punishment of any kind. On top of that If they do that to you your survivor rank goes down! it's not based on wins its based on points accumulated withing the game. If you are a killer and get into a game where everyone DC's right off the bat you go to the great victory screen and then the bummer you lose a rank screen. The menu UI is not fluid and clunky in places not terrible but a super easy fix and should be perfect for release.In short Even with these looming problems and then some this game is addictive and fantastic. I am still going to play it but keeping in mind that the game is broken and people who break the rules get off scott free while punishing you. If you don't accept that then this game will be a frustrating mess for you. **Update!*The new DLC came out and luckly the game no longer works! Seems like they are scrambeling now just in time for a random free weekend download!******UPDATE!****I main survivor and its hard to keep playing this game when the killers are so underpowered. There really needs to be a rebalance. I shouldnt be able to abuse and man handel a killer by myself.",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-28,0,0,213,False,Not Recommended,Until something is done about the imbalance between survivors and killers namely that killers are largely overmatched. I cannot recommend this game.Update Still a pile of terrible core mechanics all balanced in survivor favor. Cameras pathing hit detection and boxes and the fact Killers are penalized by line of sight breaks on almost every action makes this game still largely without recommendation. If you intend to play this game as a killer play either low tier where survivor perks and addons which further riduclously unbalance this game are less common or play Friday the 13th where game bias is in fact in the antagonists favor (as to be expected in a 'horror' game).Update Improving slowly.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-16,0,0,201,False,Recommended,So after reaching sixty hours in this game i thought it might be just the time to write a review about this amazing game!So what is 'Dead By Daylight'?Dead By Daylight is an asymmetrical horror survival game developed by Behavior Interactive and published by Starbreeze Studios. It is basically a 4v1 match in which the killer is trying to kill the survivors and the survivors are trying to escape the given area and of course not getting caught on the killer's hooks.What makes this game really cool is the fresh concept and the many ways you can play the game.Now i'll try to talk about the Survivors and after that we'll talk about the Killers.SurvivorsAs a Survivor you primary objective is to escape which you can accomplish by fixing a number of generators ( the number of generators depend on the number of survivor players ). These generators also require you to pass their 'Skill Checks' which is basically like a QTE. A special sound effect signals that a skill check is coming and then you have to press 'Space' in the given zone to pass the skill check. If you fail a Skill Check the generator's Fix Bar will deprogress and it will generate a loud noise which is shown to the Killer! You can play as several survivors Meg ( not the girl from Family Guy ) Dwight Jake Nea Claudette Ace and finally ( as a guest survivor ) Laurie Strode ( from the superb Halloween Movies ) All of these survivors have different perks attached to them although when you reach a specific level you can buy a 'Teachable' version of that perk in the Bloodweb which can be taught to other survivors. Of course fixing generators aren't the only thing you can do you can also cleanse totems help other players survive or just basically troll the out of the Killer! Own Opinion i love playing as a Survivor its really fun although with friends its even better!KillersAs a killer you have to kill every single survivor. That's all really..xDJokes Aside you can play as several killers including The Trapper The HillBilly The Wraith The Nurse The Hag and the one and only Michael Myers ( The Shape ) I'll do a quick review of these charactersThe Trapper one of the most popular killers he places bear traps around the map which can incapacitate survivors who step into it. Its the first Killer that i played ( and actually prestige'd with ) and he's superb! really fun! The HillBilly Haven't played this Killer but iam planning to! He uses his chainsaw to berzerk around the map and if the chainsaw hits a survivor it instantly incapacitates them! looks like a fun Killer!The Wraith Haven't played this dude. This is the Killer that uses his Bell to go invisible and jumpscare the out of the survivors! He looks like a fun dude so i will definietly give him a shot!The Nurse Haven't played her but i know she is the most difficult Killer to play as! This Killer uses a magical force to 'Blink' around the map! The nurse can be a pain in the if the player can use her! She sounds fun and she needs a lot of practicing! The Hag Haven't played her! The hag is a Killer which is based around the legend known as 'Vendigos'! This Killer can draw traps with her bloody finger which then can be triggered by survivors that go too close giving the Hag the ability to teleport to that trap anytime! She is a really fun killer!Michael Myers ( The Shape ) The most fun Killer in the entire game IMO. He uses 'Stalking' as his ability to Stalk survivors ( just like he did with Laurie in the movie ) to gain Evil Within which give him a lot of bonuses to use againts the Survivors! The Shape is the ultimate killer IMO because he brings a new stragedy into this game which is always appriciated! My Favourite killer ( along with the Trapper )Some Negatives about the game The ing bugs...jesus christ xD the game is almost full of bugs starting from getting stuck in in' trees getting Infinite Loading screens the Killer havin' no body only a head and the Killer's specific weapon! These bugs can be game breaking or just simply annoying. please fix these devs!Exploits..some people like to exploit the bugs of this game..for example i met a player who had a chainsaw on The Shape! Crazy as and its game breaking.Infinites. Although the devs are already working on Pallet Looping ( Sprinting around a pallet until you can do a Killer Stun on the Killer ) it is still worth mentioning since its a piece of tactic and if you actually use it you shall be awarded with a sucker punch into the nuts!The Community ! Despite the fact that i don't really list communities into cons ( and no way iam going to give the game a lower score because of the playerbase ) iam still going to say it for newcomers that most of the playerbase is filled with salty s! Survivors cry because you killed them as a Killer and Killers cry because you pallet looped while you didn't even touch a pallet! Just try to avoid funny conversations like these.Matchmaking ! The game has a ranking system but it really just matches you up with random people! As a Rank Eight Killer i get matched up againsts either a full team of Rank 20s or a full team of Rank 1 Survivors!Now lets get down to the cons and the pros and my final verdict!Pros Fun Fresh and Unique concept! Fun Gameplay Amazing game to play with Friends! Two playstyles! Play as either a survivor or a killer! Michael Myers is absolutely amazing in this game! Good DLCs Devs are patching up bugs and ! Overall just a really great game!Cons Game Breaking and annoying bugs! Most of the Community ( Salty Survivors and Salty Killers ) Infinites( Although bugs and infinites are being worked on by the developers! hopefully they'll find a good solution to these problems! ) Overall i think Dead By Daylight is a new fresh concept and its EASILY worth the full price! I give the game a solid and easy 8/10! It would be 9/10 but since the game has some huge bugs at the moment i'll give it a lower score!I can definietly recommend you to try out this game if you like to survive with friends or just want to slaughter four survivors as a killer after a rough day at school or work! ),Dead by Daylight

2016-07-11,0,0,333,False,Recommended,I wanna report two guys duo to get high bloodpoints. One as a killer the other as a survior. Survivor's ID &lt DBD ID DDKOS Steam UID 76561198067049287&gt &lt Killer ID Sierżant UID iSovietSoldier&gt That survivor tried to block the other survivors' way to escape when the killer was chasing them. Like stand in front of the window to block them and Lead the way for killer to find the other survivors. And notably the killer just wont kill that survivor. Thats what they usually do once the killer caught survivors and hook them up and then that survivor will unhook them. Then again the killer would hit the survivors who was just being saved from the hook and hook them up again. These two god damn guys keep doing this over and over. After the rest of the survivors were sacrifised the killer let that survivor to fix the rest of the generators and also allow him to open all the exit gates. Finally that survivor escaped from the hatch. I remember that survivor's bloodpoint was 24000+and the killer's bloodpoint was 25000+,Dead by Daylight
2017-10-26,1,1,606,False,Recommended,The new Nightmare on Elm Street DLC is awesome. I am usually a Doctor main and when you play him you usually dont really have to look for survivors you just sort of wait for them to scream. Now that Freddy is out I dont even have to wait around anymore. And the best part is I just get to see the survivor like actually see them. I dont even have to look anymore ) it's like the game plays itself for me now when I play the killer. When you can see the survivor its just a matter of time until you catch up to them since your faster and all. So happy I can just skip the hide part of the hide and seek core aspect this game holds. Would recomend this DLC to any killers that want to skip the majority of the work you have to do to as the killer.,Dead by Daylight

Mechanics are frustrating if you are a rager you'll break your keyboard. 7e is the maximum price for the work done.Pros Scary for 30 minutes. After that you get used to. But those 1st 30 minutes are a good experience.Good music for chase panic danger's closeBloodweb (skill trees) are good it's like playing Othello and requires a bit of luck and brain.Cons It's in unnoficial early access. This is still in beta test. The release date of june 17th was premature.Balance is badBecomes repetitive quite fast.Anticheat is a joke.Forced into a ranked system so you'll get what comes with competitive spirit (cheating hosts survivor griefing and being a problem for other survivors)Teamplay as a survivor can be punishingKiller camping is frustrating as hell.No custom keybinds have to switch to qwerty often with all the problems that comes with (chat is gibrish if you forget to shift language).No real video optionsFeels like a bunch of premade assets glued together.Killer is host You can be matched with someone 5000km away. Guess how laggy it can be.You think you juked the killer ? Think again he just teleported to you because pressing left mouse button does that.He disconnects after a game of 15 minutes because he could lose ranks he isn't punished but the survivors may lose ranks.Map design Procedural ? having a few elements moving at random spots doesnt make it procedural it's just random.Procedural generation ? There are 3 maps per area and 3 areas. All the map are likely similar. The procedural generation is barely visible.Maps are badly designed and unbalanced.Invisible walls invisible hitbox on trees and rockGrinding systemPrestige thing .... worthless that's an artifice to boost the lifetime of the game.7 Characters to level up if you want to reach the engame.The teamPublisher strabreeze. They made Payday2 unpopular after it was mega hyped.Devs are mute. No words.Moderation team on steam forums threatens people of game ban for no reasons. (got irrefutable proof so you can try to sue me)1st patches were to nerf endgame content (2 weeks after release) and reverse the unbalance between survivors and killers (game is still unbalanced).UI is not great (do not press escape to close a popup menu such as the daily ritual menu or you'll get another popup menu and you'll be lost in popup menus).Takes too much time to find a lobby/players.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-26,0,0,42,False,Recommended,"Here's the thing about Dead By Daylight. It's broken as hell and the devs don't seem to know what the hell they're doing half the time.And that's perfectly okay.Dead by Daylight is a very fun game to play solo or otherwise. The pure adrenaline of running away from the killer is something quite extraordinary. Learning all the different ways to juke the killer is something to behold as it will take hours to get right. But once you do it's incredibly satisfying.The current gripe the community has with the game (v1.2.1) is that the new killer Michael Myers is incredibly OP. This is not the case. He came out approximately 15 hours before posting this review and already the community is whining about the new killer. If there's anything to take from that is that the community for this game can sometimes be sub par due to them being really picky about how the game plays and are impatient about learning how to play against a killer who changes the way you play just a bit.Another gripe the community has is that the Halloween DLC makes the game Play to Win. Once again this is not the case. Yes the DLC is $7 and includes a killer and survivor. But that doesn't mean you have to pay to get them. You can unlock the killer and survivor in game but you cannot level them up. Yes it does suck that it's behind a paywall to get any big use out of them but that isn't pay to win it's just inconvinient. Overall Dead by Daylight is an incredibly fun game that can keep you entertained for hours with its ""one more game"" mentality.

2017-10-23,0,0,1430,False,Not Recommended,First of all what an addicting game. The gameplay is fairly smooth and isn't nearly as buggy as Friday the 13th. The killers are all fairly unique and offer interesting perks to unlock which change the way you'll hunt the survivors. There are enough perks to make your builds unique and interesting. However there are absolutely top tier and bottom tier perks for both survivors and killers.I would recommend this game to anyone who is willing to sacrafice precious hours of sleep. You won't have a choice once you've downloaded it. Do be aware that some of the community members are salty and are frustrated with certain tactics that each side (killer and survivor) have developed. Some of these complaints are valid but they are not excuses for making bad plays and not punishing that of their opponents. Just say gg after your matches and learn as much as you can. Good luck in the fog!*Update*The devs nerfed a DLC killer based on the data from the lowest skilled players in the game at rank 20. Freddy was an interesting killer. His main issue is that he can't attack a survivor until they transition into the dream world. This makes him very weak. They destroyed a really awesome IP and a potentially great killer. The devs don't seem like they are making positive changes or listening to their community. They lost major consumer confidence.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-26,1,1,476,False,Recommended,Good Luck On Winning The Awards Dead By Daylight! In Other Words. This Game Is A Test Of Your Survival Skills. The Way You Play Is The Way You Win. If You Like To Run You Have Perks For It. If You Like To Hide You Have Perks For It. All Of That Out The Way. Lets Describe Pros And Cons.Pros *Fun Gameplay*Best With Friends*Great Graphics*Amazing DLC(s)*Great Perks.*Fun Killers And Survivours*Different PlaystylesCons *Terrible With Slow Computer*Can't Have Communication In Games.*Hard To Get Chemistry With Strangers*People Hardly Help Get You Off The Hook*Killers Camping The Hook*Killers Staring Into Your Soul As You Perish Into The Mist.*Bugs*Some Bad Perks.In My Opinion. The Game Overall Is Balanced But Beware. Your Never Safe.My Story I Started Playing This About 5 9 Months Ago. Had A Great Time Killers Were Balanced. It Was Amazing But Then I Quit For 4 Months Stuff Got A Bit Killers Started To Get OP More Unbalanced Changes (Great DLC's Though!). This Is Were I Realized That The Game Itself Got Difficult. Mid So I Kept Playing To The Point Were I Realized That I Had To Get Other Teachable Perks. Which Would Take at Least Minimum Of 4 Hours Since Teachable Perks Unlock At Level 30! (Seriously?!) The Best Perks Were Spine Chill Sprint Burst And Botany Knowledge. Those Perks Helped You Survive On Your Own But It Would Take A Long Time To Get These On A Character You Like.End So This Is Were I Started Playing 1 3 Times A Month Since I Started To Get Bored Of The Game. The DLC's Cost Started To Rise A Bit More Which Sucked Especially When You Don't Have Money.Conclusion As I Said. The Game Is Balanced Fun And Amazing To Play But If You Aren't Good At Survival It Can Get Quite Hard. Keep Working On The Game bEhaviour! Its A Good One.(EDIT PARAGRAPHS DOWN BELOW THAT I MISSED OUT ON. THANKS FOR POINTING ONE OUT Derpsider!)Edit Paragraphs #1 Graphics The Graphics In The Game Are Great!

2016-06-16,0,0,1463,False,Recommended,"Actually going to seriously review this game after 2 years of owning it. It's got its bugs its non dedicated servers its toxic community but as you can see from my playtime I always keep coming back to it. Unlike other games that have attempted to move in on the assymmetrical horror game genre that DbD has (ex f13 and the latest DBD clone Soul at Stake) it somehow keeps me coming back to play more and more. It's a lot of fun with friends and even at the moments of bad experiences with other players I've had good ones and made a lot of new friends. A lot of funny ones and terrifying ones (looking at you Pig/Myers). Some of the things that I don't like are the auric cells. I think the cosmetics are super cool and I've managed to get a lot of them from a gift card. Like super cool cosmetics for both survs and killers. I happily support the devs but I feel the prices are too steep. And the ""best"" skins for each character are locked behind these auric cells only. But no lootbox system so there's that. As of the 2.0 update the pallet vacuum was removed making it a bit more fair. But looping (a surv running around a pallet multiple able to bend corners easier because of their smaller hitbox and waste the killer's time) is still a problem. Killers stomp at low ranks and are super weak at high ranks (rip me trying to get to rank 1 killer). SWF is a huge problem and often puts the killer at a huge disadvantage. Put a killer against a 4 man SWF who all know how to loop and have Discord or other Voice chat with all meta perks and the killer is lucky if they get even one kill. On top of this genrushing is a huge issue. Even with the perk Hex Ruin or Hex Huntress Lullaby or any gen slowing perks like Overcharge or Pop Goes the Weasel gens get done most of the time way too quickly. SWF needs a change perhaps a notification for the killer of who is grouped and who is solo. In exchange I don't think the killer should be able to see a surv's profile or information (play time achievements etc). It gives way too much away. Besides those issues and the occuring hilarious bugs/frustrating glitches it really is a fun game at heart and I'd recommend it to anyone.",Dead by Daylight

Devs said they fixed this THEY DID NOT. killers and camping are a big problem in this game there are some killers who will put up their tent and sit in the little at the back at you and stare waiting for a survivor to help you. with a wraith it isnt a big deal because they usually cloak camp and it takes a second for them to get out of the cloak and hit you.

If you are learning the game you may not know that some can stay invisible some can blink etc. The mechanics for fixing the generators appears to be made for you to miss them as if the killer were not already buffed enough.The game mey be improved and fixed but as someone that likes assimetrical gameplay I cannot recommend this game as it is.,Dead by Daylight

Also the devs have added in punishments for leaving which will take a tic mark away from your rank and will even demote you if it is at the appropriate level if you leave early. so please if these are your major complaints i urge you to give the devs time and continue to try the game because honestly it is one of the most fun experiences i have had in a long time!

2017-02-26,0,0,590,False,Recommended,"Настало время рассказать о оригинальной и довольно интересной идеи под названием Dead by Daylight. Идея далеко не новая зато первая в своем жанре которая дожила до финального результата. Играется это все довольно увлекательно а местами и волнующе. Еще до официального релиза игры на стадии беты огромное количество людей смотрели трансляции по игре на твиче что довольно неплохо подогрело интерес перед официальным релизом игры. Еще бы вышло очень атмосферно ночь замкнутое пространство и не покидающее чувство страха.Основу геймплея составляет изначальный выбор роли жертвы или убийцы. Ты сам выбираешь кем стать выживающим на чьих нервах будут играть как на гитаре или сам будешь дергать за струны и щекотать нервы своим жертвам играя за маньяка.Участь жертв далеко не радужна на выбор доступно 4 персонажа у каждого есть своя биография личные перки и предыстория.Главное задание для них это запустить 5 ненавистных генераторов которые то и делают что привлекают маньяка при любой ошибке издавая громкий хлопок. Малейшая ошибка излишняя самоуверенность небрежная прогулка по открытой местности и вы обнаружите себя или подставите других.Раз уж мы начали про звуки то неумение заводить генераторы не единственная ваша проблема шелест травы крики птиц открытия дверей играют против вас тишина и ТОЛЬКО тишина спасут вас в игре есть укрытия шкафчики но если уродец погнался за вами то лучшее что можно с ним сделать оглушить и смыться как можно дальше от него и его дьявольских крюков которые кстати можно ломать на протяжении игры.И убийцы и жертвы по ходу игры получают ""очки крови"" (blood points) которые распределяются по ""кровавой сетке"" (blood web).Выбрав одного из монстров взятых из популярных фильмов ужасов методично выслеживайте уцелевших пресекайте пути к отступлению и спасению раненых. Используйте ряд преимуществ вроде невидимости более высокой скорости передвижения или возможность расставлять капканы. В конце концов кто они а кто вы?! Острой необходимости насаться как угорелому по всей карты нет вы сами выбираете стиль охоты. После поимки жертвы необходимо усмирить его и насадить его на крюк! Уахахах!!!1 А ведь самое главное эти ненавистные человечки могут попытаться снять своего напарника с крюка поэтому насадив жертву на крюк вы не избавляетесь от проблем необходимо некоторое время на его полное обессиливание и смерть.Игра не идеальна но очень интересная. Разработчикам стоит задуматься над переделкой лобби иначе они рискуют потерять много людей из за получасовых ожидай игроков за маньяка.",Dead by Daylight
2018-09-20,1,1,62,False,Not Recommended,No proper 21 9 Ultrawide support. The game wont even allow me to change to 16 9. Instead it cuts off the top and bottom and stretches the screen. Making it unbearable to look at and a huge disadvantage to play with.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-26,0,0,210,False,Recommended,"This game is amazing. From the concept to the game itself. It is thrilling and entertaining by yourself or with friends. I find it to have a very tabletop like mindset where you can sit down and play one game it doesn't have a hundred mechanics so it is easy to grab onto but takes time to master.Unfortunately this game has a very whiny community. As you may have seen since the last patch it got MIXED reviews which is incredibly undeserved. Obviously in a 4 v 1 ranked game the 4 have an advantage in reviews and as a survivor mains I find those negative reviews incredibly undeserved.With mechanics like killers being able to be invisible making it not the standard ""I can see the killer therefore I can avoid him"" it makes for a difficulty spike and forces survivors to adapt their gameplay in scenarios when stealth is nearly almost out of the question... and it seems that new players keep whining about that spike. In any competitive game you will get whining about balance. The situation here is that at higher rank the imbalances shows more and more and the game struggles to please both low rank players and high ranks one. I find myself in the middle playing at the best of my ability to improve challenge the gameplay but never being a tryhard. And the recent killer buffs even if I play survivors 90% of the time are to me extremely fair as an assymetric game should really make the single person very powerful and the remaining 4 only powerful when working together. Although it is not perfect (as no game can really strike a perfect balance) I find the latest patches and latest killer and some to be in the right direction.Really get this game if you want to play with friends or have a good time and squeal as you see the clever af mechanics linked to your favorite slasher killer (rip if it's Jason tho). If you're not sure go watch great youtuber/streamers like tydetyme hybridpanda n00b3... they are high ranks but greatly enjoy the game and watching them just makes you want to try it out.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-18,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,i find it very dull and unbalenced particularly playing as the killer. survivors running 'infinites' and taunting you while you break palettes in addition when you camp a hooked survivor your insulted. i'd play it if it wasn't so repetitive and that if it wasn't unbalenced.

2018-07-26,0,0,425,False,Recommended,So I recommend not listening to any of the negative reviews around July 25 30th 2018. Game had a pretty large balance update and rather than people actually try to learn to strategies on how to play the game or to do certain things differently they are just going to Review bomb the game and make it seems like its a horrible game now.The game is a ton of fun and yes Killers have gotten a lot stronger since the last patch. But if you go and watch any high tier Survivor or killer play this game they will say its fine. Personally I've had very little problem surviving games if I do things right. Its just now I went from a 90% survival rate to about a 60% survival rate. Still means I survive more than not surviving. But I actually have to significantly try now.The problem that all the people who are QQ over the patch have is they are too used to just easily surviving a match and now that is no longer the case.I deffinitely recommend this game its a ton of fun especially with friends. Just dont listen to the QQers in the reviews and go watch good players play this game.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-26,0,0,503,False,Recommended,Just here to help against the review bombing games always have their downs and ups when it comes to balancing. This patch will bring in a new playstyle or will eventually be reverted if it really is that bad as some people think.The community is toxic btw so be careful with that but which online community isn't toxic at this point?,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-26,0,0,1005,False,Recommended,Game is going in a good direction most of the negative reviews are because of the nerf to survivors that came in the 2.1.0 patch it used to be where it was nearly impossible to win as killer without camping/tunneling the survivor(s). they have taken most of that power away now but they still have a lot of power in their hands such as sprint burst decisive strike (might be changed) dead hard etc. In my opinion the game is a lot more balanced than it was before and now you kind of have a chance of winning as killer without camping/tunneling.

2017-09-16,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,This game has potential but like all games that have 'potential' it'll never be what it could be. The killer can outrun you no matter what 100% of the time. You 'can' dodge his attacks go around objects and jump through windows but it only delays the inevitable for the killer to catch up to you. If you 'outrun' him it's most likely because he gave up trying to run after you. Running/hiding is the survivors only defense we can't hurt the killer in any way. In very few games has the killer 'let us win' because he was just messing around &amp 'point farming' I guess.Even though I think some of the 'slashing/disabling' attacks are a bit too much (1 hit for leatherface) to counter this the killer should run at our same speed &amp have an ability to sprint for 6 seconds (to catch up) with a minute cooldown or something similiar. It's like playing a racing game &amp the other guy (AI or not) has a car that's faster than yours. Taking turns closely &amp braking just right doesn't matter after awhile he'll pass you by. It's just not fun to play IMO.Levels and 'perks' have also ruined many games I believe certain characters should have certain skills &amp that's it. Any item you find is while you're in game not through the 'blood points'. So many people for some reason like to complicate matters and wonder why *X is OP* or *Y is OP* because of *feature they have that I don't*. Lots of online multiplayer games with 'levels' and 'perks/talents' have ruined the gameplay IMO. That's why matchmaking never works.I would never buy this game now since I've experienced it through the '5 days free play'.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-30,0,0,592,False,Not Recommended,Trying to enjoy this game is hard now it really is now that this game formaly s its own everytime with huge exploits you can do. Also camping especially is just not fun and ruins the gameplay motive of this game how can i enjoy or do specific hero attempts to save others from dying now that the developers did a patch that now camping is actually way to go now. Even in higher ranks killers do this and theres no decent communities either its so split and divided its difficult to play this and actually enjoy it now. Those who ever consider to get this game just don't its not worth its money and not worth the effort either.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-18,0,0,234,False,Not Recommended,Don t buy this game whatever you do. The developers keep ing over the survivors of this game by pumping out extremely OP killer that are of course DLC. Unless your plans for this game is to play as killer you really should not buy it. The time you invest into the game will never matter since the DLC killers are simply just too good. And then we also have the connection problem. This game still uses peer to peer. And who is the host? THe killer of course. I get that the killer is supposed to have the upper hand but this game just overdoes it.,Dead by Daylight
2017-04-07,0,0,1278,False,Recommended,"So... Dead by daylight... this game took me on quite an adventure when i first got it i could not stop playing just so fun. Running from a killer and juking him so hard is just too much fun but then they started to downfall when they started adding so many things that make the game ""NoobFriendly"". This game is just too easy now it used to take countless hours to level up to get a certain character to a certain level to obtain the perks that only they own to give off to your other survivors but now there is the shrine which gives you perks for currency u get for playing and the leveling up is 2x faster to level up which is too easy now everyone has all the good perks and just playing is a little repetive but none the less fun. the devs are always adding new things and when they do that they brake a lot of things. SWF or Survive with friends is always broken every other patch trust me. The devs are always trying to keep up with everyone because there was a time where everyone lost all their progress in the game such as all perks and items and EVERYTHING... and that happend to a lot of people (such as me D ) but anyway the game is good just if u can get good at survivor (Opinion) it is so much more fun especially with friends u can just do so many things in this game and they are constently working on patches bugs and new killers and survivors overall to rate this game it has taken so much of my life and out of all the fun i've had im gonna have to say 8/10 because there are constantly new bugs that are sometimes not to bad or really stupid and the devs do take a while to get around to bugs sometimes and it can really tick people off. So just to finish things up here its a good game to have some laughs but if u cant stand some bugs and have a high temper than u most likely won't enjoy it. But this is now one of my favorite games!",Dead by Daylight
2016-07-25,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,"Fun game when you can get in but it's a ""failed to join lobby"" simulator.",Dead by Daylight
2016-07-31,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"My main problem is that the Killer has a massive advantage over the Survivors. There is no way to communicate with your team so you basically have to guess what everyone else is doing whilst the game is happening. I guess this makes it more ""realistic"" or ""immersive"" and I've read that some people prefer it like this since you can choose to be a lone survivor or help the team. There is no point having a team based game if you can't communicate with your team. What's the point of having lobby chat and nothing in the actual game?The Killers are stupidly over powered. If you sprint or bleed they know exactly where you are and it's just a matter of time until they slice you down. If you don't sprint and have no blood coming out then you'll just get caught by the Killer because they can move as fast as you can. Having 3rd person perspective is not an advantage it's just different. I don't see how ""limiting"" the Killer to 1st person is meant to balance it out. Maybe it's just meant to be a quirky mechanic I'm not really sure.There is no information in the game about the Bloodweb/Perks system. Here is my brief experience of trying to level up when I was first in the game ""Hey I can get a torch cool"" *double clicks Torch*""Why didn't that buy?""*2 minutes later*""Oh you have to hold it down. Okay that's fine I've got a torch now""*goes into game with torch loses and goes back to menu*""Hey where did my torch go?""So items are consumable after one game. You have to then unlock them again if you want to use them. Nothing tells you any of this when you're in the menu I just came to the realisation. I know a lot of people will say ""You should have researched before playing this game"" but that's a poor excuse for reasoning. Games are meant to help new players when they start it's not meant to be about being confusing.On top of that the mechanic behind the ""checks"" is ridiculous. Which member of the development team said ""Well you know this games already good you know what would make it better? QUICK TIME EVENTS!"". Yes everyones favourite strain of AIDs Quick Time Events. Make sure you don't have a mechanical keyboard and accidentally press the Space bar too quickly because that generator will blow up every single time. Want to heal your friend? You just made him scream and bleed even more. Quick Time Events are not a test of reflexes and are definitely not any indicators of skill they are a mistake which was born from consoles and Neanderthalic button bashing mechanics like this should have died with the Gamecube.Another thing that aggravated me was the basic tactics that most of the Killers seemed to employ. Out of the handful of games I played it was mostly people picking the Wraith. The main strategy seemed to be something like this Go invisible Find a survivor Get them on the hook Stand next to the hook waiting for them to die Repeat until all survivors are deadThat was literally it. I briefly read some posts on the subreddit about people defending the hook camping strategy but since Reddit suffers from ultimate groupthink syndrome it's pretty easy to see that they are all biased. Of course they think that it's a good strat just put a thinly veiled reason for it and people will say ""Yeah you're right"" for fear of being called out by someone else. I can see how it's fun for the Killer because it's easy points for them. I'm sure someone will tell me ""Hey well that's not actually how it works"" but the fact is that the Survivors are just constantly getting caught and then hook camped to death. It's not fun for me to be the 1st or 2nd person to be killed and then have to Spectate a match where the Killer either does the same thing to the remaining Survivors or the other Survivors escape because the Killer was busy hook camping.I played a few games as each Killer as well to see if I was missing something. I was not missing anything it is easy and I can totally understand why it takes longer to find games where you want to be the Killer. Join as a Survivor and you're right into the game. Want to be the Killer? Good luck waiting 5 minutes for other people to turn up. I'm guessing this is because everyone wants to play as the Killer and the only people who want to play as Survivor are those that have just started playing the game (as they don't know any better) or those who just want to play and don't want to have to wait 5 minutes between each instance.All in all this game is only really good if you've been playing it from the start. All the people that will praise this game are those who have sunk a significant amount of time into gaining perks or just play Killer constantly. I don't have time for a game dominated by fanboys especially when the underlying mechanic behind it is QTE. There is not a stealth element it's not even a scary game.I honestly gave it my best try and I'm over the amount of hours for a refund now so I'm stuck with this game. In an attempt to make lemonade from my salt I will keep a close eye on the updates to this game to see if it gets better. There is great potential here but it's clouded by a select group of people who abuse the game and broken/outdated mechanics like QTEs.EDIT Don't just disagree with my review tell me why you disagree with it. If you look at the recent reviews from this game you'll see that the majority of them are negative reviews from people with many more hours than I have on this game. They are also (mostly) listing the same reasons as I am. Hook camping killers downvote without saying anything.That being said I am still attempting to play this game to see if longevity provides some form of entertainment. I have some hopes that it won't be a complete waste of money.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-16,1,1,41,False,Recommended,"Edited to account for new patches.TLDR I really like this game the only iffy parts are minor ranking/technical issues. If things like achievements not working occasional animation bugs and some items being unbalanced bother you then wait a little while until they're fixed.Positives The gameplay is fairly well balanced although it may not seem like it when you first start out as some things can only be learned through experience. But at the end of the day you can complete your goals as either a survivor or killer and have a good chance as either. The random generation of map and elements means that both sides need to consider the map layout in their actions. Survivors don't automatically know where the generators are and the killers don't automatically know where survivors are likely to camp items as chest locations change. All the killers have different playstyles and all the survivors specialize in different things. A match where the trapper is the killer will be played differently than a match where the wraith is the killer. A match with 3 lvl 15 jakes will be played differently than a match with all 4 characters. If you screw up as a survivor it is not an immediate game over your friends can save you or you can salvage the situation. This makes it slightly easier on new players.Negatives Gameplay Edition The tutorial teaches the main points and nothing else. While there is only so much strategy a tutorial can teach in a multiplayer game some basic elements like all the uses of items are only stated on the wiki outside of the game and not in the tutorials. Currently the game is geared towards the selfish survivor. You are much more likely to escape if you repair generators while the killer is busy with your friends than if you risk life and limb to save them. Balance issues most of which are minor Any new survivor player will have difficulty if the wraith is the killer on enclosed maps as they won't have the perks to know when he's coming and the enclosed areas mean they can't visually see him. The flashlight is very underpowered and about as effective as it would be in real life. Negatives Tech Edition No queueing with friends (As of 6/16/2016). You can host private games but you and 2 friends can't all queue in a group to get the full number of people. Ranking issues Rank is currently not an indication of skill and there are 2 main categories of players those who rank up indefinately and those who don't care about rank and are continuously at rank 20 even as their characters get more and more skills and perks. (I'm not an amazing player but I have a lot of perks as a crutch and if ranking was alright myself and quite a few others would probably be at rank 15 18 instead of at 20 shredding the poor newbies.) Minor bugs some of which are funny (animation bugs) and some of which are annoying. It is possible for a hatch to be invisible and uninteractive even after the requirements to open it are met. If the trapper places a trap under a hooked player then their teammates can't disarm it because the ""unhook"" prompt takes priority over the ""disarm"" prompt.",Dead by Daylight

2017-04-16,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,"KILLER LET DOWN Game Overview Game FACTS There is NO FEAR here. New killer to the game here. Got hate mail within the first 2 hours of gameplay last week. Due to me camping' as a killer. I dont have thousands of hours dedicated to the game. However this is my opinion. I also played other 4vs1 games.My general observations Most common things ive seen A good survivor team can end the game within like 3 minutes..have you running around like an idiot. Ghost teams. What urks me when they ""give you a chance"" at the end. hanging out inside the gate. Again im running across the whole map. Just to possibly injure maybe kill one. FUN. I know that the survivors already won so whats the point? Give me points? No thanks. Keep em. Game play Im not really positive they have this game perspective correct. As in First and Third person view. Survivors can see around corners thier perception is OTHERWORLDLY. Not to mention ""cone perks"" were it basically feels like they see you coming a mile away cept when u play MM. The hunter is in 1st person view? Or are the real hunters survivors???WERES THE FEAR in this game? When i drop in and wildly dash slash as nurse? To just drunk stumble and weep tears? Spooked you with a JUMP scare tho HAHA!. I am dissapointed. Not to mention the overall lack of abilities. I own games that use the ENTIRE keybord. This is just pitiful. Weres the fear? Pallet Circle Looping Tea bag taunting survivors. Clad in speed perks that i honestly cant even catch flatout wide open. There just feels like a lack of fear and balance. How to kill as a killer Hooks big meat hooks oh and good luck catching and bringing a ""Victim""WHY do killers CAMP HOOKS? Heres the answer Its beyond frustrating chasing weaving breaking pallets stepping through obsticles outflanking hitting once chasing down again to finally at last hit a survivor knock them down catch them crawling away pick them up locate a hook drag them there while they are struggling hopefully hooking in time before dropping them. Thats alot of work just to get someone on the hook TO KILL THEM. But wait theres more! As a killer you will be Shunned by the entire community if you make shure they DIE. Oh NO NO you are supposed to LEAVE go chase ghosts and shadows in the dark MEANWHILE they ""quickly"" unhook thier friend and at the same are nailing thier final generators opening the exits... guess what you get to do? chasing weaving pallot breaking window jumping swatting. Good luck at running down fresh survivors who have evaded the entire match. Now taunt you at every moment they get because YOU CAMPED YOU BASTARD! You didnt let our teamate GO FREE! So we can Just win anyway reguardless of your hard earned single hook kill! Because while you were chasing that one target down we hit all or objectives! OR OTHER cool tactic they use THEY WILL DC AT THE POINT OF DEATH! Screwing thier whole team over! get you tons of points! meanwhile the survivors whine and Killers are OP! Bottom Line Such a lack of creativity of potentially one of the best Horror games made. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN KILL IS BY HOOKING or final survior perking. i think. Still Pretty Lame. The only gratification of being a killer is smashing a survivors face in as they hang on a hook while their teamates win the match Anyway. Then most likely come for thier commrad to make certain you get very little for all your efforts. Resolve Ive been a proactive killer using my one single epic' ability. swatting with my oh so awesome doom weapons. pressing spacebar to slowly step over obsticles to pointlessly damage the survivor objective generators and holding the W key alot. To circle endlessly around survivor known"" pallet drop locations This games rough. I cant even fathom the strategy and tactics used. Theres pallets theres hooks..and uh.. w a s d right mouse button left button spacebar..... The enemy team can talk to each other can heal can see you can get out of almost any situation you can think of. The game claims to be scary they are NOT scared of you they are working around you. KIllers are limited to pretty much one way to kill. Thats pretty disgusting considering what this game promotes. If there were actual Killer ABILITIES like keyboard keys 1 2 3 4 to vary what your actually going to do and not be predictable. UN predictability is scary. Limiting the survivors perspective view way further down than crystal clear 3rd person mile long see around corners vision. IS SCARY. As a killer you get perks that are terrible meh rating at best moderate this or that. AWESOME! KILL! not. I own all the killers. You have not talked about perks they say. Perks perks perks. That means lvl lvl lvl lvl. Not worth my time. This games not worth dedication. Its Pallets and hooks for hells sake. Bare bones PVP. With an extreem lack of well insane ways to kill spikes! dead fall pits! hanging log traps! I DONT KNOW HAVE WE EVER watched horror movies before we came to this video game design? Dont answer that...we have survivors that fight back with Flashlights! Annnnnd......Paletts!! These tactics the projected overall strategy make for Extreem slaughterific gameplay! The Survivors suck to play against the Ledgendary killers are about as scary as a falling pallet. Predictable as well. If theres any real hope for this game needs more traps hell TRAPS FOR EVERYONE! Make em universal everyone gets murdered if the thing goes off. the survivors got enough communication going right? I can come up with 10 000 ideas that could make this game more authentic to its ing Ledgenday Roots. More traps more abilities more killers more survivors more creativity.

2016-06-30,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,I do not reccomend this game. I will start with the most glareing reasons. I am sad to say this though because I love the concept and really tried to like the game. So to start off with we will do Cons since I don't reccomend the game First Glaringly unplayable due to lots of issues with glitches. I have about 10 friends who play this game of those 10 atleast 3 experince glitches that range from weird and annoying to game breaking. I have videos on my stream of the gamebreaking glitches happening lots of times while I am live. I can go into details but most glitches include character models tripping out or worse broken game client that doesn't work/crashes entirely kicking you from the match.There is a little box that comes up saying when did this happen? I wrote in a few times but quickly gave up and waited a few weeks for a patch. Most might say (oh it's on your end something isn't installed properly but I have done all the appropriate things to make sure the game should have no issues. I have a brand new I5 6600K processor 16 gigs of ram a gtx 980ti etc. etc. You get the point it was proffessionally built and less than 2 months old. No issues with any other game I play and verified intergritty of the files in steam. These glitches happen 1 out of 3 games and leave me relaunching with no points and a loss for the match. Outside of that matchmaking is REALLY REALLY BAD. By this I mean the times are huge considering everyone is playing this game the ranks are so spread out bottom ranks playing agasint top ranked players etc. one or the other would be meh fine. But I have an average of 3 5 minutes at least for queues and then I will have a rank or level that has atleast 10 times as much time in the game as I do. This coupled with the crashing make the game really hard to play in the first place.Those are out of game issues or playability. So how is the game when it is running properyly? It is fun definitely fun. I'd probably change this to a reccomend but not a 10/10 OMG get this reccomendation. as it stands. The game has a fun concept solo tough guy vs 4 weak guys trying to escape. Think mario party but a bit more complicated.With that being said it isn't super duper complicated. The concept is simple and easy enough to figure out after a match or two making the learning curve not too steep. However with perks and items there is enough to keep you invested for quite a while perfecting your master plans. I give it a 100 or 200 play hours before I would find myself bored or craving something new. However I can't do it with all the issues. With that being said 100 hours on a game that's only 20 bucks? totally worth it!!! I think this is a great game that should have had more polish and a cleaner launch. Worst launch ever?? No blizzard holds that record in my book. but blizzard also cleaned up a lot faster this is 2 or 3 weeks out and I still see people having issues no one can solve. All in all do you loovvvveee the concept and you're willing to take the risk? If so buy it. but if you're going to be frustrated by mechanics not being polished random crashes and horrible matchmaking? stay away!!,Dead by Daylight

It is so easy to get into a game and it is super great. It has top notch graphics and sound design and an EPIC MUSICICAL SCORE!!! All the maps are diffirent EVERY TIME. They are generated every time. You will also feel like hero when you save one of your teammates or do somthing brave like distract the killer or somthing. It also has great character progression and upgrades. Also the game is very very well balenced. The most well balanced game ive seen. It's hard to play both sides and shows how well balenced it is. It's not hardcore or anything you will learn things.

2016-07-31,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. As everyone's noted the party system doesn't work/exist. But at least it'll eventually go through with Survivors. Making a Killer vs. friend Survivors game can't be done without a full party and awards no points. Besides that the Bloodweb is worthless. Everything except for Perks are single use but also in the way of Perks. Everything in it is mandatory to level up so I hope you like single use overpriced garbage. The Corn level is misery. Utter blindness somewhat detracts from the fun. Balance is pretty mediocre. If the Wraith has any advantage on the Trapper I don't know what it is. (Update He has several late game perks that allow him to functionally wallhack.) Struggling out of a Sacrifice is literally impossible. I decided not to get carpal tunnel and went easier on the space bar and was pretty much instantly killed as soon as I stopped hammering it at max speed. Conversely rescuing a hooked survivor takes half a second and can be brute forced with a second player to bodyblock for you. Survivors only have a few gestures to communicate. No vocal options even pre set. The visual settings cannot be selectively enabled/disabled. Post processing is a huge burden on computers few people seem to want on yet I can't turn it off alone. The lore only found on their website is mediocre and doesn't explain some of the Killers' most interesting features. No map selection.A friend got me this game and is now the only reason I'm tolerating it. This feels like an Early Access game but I know it's never going to be improved because apparently the devs like it with no communication between people intended to cooperate. This suggests that the devs are either amazingly stubborn about their shortcomings or morons.For $5 maybe this game would be worth considering. For $20 buy anything else I haven't also declared hatred for. Wait for Last Year or Friday the 13th to come out. Just don't get this game unless you're a big fan of either wandering around in delecrit fields (and no other environments) or abandoning mute idiot teammates because you're only going to die for trying to help them with a heavy helping of RNG either way to determine how you do.Update I've now played the game for over 11 hours. The devs seem completely unresponsive to the MANY gripes or suggestions about how to fix issues in the game it turns out it was released with known bugs and though my history of party wipes would suggest I no longer suck at the game I still find great fault with it.What I didn't know about the Bloodweb was that at a later level options will disappear from it as some are taken. While this sounds good because I could not spend 5k Bloodpoints (a significant amount) on a single use Offering to take me to a map I hate it also risks destroying the Perk the only significant thing found in every level. Speaking of Perks the ""rarities"" are misnomers. Every time you acquire the same Perk the strength of it goes up. It's Level not Rarity.If the devs REALLY rolled up their sleeves and did some heavy reconstruction the game could still be good but as it is it's mostly a cesspool of cheese and scum tactics with the occasional catharsis of outmaneuvering several players who haven't yet embraced their inner darkness.Update 2018 The community is so toxic that members of it troll the Last Year subreddit and there is now a ton of overpriced gameplay affecting DLC. I recind my suggestion that this game is worth buying for $5. I want a refund and I got it for free. There is clearly never going to be improvement to the terrible core mechanics or hard meta only more overpriced content and the existence of this game is sucking the potential for good horror characters to appear in anything decent. It damages entertainment just by existing. If I could I would review it negatively again.",Dead by Daylight

I know this could get hard for the killer but there are a lot of people who going to quit this game because they can not play with theire friends when they arent to 5.In the game there could also be other objectives like you have to get some parts to repair a car to quit the mission area or the killer has a hostage and you have to free him.But the game makes a lot of fun to play.Serikx ),Dead by Daylight

2016-07-01,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,This game would of been a game if there wasn't so many bugs and it definitley needs a lot more balancing I will list examples below.1. There needs to be an online party system when you want to play with a friend or two it gets annoying when you have to jump server to survivor looking for them but what about cheating? well with the spectating mode there is no real way of cheating seeing how both the player and the spectator have to be looking at the same thing.2. Jumping from server to server can easily crash your game I have been at it for an hour trying to find my two friends and out of that hour I have crashed about 7 8 times. First it starts off with your character duplicating itself then bringing you into a screen with the UI and some floating trees once in this screen you can not access any of the UI elements.3. Matchmaking is not totally fair new players are getting matched with rank 1 level 50 characters so the game has basically decided who wins. There should of been quite a bit more thought put into that aspect because some of the perks the higher levels can use are quite over powered.4. Like I said some perks really need to be nerfed or atleast evened out a bit.5. Also half of the time a patch is released it seems to make the game more buggier than it was before. Great job devs!6. Now the jacket on Caludette is fairly glicthy the right side of it is continously twitching also the texture on the Trapper is off his left shoulder and back doesn't match up. Small glitches like this should of been fixed before release.No need to get mad after reading this it is just my opinion on what's wrong with the game and until some of this has changed this game is not worth the buy at full price.,Dead by Daylight

So many salty kids who whine you are cheating or camping when in fact you're beating them fair and square. Patrolling an area and looking for players is not camping!!! Here's an example. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v NNnmKdHfbckMostly they whine call you names then report you for nothing . Occasionally you get a really good team who work together and escape. I enjoy these games as its a constant battle between players distracting you and others rescuing and breaking your hooks. When its played with a good killer and tactical team its a fantastic game. Currently this game is around 10 on steam for me its a no brainer.Sure it has some matchmaking issues and some bugs but its one of the most enjoyable multiplayers ive played in a long time.

2016-12-25,0,0,603,False,Recommended,Most of my friends have played around the 30 hours mark and they enjoyed themselves that was earlier days too when the bugs were a lot worse. I'd say this game is worth a try as it's a unique (or was until Friday the 13th) experience. Bugs aside. I'm going by what I've seen so far on my friends' broadcasts. It s genuinely a fun experience especially with your mates.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-27,0,0,518,False,Recommended,This is a phenominal game that I very much enjoy although it can be frustrating to face against killers who (mindlessly) facecamp you I still respect the strategic form of camping in this game. I highly recommend playing with friends because sometimes random new players have zero idea what they are doing and overall fail to get to the end game. Whoever says Freddy is overpowered really needs to play the game more clearly to understand he's stupidly easy to counter as long as you do your gens! Remember it takes 7 full seconds for him to put you to sleep so be sure to save that hooked survivor during the end game because he won't be able to kill either of you even if you take a hit. As a killer I understand flashlights can be very annoying just use lightborn franklins demise or even Overwhelming Presence to get rid of them and use enduring or brutal strength to counter pallet loops. It's not difficult.... Anyways definietly better than Friday The 13th by a long shot &lt 3,Dead by Daylight

The atmosphere is great and it can be a good challenge on the survivor side and on the killer side. They keep the game fresh by updating it fairly often.

2017-01-11,0,0,24,False,Recommended,"As of right now (16 hours of gameplay) can I reccomend this game? Yes and No. This game has alot of petential probabley some of the mopst potential of any horor game that has come out in the last few years. Lets start with the pros of the game its a great game to play with friends the graphics are pretty good the controlls are simple but they work and work well. It doesnt take long to find a game but sometimes the connection isint great (see cons) There is also alot of content The Dlc is also very goodNow for the cons of the game. Lets start with the biggest issue bugs the Devs of this game dont seem to care about the bugs as much as the community. As far as survivors it doesnt seem to buggy but playing as the killer is a differant story. As the killer you will notcie the survivors dont move at the same framrate as everything else. You will notcie when you pick up or injur a survivor or watch him jump through a window JUST the survivior will be super laggy and it makes the game feel only halfway finished. As far as the connection you connect to the killers connection and the killer host the games. So if the killers connection is trash so will yours. Another small problem with this game is the fact that come games can get very boring with one of your teammates getting chased the whole game while everyone else gets generators and it doesnt become a survival game it becomes a ""dont miss the skillchecks"" simulator. Conclusion Do i recomend this game? Maybe... if you have friends to play with and dont mind some major bugs sometimes a crappy connection and the occasional boring game then Yes (All these problems could be fixed if the Devs started listening) Will I continue playing this game and buying the DLC? YES! Would I get this game if I had no friends to play it with? Definantly not.",Dead by Daylight

2017-01-30,0,0,367,False,Recommended,4 (survivors) v 1 (killer) gameplay. I believe at this moment there are 11 maps. 6 survivors and 5 killers. Objective as a survivor is to survive the match by repairing a certain amount a generators to power up and escape through the exit gates. As a killer your objective is to kill them all before they escape. Filled with unique perks for survivors and killers alike offerings that affect the maps etc There are also survivor items such as medkits or toolboxes that offer a slight edge against the killer. As well as unique killer abilities like bear traps or invisibility. Invite your friends and strategize together or join a private match and kill them. The current state of the game is nice imo. In the beginning the game was rushed and was released with a lot of bugs balancing issues and a broken matchmaking system. The devs patch the game frequently adding monthly updates that also contain patches/bug fixes and dlc's. There are some issues here and there but overall the game runs great. Its a fun fast paced game that is really enjoyable with friends or even with random's. Its all about survival and teamwork!,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-14,2,1,320,False,Not Recommended,The concept of this game is amazing. Too bad this piece of garbage never works ever. Survive with friends is literally the cancer of the universe. Most of the game is readying up over and over only to have it tell you that there were no matches found and then you ready up again. Not to mention in 50% of my games the killer finds me and then lag switches so there no disadvantage to him but literally no way the survivor can escape. Also if the killer DCs there is no punishment but if the survivor does they get points and you lose rank. This game is amazing only if you like listenting to 10 second loops of guitar playing and sitting at the main menu.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-24,1,1,35,False,Not Recommended,"Myself and two friends started playing this game during the free weekend. For the first few days it was great. After today and yesterday I cannot in any form recommend it at this time.Last couple days even with only two of us trying to find a lobby is like pulling teeth. It constantly fails to find a lobby requiring us to click the ready up button over and over again. When it does find something it either bugs out or kicks us meaning we have to reform the group.On the opposite side as a killer. I played the trapper quite a bit and liked him. But after the free weekend ended I started to notice more and more unbalanced matches. Ones where survivors were able to literally run circles around me while I was unable to actually do anything because all my hooks were either across the map in the basement or destroyed.This culminated today when after failing to find matches as a group we disbanded and I attempted to try the new Nurse killer for the first time due to a quest. There is absolutely ZERO reason that I should be going up against teams of survivors with 3 4 nearly maxed out sets of perks while I don't have even a second perk slot unlocked on ANY character. All this while also trying to learn the nurse's teleport mechanic.The cherry on top is like any online game the craptastic community. The discussion board is FILLED with people complaining about killers ""camping"" hooked survivors by standing right in front of them. However unless you completely ignore the survivor after hooking them your chat at the end of the match will more than likely have people calling you a camper.",Dead by Daylight

Not to mention the killer abilities are weak at best with no upgrades that make them any more menacing than when they began with. Lack of gore logic story purpose and a bland battlefield the game's largest issue is that its not even scary. Much like Evolve this game will get boring within a half hour of playing though you will repeat the same experience over and over and over again within the first 15 minutes whether you pick a survivor or one of the derivitive and boring stale killers.,Dead by Daylight

The graphic textures look terrible on some machinery or look like they are using up too much GPU when they could be more robust and still look good also 50% of most players actually like the game which is a very small satasfactory. Pros * Unique horror style gameplay* Challenging* Play as a serial killer* Play as a surivor / trying to escape* killers trolling can make for some pretty funny moments.Cons * Not enough modes* Gets repetitive* Lack of features / mechanics* No party mode or feature of balanced party mode.* 50% of all players who play like the game* textures look like garbage on some objects,Dead by Daylight

I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes the idea of being chased around by a murderous killing machine and screwing around with friends trying to avoid/juke the killer. Both KYF and SWF are enjoyable features. and solo queue has its draws. Does this game have its flaws? Sure all games do. Overall it's one of my favourites though.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-18,0,0,963,False,Not Recommended,It's basically become a collection game on rails because the perks nullify the basic stategy and mechanics of the game. It's pretty boring once you play it for a couple days. You literally just take turns 'saving' players off of a hook until its your turn.

2018-08-19,0,0,580,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun indeed...but it has its problems. Being asymmetrical that is 4v1 indeed the stats are for the killer understandable but when you have 2 or less players it's as if it's unbalanced somewhat. It's hard to win as surv (if you have a real good killer).I'm not a good player i've reached only surv rank 12 but i've heard that a vast majority of the community is rank 10 or higher. and that being rank 10 or lower its hard to find matches or they can be frustrasting. I've never really seen toxicness like this before. This was the most toxic commmuity I have ever played in a gaming community. But also met some new friends. I dont care about the DC's and the Perks whose overpowered and what needs nerfing. A really good killer can wipe out all 4 survs fast and think the killer is cheating not making it too fun for survs happens on new seasons. But 4 really good survs on SWF can make a good killer hate this game. My guess is the balance is 2 really good survs vs 1 good killer 4 noobs vs 1 noob. It's a guess i could be wrong probably am. To all the new players advice is this read up on the game play watch youtube vids read posts and forums or whatever before playing. you are gonna want to catch up on some tactics before you play. noobs agaist noobs probably the most balanced. I love this game no doubt and since I had it for less than a year I've had updates about 10 times. Which means the devs are working on it good or bad but mainly means they are still investing time on it. This game promotes competiveness so if you're not a competitive gamer I dont know if you would like it. But there are some golden matches that you will play that will make you love this game. Unfortuanatly it's about a 1 in 4 6 chance. Generally/pubicly I want to recommend this game but I cannot if I do recommend get it on sale just in case you don't like it.

Visual bugs when the Killers hold you you will be inside his chest when you're on hook you will remain on hook even if you're dead and grabbed up. Loading bug when entering a game or finding a game . It doesn't show as other games in matchmaking system when search you need to re search a lot to find a match rather than making it like CS GO search and confirm and making a ping option ? .OLD Really awesome game but what i hate in this game No party system . Ping depends on host . Whenever you enter a lobby the host says "" SA pliz leave waiting for friends "". Can't you do a better system to reduce people like this ? like an option to allow friends to join to his lobby after his friends join disable the option so can people join or just make the ing party system . What i really hope to see More better addons . more maps / killers / survivors / more ways to escape die . a way to communicate between players in game not like Curse or Teamspeak but like Rust if you're near us. you can hear us .9/11 would love to myself and be the first to get killed / hooked /",Dead by Daylight

I almost instantly refunded it since you could not find a stable game.I now bought it again during a free weekend trial and after the last patch (1.2.2) i can finally say its worth it.You can now play with friends and finding games is not a pain in the like it was before. There are however still minor bugs. It's by no means the end of the world.Yes you rarely get Dc'd and lose items.Yes sometimes the cue shoves you back to the main menu.And yes there are still some glitches.BUT this game is enjoyable. After 20 hrs of game play i still get an adrenaline rush as soon as the hunter chases me.

My recommendations Slower killers Less hooks in the map Slower skill check Quieter survivors Other hiding spots besides lockers Delete all the damn crows Proning ability for survivors Less saturated player models all survivors stand out a little too wellAnd whatever helps make the game not seem like an absolute party for the killer every single game especially when the DLC killers are really powerful and appear in every game I join now. I'm trying really hard to like the game but every game I try as survivor I end up finishing the game in a bad mood (even if I escape there is barely a hair of satisfaction from it). I don't even care about the ranking system I just want a fun game.Also terrible frame drops.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-25,3,1,51,False,Not Recommended,"Games last like 4 5 minutes takes 80 seconds for a survivor to complete 1/5 generators so basically what happens is 3 survivors work on generators while the killer chases around the 4th survivor who probably did about half of his own generator before the chase started. Depending on the survivors skill the chase may last anywhere from 20 40+ seconds if they are a new player or multiple minutes if they are a moderate or above skilled player. The ""chase"" consists of running in circles around garbage piles and dropping garbage pallets in front of the killer while also occasionally jumping through windows. Eventually all 5 generators will be completed and the exit gates opened. Survivors are also armed with tools to make repairing the generators faster tools to blind the killer and make him drop the survivor he just spent 3 minutes chasing and perks that just straight up let a survivor jump off the back of the killer and run away. The big issue is that there is a ""skill cap"" for killers meaning they reach a point where they can no longer ""be better"" the killer has to rely on the survivor making a mistake to finally make a good play and even then survivors have multiple second chances to get out of it.So playing survivor is too easy. You sit and hold left click for 80 seconds on your generator and then help work on the last ones or you run around garbage piles and windows for 3 minutes while your team does the gens. I felt bad FOR THE KILLER alot of games I saw teamates teabagging the killer behind pallets or after flashlight blinding him and making him drop the guy he was chasing for 3 minutes.And playing the killer...well...I would describe it as feeling somewhere in the realm of a 8 year olds hat being thrown back and forth over him between two 16 year old high school bullies while he runs back and forth trying to grab it...yes...that's how it feels to play THE KILLER....When balance issues where brought up to the game director he said ""play something else...try civilization"" they obviously dont care about player feedback.So I cannot recommend this game the concept is awesome...but that's about it.

Killers are very respectful when you ""kobe"" of the hook and there is rarely a killer that ""tunnels"" a certain individual. If I could give this game 6/5 stars I would. People never have their save files reset either and the killers are super balanced. The best example of this is the nurse she should be buffed probably and she is my favorite to play against. I also love being stuck inside palets and ""tea bagged"" as I am being mori'd. I have ran out of space on my wrists from slitting them so much but this game helps fuel my imagination.

In terms of fps i run the game at 60 fps on low and as a killer i don't have more than 40 fps so if you buy the game just to be a killer make sure that you can run it with 60 fps as a killer.

Speed that generators can be rapaired by Survive with friend party is so ing amazing. You dont even realized and you have one survivor on hook and only one generator left even if you have RUIN and other S tier perks. But the best part on this trash game is fact that survivors (SWF) think they are good when they blocking your hook or blinding you with flashlight and then this toxic comunity are complaining about camping but what can you do when they make 4 generators in 30 seconds ? Next part that makes me enjoy this game more is when you chasing nolifer with every single pallet coorinates written on his (random palets spawn would be so GREAT).SWF with perks will be always stronger than killer with S tier perks,Dead by Daylight

Do you want to have every trick in the game to survive as a survivor to be nerfed by developers? Do you want a game that's matchmaking is so broken that as a Rank 20 survivor (lowest rank) you'll match up with a Rank 1 3 Killer (top rank of killers) on your first match? Do you want the killer to have no penalty to camp you as you die on a hook? Do you want to hear ""git gud"" every time you complain about a nerf to the survivors? Well if you answered yes to all of these questions this is the game for you. Yes Dead by Daylight where it's acceptable to as a killer (who mind you all have a speed boost extreme lunge range and a perk that allows them to down you in one hit) but it's ""crying"" when the number of pallets are extremely decreased (one of limited ways to slow down a killer) when it takes 2 seconds to run through a window (before it was ""too fast ("") and on top of that when skill checks are lowered in length (so it's easier to blow up a generator or mess up healing a teammate). And for everyone that's going to say I'm complaining and crying and that I'm not good you're talking to a Rank 1 survivor and a Rank 1 killer that has over 140 hours logged into the game. This game is terrible and I am just waiting for Friday the 13th to come out so that this game gets it's inevitable end and so that this development team once broke can realize the error in their ways. Maybe if you didn't make it impossible for those who don't want to be an over powered killer (oh by the way there is such a lack of survivors it takes 5 10 minutes as killer to find 4 players) to win and succeed at the game it wouldn't die as quick. They are lucky the Michael Myers DLC was released when it was because this game was slanted to be dead in about a month they may have bought themselves about 2 months tops in time but then they'll release a Christmas update that saves it until February then Friday the 13th is right around the corner.",Dead by Daylight

I would change the graphics settings but there are none. All you can do is change the resolution from 100%. Also the game is impossible to play. When you are the killer the other people can put down REALLY small obstacles that are almost impossible to surmount.

2017-11-22,0,0,225,False,Recommended,Honestly you need to try this game. It's a great example of Devs who care for and spend HOURS testing each and every patch to make 100% sure there is no bugs. Whenever a new character is added it is obvious that they make sure the perks are balanced and every new killer is just as fair as the new survivor. I've spent hundreds of hours on this game on my smurf account because this game is just that great. They make sure to include every demographic by making the game the exact same regardless of what rank you play. Some people get upset that there isn't any incentive to climb rank but it just makes the game more fair. If you can reach rank 1 in a month then you clearly don't need any bonus? Give the lower rank players bonus' so that we can climb! That's my only gripe with this game. Other than that this game is the pinnacle of MOBA's and will be redefining the genre for decades to come!

2016-12-04,0,0,359,False,Not Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a great idea on paper but in execution it's just not that fun.As someone who loves Horror films I thought the game would be fun and addicting hiding from killers and trying to escape and living out the excitement of Slasher films but instead you're stuck with a janky game that boils down to mashing keys on your keyboard while you wait around for a rescue.Firstly the game's production quality isn't all that great animations look ok enough but the characters movement within the world is choppy and looks bad. There's also no graphical options other than setting details to ""Low/Medium/High/Ultra "" no fine tuning or even setting the resolution. Yes in a game released in 2016 on PC you don't have the option to set the resolution. The game also doesn't perform well with an overclocked GTX 1060 my frame rate dipped well below 50fps every now and then. I can run Battlefield 1 at a constant 60fps with maxed out settings but this somehow struggles. Also load times are terrible probably because the engine is procedurally generating the map everytime. The game doesn't look that great either on Ultra details with muddy textures and poor lighting.Gameplay is where the game really falls flat it rewards high level players giving them the upper hand with unlockable perks while a new player doesn't get anything to pick from there's no starter perks you only get to change how your survivor looks. There's also no tutorials what so ever so when you first jump into it you're left wondering what to do or what the basic mechanics are leaving you to do a lot of guess work. Ranking up requires you to spend points to get perks but as a new player you're not going to arcue many to level up and unlock things thankfully though once you start getting into the swing of things they doll the points out quite generously.Maps are extremely repetitive while they are ""randomized"" they're laid out in such a hap hazard fashion they always feel the same. You get a set of prefabs with different themes (house mansion junkyard) that the world is built out of but it's all the same with different coats of paint. Also nothing is really laid out in a believeable fashion so you don't feel like you're in the ruins of a run down mansion but rather just a field with random brick walls all over the place. Oh and there's hooks all over the place and barrels on fire because reasons. The color of the map lighting also changes but coating the map in orange rather than green doesn't make the maps feel anymore unique. There's (seemingly) only one objective to do as a survivor start up generators and it's already grown tiresome.The killer and surivor relationship is also heavily in favor of the killer but not only that there's nothing to do as a survivor. Your tasks are incredibly basic start up the generators save others hide and escape. You can also knock down cabinets and stuff to slow the killer down but that's it no setting your own traps to slow down the killer or barricading yourself in buildings so this leads to a lot of ring around the rosie with the killer making things more hilarious than tense. Survivor's are slower than the killer and after being hit once you begin to limp causing you to go even slower and easier to get hit again. After being taken down the killer picks you up and you get to mash A/D to... slow him down? Apparently it does something but it really doesn't make a lick of a difference. Once you get placed on a hook you get several chances to escape from the hook (escaping is apparently RNG based?) before you go into a dying state where you mash the hell out of the spacebar to delay you inevitable death and hopefully be saved by another player. Herein lies the rub the killer can literally just sit and watch you die with impunity from other players because there's nothing the survivors can do to disable the killer at all and save you you're basically as good as dead once you're on the hook and the killer just sits there. Once you die that's it quit and find another game or you can spectate the rest of the round but you can't come back it's over. I've had rounds so short that the loading time just to get into the game was longer this is bad game design. Escaping the killer is neigh impossible once they find you it's too easy to continually stalk a survivor and finish them off since the killer always has the upper hand.I'm going to continue playing to see if things change up and I actually start enjoying the game but I doubt it. I hope someone takes this idea but makes a good game out of it because Dead by Daylight is mediocre at best.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-01,0,0,342,False,Recommended,Horror in games (and films) is too often characterised by jump scares shocking startling events designed to trigger a fight or flight response. Dead by Daylight to its credit eschews these in favour of real horror a gradual increase in tension resulting from the unshakeable sense of impending doom. That it manages to do this in an asymmetrical competitive action game is what is truly impressive about it.Dead by Daylight features two teams four survivors and one killer and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors knock them down put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods. The odds are skewed heavily in favour of the invincible killer and as a result playing Dead by Daylight as a survivor can be a nerve rattling sweat inducing terrifying experience.After queuing into a game with three other survivors Dead by Daylight puts you in one of several eerie horror environments a dilapidated farm a run down manor a rickety junkyard and tells you very simply to fix the generators to escape. When you find the generators you then need to repair them a painstakingly slow process where you hold the left mouse button down while crouching in front of it. If you're alone repairing the generator can take more than a minute. As you crouch next to the very noisy generator the game will throw skill tests at you by way of a rotating bar if you fail the QTE the generator will backfire. This creates a noisy explosion and the killer is visually alerted to the location of the backfire turning you into a target.If the killer does find you (and he probably will) your options are limited. If you have a flashlight you can blind him temporarily but your best bet is to run away. The killer moves faster than you can run maintaining the traditional horror movie 'ominous walk' but you can slow him down by leaping through windows or pushing down pallets to block his path. You want to put as many of these obstacles in between the two of you as possible as you flee for your life.Fortunately for the survivors a sixth sense mechanic alerts them to the presence of a nearby killer the closer the killer is the faster your survivor's heart beats. Unfortunately the sound is obscured by generator revving as you repair it. When 90% repaired the generator nearly drowns out the heartbeat entirely forcing you to rely solely on your eyes to see the killer.When you play as the killer you're able to see all the map's generators at all times allowing you to patrol them. If any of them are making noise you know at least one survivor has been working on it and you can hunt for signs that the others are nearby. Panicked survivors will sprint away leaving scratches on nearby walls and breaks in the grass and you can follow these markings to find your prey. Once you find your prey you chop them down pick them up and put them on a hook sacrificing them to your god after 60 seconds.The scoring system initially encourages players to create exciting gameplay opportunities by rewarding risky play. Survivors who engage in lengthy drawn out chases escaping the killer will earn more points for their boldness and you can rack up the points by rescuing other survivors who have been captured but not yet sacrificed. As a killer you're rewarded for killing more of the survivors although a single sacrifice is counted as a victory. Inevitably though this scoring system leads to immersion breaking actions like exploiting the killer's slow movement past obstacles as survivors earn huge points by taunting their hunter.Another problem for Dead by Daylight is its matchmaking system. The game is entirely peer to peer hosted with the killer hosting the survivors at all times. Unfortunately there's no way to tell where in the world the killer is or whether they're capable of hosting five people in a game until you're playing. There's no ping indicator and no regional matchmaking so you have to roll the dice each time you join a new server and if you crap out you'll warp around the game world barely able to work out what's going on. Further there's no group based matchmaking so you can't queue with friends. This results in players lobby hopping until they are grouped with friends which is a terrible experience for all involved.Dead by Daylight executes the concept of a competitive horror game well but only to a point. As players become more familiar with both roles the horror dissipates and they begin to play for the competitive element alone. The poor matchmaking and the highly exploitable scoring system make Dead by Daylight less competitive than it should be resulting in gameplay which doesn't resemble the horror experience it sets out to be.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Does this game have problems? yes it does. Does that mean it is not a good game? Absolutely not. This game is a blast to play with friends and is still very exciting to play online with strangers. The game seems to be different every time because the killer runs off of instinct and every player is different causing the in game scenarios to change. While the game is very unrealistic the people playing should understand that this is supposed to be like trying to survive in a horror movie. The game is full of adrenaline rushes and exciting moments. While there are many fun things about this game there are also some negatives as well.Cons Finding a match at weird times of the day can be very difficult. The game runs off of the killer's internet meaning that the survivors have to deal with the killer's crappy connection. Still a little buggy with time that should change though.Definately buy this game if you have friends that are willing to play with you. The experience is significantly better if the survivors are talking to each other. Please don't base your opinion on this game based off of some of the morons who like to sabatoge their team while surviving. The game should get better over time and hopefully they will switch over to dedicated servers. The time I have spent playing this game has come from one free to play weekend alone. I do not think I will pay full price for it but I will definately pick it up when drops below $10.,Dead by Daylight

As a killer every mistake you make costs you dearly while survivors have nothing to worry about as long as their buddy will be there to spring them out of a bear trap get them off a hook patch them up blind the killer with a flashlight (sometimes as he's in a middle of an animation and can't look away) kite him around while the rest are repairing generators and in general turn a horror themed game into a Tom and Jerry cartoon.What a wasted opportunity...,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-23,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,Really interesting concept that sounded more fun on paper to me than it ended up being in practice. Give it a go if you like to try out unique experiences and know what you are getting in to you may end up liking it a lot and as far as I know there is nothing else quite like this out there right now. The co op game play can be very satisfying at times. Grabbing people mid action and hanging them on meat hooks is also incredibly satisfying if you're in to that sort of thing and let's not kid ourselves who isn't.As far as an objective recommendation though I'm inclined to steer most people who are on the fence away from this game. Without going in to lots of details and listing where I believe the game could use polish etc I'd say at it's worst it is a frustrating exercise in futility and at best it is a game that manages to have some satisfying mechanics but will ultimately not likely be much fun for most people to play on a moment to moment basis.A horror game where abusing 3rd person camera angle is the core of the gameplay (as survivor)Features exciting gameplay mechanics such as holding m1 for long periods of time while listening for audio cues resisting the urge to hold m1 holding lctrl for long periods of time while listening for audio cues getting interrupted by evil within bomb disarming style mini game at random moments while holding buttons some kind of physical training involving jumping over window sills repeatedly as the killer feel an overwhelming sense of isolation as the survivors ignore you completely while doing these exercises hammering the spacebar for long periods of time to literally not die user friendly controls nothing in this game requires precision only the ability to outsmart idiots and use cheap tactics rare items that change things by 2 and 3% a convoluted ranking system that encourages people to not want to play with each other user friendly configuration options (they are simply left out) character models which you can dress up wooden pallet stompingOK I digress the game really isn't bad and it does have a hell of a lot going for it but it's obviously and unfortunately currently not for me and I urge you to research it before you buy it.I will be going back to check this game out again in a month or so and see what it has to offer at that time because I really wish I enjoyed playing it more than I do and maybe some changes will remedy that for me.,Dead by Daylight

If infinite jukes didn't win you the game then... insane perks for survivors. The killer perks suck while survivors have ones that are game changing.Oh the killer is faster than you? Why not run faster than them for a bit. Oh killer hit you? Just heal up.Oh killer might hook you? Break every hook.Killer is invisible or sneaky? Have a perk that literally detects the killer's presence. 3. If you couldn't win by this time... just disconnect! That's right! As the survivor you have the ultimate ability to escape the killer by disconnecting. There are no downsides infact you are rewarded for this type of behavior.Can you imagine any online game that allowed disconnect to not negatively affect you? Imagine League of Legends Starcraft or CS GO where the disconnector would lose no rank or suffer any consequence. This is what is available.Other than that being from an indie developer the game won't patch anytime soon.The game had potential and has a ton of streamers playing it. However you can quickly tell that streamers can literally troll the killer or the player killer is clearly frustrated by bull mechanics during streams.tl dr You'll have fun for 5 10 hours. If you play killer any decent survivor will never die to you after a bit of practice.To developers Killers need a huge buff.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-29,0,0,1181,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun as hell to play with as a survivor or killer but here is why i wouldnt reccomend playing it even though i will still continue to play it myself 1. The survivors are very toxic they will take the game hostage and try to taunt the killer right at the exit gates so they can hurridly leave (even if you play as freddy which i do and blood warden really isnt useful in that sense actually)2. it takes an outrageous ammount of time (as a killer) to find a ing game to play (for me its about 30 minutes per match but ive seen others where its an hour wait) and then people will DC as soon as they realize its freddy fun right?3. As a survivor many killers just want to camp you if your on the hook because usually people will try to unhook you so actually trying to unhook people just goes away once you know the killer wants to camp everyone they catch. 4. Survivors will constantly go through windows or stay around pallets to intentionally waste your time and then laugh about it once the round is over 5. Almost evertyime i try to play as a killer my game freezes and i disconnect from the round even though ive never had that problem as a survivor.6. The devs dont seem to care about the game. at all. Many people have had their memory whiped from the game there are still many bugs that need to be fixed and yet they want to add more killers and survivors and maps to a game that already has a good ammount of bugs in it. To me it just seems like they want to gain some money with new killers as fast as they can rather than actually trying to balance the game to help survivors and killers and to fix constantly occuring bugs that basically force people to rage quit.This game is extremly fun to play if you just want to casually get spooked for a few hours but if your actually trying to rank up....the killers are toxic and the survivors are even more toxic to deal with. This game has a lot of potential but i just cant reccomend it as it is now until there are some major changes to it / and to be honest i dont even know why im writing this the devs wont even look at it anyways because their probably too busy making the next killer/survivor designs.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-18,0,0,338,False,Recommended,(TL DR AT THE BOTTOM)I've played this game for a decent bit and instead of a full on review I just want to throw in some thoughts on this game. The game in itself is all good fun and I enjoy it myself and do reccomend it because a bigger community would solve some of this games problems. Finding matches can be a bit of a pain with groups of 2 or 3 but I haven't had much problem with it especially solo que which I usually find a match in 1 3 goes max The hitboxes do suck for some things (especially window vaulting and the nurse right now please devs.) but if you're just here to have fun the hitboxes I mean are still not the best but are okay to the point I don't complain about them as much as some people I know. The community. Well. I have no clue how to feel about this one. Sometimes some people are jerks and can ruin a game sometimes you find people that just make it all the better. The community itself isn't a super bad thing I actually find some decent people but the devs really do need to fix camping or nerf it in some way as most of the time it benefits literally nobody ( so why do you killers do it ) and it's really just kind of annoying. The devs. For all the they get they actually do listen to fans on things like twitter and aren't that terrible I actually like the devs for once and I think they are paying attention we just need to tell them what's wrong not just riot against them.All in all if you're just reading guides to think about getting the game. I like it and it's really fun. I'd have some friends to make it better as I think it's amazing with friends but it's at least worth the try and you can refund if you see no potential.,Dead by Daylight
2018-08-28,0,0,596,False,Not Recommended,This is the ultimate horror game with some famous killers like Freddy Michael Myers etc. As killer you get to chase and kill survivors as survivors you need to do generators then open exit gates or jump through a hatch escape.The issue with the game is current ranking system feels like a custom game from Warcraft3 if the killer has crazy addons and mori or survivors have decisive strike+flashlights then it favors whoever is best at utilizing those. While in most normal high rank games most killers just dodge those lobby's so they can get easier prey's. Some will evetually try facing a group of friends with flashlight but it's usually rough ride. So with easier prey's they can just run them over like how some warcraft3 custom game works they modify whatever map it is to their favor and rockn roll.I'm writing this review after putting about 500hrs into the game and this is my view of the game in current state.The good Great multiplayer horror game. Great graphics and sounds.The bad The killer hosts the game this means he has 0 ping sometimes it lags other it just spikes or rubberband. Terrible idea but it saves them costs for not hosting game servers. There's no compensation or announcement when they have database issues. (This means your progression will not be saved if your in the game or most of the time ur unable to play for many hours.) Very unbalanced I wish there was a competitve mode where survivors have to run around finding items and killers have to find addons. 60hz only we live in 2018 not year 2000. Allthough this game came out in 2016 there is still no update for higher hz monitors which is sad. Gameplay can be repetitive for survivors just do gens run and open exit gates. Bugs there are plenty of them and most of them has to do with perks either being activated or exhaustion perks that just bugs out. Both killer and survivor perks needs balance there are only a few perks everybody uses and the rest are just there for the sake of it nobody would even miss them if they oneday just removed the unused perks.If I knew this was the state of the game since start then I wouldn't have put so many hours into it I would still buy it but just play it once awhile I have to admit that I have all the dlcs and were even planning to buying ingame cosmetics but seeing how the game studio is not upto the task of even trying to balance the game the slighest for the past 6months made me change my mind.,Dead by Daylight

2019-01-03,0,0,199,False,Not Recommended,"i decided to write a review because overall its a game the ""mori"" Execute animations are essentially each killers own way to kill someone by their own hand instead of sacrifing them on a hook its a cool idea but ALL are clunky looking and need to be completely re done. the perk system is horrible i like the ideas of some of the perks and then some of the perks you wonder why they are even in the game.... nothing is at all balanced there needs to be some huge changes in the department some of the killers arent even playable at a higher rank just because the overall structure of the survivors vs that killer is un balanced and vice versa some killers such as the Hag the Doctor and the Nurse are really strong against any setup the hag can teleport to any rune she engraves on the ground the doctor drives everyone insane and they cant do anything but cower and lose and then the nurse teleport hits you through everything a good nurse rarely misses overall the game is in a terrible state to be playing it in. Because right now it feels like they are worried about releasing more killers for a cash grab instead of fixing the endless bugs and glitches in the game for example i just had a player on my shoulder i was trying to hook her and it wouldn't let me hook her it just kept strafing side to side when i tried to put her on the hook i thought maybe the one hook was bugged or something but i had enough time to run to another hook with her on my shoulder and it still would not let me hook her this is where is gets interesting. she Disconnected from the match and when she did the game ended but when it went to the final score screen it showed her as an escaped player and she survived apparently i dont know if she was hacking i dont know if it was a bug but that actually just happened to me i have experienced some bugs on this game before but nothing like that. i've put nearly a 100$ into this game and all i have gotten are broken un balanced killers and perks with Glitches bugs and animations there is no dedicated servers everything is locally hosted so prepare for de sync and overall the game needs a lot of polishing before anyone else should sink their money into this game i give you fair warning do not buy any dlcs or any parts of this game in its current state you may not feel regret immediatly after purchase but the wave of regret will slowly wash over you game after game.... until you hit rank 1 on survivor or killer you wont understand but you will... also the game gets boring after the first couple hundred hours.",Dead by Daylight

I try all my might to run away but he stays on my trail. I then get downed and try my hardest to wiggle free but it's no use he hooks me. As I struggle not to die one of my teammates free me.

I hope they let players choose the server like i heard people said it was in the good old daysif you are looking to buy this game i warn you here please dont. most of my time in this game is only pure upset and angry. it is not noob friendly! many vets player cheat on the matching system to lower their rank and allow them to play with noob but with their highest level skills and equipment they see you as pure blood point earning tool only you are there only for their daily mission. this game is DEAD to me. if you bought the whole DLC and you were just a noob like me then i wish you would have the fun you were expecting at the beginning and hope you are not hot tempered cause im a usually clam person and this must be the first time i got so p i s s e d on the net after being played like a fool by higher lvl player and being taunt and challenge everyday i finaly lost my s h i t i admit that. 10 / 9 time i encounter a Thailand player as a surrvivor they will try their best to not just beat you in game(witch i am total okay with) but going further to show off and make you have suck gaming exprience that is their gaming culture you can only avoid them in game or stop playing like me am i a total i n g racist? yes i am after this game they have change my impression of them. but you know what im telling is true indeed if you are currently playing HERE IS MY ADVICE PLAY WITH FRIEND ONLY. PRIVATE MATCH IS THE BEST WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO PLAY ALONE GG.to Thailand players i been in thai for years i know how you people are. you must feel very heroic and brave while taunting noob killer and while laughing at them during your steam. there is nothing here to stop you. but i hope game player from the globe will despite all of you one day and i will do as much as i can to insult you people in other game.,Dead by Daylight

I still love it and that's why I have to say that despite getting 350 hours of enjoyment for the low price I do not recommend it. Time and time again the developers have shown their incompetency. Their idea of balancing is bandage fix upon bandage fix. They do not listen to the community and frequently during developer streams they just blow off whatever their players say in regards to the game.They hold off on bigger bug fixes until a major patch hits. ""We have fixed it internally we're just waiting till x patch"" They're very slow with fixing their numerous bugs. There are quite a few major ones that have stuck around patch after patch. Very often they manage to bring bugs that they ""fixed' back in the next patch.I had hoped the DLC they just released would be amazing and show that they listen to their community. They hyped up the new killer as ""game breaking"" and ""players will scream OP"" What we got was a mediocre survivor and a killer who is only slightly better than the weakest killer.

Once you begin to understand then it becomes boring because every match is the exact same. None of the maps are good only less bad compared to the others.

But then Lord Gaben's voice spoke to me. He said ""Git Gud."" I had a realization maybe this game isn't like other games. Maybe it has different mechanics and must be conquered at a different angle. Maybe the killers seem overpowered because this game isn't Call of Duty and you can't just steamroll your way through. Many will say that this game is buggy or needs more time but honestly it really is not that bad. Sure it definately needs fixing up but that really is no reason to not recommend this game. The game has too much behind it to die. Updates are coming people just need to wait. The game is playable and as many have said even those who would not recommend (riddle me that one batman) it's fun and exciting. The greatest instance was when I was running from the Hillbilly and it was just me. I had 3 more generators or a trapped door. I was in a mad chase. Dodging left and right vaulting over obstacles I still could not lose him. He hit me with that chainsaw and I was immediately downed. Fear and disappointment gripped me as failure was surely lerking by. But then I saw the glimmer of hope before. He knocked me down on the trap door that I was desperately trying to find.

2018-01-27,0,0,705,False,Not Recommended,First off this game at times can be very fun and intense however over time you will come to learn about its many faults and glaring issues as well as the incredibly toxic community.What you're getting with Dead by Daylight is a game that is flawed to its very core design. This leads to a lot of balancing issues and frustrations that may never go away unless the game was redesigned from the ground up. The developers can do their best to alleviate some of these problems but they have always been apart of the game.The only way to play is online in a rank based system where ranks don't matter at all and every month the ranks are reset. You'll see a lot of players even intentionally deranking in order to stomp on new players or because the balance issues are so prevalent in high ranks that it becomes a stressful chore to play.The game director himself has stated that the game was meant to be played without communication among survivors and with a sense of uncertainty but there exists a function in which you can group up with your friends in game and use Discord or some other software to communicate with each other. As you can imagine this creates some big problems for killers and throws the entire design concept out the window giving survivors a very big advantage. There is nothing wrong with wanting to play with friends however the developers have yet to balance the game around this feature and likely never will.I have at least a few more hundred hours in this game on PS4 and I have reached a point in which I cannot recommend this game to somebody in good faith. What is at times a very cool unique and fun experience is more often eclipsed by a multitude of irritating flaws and one of the most toxic and cancerous communities for a game I've seen.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-03,0,0,227,False,Not Recommended,I like the concept of this game and it can be fun. However as it stands right now the game is unbalanced as hell. There is near as makes no difference no possibility of winning as a survivor.The killers are so beyond overpowered it's not even fun. Especially the dlc killers. The Doctor's ability affects such a large portion of the map at once its ridiculous and it allows him to see where the survivors are at regular intervals. The Nightmare is invisible the entire time so you have no idea where he is and when he's sneaking up on you until it's too late. In addition once you've been pulled into the dream worls he just sees you no matter where you are.However even the base game killers have become op as hell. There are so many killer perks that just show them where the survivors are completely defeating the point of being stealthy. When the killers can cross the map in seconds giving them a wallhack as a perk just means survivors lose every time.Either the killers need to be nerfed or the survivors need to be buffed. The repair times on generators could be lowered also because as it stands right now the killers can circle the entire map 5 times before you fix one. So when you have to stop repairing to hide when the killer comes past for the millionth time the killer sabotages the generator resets your progress and you're left with nothing.I've played over 180 hours as survivor both with friends and randoms and 9 out of 10 games end the same way 4 dead survivors and the killer wins. This game needs some serious balance changes to make it remotely fun to play as a survivor.The devs of this game only care about killer feedback and making the killers more and more overpowered and because the killer mains in the community whine so constantly when even one survivor makes it out we have come to a point where each update nerfs survivors and buffs killers to the point that the game is probably the most one sided game I've ever played.Also this game is plagued by hackers and players using various forms of exploits such as wallhacks to see where survivors are etc. Really makes a game not fun when the killer can see exactly where you are in a game based around stealth.And the devs wonder why there are so few people queing to play survivor (lol) and the wait times for playing killer have grown so long. It's because no one wants to play survivor anymore. It's certainly not fun. If I could get a refund I would.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,13,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight feels like a more horror centered Left 4 Dead. Obvously this means that there is a considerable amount of teamwork invovled but unless you group up with some friends it is going to become very difficult to actually co operate with anyone since there is no in game voice chat. Even if there was no voice chat it would be nice to have some sort of in game callout system where you could call out to your teammates in hopes of linking up with them but risk the monster be able to track you down because of it. The level up system is very ingenous yet simple. Every time you play a mission you collect a certain amount of ""bloodpoints"" (basically XP) depending on how well you perform and what you do. As a survivor healing a wounded teammate or helping them out of a bear trap will award you some extra points whereas as a monster you get point for killing survivors and trapping them. These points are pooled together and you can spend it however you want. There are three monsters and four survivors and they all do something a little different. Leveling up is going to feel similar to a skill tree only instead of a tree it's a web and instead of ONLY get perks and abilities you also get consumable stuff (a flashlight for example) that you may or may not lose when you use it in an online game (games with friends however will not consume these).You can also customize each survivor and killer (I always choose whatever is hardest to see in the dark or tall grass) which adds another layer of personalization. Overall I would definitley recommend picking this up for $30 so far the servers seem a little empty to finding an online game is a little difficult but if you can get 4 or 5 friends into it then this game is going to make a lot of your gaming nights fun.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-22,0,0,153,False,Not Recommended,"If you don't already own this game I would recommend you to wait. The major change needed for this game is a proper matchmaking system. Right now it has two problems Queueing can take many minutes especially when you want to play with friends. Even then you will experience that the lobby dissolves because the killer disconnects. For me persoanlly more frustrating the way your opponents are chosen is either not working or not very well thought trough. Especially as a new player you will continiously face high level opponents. Dead by Daylight is a grinding game where you will pick up powerful tools to increase the likelyhood of succeding in your objective. Having to face this as a lvl 1 character is plain annoying. I place my hope into the match making change that the devs promised. I recommend you to wait for that and have a look at the perceptions.What else you need to know + game concept ist really fun+ matched are quick (usually around 10min)+ you play against real players who can be very good or not so much+ the survival and hunting aspect really comes to fruition depending whether you play survivor or killer p2p network connection the killer is always the host. This leads to ping/conncetion problems and so called lobby dodging (the killer leaves the match prior to start to look for easier opponents. However the killer might be a new player and this attitude is justified but the survivors will never know and complain about this annoying mechanic) progression is slow in this game. As a late entry you will face fully outfitted opponents and you will suffer because of this. if you want to play with your friends expect long waiting times until you find a killer who is up for the challange the developement team is inexperienced. It feels like every update breaks something else. The last ""DLC"" just introduced dead lobbies which prolong the search for a lobby extensively.At its best this game can be a 8/10. Even though it has limited mechanics it can be really enjoyable.Sometimes it just feels like a broken gameCurrently a 6/10",Dead by Daylight
2016-12-17,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Dead by Daylight is a pretty neat asymmetrical horror game.

2017-07-05,0,0,1199,False,Recommended,Before patch these guys had a great review coming glad i waited till after the patch to review it. Right now it is extremely unbalanced in favor ov survivors post patch its in favor of survivors and the killers pretty much might as well just stand there let the survivors run for the generators and then the exit. Extremely unbalanced.Graphics are good the matchmaking system is seriously screwed up as is i would not recommend i would wait until after they finish the patches for a more balanced game. Do not get me wrong for the horror genre this is a good idea but they need to stop listening to whiney surviors who get sacrificed to the entity and go with the orignal design and intention of the game rather than penalizing killers points for doing what they are supposed to be doing in game. This review is subject to edit and changes as they release more patches and balance the game.I stand by my original review as the game is unbalanced BUT the Devs are trying to balance it. There are pros and cons to any game that said the amount of TOXICITY on forums as well as in chat at end of matches is out of control and both Devs and Mods need to be more thorough on their follow through. That said the game is still worth buying for the horror genre its one of the best out there F13 is dead as can be and just a lot of immaturity that is also in DBD but at least they are trying to balance it out. Therefore am chaning my review to recommended BUT there are still thngs that need worked on as in all games.Dated 4/21/2018 With the implementation of the EMBLEM system devs have managed to destroy their own game. Until the des learn balance and how to balance both sides killers and survivor appriately my game review is being changed to DO NOT BUY and PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. This game will go the way of F13.8/14 Devs still havent learned balance they continually overpower one side over the other with each patch. Really want to give them an encyclopedia that shows what BALANCE is. Yes i still play it and stll rip them new holes with each unbalanced release that said changing to recommended as the devs are trying but if you want an answer to bug reports DONT post on steam as it takes forever. Go directly to their website as you will get a much faster and professional response.11/22/2018 Devs and balance they talk about balance on their forums but have failed to implement or learn it themselves. They consistantly have one side either surivvor or killer seriously overpower the others and call it balance. With the implementation months ago of the emblem system this was a HUGE disaster waiting to happen all you get is camping tunneling killers once u hit level 11 or better so they are just not fun anymore past that so most people just dc from match or die screwing over teammates in order to derank and I honestly cannot blame them. The same goes for suvivor side where you have survivors who use exploits in match to get an advantage. This game like most others will eventually see the way of F13 and die unless they learn from their mistakes and that does not seem likely in the near future because the devs just listen to the streamers and NOt the casual players who just want to play regularly and not stream. Additionally the penalty for killers who camp is so minor they just ignore it totally yet the penalty against suvivors is extreme with depips then you have the penalty of DCing which anymore is not really a penalty because the games past certain levels are no longer fun or a challenge unless you get a decent killer who like to play the match and is not a hardcore jerk.,Dead by Daylight

2018-05-18,0,0,434,False,Recommended,"Overall I like DBD more than I dislike it.The game is still working on balance but it is fun overall.Pros Fun multiplayer options with your friends. You can play with friends as all survivors in survive with friends or play the sandbox mode in kill your friends. In kill your friends everything is unlocked for you but you don't earn any blood points or shards in this mode. There is a lot of variety in the survivors and the killers. You can pick and choose your playstyle which is nice. There are 3 ""teachable"" perks for every survivor and once you get to a high enough level with that survivor if you obtain the teachable perk it will start appearing in other survivors webs. This means you can match your playstyle with other characters with enough time. You can also pick your aesthetic as well to a limited degree. As described above each survivor has their own set of unique perks that can become teachable later on so you can get your favorite perks on your favorite survivor. The outfits are also kind of nice. You can purchase some but also get them through prestiging (when you hit level 50 you can keep unlocking new bloodwebs for new items/offerings/perks OR you can prestige and reset a survivor to level 1 and open up new outfits and also increase the chances of getting better items/offerings/perks on that prestiged survivor's bloodweb) There is a thing called the shrine and with enough shards (a currency you earn by playing the game) you can buy perks before unlocking them on each survivor's web. This is just a time shortcut so that you don't have to play the game for ages before getting your ideal combination of perks and looks.Cons Balance issues.

But i have to give this game a no. Cause when half the game is playable it defeats the playablity factor cause lets face it its much easier being the killer cause connecting to people is glitchy and downright disgusting. Your either perpetually stuck loading or it fails to connect and its just downright frustrating to experience this I just can't play the survivors for the life of me.Edit Strangely enough the thing thats plagueing this game seemed to have vanished today I have no problems connecting as a survivor. With this out of the way i could say this game is a yes however.... I bet tonight it would be the samething and im not ready to change this to a yes.Final edit Well its come to an end of the free to play weekend and I have to say this game is awesome! For some reason when I first tried this game i had problems connecting as the survivor. I would get stuck on loading screens or fail to connect to the game. And then the next day those things that plague this game had just vanished... I when that happened i was excited to say ""Yes!"" This is an awesome game however... the game can get repetitive the only two things you as the survivor can do is run hide knock pallets down shine a flash light into the killers eyes and finally escape by activating the required generators. But its even less for the killer its chase chase chase whack chase whack and hook them on a device that sacrifices the survivor. Sure each killer has a cool ability that seperates them from the other killers. Its just that the rest of the game is placed on a tread of the same things repeatdly no other gamemodes no additional powers that they could unlock. Survivors stuck with not much to slow the killer down with its just boils down to a crazy frenzy of cat and mouse and there is only so much this formula can do before you realise its boring.Correction Edit I'm still keeping this game a no but i finally gave in and bought the game its just it took time to understand and when i did it was beautiful. I have ton of fun playing as killer and the chase is actually vigorating to the point that you just get that glow of ""I got em!"" also viewing this game through a lens of ""try to have fun ignore what toxic people say and kill some peeps!"". I will give this game a recommendation if they switch to dedicated instead of p2p cause that is one thing that would make this game perfect for me.ps.

2017-03-17,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Game has an ok premise but it's pretty impossible to escape. Once you get injured you have to somehow make it off the hook. If you do then you continuously leave a blood trail that doesn't go away and you coninuously make noise.

2017-12-31,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"Dead By Daylight Brings the Horror Genre of Gaming to the Multiplayer Platform. Putting you in a 4 against 1 playstyle as you look around the Maps for Generators to start up and escape from the killers Grasp. I will say some of the enviorments look pretty scary for some people and look interesting for the most part.Each Survivor is exactly the same though so don't worry about picking a survivor over another.all the playstyles are blank pages for you to choose what they are good at.PROS 1.Spooky Atmosphere that will definately keep you on your toes even when the killers notifications are present (Heart Beat) You're constantly looking behind your back when you hear a heart beat cause you know.. the killer is out there and you may be the next unfortunate one to run into the killer before its too late.2.All Killers have different Abilities Whether you're the Shape The Nightmare The Trapper. Each killer has there own unique abilities so it gives them there own benefits and disadvantages. and that keeps players wondering whos the next killer they have to face against.3.The Bloodline system is free to use and you don't have to spend money on getting blood points just play a game and you'll rack them up really easy and its good for reaching Prestige and unlocking perks to give your survivor.The CONS.... Oh boy theres quite a few I wanna nail on.1.NO VOICE CHAT at all... For a game in 2016 there should be voice chat for a game regardless if its a horror game and the devs wanna ""Make the game more scary"" if you're gonna do that then people are just gonna go to Skype Discord etc. since they will fight your system.2.Camping Killers I dunno how many times I've had this happen where my team actually wants to help me or even I wanna help another player and Killers stay in the same spot until the survivor is officially dead. like Why? Why do that you completely kill the game that way.Along with the BodyBlocking is also a pain to deal with I can never move thanks to survivors do ing that.3.Some Survivor Perks are too OP for killers I can get by Decisive Strikes Borrowed Time and many other perks that you can gain but every player I heard uses them and some survivors make fun of the killer for even trying. I think its upsetting how players are using the emotes to make fun of the killer in a way but hey its my opinion.But I will say cause I'm not complaining too much this game is still alot more fun then getting called for work on your day off.My overall review I still think maybe this game should be 15$ instead of 20$ but that's just my opinion. Graphics gets a 7Sound gets a 8and Gameplay gets a 6 7.6/10 Still recommend it.. though with Friends only",Dead by Daylight
2017-09-17,0,0,34,False,Not Recommended,"TLDR at top to save time TLDR Fun but hard to recommend due to progresion system and no match making to find players your rank and get paired up with perked up killers instead a lot of fun with a group of buds though.Progression system is single handedly the worst thing I've experienced in my life 'specially since theres zero semblance of match making for ranks. I'm no stranger to grinding for progress but the way they handled it in this game is something else instead of letting you choose perks and having all slots available to ""build"" a character you have this web of actual trash. They limit you to the amount of perks you can use by level. Once you reach level 25 you can use 4 slots which is fantastic but getting there is slow and painful considering you need to essentially buy trash upgrade items for picks ups. Theres also this ""Cross Class"" type deal where you get what might as well be 0 blood gems per game and you can spend your 0 gems on actual usefull things. (Note I have yet to be able to purchase one of these 360/550 gems)If there was some form of match making system all to pair you up with same leveled people these problems could posisbly be solved because you could actually win games instead of getting destroyed by fully perked out tier 3 killers while all you have is tier 1 ""you actually get nothing beneficial"" perk. All that said it's fun but not very well polished but it's hilariously fun with a group of friends.",Dead by Daylight

2018-05-25,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,"This game needs two things to happen which will fix the problems that everyone is having objectively in the game. First you need to calm down with the dlc operators and issue a nerf to several of the over done releases...*cough*cough ""Doctor"". There are several other characters that I feel are in good need of NERFS with very few who need minor buffs *cough *cough ""Wraith"". Second you need to address the constant looping that is allowed for the survivors with very little that the killer can do about it but run away and have done nothing but waste their time. I think there needs to be a change that can allow for the killer to pursue looping survivors at an increasing rate where the longer the chase goes the faster and faster the killer gets. This will bode well to enforcing the idea that the survivors should have to work together in order to loop successfully and not just outrun the killer with a single survivor who cana abuse unbalanced and poorly placed windows/pallets without any lashback.... and then you wonder why killers become toxic....thus escalating the cycle of madness that is creating all the toxicity and is killing the game.

2018-09-14,0,0,110,False,Not Recommended,This game is overly competitive garbagekillers have all the chance in the world to ruin every game you get in its up to the retraint of the killer to make the game fair which doesnt happen often. there is an obnoxious ranking system that brings out the worst in players making them act toxic as well as tryhard in a semingly casual setting of a asymetricle game style. The perks given to the killer allows them an easier time to track you down removing the survivors only advantage stealth. granted the activation reqirments for the perk are specific but you are not allowed to know what perks the killer has until after the game which is dumb design given how game changing the perks are. This ranges from seeing you when you heal being able to one hit down you being notified whenever he is IN PROXIMITY of the survivor.so if you havent memorised every perk and item that the killer could have you will have no idea how to avoid him. The other issue of the game is how much your team mates can screw you over. you have 3 strikes in this game basically if you are caught and your teammate frees you in front of the killer thats another strike next time your caught its game over (if your teammate frees you). granted it is amazing how often a random team can coordinate with NO TEXT CHAT OR GAME CHAT because of how increadibly important relying on your teammates to help you complete objectives are it doesnt make any sense on how the game has no way of you to communicate with them. its like every character is a mute.Its a shame cus the game would be fun if the game wasnt so ascewed in favor of the killer.

2016-12-05,0,0,1130,False,Recommended,Positive aspects Each game session called a trial is very thrilling and challenging as a survivor. You are hardly ever left knowing what will happen. The game encourages a strong show of cooperative action amongst the survivors if they are to escape. For killers you feel you are in total control of the match most time (if you know what you are doing). It's not just about killing but doing so with style. Playing as both survivor and killer offer countless options and hours of fun.Negative aspects It has repetitive gameplay as there is only one objective each for the killer and survivors. This is however slightly off set by the various perks maps items and unique killer abilities. There is no in game voice or text chat with the exception of pre game lobby chat (for survivors use and view only). There are also seemingly always bugs they'll patch one and two more will be spawned. 'Camping' killers are still a very bad issue in this game and the developers have not done anything meaningful to dissuade this. (Sure they've added Borrowed Time and the ability to unhook a survivor from any angle but neither of those will get you far if the killer is truly camping.)The game build is currently killer sided so just be warned of that if you are looking to play survivor. There has been a slew of very powerful killers released as well with little to no way of countering their abilities/perks.,Dead by Daylight

Does this reset the wiggle meter? I think it does.4. Leaving survivors dying on the ground.

2016-07-16,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,I love this game...when it works...This game has so many flaws and glitches that crush this game's potential. For example the matchmaking is utter garbage. A rank 20 killer can get matched with a rank 10 survivor. It's like the ranks don't even matter. Then you get into the actual game and wait a sec you're rubberbanding everywhere because this game relies on a P2P system rather than having actual servers. You don't always lag but when you do it ing sucks. The thing that really made write this review was when I was playing survivor and trying to rescue someone off of a meat hook I heard the killer place down a bear trap so I was being really careful when I was going to get him off looking at the ground and I could't see any traps. Then right when I'm about to get him off bam badi boop there's a bear trap literally hidden in the ground. I struggle out of that one then IMMEDIATELY slide into another one that was also hidden. I don't know if this happened because of the immense lag or it was just a glitch but it really me off. I've gotten stuck on random objects my game has basically froze right in the beginning of a game (when I used a really good consumable) there have been times where I couldn't play killer because my game froze everytime I hosted a game. The game is just too buggy to really enjoy.I'm gonna keep playing this game but honestly I can't reccomend it in it's current state simply because it still feels like a beta.,Dead by Daylight

Since its starting price was the only price I paid and the DLC was absolutely free.For a game worth 20eu it is absolutely great what the devs managed to do and even after +100hs in I still love to continue playing it.The only reasons I can't give this game a 10/10 is because of the horrible matchmaking which I sincerely hope is something in the process of perfecting since it is either a ready simulator or a ""failed to find a game"" often appearing text.Still the execution and the whole idea is extremely well done and I not only recommend buying it as a sale but for its full price!Overall 8/10!!!

All i want to do is torture and kill everyone and yet all the killers in this game struggle to put a human on the ground. Then as a noob i run into pros frequently as survivors talking in discord and sending one person to troll the killer while they get 3 generators online by the time i catch this one person dropping all the pallets after playing ring around the rosey across the whole map. Then the survivors send one to save that person and by the time i find the next person because camping a hooked soul is frowned upon they have the next two generators online. Then they know the killer is struggling so they then go and hunt the killer down with flashlights and just stand around you trading turns with a flash light to increase their blood points. All the while leaving you the killer helpless hopeless Frustrated and most of all a weakling. I'm suppose to feel like i won if i even hooked them but then my game player name should be called the hooker not a killer. I'm the killer not a teddy bear.,Dead by Daylight

Perma lock with flash lights survivors body blocking the killer (trapper and billy shouldnt get blocked they are massive) buggy interupts which allow the survivors to unhook in a group and just cheese the game as a whole. Matchmaking is as hell level 1 players get matched together with people who've played 300+ hours with purp perks. Any perk worth having is made into a hex which can get destroyed in the game and totally ham string a killer before the game even gets started. Survivors get Borrowed time and camp the hooks which make it impossible to win as a killer with premade survivor teamsMaps have gotten ""better"" with infinite loops with blood lust giving speed to the killer but the devs shot that to hell by increasing the number of palletes in the map.Hit boxes are billy gets stuck on a pixel and interupted in a sprint pallete stuns at arms length away. Server (host issues P2P standards) lag with massive rubber banding causing issues chasing or hitting.I played when it first came out and deleted the game after 30 hours of play.

Then the Wraith came along him being able too cloak added a sort of game mechanic where you had too be hidden and sneak around so he couldn't find you.Then The Nurse came along she was able too teleport and through walls. This made it very easy for the killer too see a generator blow up teleport and slice. since the cooldown is literally on 1 2 seconds this made it insanely easy for the killers too put us on hooks.They never fixed how The Nurse was so unbelievably OP I know nurse mains are gonna compalin about this comment but you nurse mainsEither way back too the review. Sometime later on Micheal Myers appeared he appeared for a halloween type aspect of the game he was fun too play win seeing that his Killer radius was majorly decreased and as he stalked more and more it got bigger (especially at level 3) He could be Op at times as well. There was a feature where if you lost someone and you found them again you would increase in speed for a short period of time. The killer would just circle around stuff and lose sight. then come right back and gain a ton of speed and bring us down in one hit. This wasn't nearly as OP as the nurse but still pretty badOh boy Here comes ""The Crawler"" similar too ""The Trapper"" She places traps in the ground and can be REALLY hard too see the only way too get rid of them is by shining a flash light on them and if you don't have a flash light you have too be ing cautious as all hell I feel like they should have made it too were you can smear the drawing in the ground so it doesn't work. The crawler could teleport (similar too nurse) too a trap if it were activated by a survivor and could only teleport if near. but a perk (and offering) made it a larger distance and together made it a VERY far distance. so it was easy too teleport slice slice hook. REPEATSide notes The game started out awesome the servers WORKED survive with friends is a ing miracle if it works. the only thing i see useful in the game anymore is selecting your own ing map in Kill your friendsreally guys step up your i waited so long too get this game when i heard it was coming out. and then it turned into this? read the reviews and FIX YOUR GAME",Dead by Daylight
2017-09-20,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,"I was looking forward to this game for a long time. Starting out if you want to play a survivor you're screwed. Maybe once you get perks at higher levels its easy for survivors but at least at lower levels survivors have no chance. Most things you do alert the killer to your location. Running from them leaves a trail. If a killer sees you. You're dead. They will walk you down even if you're running. Skill checks on repairing healing anything...if you fail them they get notified of your location. The skill checks lag like hell. You have to hopefully hit the space bar way before the skill check is in its success area and hope you get it right. Im glad didnt buy this game outright and waited for the humble bundle sale i got it from. at least i got a few other games from it that werent trash. I cant speak for higher level characters unless you play the killer there's nothing good about this game for you. ""Work together"" ..yeah..unless you have 3 other friends fat chance of that.

These devs won't abandon this game any time soon you can tell by the updates and the twitch streams.

2016-10-27,0,0,198,False,Recommended,Is this game rough around the edges? YesDoes it take some time to get in to properly? KindaThen why do I recommend it? This is one of the most original games I've ever played. A seriously tense game of cat and mouse between four survivors who can opt to work as a team but ultimately are in it for themselves versus a killer who is out to terrify and kill all four survivors. The genius bit comes into when you are scored (The bloodpoint system). Rather than killing all four survivors as quickly as possible... you're encouraged to make it dramatic. As a killer you can easily just slash a survivor place him on a hook (which is required to kill him) and just watch him die so noone can come to save him but that doesn't score you well. Instead look towards playing with your food and making sure they are tense. It'll work out better trust me.As I say if you want to be a killer try them all and find which one you enjoy most... get into the concept of making yourself a true menace to the survivors without just killing them as fast as possible. If you want to be a survivor work with people but be sure to keep yourself alive for the mostpart. Make sure generators are getting repaired to escape but always make sure you are safe in the meantime and if escape is an option but a friend is on a hook weigh up the option... there isn't always a definitive answer...And whatever you do don't let Michael just stare at you.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-17,0,0,157,False,Recommended,"I main a survivor my opinion may be different than a killer main. I prefer being hunted and being terrified of the killer.I absolutely love this game. It is one of the best multiplay horror games on the market. This is often compared to f13 and DbD is SO much better. The devs aren't complete to people they actually change the game and update it often. The DLCs are cool but not needed they add good survivors as well as good characters. I just recently began to play as a killer and it is kind of enjoyable but I can't play more than 3 games in a row as the killer. The amount of customizations available makes the game's replayability very high. Michael Myers is by FAR the scariest killer to go up against. Furthermore the ranking system is EXTREMELY balanced (unless it is the 13th of a month if so play as a killer and grind the noobs.) There are constant events and every 3 or 4 months a new DLC is released so far 2 have been free 3 have been payed for. For the game each survivor has 3 unique perks once a certain level you unlock teachable perks which allow for other characters to get those perks in their bloodweb. I as of writing this have about 40 hours 37 of which are survivor 3 are killer. I have one level 45 character that is Claudette she has the ability of self heal which is INCREDIBLY useful. I when I started used Jake because I didn't know ANYTHING about perks (BIG MISTAKE JAKE IS USELESS LATER ON) I recently began playing as William ""Bill"" Overbeck this was as a daily but I actually like him as his ability ""Borrowed Time"" which means that if you unhook someone and the killer hits you or the person that was hooked they go into a ""dying state"" which lasts for a certain amount of time (depending on the level of the perk) and once that time runs out you become downed. Claudette Dwight Will and David are the best free survivors. Nurse and Hillbilly are end game killers. DISCLAIMER IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AGAINST A KILLER IN A DLC YOU DO NOT NEED TO OWN THE DLC! THE PURCHASE ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY AS THAT KILLER If you don't want them all the top two are Spark of Madness and The HALLOWEEN Chapter. Michael Myers is a GREAT killer while repairing a generator and him standing there looking at you and you don't realise it until you turn your camera is HORRIFYING. I jumped out of my chair when I saw that. The Doctor is also terrifying to go against hearing his heartbeat and dreading the treatment attack which would reveal your position adds a whole new element. The survivors are mediocre Laurie has a good perk where she can hit the killer to break free of his grasp.For 20$ it is COMPLETELY worth it. For the 10$ current price tag (as of 9/13 9/18) it is a STEAL! It is easily replayable better with friends but 40 hours solo is pretty fun. If you have 20$ while it is on sale get the DLC. This game is a solid 9/10 it would be a 10/10 if I friends to play it with but I don't.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-22,0,0,98,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a refreshing game with cool ideas but the bugs are very annoying. the endless loading screen (no matter if I play as survivor killer or only trying to get in a lobby) not being able to see my character (in most cases I cannot even escape)I am really having a lot of fun this game is great and the bugs wouldn't be so bad but it happens so often. On bad days I restart the every three to four rounds which is sad. I also read that these bugs are very common and not since only a few weeks they do exist for a long amount of time now.Another point which I can't really understand are those many DLCs. Yea if I do not want them I do not have to purchase them but the game isn't even finished yet and still has so many issues.

2018-02-13,0,0,135,False,Not Recommended,"When playing the killer is more stressful than playing a survivor you know there is something fundamentally wrong. If all you want is an adrenaline rush the game might be worth the money. Otherwise stay away even if the game is on sale you should strongly consider if you want to participate in this salty excuse of a horror game. I myself am done with this one I'd say it was fun while it lasted but that would be a lie. Killer If you're looking for a power fantasy playing an unstoppable serial killer terrorizing the 4 survivors. Stay away this game will not provide that experience in it's current state. If you're instead looking to experience the joys of overly altruistic survivors running circles around you as you carry one of their downed friends. If you're looking to experience the joys of chasing survivors in an infinite loop as they take their sweet time teabagging self healing spamming their flashlights emoting etc. after every single pallet and/or window. If you're looking experience the satisfaction of finally catching someone only to then have them decisive strike out of your grip be saved with borrowed time immediately after or just be bodyblocked into oblivion. If you're looking for a game where you yourself have no direct control over whether you win or lose and insted have to rely on others to make a mistake first. Then this is the game for you and I salute you for you can find enjoyment in something I can only find pure unbridled frustration in. Survivor The game is advertised as a horror game and it's certainly provide yo uthat experience at least in the beginning when you're still learning the ropes. And maybe just maybe later as well if you're able to fully immerse yourself in the game. Otherwise the ""horror"" will quickly wear off as you realize that the survivors are the ones that hold all the power over how a match will go. And even if you manage to immerse yourself whatever immersion you managed to achieve will quickly shatter as you watch the other survivors borderline bully the killer into submission.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-30,0,0,224,False,Recommended,I think Dead by Daylight is a beautiful and great game to play. The core gameplay is basic enough to be fun and not annoying after hours and hours of tedious grinding. It's so much fun kinda playying hide and seek all the time and it's something fun to do with your friends. The last part there is a bit hard though. Unless you do a private match the queue system in the game makes it almost impossible to find games with friends. Queueing up with one other person is okay but as soon as you are three or four premade it becomes improbable you will find a game to play. I do not know where the fault in this system lays but it seems essential to me that people have a nice experience playing alone as well as playing with friends.In my honest opinion if you only play with friends it's best not to buy the game or go in two by two.,Dead by Daylight

I picked up this game the day it came out and honestly it's one of my favourite game's to play with my friends. The only problem is 1 friend has it and no one else will buy it. This game is entertaining funny scary and so rewarding when you do clutch things as a survivor. Personally I do not like being the killer but that's because I like to communicate with my friend's and strategize as a team. This game doesn't get the respect it deserves for some reason but what are you gonna do about it. Also I play with controller (Xbox One) because I find the mouse/keyboard combo is clunky and awkward. Maybe that's why it is getting mixed reviews?All in all this is a good game to pick up when it is all sale so all your friends and yourself can play.

But when it came to play on my own game constantly crashed and when it didnt you would load into a game for seconds and it would be over as if no one was even in the lobby. Theres no support or help from the developers. Yes I meet the recommended requirements but having to reinstall for only two full match plays is not worth your time. Spend your money else where. Much of my 3 hours of gameplay came from the lobby screen but still could not get a refund.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-15,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,This is quite a wonderful game it has a nice concept and it does it quite well. HOWEVER the fact that the killer is the host and basically controls your ping is completely dumb. I've only recently tried to play again but the killer is still the host and they all conveniently have bad internet so they just pick us off one by one while we're struggling getting around a box and we all die. Fun game. Until this is changed i don't think i can play this game maybe add a ping meter or limit so only people with playable ping can enter the game as the killer and if their ping exceeds a certain limit for lets say 10 seconds because lag spikes do happen then the game either ends or goes into a pause because it is impossible to win a survivor at this point.,Dead by Daylight

Game has a lot of potential but recurring network/lobby issues and unbalanced matchmaking cause the experience to be flawed.As a suggestion I feel that dead teammates could still play and somehow help the survivors (e.g. turn into a crow and help with temporary sights of the killer) as early kills make the game close to impossible for the survivors as there's no channel for communication.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-26,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,"Not a huge fan of this game. Game is not incredibly fun to play alone. Unless you have a set of 4 friends plus yourself to play with you may find this game is considerably less enjoyable. If you do have a group of 5 including yourself you may still have a problem with the game. The posted recommended specs are inaccurate. Typically the recommend specs are specs that allow you to play the game on non minumum settings and not experience any skipping or framerate loss. The computer I used to play this game met or exceeded the recommended specs and still experienced a low framerate at medium settings. Therefore I had to drop them to minimum settings only to experience the exact same framerate despite the settings change Very difficult to play under such poor conditions. Tutorial is very bare bones and not in depth. The tutorial will tell you how to play each 'hunter' or 'hunted'. It will tell you each skill they each have etc. However the skill web and the itemization functions are not explained well at all. I added several ""items"" and ""add ons"" to my hunter to find them missing immediately after a match and since no tutorial expalined how they work I was forced to search the internet to find out that those two portions of the loadout are consumable. Nowhere does the game state how they work.Overall I found this game to be below grade and cannot currently recommend it to anyone.",Dead by Daylight

Combined with how dark the game is and all but the most stalwart players will be motion sick within an hour.Not to mention that the options menu is a joke. There is no way to turn individual features on or off such as DOF you can't assign a specific resolution there is no AA whatsoever and the game runs terribly!

2017-09-13,0,0,5,False,Recommended,This game gets my heart racing each and every time I play it whether I'm survivor or killer there is a certain joy in chasing and being chased by other players. Sound effects are amazing graphics are good some instances where hair is just detatched from the skull but meh. Overall I'd recommend this game for any who enjoy getting a touch of an adreline rush with a game. You'll see from other reviews that others have lost progress and the community is a bit crap. I'll admit I've had a couple trolls camp hooked survivors and I've had survivors purposely not escape just to farm points. With only 3 hours on record at the time of this writing I've already seen it. Despite this however the game is really enjoyable in my opinion and I definitely recommend trying it out on free weekends and purchasing on sale.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-25,0,0,54,False,Recommended,"Five people enter Four lucky survivor and one godforsaken creature.The survivors either leave with casualties or don't leave at all.The game plays like a 4v1 game of ""hide and seek"" while various hunters themed after horror movies (one of them is from one) are out to find you cut you up and hang you up for their eldritch deity to snack on you.The survivors have to repair a select amount of generators to power up the escape doors and hopefully escape. All the killers have to do is paint the town red. Most of the game's tension comes from eluding the killer through sneaking and cunning since survivors have no weapons to defend themselves with.The game has some latency issues that are really noticable if you play a game with a killer who has a bad connection.The game also features a perk system to allow both survivors and killers to become more efficient in their select specialities. You get points for it by doing your job as a survivor or killer helping survivors in need or saving them from hooks stunning the killer by knocking an obstacle in his ugly mug or pointing a flashlight at him etc.The game has a bit of grinding involved to get the lovely perks the characters have to offer but the challenges that you are offered on a daily basis really help speed things up so it doesn't turn into the equivalent of your everyday MMO.",Dead by Daylight

Seen a few negatives which I'll addressBad lag Maybe I've just been lucky never experienced this even slightly. No chat GOOD! Not like the films this game riffs on has everyone wearing bluetooth mics is it? Helps to make you feel isolated and its a wave of relief when it's a person not the killer who surprised you round a corner. The gameplay is fairly basic but it's a lot of fun and as someone who cant be bothered having some idiot shout ""NOOB"" at me just because I havent spent hours mastering the thing the whole co op but isolated makes me way more likely to keep going back.

2018-05-07,0,0,1125,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a flawed gem of a game. Of all the games that have attempted an asymmetrical multiplayer horror survival game Dead by Daylight has by far been the most successful. Pitting a killer against 4 unarmed survivors the game is essentially a slasher film in game form. After a few hours most players will have become numb to the theme revealing the true nature of the game cat and mouse.Now this isn't a bad thing. Cat and mouse is a tried and true formula that few digital games have attempted. In this metric the game is legitimately good although also deeply flawed. The issue arises from the game from when players understand the game well enough to take advantage of level geometry. Rather than trying to hide from the cat the most efficient strategies involve running around certain objects taking advantage of the faster turning radius of the survivor versus killer in order to vastly extend chase time. Combined with a variety of killers that simply ignore stealth the game simply emphasizes chases far more than hiding to the point that high level play gets very samey.Nonetheless the game is still fairly enjoyable given that its primary competitors are far less engaging.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-23,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I've playeed a few of these games before and one liked is Damned which I am quite good at. In this game you are thrown into the level with no instructions of how to win the game as the surivors aside from avoiding the killer which is obvious. You can repair machines but it takes too long and it's made even harder by adding random ""skillchecks"" in the form of popups where you have to press a button at the right moment. At first it was so sudden I didn't even notice it and when I finally noticed it was still hard to time it right. They also get damaged with each fail so repairing them them becomes near impossible. All this while being hunted by a killer on a very small level where you are spotted more often than not and when spotted the chances of escape are slim at best.The game is simply too hard for the survivors and the scares are only in the form of gruesome gore. I didn't even get scared when I saw the killer which almost looked like one of the survivors from a distance. More work needs to be done on the atmosphere and environment of the game because right now it feels a bit cheap. It was with a big sense of distaste and frustration that I left the game after dying on the hook for the third time. I'm not coming back to this brainless gorefest. Unless you enjoy getting killed like in the saw movies or camping in a corner avoid this game.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-28,0,0,75,False,Recommended,Overall I love this game. Exciting great gameplay. But I do have a few minor complaints.There needs to be some sort of system for punishing people who quit mid game. Also I think it's totally appropriate to be able to derank within a level (I.e having one mark out of three on level 20 and losing that mark after not doing so well) but I think being able to derank between levels is terrible (i.e Deranking from 19 back to 20). 8/10 would get murdered again. Could easily be a 10 with a few slight adjustments.,Dead by Daylight
2018-10-28,0,0,101,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. So I managed to get my hands on this game today because of the current trial going on and to be honest now was a good time to try out Dead By Daylight and see how it feels.For the pros I do think it's nice to play matches with friends and you have a small handful of characters and killers to play through which is pretty good. The tutorials were straightforward although frustrating with the skill checks and helped get the feel of the game. I haven't been playing many matches but I will say that in the time I've played maybe its because I'm new to this but the game seems to favor the killer winning. Or maybe a smart killer is paired with new players I do not know.At this point playing survivor is messy. The killers are overpowered and even if the team cooperates it ends terribly because the killers are too overpowered. I don't think its bad to save your team mates or have the bloody trails or the two hits rule I mean you can still struggle and heal teammates but on the survivor side things take way too long. The skill checks and long wait times to boot up the generators and heal your friends are disadvantages and like I mentioned it's not bad to have the game balanced. However these current balances just don't work. While wait times are reasonable ideas for the generators and health packs and searching it's just too long and skill checks make it agonizing. So far it's been impossible to win a single game because the killers are just either really smart or overpowered. Unfortunately I don't think I'd spend any money on this in its current state so I'll utilize this trial while I can before uninstalling after the trial ends.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-16,0,0,51,False,Recommended,Potentially game of the year right here! At least the top sleeper hit if nothing else. This is a multiplayer game that manages to actually pull off horror. That's borderline unprecedented. At the same time the Killer role completely immerses you in an 80's slasher movie villain's character. You can legitimately feel like Jason Freddy Kreuger or The Texas Chainsaw dude all from just doing your objectives. The immersion doesn't require fantasy. The immersion comes from focusing on your objectives. It's amazing,Dead by Daylight
2018-10-05,0,0,391,False,Not Recommended,I'd like to tell you to try to fix this problem it is like... when playing surviors we have to find the good (ping) rooms. However sometimes when we are in the good (ping) room most of the killer always disconnect the lobby. This makes survivors spend longer time to find rooms. It is such a waste of time and annoying. Nobody wants to play with 300+ ping rooms. am I right? Please fix this problem as soon as possible. I love your game but I hope you can fix this problem especially THE KILLERS LIKE TO DISCONNECT THE LOBBIES WHEN SEEING ALL SURVIVORS HAVING GOOD ROOM!,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-20,0,0,387,False,Recommended,"Well theres a few things needed to be put out there on the steam community. Dead by Daylight is a fun scary and entertaining game. If you play with friends good for you the game is even more fun. But when you play online thats where the problems come in. 1. Click Join Lobby2. Joing game3. (I grew a beard by now) Failed to join game!&gt OThats one thing that i hate about this. Also the matchmaking needs work you should be able to get the same ranked people when playing alone (Not inviting anyone) because if theres a different rank theres a chance where that killer or pair of survivors could have 10x more powerful perks items offerings etc. I just think the matchmaking needs to be fixed. Next thing the BS occurances like a killer hitting you over a palet or you jump through a window but still hits you from far. Now thats for survivor sometimes when you play as killer the survivor you have on your shoulder disconnects you cant attack drop him/her all you can do is walk. / Then you hit them down and then wallah they somehow escape from you because the killer cant grab the person by the legs and drag someone crawling. I don't care if the ""Entity"" prevents you from doing so and so it's bullcrap and should not be tolerated. Then theres the newest killer.... The nurse. OH MY GOD. SHE IS THE MOST OP KILLER OF ALL TIME. She has a power to ""blink"" or teleport through walls and everything. Now newcomers must be thinking wow thats way too powerful but theres a ""balance."" Whenever she blinks a certain amount of times (Depending on the add ons you have) she gets sort of stunned and looks down and can't really do much. But NO THATS NOT TRUE SHE CAN BE FRICKING STUNNED BUT CAN GRAB YOU OFF PALETS AND WINDOWS! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!!!!!!! MY GOD. She also has this terrifying perk called the nurses calling that lets her see people being healed at a certain range but it's balanced. But just to finish this really long review this game is fun funny scary whatever. Although the price is quite high I think its worth the buy now then what it might be when its done. Might be $60 for all I know.",Dead by Daylight

2018-09-08,0,0,606,False,Recommended,"The Game Itself Dead By Daylight Is an asymmetrical 4v1 horror game.You can take the role as survivor or killer whichever you prefer.Your objective as the survivor is to complete 5 generators then once those are completed you can open the door and wait at the exit doing butt dances! But on a serious note you are challenged to complete 5 generators while facing off a brutal killer. You and your team will need to strategize on how to win. Once all generators are completed you can open one of two gates which then you can escape. If you are caught you are usually put on a hook unless you wiggle free or have decisive strike. you can be hooked two times before you are removed from the round permanently. first time being hooked you can try to free yourself which usually doesn't work or wait for your team to save you. Once you are hooked for the second time or have not been rescued in stage 1 you start stage 2 which you have to repetitively start to spam space. If your team dies and your team has done two generators you can have a chance at finding hatch it pretty often a standoff happens which is pretty dumb in my opinion.Your objective as the killer is to kill all 4 survivors and stop them from getting the gens done. You do not need to kill all survivors to win. It is sorted in a bunch of categories which then determines if you win or not.This all I have to say about the killer as I don't really know what to go into detail about. This may be changed at a later stage. Pros 1. playing as a survivor feels like a rush and the constant suspense will keep you on your toes playing as the killer is super fun and the thrill of the hunt is exhilarating2. Great concept executed at a fair rate.3. mediocre character progression for both the killer and the survivors with various tools add ons perks that can help them accomplish their tasks4. the atmosphere combined with the ambiance and music does a really good job of creating a tense environment5. the audio is done well and you can hear the cries and screams of the survivors as well as other audio cues to help locate your victims6. each map is procedurally generated so you can t just memorize the layouts so each game feels fresh7. the gameplay is very fun and addicting you'll often find yourself wanting to play ""just one more game""8. controller support was added and keybindings are also customizable9. survive with friends mode was added and friends can play together in smaller groups10. the shrine that rotates in teachable perks rewards your time playing and helps reduce the need to grind and level up each survivor. Cons 1. some minor texture bugs and a couple weird graphical glitches where survivors were looked like they were flopping through the air and some of the bodies on hooks but weren t hooked correctly (I'm surprised that some of these still aren't fixed)2. there was also one time where I was unable to heal another player and one other time that I wasn t able to pull the player off of the meat hook because the prompt to do so never came up UPDATED (while this is very rare it can still happen)3. some killers AFK macro hoping to get points and some survivors disconnect making the matches unbalanced4. killers with bad ping will cause survivors to lag into the walls and make them easier to kill (they have added a way to see each other's ping although it is very inaccurate.) I feel like being a killer is significantly easier than being a survivor because you are only relying on yourself not to suck. I ve seen a lot of survivors who are new or sometimes just not very good and it can be a real detriment to the rest of the team and it makes it a lot harder on the rest of the survivors to succeed.Some people might say it s easier for the survivors and in some very rare cases I managed to get a group of competent survivors and the killer never managed to kill everyone. But I feel like in those games the killer was probably just new since those flawless games were few and far between.Every game felt a bit different but admittedly some games were more enjoyable than others depending on how good the other players were. Conclusion I have really enjoyed the game so far but it does have some issues that make it not quite as enjoyable as it could be. Nonetheless I still found myself saying after every game just one more game... It s been a fun game so far but I expect it would be a lot more fun playing with friends it s a great concept and it s got a lot of potential but it would certainly benefit from some small changes here and there.If you have enjoyed the review feel free to add me and tell me your opinions or tell me in the comments below.",Dead by Daylight

2016-10-25,0,0,1058,False,Recommended,I recommended this as a joke. Don't play this garbage.New left 4 Dead update. New character new costumes new perks.No fixes to any of the t listed below...... Lets go with the fact you can just pull your internet plug and you get free points as killer.While the survivors get 0 points.Every game as killer you can do this.. . .Most perks and perk combo's are absolutely useless compared to others.Laggy and no real options for video.Peer 2 Peer system. It's garbage.Killer lags up the game or leaves half the time.Killer has autoaim. If you're near the killer you will be hit if he swings. Absolute t.No point playing as a group as you'll wait years before you find an actual game.Gameplay feels worse with each update. (Bill and costumes are neat however it's a dlc.)The game is just d/c'ing teammates farming points to 'very slowly' reach towards those perks you actually need digging through all the worthless ones. Myers is just a normal character who is a bit faster and instantly kills.Hag is a crappier version of trapper that requires totems to make her anywhere near good.Teammate blocking is a thing.Reports do absolutely nothing.Adding paid dlc in an early access game. lol?I doubt they even play or test their game.Putting double bloodpoints in won't revive or save your game. They remove discussions that have to do with the bad qualities of the game.You do you but I suggest not buying their crap.I did so you don't have to! Go watch videos on how bad the mechanics and functionality of this.. ....pile of coding.... is.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-05,0,0,176,False,Recommended,"The only issues in this game right now are 1) Waiting times for survivors is unreal. Less people are playing Killers (for stupid reasons I'll debunk below).2) There are still issues with Killer Bots who are just scripted to stand in place and keep swinging their weapon. Sure it's free and easy blood points but it ruins the point of the game.3) Human's online are just stupid. Like literally why would you start to heal me when the killer is coming at us?! (Please add a feature where we can shake off other survivors and run. Just make it a noise trigger for the killer to see). Debunking some of the bad reviews ""The game favors surivors and playing killer is just a joke now! You can't win!""&gt &gt &gt This is nonsense. This is literally just a cry from people who aren't as good of a killer as they think they are. Put on the right perks to make finding and handling survivors easier. Be more creative and strategic with the way you chase and capture. Think ahead. I've honestly had NO trouble as the killer and I very rarely play the killer! ""The survivors perks are over powered compared to the killers!""&gt &gt &gt To a small extent I would agree but not enough to where killing all of the survivors is hard by any means. Self Heal Stay on their tracks and they wont have time for it. Sabatour Can be a massive issue but at the pre game screen you can SEE how many survivors might have this perk (or a toolbox). Adjust your perks so that once you catch them you can take them to where YOU want to hang them (i.e. The Basement where they CAN'T undo hooks). And be more aggressive and relentless towards Jake's when you spot them. ""Survivors aren't afraid of the killer anymore! They just toy with him and win!""&gt &gt &gt Again nonsense. It's true there are survivors who try to 'Toy' with the killer by body blocking instantly unhooking people while you're finishing your hooking animation acting as a decoy etc. But those survivors are the easiest to catch! They literally bring themselves TO YOU!Body Blocking Hit them while carrying your victim. It's not hard. It will get them out of your way. Duh.Instant Unhooking You have plenty of time to either 1) Hit the survivor they just took off the hook (and they'll sacrifice faster once you place them back on! GASP!) or 2) Get a hit on the cocky survivor. Chase either one of them down and put them on the hook. They can only use that tactic like 2 times before they're instantly sacrificed when hooked. Decoy They've PRESENTED themself to you. Accept the offering. If they're avoiding you in a troublesome area leave them and search for the others. You'll either 1) Find a new survivor in a more favorable place for you. or 2) The decoy will follow you and likely be in a place more favorable for you. Just because someone's present before you doesn't mean they're the one you HAVE to go after right at that moment. Think and stop being so simple minded. ""The dev's don't listen to the community!""&gt &gt &gt Most of the things you're crying about are personal 'Can't think for myself' problems. You have the solution to most problems as the killer. Adjust your perks and add ons at the pre game screen think outside your simple 'Follow and Hit' methods and put in actual effort. It's not hard catching survivors.",Dead by Daylight

2018-09-19,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,This game is so unbalanced especially for the Killer sense most of the maps are huge while trying to kill someone they just run loops or keep pulling down pallets unless youre nurse but she is so slow for such big maps and the gens are so easy to turn on personally i would not recommend this game in the state that it is in right now.Also the survivors are so toxic all they do is teabag and if they open the door to escape is nearly impossible to stop them now.,Dead by Daylight
2018-05-09,0,0,104,False,Recommended,Fun game definitely worth the $20. Not a huge fan of needing to buy the DLC to get all the killers though you can ignore some of it. Just a tip ignore the bundles that come with the movies unless you really like those movies. I personally highly recommend getting Leatherface and Of Flesh and Mud if you want to play killer as the killers those come with or buying them off of the (completely random) weekly teachables thing are the only ways to get 2 of the best killer perks in the game BBQ and Chili which reveals all survivors for 7 seconds when you hook a survivor and Hex Ruin which makes good tier skill checks drop their progress 5% and great tier skill checks not add any bonus to their progress. If you don't want to buy the DLC probably the best equivalent to Hex Ruin you can get is Hex Huntress's Lullaby which of course comes from the Huntress and builds stacks as you hook survivors. No matter the stack counter survivors will get 6% progress regression for failing skill checks as well as hearing the sound effect that goes off when the skill check is about to start later and later until at 5 stacks there is no sound effect. It also slows down games but not to the extent of Ruin.,Dead by Daylight

From my own experience I learned this game is really fun with friends and is easier to play with people you know. If you are considering to buy the game and are playing it for the first time I would highly suggest that you play with friends who can help you during ranked matches or even practice with you in a private match. The players in DBD can be ""salty"" and bully newcomers however any online multiplayer games have those kind of players.

2017-11-24,0,0,58,False,Recommended,One of the few good Horror games out these days. BUT it's not calibrated and fair for example the Killer doesn't have a better chance to take all Survivors.

Also new modes maybe can be added to have more fun.,Dead by Daylight

You dont need to buy the DLC by the way you wont be restricted from anything it just gives you more playable characters and cosmetics. if u are buying dlc i recomend the halloween chapter it has a really good survivor and killer. The game is not very scary but is horror themed. no it is not a ripoff of friday the 13 the game they have many differences. Lots of fun to play with freinds same with strangers. I love how you dont know who the killer is and you have to be carefull and figure it out. Its a lot of fun working together and has a concept that many other games dont wich is that SOMETIMES it is benificial to leave your teamate. like if they are on a hook your the last and are right next to the hatch with a new flashlight. Overall great game definatly takes skill and low price so DLC is not painful to buy. Please give this a try and I assure you that you will have fun.,Dead by Daylight

2018-03-19,0,0,150,False,Recommended,I have game for about a year now and honestly it's a game! Yes it has some things that need to be worked on such as new gamemodes like hide and seek more objectives etc. but every game has it's downs. Despite these downs the gameplay is fun addictive sadistic and rewarding. You can play as survivor and either help your fellow teammates to survive or play as a survivor who is a lone wolf and use others as bait. Alternatively you can be the killer and live out your goriest nightmares with you behind the mask. Being killer is a lot harder than being survivor nowadays but it is still a fun experience. Especially when you get that sweet revenge on the survivor who's been trolling you the entire game. This game is not pay to win at all because if you buy DLC characters you just get the chance to use bloodpoints to get new perks where if you don't buy DLC you can still get said perks using in game currency. Speaking of DLC most of the characters are non DLC and are part of an ever expanding roster of killers and survivors. Long story short this game is worth the purchase.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-21,0,0,743,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT Changed the review to negative due to the fact that after 6 months the game still have a bunch of bugs and issues that haven't been fixed.People keep finding new ways to glitch and exploit the game and the developers don't really fix them fast enough. There are still bugs where for example the Nurse cannot blink through certain objects and the develeopers don't put enough time to find these spots. Then there is the issue of balance. There are still a huge amount of perks that are basically useless and then there is the ""mandatory"" perks everyone is using. There is nothing being done to balance it out.I really like the game and that is why I am changing my review.ORIGINAL Fun game where you play as either one of four survivors against a killer or vice versa. It is by no means perfect as it has its array of bugs and glitches but even after 40 hours of gameplay I still end up having great games and plenty of fun.If you have a bunch of comrades the fun can be potentionally quadrupled which is even better.",Dead by Daylight

2017-12-26,0,0,460,False,Not Recommended,"PROS Fun game if you play with friends has a ""perk"" system so you can make your own builds and has several popular characters from various franchises. Michael Myers Krueger and a few others. Provides hours of enjoyment and each learnable character perk makes it so you don't have to play as one character just because they have good perks provided you hit level 40 with the character who has perks you want.CONS 1. Hackers. This is a fun game only if you don't mind hackers and ragey ignoramus. I bought the game and found that after 8 hours of playing it was fun. Almost all of the time I played were night time hours. I play in the morning and for 2 hours straight I encounter hacker after hacker after hacker. Instantly knowing where I was despite me literally being silent. I can understand if it's a ""perk"" or something gameplay related but after googling the mechanics and checking the other players' perks there was no explanation as to why I was instantly found in the corner of a map far away from the objective time after time after time and every other player as well regardless of the amount of noise we made. Great game but the player base is ruining it. And yes I am aware they have an ""anti cheat system"" but that didn't seem to stop the individuals I encountered for 2 hours straight in the morning time. I suspect kids or teens with nothing better to do than boost their fragile self esteem than by illegitimately ""winning"" at a game where if you lose your rank goes down. 2. Salt and Stupidity. If I play as the killer and I stand by a hook until the survivor dies then after the match the chat is a torrent of whining raging and crying by the survivors. Yes it's camping. HOWEVER if you camp a hook this lets the other survivors activate the generators with no worries and gives them valuable time towards the objective. Some survivors even stand in front of hooks spam flashlights and follow you around or sabotage a hook as you're heading towards it. I don't rage over these things which are indeed legitimate strategies such that camping on my end is. If I don't rage I expect no rage in return. Instead I get whining survivors who can't deal with me getting minimum 2/4 kills per match.",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-20,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a good game hits the spot well in terms of mechanics. I'm happy to reccomend it on that basis alone. The game is enjoyable from both the perspectives of the killer and survivor and they feel fairly balanced. Being a survivor follows simple gameplay with minor complex detail featuring very heavy risk taking creating extremely tense suspenseful moments in sessions. Progression relys a little less on levels (though still a considerable aspect) and more on the skill and accumulated knowledge of the player which I find to be an especially rewarding mix. Killer gameplay is considerably more complex and relatively more tactical relying on cunning and trying as best you can to use the many mechanics available to track and chase survivors. New killers will struggle more than new survivors though as progression for the killer is split a similar way as for survivors but relies more heavily on both knowledge and skill.However as much as I enjoy playing there are some flaws that really shouldn't be there.There seems to be little consideration to mathmaking where new killers are pitted against teams of seasoned survivors and vice versa. Lobby waiting times can sometimes be quite lengthy too. With a decent playerbase there is no good reason to have both these issues simultaneously. There can sometimes be some lag in games though I've experienced less of this than what others seem to have. I've noticed some bugs. Disconnects are also a semi frequent problem where you can be kicked out of lobbies 15% of the time and with great frustration can be kicked out of the game roughly 5 10% of the time.I'd like to be able to say the devs are great and working on this but from what I can see it doesn't seem that way. They appear to have set focus on producing content for the game for it's longevity and for money. While the dlc is good and something I'd also reccomend they have clearly lacked as much focus or refused to work on the problems the game has.Despite this I reccomend This game. It's very appropriately priced so If you're interested in the concept it should be worth the money particularly when on sale.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-03,0,0,1001,False,Recommended,If this game came at full retail of 30+ I'd tell you to stay away from it. However the price is very reasonable for the amount of hours I've put into this game. The game is constantly improving and new content is being added. Yes there are always issues the Devs are reletively new but are hard at work. I've spent 40 on games and barely played 50 hours so it's certainly value for money.The typical game spawns you in as a Survivor where you need to repair 5 Generators to power the doors and and make it out alive. It's easier said than done as each Killer has different mechanics and is a human player constantly looking to sacrifice you to The Entity by hooking you. There's plenty of longetivty to the game as long as you don't mind a bit of a grind. You can unlock character specific perks for both Killer and Survivor.If you're looking for a triple A quality game this is not your game this is a fairly priced Indie game. If you enjoy Cat vs Mouse gameplay and nailbiting close calls then this game is worth the moneyUpdate 660+ Hours at the time of writing this review. The game has its ups and downs but the game is certainly fun and for an affordable price. DLC Cosmetics are low price and the game is stricly NOT Pay To Win. All DLC Perks content can be obtained without buying the DLC. Frequent updates and new content with this game means you can't really go wrong.

2018-10-09,0,0,309,False,Not Recommended,This game has had years to sort out balance issues. This game has had years to make it an even enjoyable experience for killer and survivor players. But unless killer players use specific perks AND specific killers this game definitely leans in the survivor's favour. There's a massive XP hill to climb to get consistant access to good add ons and all the perks. Definitely NOT new player friendly. I'm nowhere near finished unlocking characters and perks and ive put in nearly 300 hours.This game was supposed to be a horror/survival style game. But playing as the killer is pretty much no fun at all in most games. I thought it was the survivors that were meant to be scared but it's usually the other way around.Lets add that survivors dc'ing from games happens REGULARLY as a means to down rank. And this is allowed? Can't players be punished by an in built system to discourage this sort of thing?One of the original maps STILL has a point where the killer can't reach the survivor and the survivor can block the killer's path.,Dead by Daylight

I couldn't recommend it if it were full AAA price with the problems it has.First and foremost the devs ABSOLUTELY need to allow keybinding. I don't understand how they haven't already added this to the game it's such a basic feature.Button mashing really needs to go too.

2018-10-13,0,0,647,False,Recommended,This review is written by someone who has played about 24h exclusively as a survivor take that into account.What this game excels at the atmosphere is great. In every game the atmosphere is roughly the same. It's tense mysterious exciting... But from minute 1 till hour 24 the player's perception of it evolves from a horror type game with a bunch of jumpscares and adrenaline rushes to an intense interesting PvP game where tactics and mindgames will lead you to victory and give you a real sense of a accomplishment. The matchmaking/ranking system is solid. Although it differs from match to match I rarely feel that I'm matched up with a team or opponent that are way below or above my approximate skill level. The foundation of this game is it's audio and ingame visual effects (not part of the HUD). From start to finish you need to rely on your visual and auditory senses to succeed. Game knowledge helps a bunch but learning maps by heart is not a thing in this game. It keeps you on your toes and this is where the game shines. Procedural generation of the maps means that you won't ever be matched up with diehards who know the exact layout of the map by heart. At the same time this keeps the game fresh for said diehards it's great!What the game does well The leveling/perk system feels well thought out allows a lot of variety in playstyles. The downside of this system is that it's opaque and you're not able to see the perks till the end of the game. This means that general knowledge of the game and awareness in a match is more important but it also means that you don't know that you're in a very unfavorable matchup till it's already too late because you can't adapt to the situation. This is both a point against and in favour of this game. The tutorial is comprehensive and provides rewards to get you started along with some essential knowledge. 20 euro price tag Queues are generally really short. Not having voicecoms ingame is both a blessing and a curse. The lack of people shouting at you or loudly munching cheetos with open mic absolutely saves the immersion of this game. At the same time it often makes you feel powerless against killers as there is no way to prevent your teammate from walking into an obvious trap.What the game does poorly Even though the pricetag is very low for a game with these graphics and of such quality Behaviour Digital kept costs low by utillizing a P2P model. This is understandable but because the game is hosted by the killer this causes latency issues which you would not experience with dedicated servers. Every few games I end up with a host with a not so great internet connection which causes rubber banding disconnects at the very start of the game or poor losers who will end the session by ragequitting. Related to above Sometimes matches don't get established at all as a disconnect happens during the loading screen but certain consumables with effects on only that match will still be consumed. This last one is not a fault of the game but due to the nature of it you can NOT listen to music or watch videos while playing this game. In order to succeed at it and enjoy it to it's fullest you can't have any other distractions going on while you play.Final verdict For this price buy it. Even with its flaws and many DLC packs you'd have to purchase to get the full experience of the game this is one of the best gaming experiences you'll ever have even if it's just as a casual experience for a few hours.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-27,0,0,1515,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is an excitingly addictive survival horror game. Very fun to play with friends and it's such a fun fast paced game once you get the hang of it!In case you're wondering how this game is any different to Friday The 13th here's the down low Friday the 13th is a very repetitive game being that it has only one killer (or many that all just do that same thing) and many characters that have very indifferent stats.Of course the objective is the same as dbd. You must escape. Dead by Daylight is definitely not repetitive at all. It has many killers and many different survivors with their own perks. Each game is clearly different as there is a high chance you will verse a different killer every game. You have ranks in dbd that will put you in a game with others that are at the same level as you. f13 does not have this option and you could be versing level 500s in your first games .,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-16,0,0,30,False,Recommended,I rarely write reviews for games but this game is VERY addicting. To make this review simple I'm going to write it as pros and cons. PROS *Can be a killer or survivor*Rarely run into a group of friends who have an extreme advantage with communication if you're the killer*Quick learning curve*Infinite level perks*Maps are random every round so survivors can't memorize layoutsCONS *Has a few bugs has crashed once for me*Can only make a lobby as a killer (Good and bad depending on how you look at it)*Loose items on death (If you buy an item for your character such as a medkit for example if you die while using that item it is gone for good until you are able to buy another one)Other than what I listed the game is very good. It has a few balancing issues but that's expected from a game that just released. Give it time and the game will be amazing. The best round I had was when I was the wraith and I went invisible the survivors didn't notice so when I found them I uncloaked and caught them all in one spot. I know this review isn't much but I hope it is enough to sway some people to trying the game. The negative reviews claiming the game doesn't have private friend matches are trolls and people that want to sit under their friends buts the whole time while playing. Loosen up play the dang game like it was meant to be played. If you want to play with your friends start a private match so its fair between YOUR FRIENDS. lol,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-31,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"Dead By Daylight New age ""Hide and Seek"" Dead By Daylight offers a scary theme is really creepy and suspenseful even with a friendly killer (killer who roleplays the match) in fact 2 of the games I had with a friendly killer were better than the random queues. Making it challenging however playing out a story where only 2 of us survived after 53 compelling minutes of running hiding planning our next move and repairing the 2 remaining generators in order to achieve our freedom. The game itself is amazing though the development team could do a little more to enhance the experience for everyone. I really love the development team for sticking true to its roots and not implementing a loot crate system opting for a more traditional in game currency and item buy menu this allows for a completely fair and equal playing field when in game. The team even shows its love for other games and classic movies by adding cosmetic changes for characters if you own certain games or buy the DLC (Not Mandatory). Even the addition of Freddy Krueger was a nice nod to the original classic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" as well as the Leatherface skin available as a DLC. Dead By Daylight has a lot of unique and original killers as well which are very appealing and fun to play as I personally would love to see movies or even shorts based on these characters maybe someday in the future. Sadly this game is far from perfect and though I enjoy this game so much it does lack variety... There are only 9 different areas known as Realms in the game which offer 22 map layouts across the Realms which tend to be slightly repetitive if you pay close attention. Also some killers do seem to have an advantage with their abilities and varying movement speed. Also with no voice chat it does make it difficult to coordinate with teamates though I am glad I don't have members of the toxic community screaming in my ear. Additions I would love to see implemented to the game is lobbies where you can join friends where you can set up custom game settings and create your ideal scary movie senerio as well as have a friend or yourself lobby as the killer. Roleplaying has a huge community and I feel the game could benefit so much more if they did add such a feature. I recommend this game to anyone who meets the System Requirements the development team really did make a gem and should keep up the outstanding work. Game 8/10",Dead by Daylight

2018-05-02,0,0,560,False,Not Recommended,This game has a great concept 1 vs 4 killers vs survivors can be great fun at first. However after player a good amount of time as the killer this game has shown its too colours through the comunity and the devioplers. The survivor player are the worst prand of people ypu will ever come across. High level survivros torment the player by bullying them during the gamplay. If the killer doesnt do what the survivros wants such as not camping the surviros willl gang up on you and harrest you for just playing the game the way you want to play. Its a never ending story you avoid this its four players agaisnt 1 and you cannot mute the chat. The idea of the game is great but its excurected in the wrong way the palents the looping perks like decisive strike isn't fun. Everything is agaisnt the killer which leads me the devs of the game they only care about the survivors. They listen to them too much they complain about elemens in the game which the players can over come themsleves. They do a very poor job in helping killers have a better expeience instead of changing core elements of the game they instead just relase certain perks or killers to answer the problem but this has only coursed more problems and made the game worse. The change to the ranking system is another example of how the devs do not care about the killers this game is also too expensive for its own good. each dlc killer is $8 each the main game only comes with four you have to buy the other 7 killlers which is way overprice. This game all together is Aud $85 and its only one game mode. No story no other mutilplayer modes its horriable. This is almost as expensive as evolve. If your looking to play classic movie killers you can do that if ur willing pay for them. Howeer theyare considered the worse killers who struggle agaisnt the survivors. The devs should have made these killers strong to gain more prase but they didnt because they listen to the surivivors too much. In the end this game its turned into a massive troll toxic repulsive anrgy disrespectful comunity who go about bullying people you dont get what they want. This game could damage your mental state if ur looking for a game to relax and chill like a break from study this isn't ur game. This will do more harm then good the devs create a great idea but a toxic game that will leave you depressed.,Dead by Daylight

Teamchats like discord give survivors a huge edge that the game isn't balanced for. Kill your friends is an unranked mode where you basically don't earn any points or rank making it pointless unless you have a full group of five.Survivors are overpowered don't let salty bad player reviews fool you. If you know what you are doing and know how to build perks and abuse pallets you can make an absolute mockey of killers especially killers who lack a way to get around pallet abuse. SWF or survive with friend troll groups are a thing in this vein and they are toxic.

They tend to think they are hot for doing it despite pretty much anyone who is decent at the game knowing survivors have an advantage over most killers. That said playing the killer is really fun when the game works as intended and you have a group of 4 randos of varying skill scattered throughout the map who may or may not help each other. It feels great to finally outsmart that one slippery survivor who thought they could loop you only to win the mind game and slap them down.The game does have a lot of effects statuses and naunces that are not immediatly apprent so keep that in mind and be prepared to do a little research on these so you know what is going on. Biggest tip for survivors always keep one eye on the killer especially in a chase dont just look ahead. Otherwise you will probably find the killer as side stepped you and is about to lunge at you from the side or something.",Dead by Daylight
2017-06-11,0,0,812,False,Recommended,There is a bug that escapes the score link window after escaping the Devade game. However if you do a forced termination you lose both the Blood Web Points and the Ranking Points. I feel a very big anger about it. This bug occurs in several games not just one time. There is a bug that can not escape from loading the game room. This is a forced termination. However this does not eliminate the BloodWeb points and ranking scores. But it feels like anger.

2016-07-11,0,0,529,False,Not Recommended,This game is unfinished the patches break more than they fix the devs are clueless (look at some of their past work) as to what is fun they spend time tweaking the UI and act like they did a good meanwhile they had to roll back a patch that they literatley said was unfinished (then why release it? Because fans whined? Be big boy devs and finish the job!)Gameplay can range from 10/10 to a 2/10 depending on the amount of glitches and exploits you experience. Sometimes you will just get stuck in walls cause that's fun! Othertimes you wont get on screen indicators that are supposed to be there sometimes survivors continue to grunt after they've been killed sometimes the killer will be unable to pick up a survivor. Overall though when the game functions mostly as it should it is fun. Lots of fun.Graphics are meh. Go to the Unreal Asset store and pick a few packs full of nasty colors and mediocre textures. The visual design of the killers and survivors also leave a lot to be desired with no real customization to speak of. Visually the whole game is a 6/10. Could be better could also be much worse i suppose.Bottom line ask yourself how much you would pay for a game that is and will be forever in beta? If the answer is equal to or greater than the price of this game go for it.Oh something they don't mention anywhere on the store page don't get attatched to your Rank.

When you get the game if you decide to MAKE SURE YOU GET FRIENDS THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING!!! I didn't so I went in blind and got flamed at the end of every game. Make sure you get some friends to go into matches with. Also you're definately going to get bored of your playstyle when you first start so try something else like juking then go back!

2017-08-23,0,0,210,False,Recommended,This is actually a very solid game. It's funny too see people hate on this game but praise Friday the 13th. I had originally bought Friday 13th played it for 45 minutes or so and refunded it. It had so many issues not to mention the fact that the servers were absolute garbage you couldn't even find matches half the time. Yes in DBD you get some campers and some whiny killers but hey it's like that in just about any multiplayer game. You get people who quit in the middle of matches or whatever but again it's like that with any multiplayer game.I've had pretty good luck with the community and had a blast playing the game so far. So there really aren't any negatives from me. The only negative maybe that a few of the killers are OP but that's up for debate.Anyway this game has so much more content and overall has so much more to offer than Friday the 13th. I would strongly suggest purchasing this game. For $20 it's well worth it and if you find it on sale it's an even better deal! Don't waste your time with anything else just buy it!!!! Plus you can buy the game and most of the dlc for the price of Friday the 13th.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-24,0,0,1417,False,Recommended,I was so on the fence with picking this title up as I read many reviews complaining about the bugs and lag. After about a month and the game being on sale I took the plunge and picked DBD up. The game is far from perfect but provides plenty of fun if you have the have the right people in your group. I learned early on that playing with randos led to a lackluster performance that generally lacked any team work. Once I found enough decent players the game really grew on me. I still hate the fact that the game bugs out and kicks me back to the opening screen when trying to enter lobbies. This type of issue happens way to often and really needs to be remedied because it wrecks a pretty solid title.,Dead by Daylight

If you like pretty much consistent character progression (via unlocking skills skins etc.) then you'll enjoy this game. I've played quite a bit and have unlocked all the teachable perks for the all the Survivors. Started working on Killers but the queue for them is a bit long. Managed to hit Rank 6 as a Survivor.I do have to give this game the thumbs down unfortunately because of the players themselves. The game is pretty well done and fun to play. The thing that absolutely kills any fun in this game is the players DC'ing when they get caught when they feel they have been ""wronged"" or whatever other reason they get upset over.As of right now NOTHING is being done about the rampant DC'ing in the game. While the game is fun until they do something about the DC'ing (just like every other game out there with a competitive ranking) this game will go downhill due to the players.It would be in the developers best interest to start doing something about this NOW rather than wait until their game goes the way of Evole.",Dead by Daylight

2017-03-03,0,0,578,False,Recommended,I have written a revieuw about dead by daylight before that one was negative cous there where to many gamebreaking buggs. I have deleted this one and decided to give it a positive revieuw cous most of those have been removed. However i do want to inside caution into makeing a purchanse into this game. The devs have showed before that thay care more about deadlines then that something is actualy playable.I wanted to write a positive revieuw becous i have thouroughly enjoyed myself and defenitely got my money out of my purchance. I personaly dont like this game in its current state but alot of people do. If you think you might enjoy the game give it a shot. its affordable has enjoyable gameplay is unique and has alot of potential.I want to state though that however i think the game is worth the money for some people this game is unbalanced and quite repetitive. I have reached the point myself where i have seen enough of the game and start to irritate myself on the lack of balance at points so i would not play it futher myself. For most people playing this game the balance is unimportant it realy only matters at rank 1 so if your not a competitive player this will not be a negative point for you thus my revieuw is positive. And that beeing said if you are a competitve player then i would strongly recomand to move on becous the devs have shown to not understand the balance at all at the slightest so i doubt this game will become balanced in the future.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-11,0,0,843,False,Recommended,This game is based upon 4 players being survivors and 1 player as the killer. It is a cat mouse game and matches usually last 5 20 minutes. Very exhilerating to play either side and enough content to keep it fairly fresh. I would recommend this game to anyone as I keep going back to it even after quite a few hours and this is coming from someone who easily gets bored with playing the same game all the time. There is a stream of new content all the time and the game is constantly evolving and getting better.However keep a couple things in mind 1. As with many games some toxic players can tarnish the experience. After a match is over there is a chat room open as long as the killer is in the lobby (the player playing killer runs the server more on that in a second). I advise new players to just leave as some people are s. Secondly survivors that aren't doing well in the beginning will often just disconnect from the game essentially screwing over the remaining survivors.2. There is a steep learning curve. Back when I got into the game a couple years ago the learning curve was steep enough and it has gotten a lot more complex since then with a lot of new content and fixes. At times the devs seem to try to balance the game more towards the high rank play and not for the new players. The frustration will be real when starting out. Possibly try watching some streamers play or watch gameplay on youtube when you start out to get an idea of how to play.3. There are no dedicated servers. Therefore there are some ways for killers to exploit this as the server is based off them and sometimes even with good internet you will experience some lag in game.,Dead by Daylight
2018-05-30,0,0,370,False,Recommended,"There is a lot to be said about this game. It is still definitley in its earlier stages and it does have some problems. I personally love it but I would advise anyone thinking about buying this to take what happens in this game with a grain or salt and there will be plenty of salt! PROS__________1. It provides an awesome horror experiance. With a broad amount of maps and Killers. You can pick your favorite psycho and terrorize strangers to your hearts content or you can pick a survivor and attempt to escape the clutches of your favorite movie villian or better yet a killer unique to the game. 2. This is a great game to play with friends or alone. You can get all that pent up frustration out. The experiance is as enjoyable as it is terrifying. 3. The Bloodpoint system rewards you for almost everything in the game and you even recieve in game currency as you level so you can buy cosmetics for your characters. 4. You can teach your survivor/ killers perks to other chracters. Which gives a broad spectrum of creativity in your playstyle alongside various ADD ONs and Sacrifices. There is a meta and it does exsist at higher ranks. But there are a lot of options if you are a casual player. If you are competative don't worry about it too much cause the meta here is basically opinion based and most everything works. I would stay away from Freddy and Wraith if you just got this game and are playing killer. Those killers need some serious balance changes. Wraith is getting better but Freddy is struggling hard. They still work but it can be hard. As for survivor Quentin is pretty bad. Ace and Nea are a bit lackluster but not awful. 5. The games visual and sound quality are amazing. The ambient sounds and graphics really immerse you into the game. 6. The game is growing and its a joy to watch it evolve and have new content be released. Even after countless hours of gameplay there is always something to come back to and it seems to only get better and better. CONS______________1. The community is a bit toxic. Even the developers seem to have a bad attitude towards the games development at times. Killers whine about balance constantly and how the game caters to survivors. Survivors whine constantly about just about everything. In my time playing this game I have found survivors to be the more toxic part of the game. The Killer role needs some love but it is not underpowered. The Survivor role is a bit strong but it is not overpowered. 2. Game Balance and bug fixes. Anyone who has played this game for any extended length of time will find a bug or will deal with something that is unbalanced or unfair. This game is still growing and a lot needs to be fixed. Yes it sucks but thats what happens when you play a game that is still evolving. 3. The developers take a very cavalier approach to the games development. There were statements made by the lead spokesman of the game mathieu cote that were very out of line and he had to issue an apology to the community. Even afterwards the apology seemed like ""damage control"" and personally anything out of his mouth should be disregarded. Just letting you know before you buy it. It is not just the game itself that is growing. The developers are slow to change core issues and address community backlash on both sides of the spectrum. The creators are learning how to manage and how to run the game and how to deal with being in the public eye. Just be aware you may need some patience a lot of it. No situation is perfect and keeping everybody happy is a harder task the more people that are involved.4. The community is small and sometimes you have to wait awhile to get a game. This is a niche game and a lot of people have quit and come back. But new people join everyday and old players come back. I would not say its dying. I hope not anyways. Even with all its glaring flaws I LOVE THIS GAME! 5. It can be a little grindy getting add ons and bloodpoints especially in the beginning when you are just starting out. They've made a lot of changes to make it easier but it is still a bit of a grind. Which is normal. Its just how the game is. It's not awful or anything. 6. There are a lot of bad mannered people that play this game. A lot of talkers and tea baggers and face campers and hackers and bug abusers. Just be prepared to deal with some s. Its like that in any online game. Just be prepared.7. The games price tag can be a bit pricey with all the DLC. I think it's worth it because it supports the game and keeps it around but it can be pricey. Overall this is a great game and I would recommend it 100%. It has a lot of problems but there is a lot of good about it too. I can't wait to see more come out of this game and where it all goes. GO HOOK ONE FOR ME!

When you can find a match that you can connect to (can take from 5 seconds to 10 minutes) sometimes you just bug out get killed when your not near the killer or at worst which has happened to me several times already have the game crash out to your desktop and lose all your items on startup.

2017-09-30,0,0,594,False,Recommended,Overall fun game even with all the bugs. It feels like the game is more survivor sided with there being more and more perks and balances to make the game easier for them. Really wish the devs added more things to make it fun.

However in its current stance the game is a bit unbalanced and there are things that game could change.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-27,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,As of right now this game is crap. Dead By Daylight is full of game breaking bugs that prevent survivor faction players from joining servers and the framerate is incredile low. I like to think I have a relatively good computer that should without a doubt be able to handle this game (AMD A10 8700P Radeon R6 10 Compute Cores 4C+6G 1.80 GHz with8 GB RAM) seeing as how my computer can handle high end graphics on games like Skyrim while maintaining a constant 60 FPS. with this game on the LOWEST graphics settings I get anywhere from 5 15 FPS. This low framerate makes it near impossible to outrun and out think the killer as a survivor and is impossible to track down and kill survivors as the killer. Do not buy this game until its other gamebreaking bugs are fixed and optimization is improved. Gameplay is incredibly fun when the FPS rate and glitches don't ruin the experience so once thats all fixed Ill change my recommendation.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-01,0,0,75,False,Not Recommended,"I'm rewriting my review as I'm approaching 100h played. It may seem hypocrite to have played this much and NOT recommend the game but the only reasons I kept going are because it's super addictive and I kept hoping with more experience and more grinded perks things will get better. They don't. Here are the things that made me quit and regret ever starting the game is a huge grind. The get an optimal build you will need to bring all your characters close to max. If you don't to put in a few hundred hours don't bother. the community is the most toxic I've ever seen as a gamer in 20 years. Survivors and killers literally hate each other both in game in chat and on forums. After playing killer so long I hate survivors too. I've taken so much abuse in game (tea bagging making fun of the killer exploiting etc) and after the game (in chat) that I geniuenly feel like this the game is not balanced nor will it ever be. At high level only a single killer is viable. The whole concept is based on survivors making mistakes. If they don't there is nothing you can do as a killer. The survivors have so many crutches and things on their side that the killer is powerless. Look up ""dbd de pip squad"" on youtube to see how bad it is. And any time the survivors are nerfed they cry out on forums like babies and ultimately devs get on their side because they are 4 time more in numbers. Nothing you can do. The balance is broken even more by SWF teams (nicknamed cheat with friends) that use external voice chat to circumvent most of the mechanics. When you encounter one of these you are about to have a really bad time. Worse the dev allow this but still balance the game around survivors not talking to each other. It's a farce.",Dead by Daylight

I want to love and recommend this game but I just can't. It has always been a buggy mess the devs don't know what the hell they're doing this game is essentially the best of a bad situation for this type of PvP and even then I'd urge you to look elsewhere. There's so much potential here but it's all wasted for no good reason.

2018-02-03,0,0,487,False,Recommended,This is an amazing game. It does horror (not merely asymmetrical but horror in general) better than anything I've played in the past 5 years. The killers are intimidating the survivors (David King is my favorite) are vulernable and have personality and the settings are frightening. My only complaint is that if a killer doesn't like the setting an offering might produce the killer can disconnect. I know there are bans for exce4ssive disconnection but in the meantime the survivors still lose their offerings and occasionally their items as well. We work hard to get those things through bloodpoints and taking chances on chests it's not right that a wussy kliller can cause us to lose them. The game would be better with some sort of system to see who disconnected and only cost THAT person their items and offerings. This is not simple development I know but it would make the game better and fairer. (Life may not be fair but the games we play should try to be so.)Other than that one piffle though this is an exemplary game and it's constantly evolving. Been out a year and a half now and just keeps getting better. Well done Behavior Digital!,Dead by Daylight

2018-04-20,0,0,823,False,Recommended,I have mixed feelings for Dead by Daylight. But despite these mixed feelings I have to say that Dead by Daylight is the most played game I own on any console. Xbox or PC. I never play anything else that often but Dead by Daylight is possibly the most top played. Yes it has its bugs and some people have their speculations about the Dev team behind the game. But I love the plot of the game and how it functions. I love playing both Killer and Survivor for both sides are fun as hell. There are a lot of unique and not so unique perks in the game that help you out along the way but you have to earn them as you level up your character. So there is that. But the concepts of the killers and ideas that they produce is unique and original. I will probably keep playing this game despite the fact that there are more cons then pros to it. It is really fun and I am excited to make Dead by Daylight the #1 game on my top games list next to Skyrim.,Dead by Daylight

If U like dark climates a sense of being observed or the adrenaline of being chased by a psycho with a saw this game is just 4 U DAll maps contain abonded places dark corners blood stained room etc so U will feel like u were in your own house (Familiar isn't it?)There r 2 types of of roles U can take up. The Killer or the SurvivorWho's the Killer? Well in the nutshell it's a psycho with a characteristic weapon and unique skill. Its aim is to ends up the miserable life of all Survivors by hooking them on a special hooks or just killing them by its hands (embeding an axe in survivor head sawing through the survivor body etc xD) )And the Survivors. Their aim is to escape from the place they've stucked in with a killer by repairing 5 generators and opening a gate. If U like bodyblocking everyone expect U not healing ur teammates (they will die so don't worry) or just juking the Killer so that it will DC this role is definitely 4 U. The endless fun entertainment and ofc Self respect. All in all This game is worth buying it believe me. If U buy it U won't be disappointed U'll have a lot of fun especially if U'll play it with UR friends. So don't waste Ur time enter the abonded world and show them who the real boss is D,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-01,0,0,336,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight is an excellent game. I dont know what else to say? What thats it? Nah ill give you moreDead By Daylight is a team based game where there are 4 survivors (or less if you are playing private match) vs 1 killer. The survivors objective is to repair 5 generators and open up a power based door before the killer kills them. Killers goal is to kill the survivors before they can do their objective. Thats a basic intro to the game and thats all ill say. The game has a unique set of perks for each character you play as and offerings for both the killer and survivor (offerings are burned at the beggining of a match to give an advantage to the survivors or killers (25% bonus blood points more item chests less sacrifical hooks etc.) Overall this game is very well thought out and all though the community of killers love camping survivors this game is extremely fun when you get good at it!

2017-02-25,0,0,228,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly I love this game but I hate it more than I love it. Here are a few points why this is NOT worth buying. Toxic Community Fail to unhook someone camp someone to win do anything that's not in the meta and you're bad. After game chats are as toxic as Chrenobyl with no one actually taking blame or taking responsibility for what they did. Unessecary Competitive ""Resets"" and Bad Lower Ranks Every 13th of each month you're rank is reset to almost the lowest rank with mine 7 (the 7th highest) going to 19 (the second lowest). Rank resets are not only unnecessary as there is no ""placement matches"" or highly competitive tiering system (where only X amount of people can hold a rank) to warrant a reset as well as the fact that good players have to play with sub par or below average teamates in a RANKED TEAM BASED game. It just ruins the game to have to play with lower skill ranks that do not understand the game. Lack of an Unranked Gamemode Sure you can play with a party of just friends but lacking friends to play with causes you to have to play ranked because there is only ranked. Unranked public online games in Dead by Daylight simply do not exsist. Balance Issues in play Some killers such as the Nurse and the Doctor both counter key aspects to a Survivor's gameplay. The Nurse has an overpowered blinking ability that allows her to teleport closer to any survivor she's chasing. This also allows her to teleport straight through objects walls and pallets the latter being the keystone to a survivor's survival due to the lack of other options presented by the devs. Which brings up my next point the Doctor. The Doctor has an electrical field that can go through walls and objects and is on at all times that forces the survivor to scream and give away his position while within his terror raidus. These 2 killers take away the Survivor's ability to avoid killers one being the Nurse and the chase and the other being the Doctor and hiding. In Conclusion This game is only fun in the high ranks low ranks suck because most of the people playing are incompetent trolling are new or haven't played in a long time. I would not reccomend this game.",Dead by Daylight

So the devs should fix that problem first and keep in mind my computer is only two gb two of them lower then recommended and the game wants to kill itself. after that they need to fix all the killers properly not a bandaid fix a proper one. then they can add new features. with all that said dbd is still a good game and fun to play it just needs some fine tuning in sertain areas is all.,Dead by Daylight

He always puts down several traps near hooks and generators (as he should be played but he baits your teamates to help you while he camps). He ruins every game he's used! I would give this game a really good review but trapper being overpowered and killers able to knock down multiple survivors at once (Leaving them to bleed out and then hooking them) ruins every game it happens in. I give it 7/10 at the state its in. Nerf trapper and it would be a fantstic game.,Dead by Daylight

2018-03-18,0,0,114,False,Recommended,So first the bad occasional gameplay bugs and glitches (seem rather rare though) some killer/survivor perks are near mandatory while many others are borderline worthless matchmaking can be rather hit and miss depending on how many people are online a LOT of the players (under 50% but not by much) are toxic.Now the good the gameplay is REALLY fun one of the few asymmetrical games that feels like NOT a one sided stomp getting to chainsaw someone is really cathartic the killers have a variety of interesting powers to play around the graphics are pretty good. Overall I have fun playing this which IMO is the ultimate metric.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-31,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,Survivors are way to OP in this game. You try to catch one and by that time all generators are already repaired. Surivors can crouch and block killer while he try to hook one of them with is ridiculous. Killers have way to less skills to use while survivors have plenty. Also maps are not balanced in most of them killer can enter the first floor only by one side while survivor can escape using many ways. Killing 4 players on one map is practically impossible unless you play versus total noobs. The game lacks competition. Aactually it does not matter if you kill 1 2 or 3 players all you get is some bloodpoints and you dont feel like a winner unless you hook them all. I also would like to mention that when you hook 3 players the last survivor can escape through hatch with is randomly opening on the map. If he is the last alive he just dont have to bother about not repaired generators that you where defending with such stubbornness. Last survivor just run through hatch and it's the end. I only had fun when I was learning this game but now when I know all mechanics I do not recommend it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-12,0,0,288,False,Recommended,If there is one thing I would add to this game it would be a camp point reduction. Listen I play a lot of video games and personally im not against camping in call of duty or battlefield or what not but in this game its points system is fairly well thought out and a simple tweak could save a lot of hassle. For those who havent a clue what im talking about when the murderer eventually catches you he will then hang you on a hook and when he does so 9 times out of 10 he will sit there and watch you like a hawk and there is no way to save you. Your friends cant help because he refuses to chase them if you friends try to grab you quick youll either die before you can run away or he'll just grab your friend from saving you and hang him on a hook too and if your one of the lucky few and get off the hook on your own he can just stab you and put you right back on the hook. I feel that all that is needed to resolve this issue is a simple point reduction system where if you stand within 10 meters of a hung survivor you will lose say 300 points every 10 seconds and if he dies while your doing so the sacrifice points are nerfed for you never giving him a chance to escape. Other than that flaw there are a few DC rank issues that need to be resolved but besides that this is a great game and definitely worth grabbing even if only for say 100 hours or so.,Dead by Daylight

2018-04-20,0,0,365,False,Recommended,So you are thinking about getting Dead by Daylight right? Well I am here to tell you how great this game actually is.First of all if you are scared of horror movies and the genre itself this game is fine for you. Personally I hate horror movies and I can't really watch them but I can play this game just fine and still have a great time with intense gore. Also something I would like to point out is don't let the bad reviews about bad balancing issues ruin the game for you. However they are partly right. Not every killer in the game is good in fact there are only three top tier killers (Hillbilly Nurse Myers.) Survivors can have ridiculously good perks but the killer can as well. Trust me anyone who is saying killer is impossible to play is completely wrong. There are plenty of perks that are amazing on killer here is a few BBQ &amp Chili (This basically lets the killer see any survivors that aren't near the recently hooked survivors) Nurse's calling (Let's you see the aura of healing survivors from about 20/24/28 meters away) and NOED or No one escapes Death (When the exit gates are powered a dull totem is turned into a hex totem that makes it so survivors are one hit so the killer can just hook everyone before they escape.) I know if you are reading this review you may have no idea what I am talking about and thats ok. This game has some bugs everyone knows that but so do other games. There isn't a single game out there that is absolutely perfect and has no bugs. In the end I feel like this game was very worth my $20 and I hope to keep improving as I keep playing this game.IMPORTANT If you are worried about the hefty amount of DLC for this game don't worry. The devs are implenting a way to unlock DLC characters by playtime so you won't have to pay to get them.,Dead by Daylight
2018-05-10,0,0,184,False,Recommended,When first playing the game it was as scary as any other horror game. There was an intense atmosphere while fixing generators looking for the killer trying not to mess up skill checks. This wore off about 8 or 9 hours into gameplay. After that it became an enjoyable multiplayer experience. The mechanics are fun playing with friends is enjoyable and the low price tag also helps. Whether you play killer or survivor you ll enjoy the game.GOOD $20 Fresh Experience Decent net code Not bug redden Good with friendsBAD Is super difficult to get started very grind heavy Players get toxic after about rank 16 Flashlights (!)Overall review 7/10,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-01,0,0,81,False,Recommended,It's a very good game I think the balencing issues metnioned in previous reviews are valid However this is really own to the play style of the players for example if you play killer expect to come across many survivors who will endlessly loop you or worse still block you from hooks when you have one of their friends after that they will hang about their friends for the save. Then when your stalking the nearby player you get accused of camping.From a survivor perspective there is a learning curve but once you get the hang of it you will be running rings around killers (literally)I know the devs can't do much about this the community is the community but it would be good for people to educate themselves about the game a bit to 1. learn how to play better and 2. to have some understanding for the killer who for the most part is doing his job and stalking survivors so a degree of tactical trapping survivors is a key to victory (I am not advocating face camping here however).If you decide to play killer expect a learning curve for every killer you play and be prepared for quite a bit of flaming and accusations should you do well and called a noob if you ignore easy kills in the interest of 'not camping'.Overall I'm still going to recommend this it can be frustraiting at times but the odd dip in game can be lots of fun.As regards to DLC this is definatly not pay to win most of the DLC killers and survivors in my view are not as good at the already included ones but fun none the less once you learn how to play them.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-01,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,I would rather not down vote this game since what I am complaining about is not really gameplay. However the fact that they got something wrong that is such a standard across games by doing it all different and wonkey stopping me from experiencing the gameplay I felt I should say something. I was also hoping it might server as a warning to others with something other than a single monitor to take serious considation before purchasing this game. Unless your ok with constant settings changes and losing your desktop layout everytime you want to play.This game does not follow industry standard for resolution handling. It handles changing the resolution through a single slider which only effectivly changes the resolution when the game is in full screen mode. When in a window the window size changes. There is no way to set the game window to anything but aspect ratio of the primary display.Why is this a problem?I have a multi monitor setup and use Nvidia Spanning to create a single desktop from all 3 monitors. This makes my desktop resolution 5760 x 1080. Because this resolution is what the game will base alll of its scaling on despite altering the config files to set it to my desired resolution of 1920 x 1080 the video appears zooomed in and with the top and bottom of the screen chopped off with no effective way to change it.From the tutorial play throughs and one miserable attempt at an online game I would not reccomend this game to people with muliple monitor configurations.,Dead by Daylight

Like the killer hitting someone has a recharge attatched to it.EDIT This community is extremely whiny.

Bad geometry on the maps can ruin your chase glitchy walls can allow the killer to get off illegal hits and of course there's a decent number of facecamping killers and salty survivors. Despite all that I still love to play this game and recommend it provided you back up your saves after you play because that lose all progress bug is naaaaaaasty. Took the devs almost two weeks to fix my account although they did give me a huge number of bloodpoints to apologize (but couldn't restore my shards so I lose out on the teachable I wanted!)

2016-07-01,0,0,136,False,Recommended,Really awesome concept for a game. Been waiting for a decent horror game to come out for a long time. I seldom deal with any glitches and crashes but I'm sure there's some wiggle room to improve this game. Some people think this game is unbalanced but truth be told I think it's mainly about luck... You can be awesome at this game or you can just be downright terrible but it honestly depends on how lucky you get. Applies to both survivor and killer. There's no doubt that there's skill applied to gameplay too but for me I've just been lucky or really unlucky.One problem with playing online with randomers is when the killer gets one person on the hook camps in front of them and the other survivors go to help said person... usually ends up in everyone getting injured/dying. Killers stop ing camping. Survivors don't go for the hooked person until the killer is lead away/isn't being a camping nut.Minus the people you deal with online this game gets two thumbs up from me. It's pretty hard to scare me but this game really gets me screaming. ) If you like horror and need a new refreshing game to play get this.,Dead by Daylight

2018-05-12,0,0,207,False,Not Recommended,"I stream this game a lot. 2 hours a day on stream every day. So I can safely say this This game is not good. This is not a well made game nor is it fun to play. It's fun for the first 50 hours and then it's just repetitive. Let me break it down here.For one thing the community is horrendous. This game turns the nicest kindest soul into a withering bowl of soup. You get into a game with a P3 (Prestige 3) Claudette with the name ""Pallet Loop God"" or some cringeworthy like that they crouch everywhere and touch one generator for about 3 seconds. What are they doing for the rest of the 20 minute match? Blinding the killer unnecessarily wasting pallets t bagging body blocking etc. They waste the killer's time and the survivors time alike. Then when they finally get caught they spam post game chat with stuff like ""camping noob"" or ""boosted killer"" or something they heard their older brother say on Xbox. These people believe that every time they have died it was always someone's fault. Also as you climb the ranks you will notice the game becoming less and less enjoyable than it seemed in rank 20. You see much like doctors and scientists rank 10's or less (ranks in this game go down to 1) all have a god complex which makes them play like booty. This is the most toxic video game I have ever played in all my years of gaming. Of course there's the killers. Killers are almost never at fault for anything they're here to murder you not be your friend. But there's this word that every gamer fears ""campers"". Camping in any game has some sort of negative connotation but with Dead by Daylight it's not unsportsmanlike cheap or even annoying. It's game breaking. In this game survivors are killed by being hanged on meat hooks which if they stay on it long enough will kill them. To get off of the hook you need to be rescued by another survivor. What Camping killers will do is stare directly at you while you are hooked. This prevents other survivors from un hooking you without either them dying or you being downed again. And it's not a question of ""will this killer camp"" it's a game of ""don't get hooked or it's gg"". For every 60 minutes you play this game (3 4 games) you will encounter at least one camper. AT LEAST. This obliterates the fear factor in this game and just turns it into another toxicity fueled show. Now I've talked a lot about how the players ruin the game which yeah of course they do. It makes up 60% of why this game is abysmal. But there's the one subject that nobody likes to talk about The developers themselves.Instead of writing a paragraph or two explaining why the devs are incompetent lazy and money hungry I am instead going to list things the devs have done/not done. Released a major game patch introducing a new killer survivor map and currency which was released on pc and Xbox. PS4 players had to wait about 12 days for the update because... well I have no idea why. Again incompetent. Prioritized micro transactions and cosmetics over bug fixes and more content. Oh hi you must be EA! Oh... no? Well what are you doing??? Neglected player feedback and continued with naive and unrealistic choices. If the killer leaves right when the game starts you will lose your item and offering. Devs are well aware of this. I suppose they think this is fine.Now listen you friend probably plays this game with 3000+ hours and told you you absolutely HAVE to get this game. As someone who used to be that guy telling my friends to get the game listen to what I have to say DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. At least for full price. This game is worth $5 at most IMO. If it costs $20 + microtransactions and they spend it on making more CLOTHES and AESTHETIC implementations then their budget is not being spent correctly. This game is buggy boring tiring repetitive and just annoying. Please don't get this game. Maybe if the devs noticed a decrease in revenue they might actually try to fix it. Evan",Dead by Daylight
2018-07-19,0,0,164,False,Not Recommended,If youre a casual player please get this game you will have a blast.Are you competitve? Read first. Are you wanting to be a low ranking survivor? Well let me ask you some questions No patience?No self control?Do you get frustrated easily?If you answered yes to any of these questions do not get this game. There are some flaws in the balancing aspect of this game that will not be changed. They have been adressed to the devs and they wont bug on hard changes. Can you get rank 1 as a killer? Sure you can. Just be ready to not have fun because you're going to be playing a game that makes you run around a set path in the map chasing survivors where once you get close enough they will perform an action that resets the chase. Is there a way around it? Mmm yes and no. If you are good at mind games then maybe you can be successful. A perfect survivor vs a perfect killer survivor wins unfortunatley.Also theres other items and perks in this game for survivors that are also uncounterable and widen the gap of balance between the killers and survivors.In conclusion killers are forced into a meta where there is only a very very very limited amount of killers/perks to play and have a chance at success. Also survivors are forced into a meta where certain items and perks are so overpowered that it wouldnt make sense to use anything else.This means that there are so many other items perks and characters that in the competitive scene go unused. This leads to little variety. The same meta has been in place for a very long time. I doubt it will change.,Dead by Daylight

I really like this game so much so let me share with you you lovely person you the ending of a game I had.In my first game as a killer I took a person down and let them take a time out on a hook.I stayed near by in the case his friends came to save him lo and behold they did. In the fray I ended up taking 3 of them down and let one get away. I killed the 3 I took down and sadly the last person decided that they didn't stand a chance and disconnected.The game ended and in the end of game lobby the man confronted me about my brilliant tactics. He called me a derogatory name that means female dog in heat to which I was responded ""what do you mean"" he responded with a few cuss words and then told me to talk to him when I got out of middle school. This confused me since I am a college student so I told him ""Why does it seem like you didn't like my tactic."" This man then responded with something I will never forget ""Because that tactic is for &lt insert insult based around an alternate name for a cat here&gt ."" then again replied with ""I hope you lose your life to a car accident"" which I thought was a bit rude considering telling someone you hope they would die should never be used so lightly.

2018-06-13,0,0,51,False,Recommended,This game is one of my favorite games. This game has a lot to offer. It is fun thrilling and intense. There are four survivors and one killer. You must complete generators to open the exit while avoiding the killer. You are warned when the killer is there when your heartbeat intensifies. You can avoid the killers by hiding in the lockers are by using the flashlight to blind him. There are many tools to help you. There are medkits toolboxes maps keys and flashlights. In order to win this game you must work together. You have to complete five generators and you can't do them by yourself. You need to help your teammates by distractingthe killer and getting them off hooks. As a killer you must hunt down the survivors and hang them on hooks. As a killer you notice all of the hooks and generators and you notice when people fail skillchecks. Skillchecks are quick time events that happen when a survivor is healing themselves another survivor doing a generator and snapping out of it. If the survivors mess up it makes a loud sound and shows on your screen where it happened. After you hang the survivors the have a certain amount of time till they hit the half way mark they need to struggle to stay alive they can attempt to escape but there is only a four percent chance that you will escape. There are a variety of killers and survivors with more on the wayOverall this game is great and I definetly reccomend it. I give this game an 8.4/10 P115_CiTC,Dead by Daylight

If the killer leaves the match it no longer punishes the survivors by dropping the rank which was one of my major complaints about the game being punished for what the killer did. I can also tell the game has been balanced. If a survivor abuses jumping in and out of the window spikes ""grow"" in the window and that survivor (and ONLY that survivor) is no longer allowed to use the windows. Killers can destroy the generators and set back the survivor's progress. Survivors and Killers both have improved perks and if you survive a match it seems like with all you do you end up getting a lot of bloodpoints as a reward. There's still people who camp but that's just them being s. I've decided to upgrade from thinking this game is crap to thinking this game is pretty decent once again. Yay!",Dead by Daylight

There are a few bugs here and there but this game is fresh off the boat and I have no doubt that every legitimate problem will be addressed. I hope that the devs don't cave to the rage quitters. I've played mostly survivor since launch (as most people are queueing up to be killers creating a small wait time to be one) and I've found that there's a fair and balanced strategy to counter every killer. Sometimes there's no getting away and that's just the ""luck"" aspect of the game. Playing as a killer can be just as challenging and each has its own separate avenues for advantages.

2016-11-20,0,0,1243,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. The concept of this game is fun but it's technical shortcomings make it an unplayable when trying to play with your friends. The lobby system is straight up broken. 8k active people playing the game right now and my group of 2 other friends and myself have been queued for 25 minutes. That's just unacceptable. This isn't a new problem either the game has had lobby issues since release and the devs have either been unable or unwilling to fix them. It's a shame because it really does break what otherwise would be a relatively fun albeit flawed game. Other criticisms incluce A completely unecessary and immersion breaking ranking system which encourages people to exploit play selfishly and otherwise ruins the tension of the experience. Numerous graphical and performance bugs which cause frame rate dips rubber banding teleporting and getting stuck on invisible terrain. All servers are listen servers hosted by the killer no dedicated servers. No server browser (forces you to use broken lobby system),Dead by Daylight

2016-12-17,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Note I play on PS4 so things may be a bit different from PC. (E.G Nurse is not that hard to counter on PS4 but she's not played that often so this is just from my experience) Also the highest rank I've got up to was rank 11 so I most likely had crap killers.I play mostly survivor and from experience I can safely say that they are too powerful. I also play a bit of killer but the problem is that it's more stressful and difficult to catch the survivors. There are many reasons why killers are underpowered. Here's some of the reasons1. Totem placements Ruin can stall the game for a bit and prevent gen rushing. The problem is that you need to hope that the totem isn't in an obvious spot (E.G near a generator) otherwise the survivors will break the totem and now you have 3 perks.2. Nurse isn't viable on PS4 The nurse is by far the best killer in the game on PC. On PS4 if you're against a nurse it's always a free win. I've heard that it's due to framerate drops when blinking.3. Survivor perks Perks such as decisive strike and dead hard allow survivors to have a second chance when they screw up self care allows survivors to heal themselves back to full health easily and any exhaustion perks besides dead hard can allow survivors to gain some distance from the killer meaning that they will have a higher chance to find another spot to loop.4. Developers constantly listening to survivor's complaints Survivors constantly complain about everything being OP. First it was Freddy and then when they made the pick up rate faster for killer the forums were filled with whiny survivors refusing to adapt. Not sure if this is true or not but I heard that when the devs considered allowing the killer to close the hatch survivors complained about the change being too OP.I know this review is not perfect so if there's something wrong let me know. Sooner or later I'll hopefully not be lazy and come back to this review.,Dead by Daylight

Also since this game has no dedicated servers and the host of the lobbies are always killers you can always get ed over by a killer having internet so that is always a fun ing time. Or when you're playing survivor by yourself and the other three randoms are bad and they get hooked and the door is open and they expect you to go get them when you can easily leave and survive and get your points/pip and so you leave cause you don't care about other people and then post game lobby and then the other survivor you didn't save proceeds to flame you and call you bad and report you whent that isnt even a reportable offence all you ing wanted was to save yourself and get points. It's not my fault you're bad and get hooked. Then it is infuriating. This game is hella better with friends because then you don't have random people reporting you for stupid so if youre a loner wanted to buy this game don't do it you'll want to die few hours into the game.

2018-07-26,0,0,601,False,Recommended,I have been playing this game for about a month now and it is highly addictive. I prefer the killer side but playing survivor is fun as well and helps me become a better killer ). Take any review you read complaining about balance with a grain of salt any game is going to need to continuously adjust as they both add more content to make the game more interesting and tweak things here and there.There aren't many games like this on the market right now the closest I've found has been the Friday the 13th game and I haven't tried that yet so I can't really compare. But I actually love it. It's tense it's fun and you can play with your friends or queue solo and have (in my opinion) just as much fun.Other reviews mention a toxic community. I haven't noticed it that much there are a few survivors who like to tease you when you mess up but that happens in literally every pvp game I've ever played. If you don't like the player comments at the end of a game you can always close the chat box but in general I don't think it's been an issue. All in all it is a great game and I'm very happy with my purchase ).,Dead by Daylight

However I have had to change my original thumbs up and defense of the game to a thumbs down with a condemnation of it. The devs are seemingly only focused on making more dlc while they let the horrendous issues with lobbies continue. Currently I am usually only able to play one match before I get stuck in a never ending loading loop every time I try to join a lobby. These issues have been present since the game came out and are still disgustingly prevalent. I would love to recommend this game as it is really fun when it works but it doesn't work and as such I can't. Lobbies are in fact worse then when the game launched. Hopefully they will one day fix the lobbies and make the game playable again but until then its a solid thumbs down.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-23,0,0,696,False,Recommended,"I've played this game for over a year now and i still love it even though there are some things that are making the game less enjoyable. They focus more on the players at rank 16 or below. So when a killer is a noobslaughterer and in highrank he's in the middle tier then the killer will get nerfed so noobs can play against him. The problem with that is that the higher rank killers can play him anymore cuz they are gonna be pallet looped the hole game. I can understand that the devs have to focus on the larger player base but they need to find a way so the killer is playable at every rank. Another negative point is that it has a lot of bugs but the devs are constantly working on that. The last point is that there are some infinite loops on some maps where the killer can't really catch the survivor.

2017-09-21,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,"I want to receommend this game but I can't There are so many great things about this game but the core of it is just riddled with frustrating game design. The premise of the game is that there are 4 survivors and 1 killer and the survivors need to start 5 start gen that will have active reload quicktime events to to either accelerate you repair or if you miss the timing window you will then damage the gen and alert the killer. It is very nerve racking playing as the survivor because you will hear a heartbeat when a killer gets close then fade away when he/she leaves. The thing that is complete t in this game is the ""looping"" (running around objects and dropping pallets) that cause so much frustration. You can get addons that will accelerate your speed to break pallets and movement speed but if the other player has addons that are maxed out they are impossibly hard to catch and it really just relies on picking the stronger killer.Buy this game on a sale if you like some cat and mouse but besides there are some hair pulling moments in this game that is built around its core design.",Dead by Daylight

2017-05-28,0,0,818,False,Recommended,"Fun game with a lot more depth and progression than the similar games on the market. Also has a number of bugs. I recently lost an ultra rare item with ultra rare add ons while using an item that should have preserved them in case of death aka the white ward. I reached out to support and let them know about it along with additional info like that I had recorded the entire match so had proof etc. and the next day got an e mail asking for some additional info. I provided that info and then noticed that they had sent another e mail immediately following the first that said my issue had been resolved! Yay! ...or not... here's the details of the second e mail verbatim ""Your request (*******) has been solved. To reopen this request reply to this email.Hi there Thank you for your information. We are currently aware of this issue with both White and Black Wards. I'm afraid we cannot restore your item. Please refrain from using them for now. I've gone ahead and logged your bug report in our database and we will get back to you if we need more information.Death is not an escape...The Dead by Daylight Team""So I was told by the developers that they know it's a problem my recorded stream won't help don't use the items that they put in the game to make it more enjoyable and I've been added to the list of bug reports.The game is mostly fun a great concept and new stuff is added fairly regularly. But this issue goes back for over 6 months from what I could find and plenty of other issues persist in the game as well for both killers and survivors. When they try to ""balance the game"" they kick it 40% the opposite way with heavy handed buffs and nerfs and everyone has to adjust to new mechanics that don't work any better than the old ones without ever addressing the actual problem. A concrete example is that killers complain about pallet looping. First fix was that a pallet can only be jumped 3 times in quick succession before being blocked but I was just in a game where a survivor jumped a pallet 20+ times with no blocking. Then when that didn't work they added a chase mechanic bloodlust that speeds up the killer the longer the chase goes on. Why didn't they just move the pallets and reshape the paths by making slight map changes to prevent the loop mechanic? They redo maps and pallet locations with updates but never seem to move or solve the actual infinites that killers hate so much. Survivor side biggest issue is face camping killers. They refuse to add a proximity timer to the bleedout for killers to dissuade camping but instead added an ""unhook from all angles"" that doesnt work at all or traps the survivor inside the hook pole and prevents any movement bugging them completely out of gameplay for the rest of the match.The game is fun the concept is awesome. But the balancing is like being on a see saw while intoxicated and the dev's really don't care about fixing the underlying issues that the player base complains about on a daily basis. I recommend the game but really dislike how it's been handled since release. You definitely get your monies worth but you get plenty of frustration for free to go along with it. By the time you finish the grind of prestiging your killer/survivor to top level and have all the fun perks... you realize you play find a lobby simulator and infinite tag more than the rest of the actual game.",Dead by Daylight

2017-09-15,0,0,219,False,Recommended,"TLDR I LOVE the game obviously by my hours but seriously devs chill with the obvious killer favortism.With that said this is a conflicted review. I love this game but I REALLY don't understand the devs. They have stated in the past (""we want to break the game with this killer the killer being The Doctor "") and with their updates consistently display HEAVY favortism towards the killers and dissuade playing survivor.I love playing survivor because for one I think it's the most fun and rewarding juking the killer and leaving them in the dust. Survivor is the most fun to me but they make being the killer SOOOO easy. First off the killer is always host. Automatic advantage. But also the devs constantly are buffing the killers and nerfing the survivors. Killers 2 Survivors 0.I understand it's 4 survivors vs. 1 killer but when the killer can down 4 survivors within 5 minutes of gameplay no matter what killer you play whereas it takes survivors about 20 minutes to get all 5 gens up it get pretty annoying. ESPECIALLY when the killer decides to ""face camp"" or ""slug"" the survivors with face camping being EASILY the most annoying strategy of them all then the devs just say ""It's a legitimate strategy"".",Dead by Daylight

2018-08-06,0,0,21,False,Recommended,"*DISCLAIMER* I play through family share on another account so the hours I have are slightly misleading.This game on both sides of the coin both survivor and killer are fun. With the most recent update from the developers I feel as if the game has become truly balanced killers that were weak are stronger and more fun to play and that same perks were taken no matter the killer aren't needed as much anymore (I'm looking at you D Strike.)Survivors feel better to play and more rewarding as well. Instead of looping the killer around the same pallet or same set of ruins for minutes on end while my teammates hastily complete generators and where hiding from my killers was practically impossible it feels...better now. While a distraction is still neccessary on a team of survivors it feels better to play as the stealthy survivor instead of being a detriment and a weight. And it feels nicer to have a wider range of perks to pick from instead of the same 4 over and over again. I can go for a more altruistic line up focusing on saving and taking hits for my teammates or go for a distraction lineup looking to stall the killer long enough to get out. Or even a stealthy play around the killer type of lineup where I simply use all my perks to actively avoid the killer while doing generators. I feel like I don't need D Strike anymore simply because my escape options are better now or options to avoid the killer all together.On the other side of the coin killers feel much much better to play than ever before. The perk buffs along with the various buffs to killers and such make it to where knowing how to play one of the Trio of Meta (Huntress Hillbilly Nurse) isn't needed anymore if you want to climb ranks. Sure it's still recommended mostly because they're really good killers because of how fast they can stop chases and such but it's not needed. Your options are much better in terms of killers due to the various buffs that the Hag and Trapper got as well as general buffs to the killer like the pick up time or general nerfs to survivors like exhaustion cooldowns stopping when you run. Not to mention the various buffs to underground or not used killer perks like Bitter Murmur or Sloppy Butcher to make them optional choices.If you had asked me before the mid patch update if the game was good enough for the 20$ price tag there was a decent chance I would've told you ""no the game is horribly imbalanced. If you like wasting time and just waiting for a skill check to pop up which scares you more than a disfigured chainsaw wielding murderer then yes."" However with the new changes new balancing and the new perks which I didn't even talk about as well as the new killer the game feels amazing and refreshing to play again. So out of 10? This game now is a good 8/10.The bugs are still apparent so is the lag switching from the killers. But the core gameplay without all of that? It's fun again for both sides.",Dead by Daylight

Matchmaking can be a too . it just isnt fun to try a new killer without perks and addons just to get put together with 4 full build survivors. also a big problem is the toxic community. you cant get a real match as killer without survivor acting like cocky lil pieces of for everything you do and every form of outplay they make. also most of the killer are pretty weak to stuff like window and pallet loops. only about 4 are viable if youre aiming to win. in the end it suffer from the rng side as much as from the community who suppreses every kind of learnig or adapting and even flame you for doing so.,Dead by Daylight

Friday The 13th is actually a much better game and it is trash too. The devs just abandoned it. so good luck!,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-21,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,"Long story short its hot garbage. Entertaining to watch but really boring to play. Don't let hype draw you in.Level 1 killers will be matched with hundreads of hours players matches are insanely tilted and very rarely are close if ever.Level 1 survivors will be matched with completelyed kitted out killers seeing a trend here? DLC killers are generally more powerful and snowball way to fast. The RNG in this game is so real I rarely see skill come into play... if ever. The netcode is laggy at the best of times and easily abused by the host (Killer) personally tried lagging my match out when I got near survivors and made it stupidly easier to get them.The maps are horribly unbalanced I honestly don't think there is a coherent design to them speficially Killer will just get dicked on certain maps and become impossible to catch anyone. Vice versa some maps certain killers excel on and will be able to chase players from the other side of the map.Killer perks are increadibly boring and dumb a lot of the time they take any idea of 'hunting' and just turn it into wall hacks the video game (They show survivor locations because they're doing x thing). The game forces you to play for hours and hours to get even a reasonable set of items to take into a match (Will be lost if you lose that match) so matches by nature aren't ever balanced.Fundamentally I don't agree with this style of gameplay design RNG items that make a huge impact in a match with random player level matchmaking a lot of the time just adds up to boring tilted matches that aren't ever exciting and give of the vibe that the developers are just going for the old ""You won it wasn't even a fair match but you did it and thats all that counts!""",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-18,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Fun idea. Had a good 2 3 hours of fun with a couple of friends.Though it got very dull and repetetive very quickly. I found it very annyoing that you can't rank / level up when playing with friends in private the only time the game actually does what it's meant to do. Having fun with your friends. Instead to level your characters you're forced to get into a random lobby with random people randomly running around like idiots ending up getting killed without ever getting remotely near successful in your objective.For 4 99 maybe I would consider a purchase but never in my life would I pay 13 99 for what it is.,Dead by Daylight
2017-04-30,0,0,307,False,Not Recommended,Okay so I have 155 hours. I bought the game not long after release and have been playing it ever since.At first the game was really enjoyable. It was thrilling and new. It was fun and it felt very fair. Ever since release the developers have continuously tweaked the game's balancing. Early on balancing was great because not that many people had perks but as people earned OP perks and learned how to abuse the game and easily win as survivors the developers had to tweak it. The problem is the people who are gods at survivor are a tiny fraction of the population that plays this game. But the developers can't have that happen so they make the killers better. People playing survivor get adjust and get better with experience and the devs make killers better again. Now after a ton of updates the killers win nearly every game because the devs can't allow survivors to win if they are skilled. Now the only time you will win as a survivor is when the killer is really bad or you get lucky. Since 4/5 players in a match is a survivor that means on average the game has just above a 20% win rate for EVERYONE. If you play survivor and killer equally you will lose nearly every survivor match and win about every killer match.Overall the game isnt fun because of how easy/hard it is depending on which character you play.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-18,0,0,444,False,Recommended,Saw DLC is way overpowered for the Killer (where did the heartbeat go? i'm getting smashed without ANY warning all the time). Why bring BS without a well balanced and well overthought gameplay? Doesn't make any sense for me. I'm reaching the point of playing without ANY gear because i know im gonna lose it all.

2017-11-29,0,0,729,False,Recommended,CANADIANS ARE THE BEST DEVELOPERS... EH!#Not in order#Peer2Peer Servers are Hosted by the killer.Needs more Maps Survivors and Killers as well as cosmetics and DLC.Gameplay is Audio Dependent and Visuals Play a very important part of the gameplay.Understanding the Full Mechanics of the game is important.Playing greedy can cost you.Stealth and Mind games are a feature of this game.Quickest Time to kill Killer is Nurse if your good at blinks.Killers included in the base game are on par with DLC killers but I would argue the DLC killers tend to be more fun even if worse.Survivor gameplay can be stress free as you gain points if you die anyways and chances are someone else will end up dieing instead.Play Survivors for an easier game or harder game depending on your prefrence.Play Survivors with Freinds can be more fun but queueing solo is still fun.Play Killer if your connection is very good and people that Connect to you get very good connection else stick to surviors because if lag is to bad it makes for less fun.Dont worry about bloodpoints you get them from doing any and everything.So even if that jerk camps you just let him he still gets points even if you DC while you get none.BTW Pig chic is really fun but I was hoping for a full alternative to the hook system.That Is why I was hoping there could be an alternative power to her that game her no hooks infinite traps and traps trigger from start but are paused when downed or in grab...ect. Plenty of the players are casuals that own the game and over half the games we are too busy killing each other to be bothered by high level plays. We are busy hiding in lockers or around the map acidentaly sprinting over and into obstacles geting chests and totems for exp unhooking people that result in death for exp telling on survivors for the killer to save ourselves especial in the downed state on our no hook chance or trying to give away the position of other to save our selves from the killer. There is no reason why the killer should not be able to keep rank with hooking each player once in this game or ranking up from killing one player... I feel like player reporting is affecting queue times...All DLC is worth go buy it so they can make more! but... but they lack consistency and are never updated to fill out the new consistency they should have. Like more cosmetic options based on added things.Im not allowed to use the DeadByDaylight steam forums because of death threats and there was no clear way to re approach the situation with alternative behaviour.It says the forum ban is permant. The devs insist people be locked away forever for saying somthing that hurts feelings. Now if that isnt a fate worse then death I dont know what is...This is a game that encourages people to kill directly and indirectly at times.This is a clear bias and somthing that should be noted.This being said this is going to be the last BHRV purchase I make and I will continue to buy DLC for this game. From what I have seen from the Community Management of this game Im not ok with Permabans especialy when they are relate to free speech.#Important note#Steam Support/Steam Community Managers Follow a policy of Zero Tolerance. Zero Tolerance at any level only leads to Ignourance and Hate becayse Tolerance goes both faqn ways.

One is for pointing something and the other is follow me gesture. Like seriously? After a few matches its getting really boring!

Are they all incapable of comprehensible language only to be reduced to incoherent moans?

It was the whole reason I bought the game but when I get into a lobby I always end up running into Survivors using exploits to give themselves an unfair advantage. Most notably infinite window hopping (which 1.0.2 fixed for like two days.)And if a Survivor is decent with a toolbox? Forget about it. All of your sacrificial hooks are gone in five minutes you're stuck with your thumb up your and God forbid you go onto the Discussions page to talk about it because arrogant Survivor are waiting to talk down on you for wanting a fair game.It's gotten so frustrating to the point where I've considered just uninstalling the game.

2016-07-27,0,0,220,False,Not Recommended,Loved it great game idea ruined by poor balance missing vital features and broken matchmaking / the number of people hosting servers in china. Because there's no reliable in built method to determine if you have an atrocious server host or not (people spam chat as a test which works but is frustrating and it seems anytime you forget to do it bam chinese host) I can't reccommend the title.I got my money's worth not even mad but until there's either server locks to keep people from China hosting in north america or there's some built in way to realize the host player (the killer) has a garbage connection to you it's just not fun anymore.EDIT Not sure if matchmaking was fixed or not but laggy games have been on a decline personally. They recently patched it though and it's still got a wealth of bugs to be incredibly frustrating. On top of that the killer now has some really heavy aim assist on his attacks making it far more difficult to borderline impossible to evade their attacks unless you're turning a corner (then they auto attack into the wall and are briefly stunned). To give you an idea the game has pallets which you can throw down to try and block (or stun if timed right) the killer. As of this latest patch I've stunned 0 killers successfully even those who were chewing on the pallet when it got dropped and I've been able to stun only 4 killers unsuccessfully... because the game decided their auto attack trumped the barrier between us so I took a hit anyways. Just frustrating the game was way more fun pre patch.,Dead by Daylight

Bugs glitches salt toxic community if you like this game you're not looking at the comment section. Stay away,Dead by Daylight
2016-09-30,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,First I just want to say I think the game itself is great. I can see why people think the gameplay gets stale becaue you really are doing the same thing stuff every game just with different maps however as long as view each game as its own unique experience there's enough with perks and playing all killers and survivors to keep you playing for awhile. Why I have to give this game a negative review Matchmaking and lack of dedicated servers. The devs were finally able to get matchmaking to what I would I would consider a beta state at the time of this review since the matchmaker still doesnt find you a game every time and as you'll read in other reviews trying to queue with friends is seemingly a disaster. I've also experienced a time where I was put into a game and everything loaded but I was still searching for a match. Needless to say I lost a pip and didn't do anything the whole game because I couldn't move since my client thought it was still searching. These are just a few examples.To the point of dedicated servers the game is always hosted by the killer when matchmaking. What this resolves into is that if the killer has a poor connection or presumably your locations are too far away the killer always has the advantage as their actions take priority since they are received more quickly as the host. Much of the in game lag issues could be resolved with dedicated servers in my opinion and I've seen no evidence or heard nothing from the devs to state otherwise.I sit in anticipation hoping that one day dedicated servers come or a solution for laggy killers is found along with the completion of a hardly failing matchmaking system. I will probably continue to play the game continue to rage at laggy killers continue to curse the devs. I hope one day I can change my review but sadly in today's state of rushed releases I fear this day will never come.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-10,0,0,923,False,Not Recommended,"So this game is great. It has an amazing concept unique killers as well as classics that everyone loves. Fun gameplay ideas for both sides killer and survivor alike. When I got this game years ago I was pleasantly suprised with everything about it. Yea there were bugs here and there and somethings werent exactly balanced but the game was brand new. It would get fixed right? The answer is no lol. As much as i love this game and want to say play it it's simply not worth supporting a group of developers who do not listen to and work with the community. Lately the main point for the crew has been ""new dlc hollywood killers new inovative ideas"". The game doesn't need new cosmetics and additions at the moment. It needs balance on both sides. Surivors have the end of the bug stick as they constantly have to deal with sound and exploit bugs. They have the more ""boring"" playstyle as pallet looping is basically the only thing they can do to survive and get points at a rate worth working for. And killers..... don't even get me started. I have never seen a asymmetric game that doesn't give the lesser side the advantage. So many good killer perks take nerfs and so many new killers get nerfed to the ground that at ranks 5 1 you upright can't use them and win. The hitboxes for both killer abilities and pallets are absolutely broken at times (its not fun hitting a hatchet that was clearly a miss or getting hit by a pallet from a mile away). And the wraith update.... WE WAITED 2 ING YEARS FOR IT and the wraith happens to still be the next to worst killer. WHEN DOES IT END. This game is great but their is so much more wrong with it that isnt't getting tended to. I still have hopes for the devs but with all the talk about new dlc killers and maps every few months it makes me wonder... ""when is the time to fix this game going to happen"". I recommend playing this game if you get it gifted or it you have it already or get it for free but I cannot recommend dumping more money into a company that refuses to listen to their community.",Dead by Daylight

I constantly have to reset my game because if I fail to find a game I get stuck in an infinite loading screen. The bugs can make you angry but if you overlook them the game is worth trying.

I loved the concept and i like that the developers are making new content so we won't get bored of this game.You can choose to be a survivor or the killer. You gain points to buy stuff and level up. Also there is a ranking system so you can see how good you are.Because of the ranking system the survivors are willing to play as a team more often so that's a good thing.Unfortunately there are still some bugs in the main game and the algorithm for the lobby queue is not that good. You can wait to find a lobby from 30 seconds to 30 minutes especially if you're playing on the survive with friends queue.Rating 8.5/10,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-15,0,0,36,False,Recommended,The gameplay is great and honestly gets my adrenaline pumping! But the multplayer matchmaking is sadly awful. If you are trying to be the killer you won't have any issues same if you are just joining a lobby by yourself.

But there are a few things that bug me... first is if you don't find a match u are stuck on a loading/searching screen and have to restart the game. Then once you finally find a game it could take 5 min to load in. It does get annoying but if you are true to gaming it really doesn't affect the game itself and the genius behind it.

2016-12-15,0,0,171,False,Recommended,I like the game. I just recommend If you can nerf the time limit for Michael Myers I think its to long for the insta down. other than that its a fun game you get to play with your friends and try to survive till the end fix all generators and open the gate was a good idea. Also i would like if there was a perk for the killers that when the hatch opens it only last for a certant amount of time but you can only get it by the shards.,Dead by Daylight
2018-04-14,0,0,1490,False,Not Recommended,DBD use to be a fun changelling game but I feel it has now gone very one sided and requires survivors to do a lot compete too much with each other and evade the killer for a small amount of points.It is almost impossible to pip up. This new emblem system is not survivor friendly at all. It has helped with getting surviors unhooked but it has caused too much competition between surviors or you cannot pip.There is a lot of killer camping both face and distance camping so you cannot save the hooked survior without being downed yourself which of course hurts other surviors points. Also there are so few pallets you have a difficult time successfully escaping since the killers can get faster but you cannot. Why can't you make the pallets like the hooks and they come back after 3 or 4 minutes.,Dead by Daylight
2018-04-04,0,0,83,False,Recommended,Ok let me start this off by saying I LOVE THIS GAME! And was so cool is seeing more and more people playing it. Since launch the devs have been giving us more and more and its been really exciting to watch the changes and improvements as well as content updates being added regularly. The survivors are all well balanced and have unique skills attached to them. I think we need some more room for customizing these survivors though in terms of clothing and even facial hair. Other than that they're all fun to play as. The killers are also a lot of fun to play as but there are definetly some balance changes that need to occur. For example and I probably sound like a broken record because Michael Myers I feel is still reaaaaaally OP. He can literally charge up to his tier three form and ONE hit anyone...common...ONE hit. . Ridiculous...and really not fun to play against. I've had wins against Myers killers before but maaaan is it tough. If this is a skilled killer you better just sit there and afk cause your team will be done lol. Now I'm not saying all one hit killers are terrible the chainsaw guys can down survivors in one hit too except for them they need to CHARGE up their chainsaws and theres a huge audio cue where you can try to hide if need be. Myers on the other hand does not have much indicators if he is staring at you building up that damn tier thing he has till he's tier 3 to down you in one go. Ok I've ranted long enough but there you have it. Other than those issues I love this game. It's tense its fun and when you play with friends or a good team this can be super enjoyable. It's also fun running solo as a killer against other people. I've had many tense matches against super high ranking survivors and although I'll win some and lose some it doesn't matter I'm having FUN. It's a game. Good times.,Dead by Daylight
2018-02-25,0,0,474,False,Not Recommended,"It's really a pity. I have mixed feelings about this game and have already sinked many hours into it. However at this time i can't recomend the game. The sad thing is that almost only technical things which could be easily fixed destroy the game experience in the end. I will only commented on them because you can see from the other reviews that the game has a unique playstyle which has great replay value especially with friends.Issues no Ultrawidescreen support. Moreover they work actively against 21 9 users because they consider FOV a game mechanic and removed the well known tuneables of the Unreal Engine for FOV correction on 21 9. I would be fine with that if they would've at least implemend the rest correctly but no there are no ingame resolution settings and if you play the game in standard settings on a 21 9 monitor the picture gets stretched over the whole screen leaving you with an actual penalty compared to 16 9 users. What they see on their center of vision is now in your perepheral vision. The only counter against that is to adjust your desktop resolution to a 16 9 one each time you play the game or play the game in window mode which is not supported either you have to rely on Unreal Engine command line arguments. matchmaking Finding a game takes long sometimes. They have already improved this but its still far from good. Expect 1/3 of your gametime with searching for games. P2P game The killer is the host of the game. They have no dedicated servers. Which means a) You end up with highpings and lags. Especially if you have been matched with someone from the other side of the world. The games response to lag favours the killer As survivor you get stuck in objects experience rubberbanding etc.b) You randomly loose progress if anything happens to the connection The game can't know if the killer or your system had the problem and therefore the penalty for disconnecting randomly punishes you for no reason. constant bugs the game has a funny nickname DeadByBugs. And its real. The devs seem to focus in pushing out more content instead of fixing issues. Quality control is nonexistent. How can it else be that core game mechanics stop working? Take the chinese new year event ""Heartbeat"" was broken after the patch. Everyone noticed that in their 1st game after the patch. Why not the devs? The sad thing is that this kind of bug is not the one time exception that happens to everyone sometime. This kind of bugs happen regulary.What i cannot agree to though are balancing issues which are mentioned in a lot of reviews You can clearly see that they try to balance the game for the casual player which is a good thing because it's still way to hard for new players. The first 40 hours of gameplay are surprisingly unrewarding. If you endure that i am sure you will have some fun. Especially if you use the points generated by playing killer to level your survivors and play them with friends.That said i am taking a break from the game now.",Dead by Daylight
2018-04-14,0,0,911,False,Not Recommended,Game can be fun minus the toxic community but doesn't seem like that would change since it's not based on any real reason of the game itself. You will run into complaining from survivors and killers. Survivors get punished/camped for bringing certain items into the match such as a flashlight... Killers will be provoked with swf.. I suppose seeing certain survivors and not accepting the match up helps but it would also be a good idea to reveal the name of the steam player that is hosting as the killer so survivors could also have a choice on who they would go up against. Seems fair that both parties know their competitors. As a killer it is good to avoid some nonsense. As a survivor it would be just as good to avoid certain players as well. All around the game can be fun but the community ruins it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-15,0,0,688,False,Recommended,I would say it is enjoyable but not a 200 hour game. Small bursts playing for a week every few months. There is little variantion between game typesThere are under 10 maps and it play styles mean you will focus on one charter. The difference in charaters is not signifficatn as the survior. As the killer there are huge differences in characters and each has a unique play style. THe community is vast in play styles. There are campers who reduce the 'scare' factor. Which can be a shame but you quickly learn to adapt to this. It is not uncommon to get killers who truly get in to the role. They will toy with you scare you and tease you with the idea of freedom. Those games make it worth it. I would compare the playabilty to that of Nazi Zoombies.Ques used to be a big issue it has now improved.I have a decent PC (well above 'RECOMMENDED' for this game) but game is terrible for optimization I can run GTA5 top spec but I have to run this on low specs to prevent FPS lag.

2018-03-05,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Let me start by saying that I do not play this game competitively. I do not que into games by myself hoping to level up more. I instead play with my friends in private games where perks and items are unlimited. This is where the game shines in my opinion. Playing privetly with your mates is something this game does great. It never fails to make us laugh and scream while playing together. Playing publicly I feel simply doesn't work. I've tried many times but I couldn't get into it. It's the same strats and moves over and over again if you're the villain. You down someone pick them up and throw them on a hook then you stand there next to them not moving basically denying any chance of them getting rescued. This is both boring and cheesy especially if you are playing as the survivor which is what I typically go for. All in all if you plan on playing this game alone really (and I mean REALLY) ask yourself if it's for you. If however you are getting this game to play with your friends then I could not recommend this game enough. Really fun sessions to be had here!,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-03,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,To be quite honest the premise of the game is simple and has been replicated many times. Not even that well thought out I might add. While this is the case the community is full of terrible players (both survivors and killers mainly the latter) and it is no wonder the game is dead and no one likes to play. For starters killers get no punishment for body camping whereas survivors get the bird circling them to reveal their location when then stand in one place too long or hid in a locker too long. There is no implimentation to stop killers from standing right in front of the hook so others can save the person on the hook which is quite honestly a joke. Killers get to waltz around doing whatever they damn well please and the survivors get to suffer for it. The developers of this game are hilarious to think that their game is even remotely good instead of changing things to make the game better why not just out another terrible killer (the pig) oh yeah invis was so good on Freddy lets put that on her BUT WAIT why not put an instakill on her for free that she can put on every player then pick them up hook them camp them on hook then if BY SOME MIRACLE they get free why not put the only way of getting the trap off their head as a stand alone station THAT ISN'T EVEN GUARANTEED TO WORK so that way when the killer knows the player is close to getting it off then can camp those too. What a joke of a game. Dead by Daylight could not have been a more true title because after the first week of release the game was more dead than my grandfather. 2/10 is a generous score to give this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-16,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,"tl dr don't buy this game. Just stick to watching it it's more entertaining by far. The developers don't support anyone except their streamer babies. Most of the ""positive"" reviews on here are actually negative. In real terms this game probably has one of the lowest user ratings on steam for an actual title.I could write a thesis on how awful this game is for reasons that are easily fixed or reasons that are primarily caused by the developers who just support public streamers instead of actual players.Initially I loved this game. As you can see I played for 65 hours. Now quite a few of those hours were just spent lobby jockeying which means you wait for the godawful matchmaking system to put you in a match and just hope the killer doesn't decide to leave because they're awful s. It happens a lot.No I enjoyed this game initially it's amazing to watch and I think that's what draws a LOT of the fanbase in and motivates a lot of people to purchase the game. It's so suspenseful and really engaging to watch someone if they're streaming it as a killer or a survivor. Actually playing it yourself isn't nearly as enthralling these days.When the developers are only interested in supporting the people who stream the game live (typically killers) who draw in more publicity and players and profits you see an imbalance in the game mechanics that has only gotten worse over time and has stopped me playing the game entirely. I went from playing this game for hours at a time every night with my friends to deleting it from my computer.Why? I played as a killer and a survivor. Primarily a survivor I wasn't great as a killer although it's very easy to get better. When I started playing I was a godawful survivor as well but you quickly gain proficiency and this isn't just because of character perks abilities and items. It's easy to be good at both. With each patch however more and more nerfs were aimed at survivors spurred by killers who found it ""too difficult"" to kill survivors due to sensible balanced game mechanics.The devs naturally were far too afraid to have any reasonable cricitism levelled at them by the people they wanted to protect the most to keep drawing people in. So they nerfed survivors. They nerfed their abilities their add ons and any reasonable strategy they could use against killers who already had the natural advantage by not being defenceless and being about twice as fast as survivors when they were just walking around.It became less and less rewarding to play as a survivor especially when the killers were entitled s who kept lobby dodging with no consequence.The developers would have you believe that this doesn't even happen ""Oh we got straight into a game the one time we played as survivors all you players are clearly just exaggerating there's no need to impose any sanctions on killer players at all."" A proposed change in a previous patch was to implement a longer delay for killers who left lobbies before they could start a new one. Note that the default original ""delay"" was five seconds. Yep. Also just forget it if you're playing in a group you could have a full array of survivors ready to go but you'd have to hit that tiny bullseye to find a vacant killer who didn't have any solo survivors already in the lobby. Good luck playing solo too the amount of lobby dodgers is phenomenal.Oh hackers are a thing too (here's looking at you China fanbase.). Griefers are also becoming more prevalent where a survivor and a killer know eachother and the survivor goes around following other players showing the killer where you are and sabotaging attempts to repair generators. So you know that's great for people who are farming ranks perks and bloodpoints. Not so fun for people who actually want to play.So overall I am sad and disappointed. I had some seriously amazing times on this game when it was good enough to play even with the matchmaking ""ready game"" and the lobby dodging killers. Now? No now it's too unbalanced to play and I wish I could get a refund. It's annoying when the developers openly mock the fanbase for legitimate problems and focus instead on breaking the game further just so it looks better on twitch for the killer streamers.Oh by the way? The newest killer? She teleports. Repeatedly. And can SEE THROUGH WALLS. Yep. The newest survivor? Uses her items just a TINY BIT MORE SLOWLY than everyone else. That should tell you enough.",Dead by Daylight
2017-07-02,0,0,769,False,Recommended,This is a game that's fun and exciting to play with your friends and even total strangers. Even though the bugs can drive me crazy sometimes I love this game so much and have been since the day it got released. I've met so many awesome people from all over the world with whom I was in a team with it's always a complete mystery when the strangers you're in a team with will save you when you're hooked or not. Most of the time I've seen that almost everyone is a teamplayer and many of them (myself included) even let themselves get caught after they saved a teammate from the hook in order to protect their injured teammate. Of course there are toxic people in game that'll curse you out in the chat afterwards but that's all part of the experience I guess. I know for sure that Dead by Daylight made me feel intense at times and people tend to react to that in a bad way. After all you're supposed to never feel safe while playing this game.

Surviving with friends is fun and can get you killed easliy at times but all worth it in the end. The exhilarating feeling when a good killer chasing you is dreadfull escaping is almost impossilbe using the resources around the map just stalls the killer for your team to get the objectives Without team work the game almost a lost depending how good of a player you are.

2018-05-27,0,0,326,False,Not Recommended,This is a really big hit and miss game. It has so much potential and its almost extremely fun to play. imo there is a huge balancing issue. Its too easy to die as a survivor. Obviously its possible to win but unlikely. I've been playing this all weekend during the free to play weekend period. I would buy this game if it was actually fixed. However being that it was released back in 2016 this doesn't appear likely. (,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-07,0,0,131,False,Not Recommended,Game is absolute trash! I play as both the killer and survivor so heres my honest review of each.Killer After about 4 hours of practice and understanding the game you will without a doubt be able to kill at least 2 survivors EVERY GAME without camping. Once you get even decent with a killer prepare to kill EVERY survivor almost every game without even trying. This new patch puts every killer in the strong range and most killers into the OP range. Ive been playing killers with zero add ons and zero perks the last day and im still getting 4 piece kills as huntress and freddy.Survivor You MUST BE in discord if you want a chance against decent killers. If you arent in Discord get ready for every surivor to run towards a hooked survivor due to the unbalanced points system favoring unhooking people. And then the killer will murder all of you because a majority of killers camp/ proxy camp. Or get in discord and still die because every decent killer can see everyone for a good chunk of the game. You might hear pallet looping and flashlights are OP but they arent. They are decent at prolonging death for a short while but arent great. If the flashlight isnt spot on you wont do crap. If the killer is too close you cant even use a pallet and theres still a chance when throwing it down that the killer will hit you anyways. AND the top tier killers can avoid pallets all together. AND AND AND pallets were nerfed so there are less of them. This game is a breeze as killer and super difficult as survivor. The skill curve for survivor is INSANE and still relies on luck. Save your time and save your money. This game is trash and imploding on itself to favor the Killers. They keep nerfing survivors and buffing Killers. Example survivors exhaustion can no longer cooldown if youre running BUT michael was just give the ability to insta kill everyone if he is in tier 3 even if they are perfectly healthy and running and never hooked..... Does that sound balanced?,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-19,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,This is an interesting game I've been watching gameplays since the beginning of this being out. However I've only started playing it shortly. Like many have mentioned this game has no tutorial save for few hints as you wait for the match to load. So unless you have a friend to explain every aspect of the game expect to be sacrificed quite a bit until you get the hang of it. The balance for matchmaking is ridiculous and not in a good sense. You could be starting out in the game trying to learn how to hide and escape and you face a rank one pro killer. Basically meaning you have no chance of winning. This is something to fix. Another thing is sensitivity to do actions. If two items are too close to each other you have to be super careful in order to achieve the action you actually want. Besides these two items this game is actually very entertaining with friends. This is not something I'd want to play alone even though it seems fun for the sake of communication. If you play with friends you can definitely communicate where killers generators and totems are. Which is extremely crucial as you discover in your gameplay. Without this it becomes extremely difficult but still worth the challenge if you want to play alone. Another thing to note and even though this is a tactic it's not one I particular enjoy (frankly it's horrible and I want it addressed) killers being campers. The game is much more entertaining if you don't camp the survivors because it keeps everyone on their toes. However if you camp we will literally leave the killer and the poor victim alone to complete the objectives and escape. What does this mean? One survivor one player ends up frustrated at the lack of gameplay and terrible match. I've been victim to this quite a bit and though my friends and I tried different tactics to survive this sort of killer it always ends with someone else (if not the original victim) being killed. This needs to be fixed or there should be a penalty for camping. So new players beware. And I mean BEWARE. Even though it is fun after you get the hang of it all these issues will drive people away unless there are friends asking you to play.,Dead by Daylight

Although it takes some beefy hardware to run you can modify it to make it run better. The game core gameplay varies but is mostly the same. The online killer feature and many different killers is what changes the game a bit. Although this is mostly a pay to play app store feel game. more than 50% of killers need to be paid to play.

2016-07-12,0,0,385,False,Recommended,Fun and addicting game with a few current caveats. This game has a fairly moderate learning curve. I find you don't begin getting the hang of playing survivor and winning successively until about level 30. At around this time more skills and items become available more frequently to allow you to gain the necessary 10k bloodpoints each match to gain a notch to improve ranking. Character progression and rankings are what drive repeated plays. Maps for the most part all vary game by game. The generators exits chests etc will all change each game. Some locations of things remain the same (such as any items or generators in buildings). A little work on this variety could help.At the current state the game still suffers from a variety of issues. You will be dropped from games randomly and have random crashes. This happens a good third of the time. There are also many issues where the game lags tremendously and suffers from very slow frame rates. This only happens in certain matches. For not much going on in terms of graphics or things to load this game should be a lot smoother and more stable. I have also encountered several issues in game such as my character getting stuck particular around areas that lead to a hill. This has caused me to lose valuable items during gameplay when my character was killed. I also had a game crash on me randomly causing me to lose 3 out of 4 notches in my survivor rank which was very frustrating after putting in all the work to gain them. If you quit or fail to gain 10k bloodpoints you should only lose 1 notch. I do find that one particular item the flashlight its almost completely useless. It is meant to stun the killer but I have never seen it successfully do so in any of the probably 50 or so games I have played as survivor or killer. I have used the flashlight to stun (as indicated by gaining of blood points) but it doesn't seem to have any or much effect on the killer at all. I feel the devs should replace the flashlight with something more useful especially considering all the useless add ons one spends on the flashlight.Overall though I find this game really fun and addictive to play once you get past this issue. If the devs are able to increase performance stability and continue to update this game with more items customization locales and characters they have a real gem on their hands.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-18,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Let me first start by saying this game for me so far has been a really fun experience. The atmosphere is fantastic from the music in the menus to the feeling of fear you get in a match. As far as gameplay goes I have really enjoyed myself so far. the reason I'm writing this review is in the 2 hours ive logged into the game so far I have had to use the task manager to close the game down four seperate times due to it freezing in menus. I dont want to disparrage the game its pretty damn fun but for me this is a crucial issue that is keeping me from wanting to play especially when I have to close the game and reload multiple times before I can get a match going. That said asside from this major issue I would indeed recommend this game its well designed if you enjoy horror expecially from the 80s and 90s,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-16,0,0,55,False,Recommended,It's fun and all but i do have some things i'd like to say about it first of all i have an idea for a new killer a grudge/ring like character that limps or floats around like a ghost and for a special ability she crawl like the grudge increasing her movement speed but makes her unable to hit people oh and she hits people by scratching them and if you want me to give an ability to hit while she's crawling then maybe a super short ranged up close as heck grab or something and it makes them fall to the floor and now about the damn problem i have with the game the amount of hooks in the maps is utterly ridiculous and needs to be decreased by at least 3 4 or something because every like 5 steps there's a new damn hook and that's not fair at all unless you want to make the wiggle ability increased in speed to that you can ACTUALLY ESCAPE THE KILLERS SHOULDER the fact that you can't like AT ALL no matter how fast it goes is really stupid in my opinion and the toolboxes are rendered pretty useless considering the stupid amount of hooks i forgot to mention the grudge like killer could drag players around rather than hoist them up on her shoulders that'd be a little silly to see. another idea would be adding walkie talkie's or something as an item to speak to other players in the game or a close up whisper type of thing where they can only hear you if your like next to each other.

2017-08-09,0,0,368,False,Recommended,Very fun game with alot of replayability value and would be one of my favorite games due to the new concept and interesting mechanics if it weren't for the exceedingly salty and toxic community. As I enjoy playing a killer from time to time I find that survivors are toxic and otherwise detrimental after the game is over in the chat. I don't notice this much from the perspective of the survivors however every time I play a killer I have to deal with rude and inconsiderate survivors mouthing off while i try to be a good sport.,Dead by Daylight
2017-08-09,0,0,85,False,Recommended,"This game has some issues but it's pretty fantastic. I haven't spent this much time on a multiplayer only game since Science and Industry.Survivor and Killer are both a lot of fun to play although I did prefer Survivor. Survivor XP rates could be higher it seems like Killers have it easier getting Bloodpoints each match (having played both). XP rates in general could be a lot higher the game is almost a Korean MMO with how slow the vanilla leveling rate is. There was recently a Triple Bloodpoint event (3x XP) and that even felt too slow.Maps being free to play even if you don't own the pack as long as the host (Killer) owns the map is nice but the are still overpriced.I feel like the game would have more teamwork from the Survivors end if you got more XP if more Survivors escaped. As it is if someone's hooked and the exits are up even if it's an easy save most people will just head to the exit. If you got more XP for having more people saved people would be more likely to take the extra 15 seconds to get someone else out because it benefits them.It doesn't seem to be optimized well as at max settings it utilizes far more resources than it should given how it looks and how small the tech is for the game (no AI to process only five people total and the maps are medium sized).I love how the menu music is the same theme throughout but each section uses different instrumentation. Main menu is piano Survivor screen is acoustic Killer screen is distorted guitar. The music doesn't stop when you change between these sections this is what's really cool it just flows into the new instrument for the section you're on continuing at the same part. It adds to the atmosphere very well it's a simple technique but it's really effective. Despite being a multiplayer only game that has essentially no story except for what you find in the instructions and some quotes when leveling up/tooltips it's a very immersive survival horror environment.Entering the Killer's basement is always tense. It's exciting to hear the terror radar go off (an increasing heartbeat) hide and evade the Killer's vision by constantly positioning yourself correctly behind a tree so he doesn't spot you then he runs off and you make a safe escape. Or working on a generator that's almost finished the terror radar goes off an ally baits the boss in another direction and you finish starting the generator. A favorite of mine is the escape hatches. I still haven't figured out how to open one with a key (haven't got the right key yet) but at certain points in the game there's a hatch in the ground that opens and if you find it you immediately escape. In one of my first games I was the last Survivor alive I didn't know how to play yet so I was just running around not sure what to do. The Killer started chasing me I didn't want to die so I kept running I accidentally came across a hatch and exited through it. I had no idea they existed in the game and that escape was so well timed it's moments like these that keep Dead by Daylight so compelling even though it's ""the same thing"" over and over. There are all these random mini stories that happen throughout the game through the interactions of players.A lot of people think the Huntress is overpowered but I like dealing with her more than the Doctor or Michael. The game feels really balanced. Beginner Killers have an easier time getting rewarded than beginner Survivors but as long as you get matched with at least one other Survivor that knows about body blocking/what chicken winging on the hook means/not to insta unhook the Killer is going to have to work for the kills.The most frustrating thing about the game is when you join as a Survivor get found and hooked by the Killer within about 15 seconds and die because no one comes to help you. You end up spending about 5 minutes finding a lobby/waiting for match to start/loading into match to die in two minutes and get 5k bloodpoints because of how RNG was with the placement and/or the other Survivors totally abandoned you that early.Another frustration is the item system. There are a few offerings that can be used that hugely tilt the game in either sides favor. Pitch black lighting means the Killer is going to have a really hard time finding you and the item that lets the Killer kill anyone who's downed if they've already been hooked by them makes for some really fast one sided matches. This should be given another look at.It's really good overall I'm certainly not bored of it yet but the biggest hurdle to most will be how long it takes to level up in this game.",Dead by Daylight

2017-10-23,0,0,179,False,Recommended,I honestly find this game fun it has an almost toxic community. Some survivors are great they love getting hooked a few times and no hard feelings to their killer. Other times survivors &amp killers just go all out against each other exploiting glitches body blocking and just disrespecting each other. Hey play your way but don't insult new players still learning but if there is a weak link sometimes you have to snap it. But I love seeing survivors coming together to save each other just don't farm your fellow survivors! As a killer main I love to let my survivors go which probably is why I don't rank up. The entity hates me! lol You can get 8k in every category and earn over 20k experience for it but do you get any pips? Nope. So as a killer I like to help my survivors out. This is often disliked as I mean what is a killer if not someone who kills? Why does he just farm blood points and let you leave? Well I dunno ranking system is all sorts of stupid for survivors and killers right now so blood points is all I care about but I almost exclusively ignore Sacrifice category as it tends to make survivors salty. I like my survivors sweet and tasty so many I store a few in my cellar so what? I'm not like those killers who pile up the body count and play Nurse just to get blocked. Nah I play the Doctor and he always gives out lolipops and madness. In closing If you want to play this game expect to find people who literally want you to rage who are salty about everything and will probably hook you over and over and your fellow survivors will help the killer farm you to death. I've actually held death hook people after downing them and let them struggle free just so they realize I don't want to farm them. They usually get the hint. So either enjoy the game or don't but I encourage violence with a purpose! Also screw you Entity I'm not feeding you anymore!,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-18,0,0,358,False,Not Recommended,This game has great potential and was released roughly 7 months ago. However the lack of support for game breaking issues since it's release makes me give it a negative review.For starters the Solo Survivor does not work. You must go around it by using Survive With Friends and Escape from the in game overlay and then click Ready in order to start searching for lobbies. After doing so you may join a lobby but 80% of the time you will be thrown back to a menu screen. There is a Join A Lobby button. It also does not work. If you choose it you will get a bouncing logo which is an endless loop that will not stop. This also applies to Quick Play at the main menu. You cannot back out you cannot Alt+F4. You can only CTRL+ALT+DEL and close the game manually via Task Manager. Then you can relaunch the game and try again. So Solo Quick Play and Join A Lobby are broken and have been since Day 1. That was June 14 2016. It's going on February 2017. Any questions? Good! Moving forward.Now let's say you launch the game and select SWF (Survive With Friends). Select friends to play with or Escape out to Ready up for Solo Survival. Make sure your friends are in the party before clicking Ready or you will have to repeat the process. (Or them)Now that you and your friends (if any) are in the party it's time to ready up and begin searching. This is where you either wait for 6 10 minutes before joining a party or you get a loading screen that ejects you from the party and sends you back to the main menu. Once again you must repeat the process. You will do this 7 out of 10 times guaranteed.Now let's say you get into an actual lobby (hosted by the killer). You won't know who the killer is until the match is over but that's not important. If the killer decides to not play you will be ejected back to the main menu where the process will have to be repeated again for joining a party and a lobby.... Painful right? There's more!If you're in the lobby and not all people are ready you can chat to them. Are they there? Probably not. They are most likely in the infinite loading screen (as stated above) and they do not know they are in that lobby. They cannot Ready Up. When 4 players are present (whether they are actually there or not won't matter) The Timer will count to 0 00 and thus launch the match. If only 3 people are ready the 4th will cause the game to show the loading screen to Ready Players until he/she is either dropped from the match or they have manually closed the game in turn allowing the match to proceed with 3 survivors. If only 2 are ready and the other two are on hiatus the wait will be longer and you may even be thrown back to the main menu and have to begin the process all over again. Yes again.Remember the timer counting to 0 00? If all players are ready the timer will jump to 0 05 and continue to 0 00 and the game will start. Maybe. If all players are NOT ready my suggestion to you is to leave the lobby at 0 10 and begin searching for a new lobby all over again. Yes again.Isn't this fun!? I know right? We haven't even played the game yet and we've already spent 15 20 minutes just trying to get it started!,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-25,0,0,1101,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I recieved this game as a gift and I have really enjoyed it! Are there bugs yes but for the cost and teh overall gameplay they are bareable. If you plan on playing as a killer be sure to have a decnt internet conection because you host the lobby and lag can really suck the joy out of the experience. The devs try to work on balance for this game a give and take a benifit to downside to perks add ons etc. It is a great way to try to work your gaming style with the style of others to acieve your goals and achievements.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-08,0,0,176,False,Recommended,Okay so I'm just going to be brutally honest and I'm sure most people will agree. I have never written a review before but this game has frustrated me to point where for some reason I think writing this make me feel better. The game is extremely fun. Even with all the things that are annoying I still play and play. THEY WILL FIX THESE THINGS. SO PLEASE GET THIS GAME. There is just a couple things that grind my gears. FIRST when you hit 'Find a lobby' to play solo and it immediately says 'Failed to join lobby' you're sent to a throbbing hash mark loading screen bug. Where you then have to hit control alt delete task manager and close your game. I'd say this happens 3 out of every 4 times I try to play solo. I have to hit survive with friends and then invite no one to get into games solo. Second buggy thing When I do play with friends I experience ridiculously long queue times where most of the time you'll get into a lobby and then be sent back to menus. However if you do get into a lobby and someone doesn't ready up? That is a sure sign that they will most likely disconnect and you'll start a man down against the killer. Which brings me right to the next thing. I'm tired of putting on awesome items just to find out that two people disconnected and I now have to face some try hard killer with only one other friendly. I then easily get killed losing an awsome item that I can't get back. There needs to be an item lock or save when multiple people drop before the game starts. Third and finally the last main issue in my opinion is hook camping. I know this is a 'strategy' but maybe they can do something about increasing your luck to get off the hook if the killer is within a certain distance. Otherwise players will see the killer is just standing next to you and let you die. Like I said before even though these things are wrong I still play and am very much addicted. Therefore I recommend however surely at least the buggy things will be getting fixed with next update,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-09,0,0,263,False,Recommended,"Love the game but i have a couple problems. Too many farmers in game. I rarely get into a game where the killer is a normal non farmer player. I either get put into a game with an AFK farmer or a three times prestiged killer that I stand no chance against even when I'm rank 20. The main menu has a couple bugs I have seen so far. I'll be in the survivor menu and hit the ""Join Game"" button and it will pause for a second and then the dbd loading screen will come up on top of the join game button and just stay there forever. I have to restart the game every time this happens which is more times than not. It takes about ten times restarting and pressing join again before i actually get into a lobby. Then I'll get kicked for no reason. Then it all starts again. Final Verdict Love the gameplay a tiny bit too balanced sometimes it gets boring and not scary anymore but still fun when with friends. 75/100. Higher score if menu bugs are fixed. Make better killers and survivors please. The Hag isn't fun to play as or against. Hate it. I bought the game at my dad's house and rebought Halloween DLC and 80's Suitcase but not The Hag DLC. Just my opinion but I'm not buying that again. The Hag needs a big nerf against Laurie's Stab she gets unstunned before I press the button to run away. Ever since this update I haven't felt the urge to play ever again. I'm gonna get Friday The 13th and play that with my friends instead. Hope this was helpfulFix the ranking systems and put the low ranks in low rank games and high ranks with high rank games.Fix your killers and add more variety and useful survivors.Maybe add some more game modes to freshen up the repetition of the game.Add more movie killers (like Michael Myers Freddy Krueger Chucky Leatherface Ghostface etc.) Fix the menuAdd more customization for the killers for free. No one likes paid DLC if it isn't game changing.Good Luck and I really hope I can come back after Friday The 13th and still have fun.",Dead by Daylight

2017-05-23,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,probably one of the most annyoing games ever made the killers have a huge advantage with all the update and once one gets on on you its almost impossible to get him off which leads to a 2 minute chase where you will inevitably get downed and msot likely wont be rescued.

2018-03-18,0,0,251,False,Not Recommended,I have played this game for quite some time. Invested a good amount of hours and i can say w/out a doubt the devs are garbage. They invest more time picking up licenses for killers than fixing their game. After taking a few weeks off and trying to pick it up again i realise how bad they mutilated this what use to be great game. Rank resets are an idiotic the power balance is definitely horrid and it definitely feels like they just want money now instead of a great game. The rank resets bring in a whole new migrane into every match nothing worse than playing like a rank 1 and dealing w/ new rank 20s. The only way around this is Survive W/ Friends and your lucky to find a killer that doesnt dodge after seeing a few people join in all at once. I will gladly come back when they pull their hand off my wallet and put it back on the keyboard to fix their game that most of us have spent more than enough money on.,Dead by Daylight

Even with the new patch matchmaking hangs in loadingscreen very often and I can't even get into game the menus get bugged and unresponsive and I can't get out of the game either. When it hangs you can't back out can't alt F4 can't close the game. If you ctrl alt del the game gets stuck in the background so you can't start a different game on Steam and you can't close Steam. When I get into game finally most of the time things work great but there's random disconnections for me and for others in game but that's not really a game bug. If they'll fix the loadingscreen bugs I'll buy some DLC too. Otherwise really nice game inspired by the legendary Damned on Steam.,Dead by Daylight

The feeling of actually outsmarting the killer and losing them when the find you or just plain escaping and winning the match is one of the best feelings any game has given me.Sadly though as of right now not sure if it is the newest update or what but now there is just a ton of bugs. Sometimes hard to even get to a lobby with others sometimes hard to join a match. Even once I do join a match I simply lag horrificly.

However in an attempt to suck more money out of players wallets the business has decided to take the road of creating DLC over fixing some of the major issues with the game.Quite honeslty I cannot remember the last time I played a game that either had a full four survivors wasn't laggy as sin or didn't have a bot in it... It's getting F""$%&amp %G silly now!I'd still recommend the game by all means but the Devs need to get their game together and polish the game for a more enjoyable and stable experience as opposed to shoving more killers shoddy survivors and let's face it 3 pretty average additional maps.One addition I'd make would be punishing DCers properly with time based bans instead of losing a few piddly pips per game.

2016-08-05,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun but can feel like cancer within 3 5 games. 1) Matchmaking will match you with people higher than you all the time. Some will tell you it's part of the process and that's only cause the had to go through it but didnt care.2) Loading and que's can take from 1 min to an eternity. Waiting 20 min for a que is not ok if not longer.3) Hunter may seem to be overpowered but that's just in your head. Just get his attention and wall hop back and forth 10x and see if he doesn't quit. Game may say it's geared towards the survivor but they are lying. Survivors who waste the hunters time are the mvp's. 4) Like 4 Survivors get a lot of cool perks to increase movement speed and heartbeat distance reaction. Why not go out of your way to get his attention and barrier hop to waste his time.5) While you may get points if the killer quits the game often crashes and you lose pip's when it does... Nice6) When can I level up when I play with my friends? No offense to the world but I got this to have fun with friends not hunt people nor run from a hunter I can't even taunt or joke with.7) Overall this game has not improved since launch and after reading the last patch notes it seems they did little to help other than to adjust certain perks for the top % of people who are at that level to use such perks.8) If you want to get this game honestly it will be for the long haul. If you expected it to be a pick up on occasion then this is definately not for you!,Dead by Daylight

Matchmaking is abysmal leading to hosts with horrific connection or from other continents lagging up the rest of the server. I know I suck at games like these but on multiple occasions Ive just lagged into the killers arms or thought Id escaped only to be teleported right into danger again. Window hopping needs fixing and the ranking system needs an overhaul. Ok having written the above it is a really good game and does have some great mechanics.

2018-07-04,0,0,152,False,Recommended,I like the game but it has some issues at the moment.1.No dedicated servers. The devs said that they are looking into it but until then this game has no dedicated servers which means that the game is hosted by the killer so the killer can lag so it lags the game for everybody Hard DC (when the killer disconnects normaly it counts as if you escaped but with a Hard DC it doesn't count as an escape so you don't get the point from the escape and you also lose any item you were carrying.) and more problems asociated with a game having no dedicated servers.2.Bugs. The game is a bugfest hits that shouln't register that register killers being able to hit you through pallets killers being able to hit you after you've vaulted a window/pallet not being able to pass through zones where a survior should fit through (ex. Two close trees) killers being able to edit game files in order to give them unfair advantages (ex. Speeding up the game can easily be avoided by checking the speed of the timer before the game starts) and other more minor bugs3.Community. This game has one of the WORST community that I've ever seen. Killers tunneling and camping you resulting in you not being able to do anything the whole game and not gaining any bloodpoints and emblem points thus ruining the game for you survivors running the most toxic builds in order to make your game a nightmare and BM ing you to make it even worse survivors getting you off the hook with the killer nearby in order to farm points beacuse screw you 95% of the matches you play as a killer are bound to have one or more salty survivors.Even with all these issues I still enjoy the game but it could be better.,Dead by Daylight

2018-04-24,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,"Pros since launch Lobby Simulator is fixedCons since launch Oh boy.Dev team is bad. Literally told killers to play a different game if they were frustrated.And why shouldn't killers be frustrated? The survivors have several perks that can be summed up as second chances. And boy do they have a lot of them. Nobody is afraid of you as the killer hell they survivors will outright bully you.But Jack how can a survivor bully a killer? Well I'll tell you.First up survivors are slower than you... barely. Just barely unless you're the nurse in which case they're fast. Coincidentally she's the best killer and I'll say why in a second.Survivors have access to these things called pallets which are scattered throughout the map leaning up against walls in choke points. They can drop these pallets on your face and that stuns you if it hits you. The pallet also can be vaulted over by the survivor and broken by the killer (this takes a bit and cannot be done until it is dropped.)The result of this is the survivors will do something called ""Pallet Looping "" where they run around the choke point near the pallet until you're just about to catch them at which point they drop the pallet in your face and run away usually while teabagging to the next pallet loop site.The nurse is good because she can teleport through pallets (But can still be stunned if it hits her mid teleport because reasons).Pallet loop is the big deal but flashlights also exist. You know the flare gun in friday the 13th? Imagine if it could be used multiple times. That's the flashlight. See when you pick someone up to carry them to a death hook you can't move. So if someone shines the flashlight at your face (even if you can't see it) you will be stunned blinded and drop the person.On top of that you know the pocket knife in F13 that lets you instant escape jason? Yeah that's a perk in DBD. Everyone runs it. Also you have to take them to a hook to kill them (barring very specific circumstances) and they have to stay on it for a while in order to die and yes the others can pull them off.TLDR the Killer is insanely frustrating. Nobody is afraid of you. At all. You are the object of contempt.",Dead by Daylight

2016-09-14,0,0,103,False,Recommended,My review is untraditional and focuses on an aspect of the game some people may not have even considered. Dead by Daylight is a survival horror game where you can take on the roll of a survior or serial killer. At the time of this review there are four serial killers however I find myself only using one for one particular reason. The Trapper is the killer of my choice because he is the easiest to use when trying to convince other players you are friendly. Instead of playing the game as I am supposed to (which is extremely fun) I found even more enjoyment in not killing at all. When a player trusts you you can follow them around and they will follow you around. They might try to get you to hit them so they can heal each other you can put down traps and let them disarm them they might have you walk into traps. All of these can earn you both points so it is beneficial to everyone. In truth I bought this game to compensate for the wait of the Friday The 13th game I would not recommend buything this game if you are looking for a substitute for the Friday The 13th game but I would recommend this game in general. Playing the game as intended is just as fun as my method and I enjoy running around as a survior doing everything I can to live. One final note is that if you get this game I would recommend using a controller playing as a killer with mouse is fine but a survivor with the keyboard is a quick and easy way to hurt your hand.,Dead by Daylight

HOWEVER it is still a great game I would recommend this but there cons outweightt the pro's unfortunately.Pros The game is interesting and always keeps your attention whether youre the killer or the survivor youre bound to enjoy this game. There are unlockables and daily challenges which is always a nice feature in games. and lastly no one likes anything better than to pgrade your character. i like the idea of the Blood web and since its so random its actually balanced.Cons The queues are really messed up im sure theyll get fixed but at this time it takes forever to find a game as the killer and its even harder as a survivor with queue times usually at 10 minutes for myself at least. The game bugs quite a bit. sometimes it queues you with people a much higher level than you which is really annoying when youre brand new at the game and you get rekt right away. and lastly How are you supposed to know your way around the maps..? there are nothing to indicate where you are unless youve played the game long enough it would be nice for it to e friendlier to new players.Anyways the game is fun despite the downsides and i do recommend it to Survivalists and hunters alike &gt D,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,534,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight is fun overall but they need to fix some things for it to be really fun. First the main thing that they should work on is the fact that to que up with your friends and face a random killer it is not auto matchmaking. you have to continually hit the ready button untill you find a match which takes a very long time and gets very annoying after awhile. next they also need to fix the hitboxs that the killer can hit. It is annoying when the killer can hit you while they should not have been able to. Those are the main problems that they need to fix with the game but they also need to get a better anti cheat system because very often i would run into a killer with walls which can see survivors through walls and through the map. but even through all of thos problems it is still a very enjoyable game to play.,Dead by Daylight

They want 4 kills every game and complain about any survivor perk as being ""crutches"". Don't you dare ever bring a flashlight into a game god forbid you have SOME fun in this boring bland game where all you do is throw pallets down that you get hit through anyway and run into boarded up windows. killers have aim assist and terrible hitboxes so the only way to actually waste their time or maybe win a chase is to learn a toxic boring monotonous method called ""pallet looping"" where you run around a pallet looping the killer for 20 seconds then moving onto the next one *yawn*. Take a flashlight and save a fellow survivor or blind the killer to actually manage to escape them? Don't worry as soon as they catch up to you they'll just hook camp you and proceed to call you a ""toxic swf"" player. The only thing that makes this horrible game playable is an exploit where if you disconnect your internet you don't lose your item or depip and can in fact pip regardless of dcing. This is because the game doesn't even have dedicated servers and actually goes off the killers ping which totally makes the game in their favor as they're the power role and are at the mercy of their third world internet connection. Devs are a joke and the game has more bugs than alpha games i've played and it's finished and been out for almost 3 years. Also in these roughly 3 years the game has literally no new features it's the literally the same. All they did was add new killers which have unique powers and survivors which feel very ordinary and not unique because you can just get teachable perks and run perks from another suvivor on a different one and they don't have abilities or anything. No new items no new win conditions suvivors are plain and don't have abilities.

2018-12-02,0,0,276,False,Not Recommended,This game is the most unbalanced game I've ever played. As soon as the killer decides to play to win not to be fair there is nearly a zero percent chance of survivor escape. It's annoying. The devs got their butts kicked in a public match playing killer so they overcompensated by making it really hard to escape. They never really nerf killers they only slightly buff survivors but the point is the rank doesn't matter once the killer starts facecamping proxy ing or tunneling. There are people who are incredibly good at survivor (insert twich streamer here) but they are the best in existance. For most everyone else playing the game is infuriating with almost zero redeeming qualities. I used to like this game but once I realized it was completely based on whether or not the killer felt like destroying us it became much less enjoyable. *Also you can report people in the game for cheating or abusing game mechanics but trust me they don't do anything. The devs don't care about their community or the gameplay they just release as many DLCs as they can get their hands on. Truly disappointing and tilting.*,Dead by Daylight

At the end of the week he had 200 hours &amp I really didn t understand the game at all. I had 10 hours. The game in my opinion was horrible there were way to many hackers. Almost every game I used to run into one. I stopped playing until about a month ago after I gave up on F13 Bc the community is extremely cancer &amp trolly. I mean this community isn t any better but hey At least you cant get ran over or have a lot of toxic mic spam. This game has come a long way &amp still needs a lot of things to be fixed about it has a lot of bugs. I could go on with that but I won t Bc it s just little things like the teleporting behind the pallets you just threw down so you don t get it or one time I was healing on the meat packing map &amp teleported into the wall &amp couldn t get out the killer was nice enough to DC so I wouldn t depip. The ranking system is trash. Rank 1 5 survivors shouldn t be getting rank 18 20 killers. Vice versa. I main survivor &amp I think the way ranking is kinda sucks we re 7K is safety 10K is pip &amp I can t remember what a double pip is &amp I don t know what killer pips are Bc I never play killer only for rituals. This game just needs Devs that will fix the bugs people are having ASAP not never or months years later I m sure that s all we really want the Devs to listen. Overall addictive game &amp besides the bugs its fun to play with friends &amp amazing Concept. 75% recommend I would watch YouTube videos on it before you get it. &amp remember EVERYONE sucked at gens &amp looping/360 s in the beginning.

2018-01-02,0,0,302,False,Recommended,Pretty damn good game after updates and changes to some perks there is still issues surrounding the game but I mean what game doesnt have its issues. Overall I have encountered no game breaking stuff or anything that has made the game less fun. Killer can be agrivating at first but you learn as you go and gain new perks and get better. Overall I give this a 8.5/10. Fun to hop on every now and then.,Dead by Daylight

2018-12-12,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,Let me start by saying that DBD is not a terrible game. In fact the only reason I chose to not recommend this game is because there's no option to sit on the fence.DBD is an asymmetrical survival horror game like many other multiplayer games of the same genre.Also known as a glorified game of hide and seek.Simply the reason I dislike this game is its ostentatious sense of repetitiveness. Now you could argue that all multiplayer games are repetitive DBD's core objective involves restoring generators to a working state by completing skill checks such as the objective of a multiplayer shooter is to fend for your character's life.However I find that the repetiveness of other games can be overshadowed by constant action. DBD's action virtually only consists of Killer/Survivor chases but even then it feels like there's something lacking. The chases are not exciting just as much as sitting on a generator for five minutes pressing SPACE occasionally is not exciting. I believe this game is tedious and requires a developed virtue complex. Maybe the only reason I can't enjoy this game is because I'm not patient enough.Now I'm writing this review from the perspective of the Survivor. I cannot comment on Killer since the few matches I played I was horrible and could not truly apprehend the fullness of the gameplay. But even as the 60 or so hours I have on Survivor I cannot recommend it.Of course I cannot say whether you would like this game. DBD has its flaws but as I said when I started the review this is not a terrible game. It's enjoyable enough for a cheap thrill.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-23,0,0,74,False,Recommended,At first I was quite skeptical of getting this game because I heard it gets tedious after a while but when I played it I enjoyed every second. I personally don't like playing this by myself so I recommend that you play it with friends because it's much more fun that way in my opinion. Occasionally you'll get killers who do some stupid camping t to win which is unfair as but other than that I think this game is actually a lot of fun and I definitely recommend it!,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-11,0,0,733,False,Recommended,I have played this game for what I believe is quite a big amount of hours now and I absolutely love it.However I play a lot with my friends and we are often more than 5 people who therefor can't play together. Therefor I would like you to make it so that you can play as more than 5 people in Kill Your Friends. Aslong as you are playing with friends and not online it can't harm to make everyone able to join and as i have seen in the past when the game was bugged it is pretty easy to balance the game around a 1v5 or 1v6 not to mention extra killers. I know that it is easy to do this and I believe that it would make a larger part of your community happy to be able to play with custom rulesets like this.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,162,False,Not Recommended,"*Edited Review*LIST OF GRIEVANCES BELOW(A lot has changed since launch this review addresses current concerns over the game)This game is very intense and rewarding when played at low levels. It's most fun when everyone is trying to figure it all out the chases are scarier the killer is just as likely to miss you as hit you and everyone plays fair.However at higher levels the game may become more predictable and definitely more frustrating for either side. Here is a bullited list of contreversies within the game as of now. SURVIVORS twitch streamers have started a ""playing survivor only"" trend meaning a large amount of survivors complain only having played 50% of the game the ""teachable"" perks are still must haves and make the game a living hell twitch streaming has also promoted tbagging taunting and other BM ""Survive with Friends"" squads (people playing together) can communicate giving a huge advantage which was not the intention when developing and was only added to persuade people to buy more copies declining Killer population makes waiting times for survivors longer the grind for levels is absolutely nutsKILLERS some Killers have never played survivor and complain having played only 50% of the game a couple perks are must picks to counteract survivor teachables making rounds more predictable some killers are less versatile than others meaning you are less likely to play well roundedly very unfun due to unsportsmanlike survivor tactics and having 4 people BM you after most matches Nurse's teleport is essentially an ""undo mistake button "" and easy to master after a little practice the level grind is still nutsDEVELOPERS definitely pandering to survivors possibly due to more copies sold for it (no new addons for killers little to nothing done to stop ""infinite"" chase spots taking survivor complaints a little more seriously and dismissing killers) do not take critical questions during Q&amp A seriously such as the above concerns do not seem to understand how hihgh ranking play works as evidenced from streams and knowledge of problems lack of experience with games requiring feedback may explain some of these issues (majority of the Behaviour has developed small mobile games or ports such as ""Doritos Crash Course"" or liscensed disney mobile games) This game is fun and I am going to continue playing it but I would consider checking back later if you want to purchase it. It has a great premise but not a very solid execution and some competing titles (Jason the XIII game Last Year) are aspiring to do similar things.",Dead by Daylight

2018-11-08,0,0,217,False,Not Recommended,Pretty Good Game so far. But the game need way more balance patches and fixes it baffles the mind what sort of idea the developers had for this game. Since release game was buffing survivors to a point of people leaving the game situtation got better since half year ago but this game has still a lot to change in order to be considered balanced. Survive With Friends breaks the game completely making communication simply the best out of game perk ever knowing where killer is what is he doing and telling locations of basement and hatch game was not thought out well with groups in mind and breaks game completely. Not to mention Behaviour iteself does not play their own game and they are out of touch with balance because of it.Maybe when they have some QA and some gaming testers then we can have a product worthy of purchase.,Dead by Daylight

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.*update as of 24/09/2016the new matchmaking update is WORSE than the previous. they've penalised camping with less ponits that's good but I still spend more time looking for a match than actually playing. game's so repetitive it's getting boring. btw customisation shouldn't be paid for...*update as of 05/04/2017gave it a new try and still the same crap. waiting in lobbies for hours hosts disconnecting killer's camping laggy games... I say it again DO NOT BUY THIS GAME*update as of 12/07/2017matchmaking has significantly improved but there's still room for improvement. the only way you have guaranteed play is by playing as killer though. I can start recommending the game...*update as of 10/03/2018ok this does it what the is going on with the lobbies? i can't ing get on a single game to play before the host disconnects! and 2 out 5 matches it's a 1v1 you dumbasses! what are you doing with all the money you're getting from every single DLC?

2017-11-06,0,0,1109,False,Not Recommended,Yes it has it's downsides like turning the game away from fear/stealth into more looping around things but it's still fun and still kept me hooking for hundreds of hours. A bit of a grind but you can sure tell the difference between someone who knows the game and one who doesn'tEdit As of 11/10/17DBD has shown that they want to change what they previously say they choose to ban a program that they feel isn't good with their game after they had whitelisted it for months. This is something a lot of the player base used for various reasons and instead of asking the player base what they wanted they choose to remove it from the whitelist and eventually be banning people for using it. I do not agree with this change and to try and force this kind of change makes me not want to play the game until they resolve this issue. If they choose to not respond to my forum post or to keep their ground then this review will remain negative since I will no longer be able to fully recommend the game. Already the Dev team don't listen to their players concerns as a whole the people with hours and knowledge of the game get swept away by randoms with very few hours the same with bugs that are fully detailed with video and descriptions of why it's happening get overlooked and never fixed even after countless times of reporting it. I feel that they do not actually listen to all of their player base and do as they wish which I can not stand behind.,Dead by Daylight
2018-02-15,0,0,58,False,Recommended,I THINK WE DID A UHHH. PRETTY GOOD JOB.You're going to see that a lot. As this game has had its fair share of bugs. BUT DONT LIKE THAT STOP YOU. Currently the game in its state is not riddled with bugs. Granted it isn't 100% balenced but really looking at it logically balencing a game that revolves around a person in power versus four people who are practially helpless is quite hard.This game with friends is some of the best fun you will ever have and beyond a doubt will be better than f13. Solo is just as playable as their isnt voice chat anyways and it allows you to get better at playing the game. It takes time to gain knowledge on how to play and is basically all reads and will only scare you for the first 10 20 hours then it becomes a normal game.Definitely a 8/10. It loses two from balencing issues but still addicting enough for me to get my moneys worth plus more. Even more worth it if this game goes on sale.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-28,0,0,234,False,Recommended,So I recently went back to the Dead by Daylight page only to find I had left a negative review. And I have to say they have adressed nearly all of the issues I had with the game since then. Though the game isn't perfect most of its problems stem from the community which is much better than just having a broken game.There's not a whole lot of in game glitches. They happen from time to time but I haven't gotten stuck in a wall/hook since October of last year which is a major improvement from the game at the start. Also a system has been put in place to try to catch cheaters and to report people who engage in toxic behavior. THE DEVS ARE LISTENING!Though I question the pricepoints of the DLC packs I have to say that I'm impressed with how much the devs are pumping out good content for the game. Aside from the whole second chapter every single one of them has been of high quality (in fact they keep getting better). And on top of that the devs have stated that they are going to redo the entire swamp map and have buffed the hag since release to make her not entirely useless.I can't say how glad I am that I stuck with this game. Though I have to say if you do go to buy it be prepared for a somewhat toxic community. There are issues with the game like I said but again most of them come from the community. Though it sucks and I don't always have a good tiem with the game when I play it I don't think it's fair to fault the developers for it.Oh and the 1.5 update optimized the out of the game so that it actually runs well on my card even on bigger maps DOverall I give it like a 7/10. It's more fun when with friends but if you're looking for a grindy asymetrical MMO type game to sink your teeth into this is it!,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-01,0,0,1420,False,Not Recommended,I am playing Dead by Daylight now for around 900 hours.The game is an up and down all the time.If you have a thick Skin and can handle rude toxic and rage. You re good with this game.Dead by Daylight is a competitive Game so there is really much salt and toxic in the community.Now let s go to the Game itself.The Developer spends much time into the game to bring it forward. They are all the time trying to balance the game. Well in the end it s not really working one side is all the time complaining they are weak and the opponent side is to strong. That s true on one side but they do rebalance things and so it changes on some point and then change back. Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 Multiplayer game.That mean s there are 4 survivors playing against 1 killer. The target of the killer is killing them all and the survivors have to do 5 gens and open the exit gates. They most common key for survivors is to play in a team sadly many don t do that so there are a bunch of PERKS you have to have. (Self care is a must have). It is frustrating sometimes if the full team dies because of no team play. But well just join the next lobby and try again )Killers are Alone on their journey to kill the survivors in low rank killers are really overpowered and you will die lots of times but it doesn t mean anything you get blood points to get better perks and stuff. In high Rank well then Killers are really hard to win against skilled pallet loopers and peeps using 369S and met builds. But in the end if you don t care about a full 4 man kill round or every single game an escape it s really funny.I would all of you suggest just ignore the after chat when the hate and insulting rage starts . Well since it is a competitive game peoples get mad pretty fast.Well and there is one thing you will face in the game pretty often Camp Killers they park their avatar right in front of your face makes it impossible to unhook and rescue you from the hook. In that case the one on the hook is well fkd up.Pros of the game + really good game concept+ every single game has his own flair and thrill+ Graphics are really amazing+ very cool atmosphere + Perk system (teachable perks you can use later on other characters)+ Offerings to give each game a own flavor+ Dev s are really into releasing new content and fix bugsContras of the Game Sometimes long lobby waiting times balancing (low Rank killers to overpowered high ranks the other way) if you face a skilled Nurse your 90% of the time Dead Matchmaking is terrible since the release of the game The Killer ALWAYS host the game it s an P2P game so if you are into an killer with potato internet or you face a Region hopper your game will LAG so much sometimes it s impossible to play. No implemented Ping indicator to see if the others lag or not you need to use a 3rd party tool called MLGA (Make Lobby s Great Again)Awesome Game with the potential to get addicted !,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-12,0,0,38,False,Recommended,"It's a pretty fun game the community has a bad rep but can actually be some pretty cool people offering tips to newer players and providing a generally positive atmosphere.Playing as a survivor can be genuinely terrifying when up against a solid killer when you just get started but that novelty kinda wears off after a while and it feels like a slightly spooky game of hide and seek. Still a very fun game of slightly spooky hide and seek though.As a killer you end up chasing people around and running in circles a lot trying to smack people and give them to your tentacle god thing. This tentacle god thing will only accept people if they're served to him on hooks because reasons. It's pretty fun if you're into that sort of thing (no judgement).The gameplay can get pretty repetitive after a while and at higher levels people start employing the same strategies over and over (because they work) and then things start to get even more repetitive. Plus the progression system is really geared towards frequent players so you won't be as effective a killer/survivor if you don't play a lot.There's a solid variety of killers to choose from with wildly varying abilities while the survivors have some differing traits while still feeling fairly similar. They all still repair generators and try not to get smacked and sacrificed.All in all it's a pretty fun game to play once in a while so the gameplay doesn't get too old but it does incentivize you to play more if you're into that sort of thing.tl dr community's actually pretty nice survivor gameplay is spooky for new players but becomes less spooky over time killers are ""It"" in this game of hide and seek gameplay gets repetitive progression is geared towards frequent players pretty fun 6.5/10.",Dead by Daylight

It would make sense if there were also survivors with similar lvl to killer's but NO you play with same noobs as you who don t even have perks.Its been a while since I have writen this review and game has changed... for worse. Devs just make game easier for killers and harder for survivors. Some killers are super unbalanced like Doctor who is op AF.

2018-11-17,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I am a fan of RTS games. When developing them a lot of time is spent making sure that the different units on different teams are properly balanced so that one team dosen't have an unfair advantage over another. From playing a few of these games I came to the conclusion that game balance and play testing was something that was taken seriously in the industry. Then along came Dead by Daylight!The developers seem to be randomly buffing and nerfing different perks and features of the game without playtesting any of this with real players or games. Combine that with sometimes poor communication with players and it is easy to become lost on which features work like they should and which have been nerfed (flashlight!). Perks change as well and there is no clear communication on screen as to what they do. This results in the player thinking that they are hidden and in fact the killer has a big ol' glowing outline of where you are on screen. Lots of deaths due to you thinking you are hidden and are not or that what you are doing is going to bamboozle the killer and they completely ignore it and cut you down. It sucks. Players rarely seem to team up sort of like playing Team Fortress 2 on a public server. So what should be a collaborative effort against the killer can turn into a five way brawl which again up ends the gameplay mechanic.Combine this with some mildly toxic behaviour and it's a real joy to play. Survivors disconnect when they don't like the setup or it looks like they are going to loose. This means that you are now one or two players down. The Killer can disconnect when it appears that they are loosing and the whole game is gone. One more minor point whoever built the props like the hooks in the game? The look terrible no I mean REALLY bad! Like they were made by a preschooler with Quake Army Knife and MS Paint kind of awful.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-25,0,0,308,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight combines the horror genre with a moderately decent cooperative experience and multiple challanges. Although the survivors have a natural advantage over the killer the developers have been slowly working towards balancing the two. Both survivor and killer are an enjoyable experience and provide unique experience. The developers frequently offer new DLCs which include a killer and a survivor sometimes from pop culture horror flicks. The game may grow repetitive but the DLC and new combinations of perks often spice up the gameplay. The primary downside to the game is its community as it is often toxic.In short if you are into horror and have a group of friends to play with Dead by Daylight will be amazing addictive challenging and of course horrifying.VERDICT 8.5/10,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-16,0,0,106,False,Recommended,so after about 200 hours of gameplay i come back to this game and start enjoying my self. And when i came back to this game i had about 6 rituals built up. I completed them all got around 650k blood points in the process and then i quit the game (not using al f4 normaly using the quit opton) and when i returned the next day my blood points were gone (including the ones i had saved up before the rituals) loosing around 1.2 million blood point. The worst part was that the rituals were gone too so i had no way to get my points back. I love this game and have recommened it to all of my friends but at the momment its unplayable for this reason. I'd like to request a refund of my 1.2 million blood points and im sure im not the only one this has happened too so please hurry and fix it. Thanks.

2017-07-18,0,0,1974,False,Recommended,I don't think I can give this game a good or bad rep. The devs admit to camping most killers admit to it and the killers seem to be idolized more so than the survivors. I will say that pallet looping and/or infiniting (360ing the killer) is happening often but that is because killers tunnel they camp and they make it to where those who barely start playing don't want to play anymore because their first survivor game is face camped proxy camped smacked right after getting unhooked and other survivors not willing to help. So they go to killers where they mimic their first rounds or so killers and camp tunnel sandbag and farm. The devs do nothing about it and I won't be told by Killer mains that it's bull shiz. Some killers don't do all that but heck at this point they have no choice because now killers don't even rank up unless they sacrifice half the team. Camping and tunnelling is a must. These recent patches are and nothing will change how I feel. I worked hard to get to rank one but now don't have a chance because killers have no choice but to kill. Then like I said survivors pallet loop and infinite killers (I am guilty of it to) but that's because we feel as survivors is that is the only way to survive when we are getting chased the entire game and don't get to do a damn thing otherwise. It's a bs game that is slowly but surely dying. It's not bad but it ain't good either.,Dead by Daylight

With some needing more stealth and other needs more running. I wanted to make this review because right now people are saying this game is BAD because of the new killer freddy. Freddy is not op in any way. It hurts me to see that people are saying he is overpowered i play both freddy and survivor. He in my opinion is one of the WORST killers in the game. Yes he is invisible but when he finds you you have 7!!! seconds till he can even hurt you. All you do is find a pallet or window. People just don't want to learn how to play a new killer. If you want to buy this game. Don't look at the reviews and op killers and stuff like that. If anything is overpowered its the teamwork of really high rank survivors who can make the killers life horrible. This game is amazing buy it and learn to play it. Its not a game that you willl pick up and be amazing you need to learn. Once you do you will have a great time. I highly recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight

Teammates will completely ignore you being hooked and do objectives while you buying them time dying on hook.

2018-11-23,0,0,667,False,Recommended,This game is way more fun than I thought it would be. There is some hostility/toxicity in the community but it's mostly because it's designed to pit survivors vs killers and it fosters that mentality. The game is constantly being updated with new content both cosmetic and maps/characters and they have a F2P like model in place where you can earn in game currency to unlock characters/cosmetics that you could also buy. Some cosmetics can ONLY be bought and some characters are licensed so they also can only be bought. All in all I highly recommend this game it goes on sale very frequently (50% off at the time of writing the review) and anyone on the fence should at least get it while it's on sale. If you do buy it I also highly recommend buying the trademarked/licensed bundles if they are also on sale as well. Most of the survivors/killers that you unlock are very valuable/fun and since you can't get them through in game currency you might as well grab them while they're discounted. The following are the ones I urge you to buy The Saw Chapter Leatherface/Cannibal Nightmare on Elm Street and The Halloween Chapter. The rest of the bundles/characters can be unlocked once you play the game enough.,Dead by Daylight

2019-01-09,0,0,62,False,Recommended,"Okay.I needed some time to get my mind right before I wrote my initial review. After careful thought and consideration here's what you're going to get. Let's start with the bad because it's always better to end on a good note. The game tends to have inconsistent connections. (Now before people with a solid bajillion up/down speed jump into the comment to fight me with pitchforks and Velveeta cheese blocks yes I am aware that the best connections are wired. Yadayadayada.) Lag spikes are one thing. It's incredibly frustrating as Hell to see that you made an escape for a moment from the killer and you get sliced to bits all because the game finally caught up and gave you a stable connection. Thanks. Or who doesn't love going for a hooked survivor and realizing that what you see on your screen (unhooking of the survivor then promptly letting them go) is actually not what is actually happening (you standing like a goofball near the survivor with the prompt reminding you that you can actually unhook said person) Have you ever got into a nice groove with skill checks? Yeah me either. So just when you need that skill check to heal to do a generator whatever players will hope with all of their glory that lag doesn't poop everything up. The game crashes more often than it should. One of my aboslute favorite (not) moments of the game is having a decent loadout a competent team and then...the game freezes. I understand that at the time of my review (9 Jan 2019) it is indeed winter time. I don't think that necesarily explains the frequent freezing. All terrible jokes aside this happens more often than it should and really takes an otherwise immersive experience and makes it rather...sucky. If you want to know what it's like to be in a toxic environment give Dead by Daylight a try. What makes the mechanics of the game really rewarding is when the survivors work together. Anyone not looking to help others during the game is toxic (there I said it) as the game often favors the killer. I've played with players that will walk around all game never thinking to work on generators but will carry their medkit around and heal themselves when they get hit. Or how about the person that hasn't been hooked once never thinking to sacrifice themselves for a moment just so a person on hook 2 can buy some time and rethink their strategy? Yup it happens. I mentioned earlier that the killers have an advantage. They do. Still some players feel the need to cheese the game. Sometimes you'll play a game and players will disconnect before the round starts. Instead of thinking to at least help the disadvantaged survivors farm bloodpoints on a map that asks you to fix five generators on a map that's either too big for anything less than four survivors to do or too small to avoid being detected to begin with. Remember that time you worked your butt off to escape via hatch and the killer camped the door so you couldn't escape? I love that part (no I do not). Legion at the time of this review is OP. New players and ""experienced"" alike can glide through the game with no challenge at all and kill everyone with ease. It's a nice pick up of BP per game so why wouldn't people do it? Unless I'm missing something the lack of in game voice chat/support is surprising and disappointing. I understand not everyone is privy to it but to not even have the option at all is kinda suck.Now for the good.+ While the game puts survivors at a disadvantage careful planning teamwork and communication can and will often get you out of tough spots. Naturally someone is going to die as a survivor. New players be prepared to die and die often. At the same time gaining more knowledge on the pacing of the game how you should play etc. is key. + Grphically when it's not dropping frames like that one time you were so shocked you dropped something on the ground it's really nice. The survivors look unique. The DLC characters resemble their likenesses as they should (except Freddy he looks like a bad remake from the bad reboot) + The mood and vibe (when the game doesn't drive you up the walls) sucks you in. The heartbeat slowly but surely getting closer to you while you're trying to rush to do something is a nice touch. The killers sound like they should and some survivors that shant be named breathe extremely loud ever louder while they're injured and internally you wanna tell them to ""shut the heck up"" but you can't. It's a video game. But you do it anyway because you know you'll get caught if you're breathing like you've just came out of a Taco Bell bathroom during the summer time. + It's really fun with friends. It's the best when you're playing with people you know and can talk with. You know what you're doing everyone has a job and you're more likely to survive or help someone live.On a scale of one to ten I'd give it a respectable score. I can't say at this time without certainty because regardless of how I feel today I feel that the feeling would make me regret going too high or too low depending on the W/L ratio the skill level of the players involved etc. I'll leave you with this. I got this game on sale I play with friends and randoms and I believe I got my money's worth. So there's that.",Dead by Daylight

Bugs ... a ton of them.... everytime the developers ""fix"" something they break two new things... every week they promis enews and changes and nothing really happens at all.2. Connection peer to peer .... if you are lucky enough to find a game ( which can take up to an hour if you queue with 3 other friends) you have high chances of getting dodged by the host (the killer) because he doesnt want to play against a group of friends ... OR you get the laggiest game experience that you ever saw... 3. More bugs and exploits people could use without getting punished or anythign being done against it.4. Wrong priorities by teh developers They rate pumping out new PAID DLCS higher than actually takign a step back and fixing stuff the community really tells them to fix for month over and over again.5. Saltiest Community next to league of legends where no matter how your playstyle as a kilelr is you will always get on by survivors that got killed by you and vicy versa killers will always flame about ""unfair"" survivors... really really not enjoyable.Yes i have over 1200+ hours in this game mainly because i streamed it and had a nice community in my stream but since the latest ""engine update"" where they wanted to make the game look better and increase the performance they actually made the game even more laggy for a lot of players (and yes my pc specs are more than enough to properly stream and play this game in theory) ... but i guess proper programming isnt their strength.

My problem is If you use D Strike youre a noob if you loop pallets youre a noob. Insta blind flashlight? For noobes. Killers cry about everything and devs swing their nerv hammer. That might not be 100% right but it just feels like it. Dying to a bloodlust 3 is no fun at all. There should be much more focus in makin a good and fun chase rather than just buff killers so that you dont even feel good if you get somebody. Barb n chilly aint an answer to camping. Giving a buff for not camping doesnt mean you fixed the problem. Im gonna play another game for a little while and look back to Dbd later. Lets see if anything gets better shall we?,Dead by Daylight
2016-10-19,0,0,98,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is an easy game there are not a lot of difficult game mechanics. The (four) survivors have to fix generators and the killers has to obviously kill them. This is one of the few games that didn't start to bore me after playing it for a week and that says something. However you're not rewarded for playing as a team. When the first survivor is hanged on a hook the killer usually camps making it harder for you to win. Best strategy hide until the first survivor hangs fix all the generators and escape.PROS Easy to pick up. It never gets boring.CONS Camping killers. It sometimes feels like an early access game.

2017-11-24,0,0,581,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight has been out for a while now but it earns recognition for having one of the most original game concepts in the past 5 maybe 10 years even. In the game you can play as a survivor or a killer. Both offer a very different gaming experience. As a survivor you team up with 3 other players and you need to repair generators scattered across a map. Meanwhile another player takes on the role as killer and hunts the survivors down. Survivors have a third person perspective and can't attack while killers have a first person perspective and each have their own signature weapons and abilities.I'm not going to go deep into the game mechanics but as you play you'll get points for doing various actions. Survivors need to repair search evade and often heal their team mates for points. Killers need to track down damage generators hurt and sacrifice the survivors on gigantic hooks spread across the map. Earn points and spend them in the 'Bloodweb' which acts like a skill and item tree. You gradually unlock new perks that offer new types of variety in gameplay.What keeps the game so interesting is that you really need to adapt and try to think like your opponent. Every match is a battle of wits and mindgames. Sometimes you will get unlucky but learn from the situation and you will eventually succeed. Escaping a match unscathed or eliminating a full team of survivors. Both will give you a whooping amount of satisfaction.EDIT 2018 This game remains a lot of fun. I've put the most hours into it for all of 2018. New interesting killers and survivors have been added. Back in June a cosmetic store was introduced. You can now spend saved up currency on outfits. No lootboxes you either pay and get what you want or grind your way. A fair business model. Good job devs!,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-19,0,0,335,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a terrifying horror game in which 4 survivors are pitted against 1 killer in an unnerving fog filled map. Whether it be in the iconic neighborhood of Haddonfield from Halloween or the Coal Tower of the Macmillan Estate the goal for both sides remain the same. Survivors must repair five generators and escape while the killer must sacrifice the survivors to the Entity a arachnid like monstrosity of the sky. This game is fine tuned to give you a scare with horrifyingly beautiful graphics and ghastly sounds. Everything in the game is more than adequately detailed with dark lore to add to your experience. Along with that the overall gameplay in Dead by Daylight is polished for the player's experience. Dead by Daylight has relatively few bugs and those that do exist are rarely gamebreaking. Content in this game is well fleshed out and no two experiences are ever the same with the numerous combinations of items to take into matches as well as game changing offerings.Finally Dead by Daylight is still being actively worked on by its developers with Freddy Krueger being released into the fog only last month! (Edit Now the Spirit has been added and with the huge success of the Hallowed Blight event another killer is being teased!)All in all I highly recommend Dead by Daylight to anyone thinking of purchasing it!,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-23,0,0,291,False,Not Recommended,While this is not as polished or as involved as Friday the 13th this game is still incredibly fun Edit I cannot reccomend any aspect of this game to anyone who actually wants to enjoy themselves. At this time the game is peer to peer with no real anti cheat system in palce so the overwhelming majority of matches are going to be lag fests with clear and obvious cheating. there is no balance between killers survivors and perks with several perks being outright borken. The developer has been notified repeatedly of the toxic playerbase and the problems with campers balance cheating and perks that don't work right. Whule none of the problems with this game have been addressed Behavior has announced server support for 2019. Don't waste money on a poorly coded fest that is this game in it's current condition. Wait for the developer to porperly support this product before purchasing this game. This game is too far broken the playerbase is too far cancerous and the support is too far nonexistant to encourage anyone to support Behavior financially in the game's current state.

2017-03-04,0,0,445,False,Recommended,Best way to reach the community is through the reviews I main survivor but I know how frustrated decent killers are with the game. The new ideas for the buffing the killer are probably going to make survivors and annoyed. I happen to like relatively at least how things are gameplay wise. So to help killers out and not stomp new survivors or bad survivors I believe the rank system is key. At ranks 7 1 survivors should only get three perks and killers should be given 5 perks. Logically it's no wonder the high ranks suck for killers. It's only 1 person versus 4 good players. I think this with some work is a good balancing mechanism.Very fun game to solo and with friends. Most people get used to the horror I don't though. Fairly balanced except for new killers. The devs have stated they intend to break the game every time they release a new killer...so yeah...I personally think the flashlight is worthless if the killer even knows how to turn left. The wiggle function needs a tiny buff. Like half a second or maybe a third. It's just a little too slow for most games. If your last survivor you're ed.

Usually when I use rare items that were hard to come by. I mean it's a game... but I hate losing without making mistakes. But if you're cool with games like that this game can be quite enjoyable. The last thing to keep in mind is the highly toxic community. For every ""GG"" there's a ""Go F*** yourself"". Players disconnect when the game isn't going their way WAY too often. It's a constant thing. And the devs encourage this by not punishing those who do it regularly. I know it seems like I didn't enjoy the game but I did.

2016-06-17,0,0,471,False,Recommended,Excellent Game!First and foremost this is a stressful frenetic hide and seek game... and depending on what side you play on the gameplay varies greatly. Survivors feel very helpless and you never feel like the survivors have the upper hand. Through very very good teamwork (and luck) a survivor may be able to escape. However as the Killer you feel extremely powerful. Like a game of cat and mouse there were many times I toyed with the survivors like letting them free eachother and just having fun with them. The graphics/animations aren't the best but the environments are dark creepy and evil. The sounds are well done also from the grass crumpling under your feet or a twig snapping as you brush by to the grunts of pain when hiding or the screams of the survivors as you hang them on meat hooks. Now although there are people who can ruin the experience by disconnecting (honestly I take it as a compliment knowing they won't win so they quit . ) Don't let it deter you from playing an excellent game.

If you solo queue in a quick play then it is alright but if you try to play with your friends it doesn't matter if you have a for party or not matchmaking just seems to take forever. The game mechanics are good. And is evenly matched when it comes to matchmaking. Please fix the matchmaking times because this game has been out for a yearor so and still having the same problem.,Dead by Daylight

(you could also think of it as 'Freeze Tag' playground game)While this game has come far from patching and rebalancing a lot of its maps characters and abilities it still has issues with keeping the gameplay fun and fair on higher skill levels.All its flaws aside it still plays true to the core mechanics of any Cat and Mouse games.The longevity of this game looks promising with regular monthly updates Public Test Beta and weekly Twitch streams with the Devs.Devs have started to listen to the community more and working on constantly rebalancing Killers and Survivors.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-26,0,0,1473,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a great game. It has very addicting gameplay with a non stop grind that will keep you coming back. Both roles are very fun to play although the game does seem more centered towards the killer but not to a point to where it breaks gameplay or makes the game too horribly unbalanced. Frequent patches and new content keep the game pretty fresh. To keep it short get this game. It is definitely deserving of your purchase. You will enjoy hours of gameplay all for an amazing value. DLC is also very cheap and sometimes it's actually free. You won't regret getting this game.Sadly I was banned from this game. If you check out my achievements for this game my prestige achievements for the game are at the exact same date and time although the one below those is actually accurate. This is a glitch for some reason I didn't get them when I actually prestiged although I did inquire about it in the forums. It didn't get replied to but I ended up getting all 3 of them at the same exact time after a certain patch. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not but in any case it does look very suspect when people scope out my profile. I did legitimately earn legacy skins and grind many of my characters to P3. Regardless after around 3 weeks of being banned and sending them an email no dev has gotten back to me yet. I'm not sure if anyone else has had an issue with getting wrongfully banned and ignored by the devs but it's just something to keep in mind when purchasing this game. I do feel very wronged from the whole situation as I have dumped a lot of time into this game and bought all DLC. I just hope that the devs get a little better about helping out there playerbase and listening to them.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-14,0,0,45,False,Recommended,"Played the beta and was instantly ""hooked"" (pun intended). Pre ordered and since I already owned Payday 2 got it for $16.99 which is a steal for this game. Been playing all night and it's even better than the beta with the new maps and new killers. They currently don't have party play but the developers have said numerous times it's on it's way if it's just you and one other person it's very easy to do a countdown and get into the same game have played 15 games or so tonight with my friend just counting down from 3 and most of those times we actually got into the same game on the first time. I think all the killers are pretty well balanced so far people are complaining about the Wraith but he is actually not hard to see he has a shimmer the biggest thing is you just don't get the heartbeat when he's near. But he also has no traps and nothing else to randomly stop you so it's evens out. If you're a fan of horror games/movies if you like to feel your heart racing if you want a game that when you make it to the exit you literally feel like you actually survived something horrific get this game.

2016-06-18,0,0,84,False,Recommended,Only cons really are the lack of content currently (new maps) and the like and some annoying game mechanics that need a bit of tweaking. Play with friends is w.e and when implemented should have its own Queue/ranking ladder otherwise it will just be another premade pubstomp game which some people dont seem to understand. The added aspect of having to work together with 3 stranges (in the case of the survivors) adds a nice dimension to the game. They need to add some sort of voice chat in game that is local only and can be heard by the killer. Game has lots of potential and is definitely different.,Dead by Daylight

I just bought the saw chapter and it feels like they just gave me a big you cause they sold me the same as the game barely refined no balance half peice of work. You want a one sided match were your friends can laugh at one guy playing a killer and teabag your way out to the 2 to 3 exits you guys have to escape while the killer cant do this is the game for you. its sad cause this game is one of a kind there isnt a game like this but they dont want to put the effort into making it a very awesome competive game,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-21,0,0,773,False,Recommended,It is a pretty fun game a little scary at first but you get used to it. I recommend using headphones when playing because there a lot of audio cues that can be very helpful once you understand how they work.

I highly recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight
2017-08-28,0,0,90,False,Recommended,The concept is quite cool. Lots of fun when you play with your friends and even without them. But the way the killer camps right in front of the place where you are hooked is so annoying. Also spawning right next to the killer is a funny thing that gives you really nice start of the game and it's usually the end of the game as well. GG. The game is addictive and the gameplay can be really good but the camping just makes it seriously unpleasant.Oh and also.. the killers are seriously op once the guy who plays them isn't a total noob.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-19,0,0,713,False,Not Recommended,This is one of those games that has a tremendously great idea with potentially great gameplay using a phenominal premise.What ruins it all is the sad feeling that there must be two separate dev teams. One that came up with great ideas Asymetrical gameplay where one player plays a 70's 80's and 90's era slash movie monster and the other four play Survivors random people from random places who all got 'called' to a dark and mysterious fog filled pocket dimension where they must evade and escape and hide from the monster. Always on the lookout and watching each others back to help ensure their survival or simply letting someone die so that they themselves can escape to live another day. Always knowing that they can't run away forever from that which stalks the fog for them always waking up again after 'dying' on a sadistic meat hook when caught. There's a lot of great thematic tension in the atmosphere ... And it's absolutely ruined by the other dev team who seems to take great joy in breaking what doesn't need to be fixed... or are just suffering from Dunning Krueger syndrome ( a 'condition' or a state of being really where you think you're far more competant and capable of doing things than you really are ). For every great idea the 'other team' comes up with the second less competant and capable team either fiddles with to mess it up or panders to one side of the player base because they themselves are terrible at the game and they want to punish actual competant Killer players at high rank. I'm not going to lie once you've found your niche and possibly some friends to play with the game is a blast. You can set your own rules consciously or subconsciously ( because you wouldn't really jerk around your friends if you actually wanted friends now would you? ) so that everyone has a blast and can chat via Discord or what have you.All that goes right out the window in the online ranked play. There are an immense amount of crutches handed to Survivors that on the surface are supposed to give them a fighting chance at survival against the Killers. These are ostensibly THOROUGHLY ABUSED by the Survivor players who've built up a lot of skill and situational awareness in the gameplay. I could go on for hours but I don't want to bore anyone with what might seem like an angry rant and I don't think I have infinite space here so I'll just shorten the statement down to this The Devs have no idea how to balance the game in a way where the Killer player feels like a terrifying threat at high ranks. If you play a Killer in this game be prepared to be drowned in 'Survivor Salt' for simply EXISTING in the game. At low ranks there are more chill people either they're not as experienced or they're casual players just looking for the adrenaline rush of the chase. At higher ranks though the Survivors are not locked in a room with a Killer... the monster is locked in a room with four people who know how to abuse every single mechanic in the game for their benefit. Let me just put it this way to give you an idea of how things are to anyone who wants to debate this... The Devs to celebrate cross promotion with Left 4 Dead added Bill to the game as a free character. When they teased one of his perks they were so clueless about how to describe this perk it sounded like a get out of jail free card. It led to an actual strike among the Killer player base unwilling to deal with more yet more garbage. It was only until the actual update took place and people were allowed to read the perk's listed ability did people understand what it did and when. But to hear the devs initially describe it it sounded like the Survivors were being given literal invicibility for several seconds under certain conditions. Hell they even packaged that update with black T shirts for the Survivors ( obtainable somehow I don't know how ) that when equiped on Claudette the black girl in the Trailer video makes her invisible in most environments in the game because she blends in perfectly with dark areas. GG on that one Devs. Be prepared to see a lot of Survivor Players using that character with that shirt. Everyone I've run into playing that combo has been an utter $$H t tried tested proven.Until the Devs actually fix that stuff on top of some of the long standing bugs like the bugged pallets on MacMillon Estate maps I can't recommend the game.,Dead by Daylight

2018-03-27,0,0,388,False,Not Recommended,Okay so Dead by Daylight and I have a history as I both enjoy the game and utterly hate it at times. However a lot of what I hate about the game does come down to some of the tactics the players use. So I won t be counting those. For those who might not of played the game it s a game where one player is a killer and the other four are survivors and need to escape. Each killer and survivor can be customised with a variety of cosmetics perks and equipment. I will say right now this won t be a full comprehensive review but I will write one out and exchange the current review for the more extensive one. For the moment I ll use some points to address and list the pros and cons of the game.Pro One Survivor and Killer variety and customisation. There is no denying that there is a lot of variety when it comes to the killers and the survivors and although a great deal of it could simply be said to be cosmetic and models. The perks and load outs add to the variety and can alter the playstyle of each survivor and killer. Con One Sabotage is Useless. Okay so this is possibly my biggest issue with the game at the moment among a lot of newer issues. As I did take a long break from the game and only recently got back into it. When I first played the game roughly during the first months of it s release and maybe a little longer. I played mostly Jake Park the reason I enjoyed playing Jake was because of one of Jake s unique perks. Saboteur. Saboteur allowed Jake to sabotage hooks traps and the like without the need of a toolbox. A very useful ability that has been utterly rendered useless. Before if you had a good Jake on the team. You were fairly safe from the hooks. As Jake could go around and sabotage them rendering them useless to the killer and giving the survivors more of an advantage. The issue is that now hooks regenerate pretty damn quickly. I ve heard that apparently they regenerate after three minutes. But it feels much shorter and it renders the sabotage ability absolutely useless. Pro Two Design of the Killers. Aside from the licensed killers all killers in Dead by Daylight are pretty well designed. They each look unique and play in varying different ways. The Nurse can levitate and blink making her highly mobile the Huntress can throw hatchets giving her a rang advantage the Wraith can turn invisible the Trapper can set traps to snare unsuspecting survivors. From the design of the models to the way each of the killers play with their unique ability. The game certainly keeps it interesting and always guessing.Con Two Speed differences Now due to the fact I have been away from the game for a long time. I may be wrong on this one and if I am please say so. The issue with the speed and I don t mean the chase speed although there have been instances where the Killers have been SO MUCH faster than they probably should of been. I can put that down to certain perks within the game. What I cannot really grasp are the other times. Repair for generators has always been long and I don t mind that. But the wiggle I timed this several time and the wiggle can take anywhere between fifteen to twenty seconds. That might not seem like a long time but refer back to Con number one. Sabotage is useless. The whole point of Sabotage was to remove hooks and make it more difficult for the killer to begin the sacrifice. Now without a proper way to remove surface hooks those fifteen to twenty seconds essentially mean you are guaranteed to be hooked and will require your team mates to rescue you.This also means that the hooks in the basement the four hooks that can never be sabotaged are basically only used when the survivor goes down close enough to them.Like I said this is by no means a comprehensive review and I will be writing one during my free time and while I do really enjoy this game. I cannot deny that it is frustrating and I cannot avoid the conclusion that. While the game originally favoured the killers only moderately it also gave the survivors the skills and tools to be able to survive. Was it always fair? No not at all however now the game is punishingly unfair. The uselessness of sabotage and the massive fifteen to twenty seconds needed to wiggle out of the killers grasp. Mean that you are going to get frustrated at the game. I do like the game I would encourage people to play it so long as they can put up with it s flaws. HOWEVER I cannot recommend the game in it s current state considering how leaning it is to the killers and not more in the middle or only leaning slightly to the killers.,Dead by Daylight

2018-12-25,0,0,430,False,Recommended,Although very many people have issues with this game in terms of how it works I'm going to be straightforward and objective about this. Dead By Daylight is an assymetrical game that has 4 Survivors and 1 Killer. The Killer's objective you guess it is to kill the survivors. The Survivors on the other hand want to escape. There are many different potholes in the mechanics of the game resolving to make most players believe that Survivors have a higher skill cap than Killers and I agree. If you decide to buy this game just remember that everything will come with time. With most of the community being toxic you can't really avoid any criticism or hate. My way of enjoying this game is to play the game your way whether that would be running the Killer around (You learn how with experience) hiding from the Killer or just sitting in a locker until the gens are done. On the Killers side you can guard gens and kill Survivors normally you can be completely rude and slug the Survivors (Down them and wait for them to bleed out) or just simply be AFK until the end of the game with NOED. Both sides are fun to play once you learn strategies and builds.Overall I would rate this game a 8/10 from an objective standpoint. It is extremely fun to play from both ends as long as you know what you are doing. You can enjoy in multiple ways whether you are solo or with friends. In a subjective standpoint however this game would get a 10/10 because I want to.BTW This is my first Steam Review I'm pretty sure so how did I do? Did I make you want to buy the game? Give me some pointers in the comments! (pointers on writing reviews not about DBD.),Dead by Daylight
2016-08-13,0,0,37,False,Recommended,UPDATE They fixed it enough in my opinion that I can safely recommend it now. It's a fun game to play with friends!ORIGINAL First let me say I love this game. When I get into a room with my friends it is so much fun. WHEN!!!! I seriously just spent 30 minutes (not exaggerating) clicking ready in a survive with friends lobby and we just gave up. Some days it only takes 5 to 10 minutes to find a game and that somehow is considered to be a good day for us. STOP PATCHING EVERYTHING ELSE AND FIX MATCHMAKING FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING GOOD IN THIS WORLD!!!!,Dead by Daylight

Many of the lessons you learn in the tutorial are pointless as the countless number of perks offerings items and add ons subvert these lessons.Casual and ranked matches seems like the most obvious solution to a lot of the games problems but it does not exist instead you can team up with 3 of your friends and use communication to gain a severe advantage over the killer. I would not recommend playing this game without your friends or as the killer as it would appear the majority of the DBD community are ""toxic"" (a term the community itself has coined to describe one another).If you can get this game on discount then it's worth a try but I really wouldn't recommend it.",Dead by Daylight

2016-10-20,0,0,215,False,Not Recommended,Let me get this straight. I love this game. The concept is great. But i can't reccomend it in it's current state. It is one of the most buggy games i've ever played alongside Thief. Here's what i think in a format you gamers understand Pros Super fun when it works In depth progression system That satisfying feeling when you get the perk you really want (My personal favorite is sprint burst) Although not deep you can customize the clothing of each survivor Being the killer is super fun and satisfyingCons The Nurse is really overpowered. At least in my opinion. The Wraith doesn't get enough love ( The occasional really bad lag spike Match making is god awful The darkness when it consumes the stuff you wantAnd the biggest con of them all The crashingThis game has hard crashed my computer not once not twice not three times but SIX F# KING TIMES!! Its really annoying and the devs have made no move to fix this.Final Verdict 5/10Will raise to 8/10 when all these issues are fixed,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-27,2,5,4,False,Not Recommended,This game reminds me of payday 2.Not just cause its published by Starbreeze Or because no mater what your graphics settings the in game models always look slightly off kilter.But because like Payday 2 once the second DLC pack hits the store I can tell you exactly where this is going to go.People who don't use or benefit from the DLC are going to be mad that the DLC is over powered.People who buy the DLC are going to say its not over powered enough. And thus begins a horrible cycle of ever increasing power creep which will if it continues unabated will result in the vanilla content being unplayable when compared to the wildly powerful DLC content.The thing that made Payday 2 bareable when this happend is that its a player vs an AI controlled computer. and the computer can't complain about things being unfair and has no real concept of fairness because its not alive.But in a Player vs Player game like this one where both sides are controlled by living thinking breathing humans not only is all the atmosphere of a horror game lost but so is the all important sense of fair balance.And I don't care what the Hunter mains say. Being able to hide from you and not be spotted instantly by t detect life spells IS NOT unbalanced gameplay. Its supposed to be a hide and seek not hide and get ed because the hunter is invisable and has a spell that can reveal all other players on the map.Can't wait for the DLC that adds a survivor with a machine gun to the game.,Dead by Daylight

2018-12-31,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun for 1 person painful for 4. This game's output is obviously in favor of the killer and when one person only plays a specific killer they get overpowered abilities and perks that ruin the game even further for the survivors. This is bad because everyone will want to play the killers and it will not balance out when the matchmaking tries to obtain survivers. I feel as if the creators of the game went full retard when designing the killers. Understand that people are getting paid real money to fix design and create the game. If you want more people to buy and enjoy the game here's an idea. You could stop going full retard when designing a killer. It surprises me that some of these killers made it past the design/creation team. 80% of the people in a game who play survivors eventually realize that the game is skewed in favor of the killer. The ranked system does not work at all as the fate of the game is in the hands of 3 other people who could hide in a locker refuse to heal or unhook or very commonly disconnect. Luckily I got gifted this game and if given the option I would not spend a single ing dollar to play this game full of braindead retard proof rank inflating overpowered killers.,Dead by Daylight

There's a big variety of ORIGINAL killers and LICENCED killers. Each of them have different powers and perks which gives the option to play any playstyle you want to play. The game objective is clear and as you get into the Realm of the Entity more often you'll be able to succesfully escape the killers.I recommend playing with friends it's easier to communicate on getting the job done. In my experience some killers have no respect for teams but it can really help you througout the match. Also encountering bugs is a fun thing especially when you're playing with your buddies. This game still has to improve but I think they did a pretty good job so far. ),Dead by Daylight

Some matches will be quick with a premade SWF of 4 players that just afk on gens and get 4 gens in 3 minutes and others will sit on top of the hook to farm the person that was hooked for altruism points which usually leads to the killer getting 4k and bashed in post game chat.

2018-03-04,0,0,371,False,Not Recommended,EDIT #2 Well 2.0's PTB really had me banking on a new leaf being turned over. I reinstate everything as it was previously. I really don't know what else there is to say from someone such as myself. You have...A 'competitive' game balanced around its skill floor rather than its ceiling.A producer of said game who would rather you play something else instead of dealing with his own product.Two end results where you will either be neglected as a minority for the rival majority s sake or feel entitled to a fun experience at the cost of your host s own.And to simply quote the Regginator... If it's not fun why bother? EDIT #1 Having felt like reading up enough on the recent Emblems patch I would like to put my two cents in on them (from a killer standpoint).This is perhaps the biggest band aid fix I've seen on this game in a long while. Instead of balance and design issues being dealt with we are met with distorted assurance as to what our 'victories' now are.The affect any of it has on high level play is simply nonexistent. Survivor perks and tactics will continue to be meta and a select couple of killers will be considered viable to combat them (all while on the clock as before).And if you've been BM'd in the past like many others nothing new here will prevent it from happening to you again. Period.I've hung onto this one long enough wanting to put my hand back into the cage but just not after being bitten so many times before.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-25,0,0,1126,False,Recommended,You know damn well you shouldn t move. You re crouching in the long grass pressed against a boulder watching a masked killer move through the brush. Your heart beats rapidly so loud you can barely hear but you must sit it out hope you re not spotted. But then he turns his gaze towards you and you can t hold the panic back. You jump up try to run for cover zigging and zagging to throw him off the scent. You race towards an old shed but can t move fast enough. Just as you re diving through the window the killer grabs you. You re in a world of hurt.Dead by Daylight has a central concept so great you wonder why nobody s done it before. Inspired by the slasher flick cycles of the seventies and eighties it s a 4vs1 asynchronous multiplayer pitting one of three monstrous killers against four survivors the survivors trying to escape before the killer tracks them down. Think of it as Evolve meets Left 4 Dead meets Friday the 13th Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre though probably better than that sounds.In the first when you start the game you will be so bad at the game and people will keep saying you are a noob and all that just dont listen to them and keep trying and never give up.,Dead by Daylight

2019-01-11,0,0,227,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer horror game which features two teams 4 Survivors and 1 Killer and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles The four Survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The Killer needs to find the Survivors knock them down put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods.Survivors play in third person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first person and is more focused on their prey.There is a large pool of Survivors and Killers to choose from every three months a new Chapter being released (a DLC including a new Survivor a new Killer and a new Map).Even if you're playing on the same maps over and over again each level is procedurally generated so you ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.The Players are able to use Perks Items (with or without add ons) offerings and objects in the environment to get advantage within the game. Each Character has three Perks that are unique to them and will only spawn in their Bloodweb until they are taught to the other Characters.This game is fine optimized even tho you'll need a decent PC to run it at 60 FPS. Sadly there are a lot of bugs. The good part is that the development team is trying to solve them as soon as possible.I will give one WARNING to new players the community can be very toxic. There are Killers who don't care about whether Survivors have fun (to put it nicely) and Survivors who want to make the game annoying for killers so either one can make a game less enjoyable. But please don't let those games to put you down and stop playing because of that. This game is super fun especially if you're playing with friends.The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it s going to turn out. Ambience music and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time you might even discover what s hiding in the fog.Also always remember this Death Is Not an Escape.,Dead by Daylight

It doesn't matter if you're a casual or a hardcore gamer you'll find your starting experiences to be mostly the same.The game's objective is pretty simple on both sides but simple doesn't mean easy. You won't be able to faceroll the newcomers forever. After you start getting into some more serious ranks you'll get matched with people with + same skill level.Content does take a while but even then. You'll be too busy farming all of your points to notice the new teasers for new killers etc. Yes there are some bugs..... Ok there are A LOT of bugs. Most of them are minor some game breaking. This game will forever be known as such. 1 bug gets fixed? Great 2 more just spawned cause the 1st one got fixed. They literally just added pallet gravity I mean seriously?All in all you'll find yourself playing this more than you thought you would. It feels like I only started playing 2 weeks ago.BE SURE TO COPY YOUR SAVE FILE ONCE EVERY SO OFTEN THERE IS SOME SORT OF A WEIRD BUG THAT CORRUPTS PLAYER SAVE FILES. BEWARE.

Over a year ago one of my friends gifted me this game so I could play with them but I didn't actually play because for whatever reason I was too scared (tf old me). But now I've been playing it a LOT and let me tell you the money spent on this game is worth it. It's fun thrilling suspenseful the whole shebang. One of my other friends got the game recently and urged me to play it with them so I did and now I can't leave. The maps have such a great ambience to them and the graphics are beautiful too. The fact that you don't know who the killer will be adds to the suspense especially when you can hear the heartbeat but you can't see them. The warning sounds perk sounds trapdoor sounds all the sounds really add to the entire experience and make it even better.Now into personal gameplay experience. There was one match where all of my teammates were dead. Three generators still needed to be done and my pursuer was the Nurse. The trapdoor was open somewhere and I was out of my mind trying to track it down hoping it was around the edge somewhere. My friend and I were in a call at the time and I contemplated the thought to her ""Maybe the Nurse found it maybe she's waiting by it."" My friend agreed with me and it turned out to be true. The suspense and thrill of tracking down the open hatch the sound of the heartbeat getting faster and faster it added to the thrill and to my anxiety. I managed to escape through the trap door but it did a toll on me. I had to take a break afterwords. Honestly the effect the game on you is amazing. I mean it gave me anxiety but that's a sign that ""Wow this game is really well made!""Overall I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for something thrilling something fun to play by yourself or with your friend(s).",Dead by Daylight

They finally gave survivors a chance to escape by removing the auto aim given to killers along with generators being repaired quickerSecondly Killers may now damage generators to halt the progress on generators making games a little bit longer and allowing everyone to gain more points. Overall the game is now balanced for both sides instead of being killer balanced. Finding matches no longer takes years to accomplish which is great.They also have recenetly upgraded their engine to make the game look better colors are much more darker and sleaker along with the sky looking incredibly beter.,Dead by Daylight

Friday the 13th/Texas Chainsaw Massacre /Halloween (Just look at who the killers almost appear to be....) I could almsot right off my impression of playing this game as cheesy because each level is retricted to some locality (Familar looking if your familar with any of thos films above. ) that are all diffrent but lokced within this decrepit brick wall that can only be breahced at either one of the three elctronic contrlled gates. That only open after four to five of the engine generators powered lights have repired and switched on.Not as easy asi it sounds but very simple. It's the same at each location there is useally a building in the centre with a basment where box filed with useful tools (Flashlighht Tool kits med kits...) can found and sometimes they can found in other parts outside. amongst oversized debris or brick wals often arranged to almost shelter those that are unlucky enough to be running from the killer. Four young pople two guys two girls &amp one killer hunting down &amp sometimes assisted by some suprenatural means artifact anfd there is kore to know.....I thought it could be way better like put in bigger setting with more things to do before they are allowe to go.

2016-07-14,0,0,565,False,Not Recommended,"I can't put into words how i feel about this game. The devs of the game love to nerf everything into the ground on one side while heavily favoring the other side. Now i have about a pretty even split of 200 hours on both sides so from that let me tell you about how this game goes. The community is toxic it doesn't matter if you play ""fair"" or scummy or even if you're on the same team you're goin to get something along the lines of ""You suck. I hope you get aids and i will murder your family and your dog."" at the end of every game. While there is an option to turn off after game chat sometimes both sides had a great game and you want to offer a friendly GG only to be met with go kll yourself 85% of the time and maybe a GG the rest of the time.As a killer You have to deal with toxic survivors using exploits that the devs accidentally put into the game and watch as the devs tell you that they will fix it soon until it's been so long that they just announce it as a feature. You also have to deal with unbalanced perks and mandatory perks for almost all killers except a very special one. Not to mention a huge inbalance in the game called survive with friends which let's survivors team up and que into a game with anywhere between 1 3 of teir freinds which may not sound bad by itself but when you add in 3rd party voice coms it becomes the bane of your existence. Along with the overpowered items that all 4 survivors can bring into a match. Just imagine whatever game you play having this huge overlypowerd item before it got patched and the multiply that by 4 except it never gets patched.As a survivor You have to deal with killers who camp you on the hook which makes it nearly impossible to be rescued without a certain perk. You also have to deal with killers who abuse the games mechanics and make it impossible to get off of the hook. (The hook is what the killer puts you on to kill you after they have downed you) IF that wasn't bad enough you have teamates hungry for a free huge chunk of points at your expense who will unhook you in front of the killer only for you to be hooked again and die faster. You will also have to deal with troll teamates who go out of thier way to sandbag you. There servers are also p2p so if you get the bad luck of playing with someone who plays on a potata then you're just out of luck sadly.Even with all of that as long as you have tough skin and enough time to grind past the early levels then it'll be a great game for you.The reason I switched my review to a negative one is because there is an issue that has been running rampid that causes players to loose all of thier save data. This has happened to me twice now The first time they were very helpful and it took about a week for them to fix it sicnce they seem to work 9 5 Monday through Friday with no support on weekends. After this first setback happened I backed up my save files and kept playing until it happened again and destroyed not only my main save but also my back up save files. As of this review i have been waiting for 6 weeks for a response and have gotten nothing outside of a auto reply saying ""we are very busy we will soon be with you"" even after I opened a second ticket that an adminof the foroums that works for the company told me to do. SO there goes a solid 400 hours of my life wasted.If you're willing to take that risk and nothing I have said so far has turned you off buy this game! It was fun enough for me to dump 400 hours into it. Just be willing for the lack of support (sometimes) and honest communication from the devs.",Dead by Daylight

The leveling is done at a fairly decent pace.Cons The game is less of a coop on the survivor part as it should. You don't get anything for your teammates to escape if you don't escape even though they're very much likely to have escaped because you were caught distracting the killer. The game feels very pay to win. Some killers are actually broken and need to be bought. Although all killers can exploit and camp a hooked survivor making it a displeasing experience for that player. The game can get very repetitive very fast. Some mechanics have been rendered useless like the hooks' sabotage.5/10 Decent to play would not pay for it though.,Dead by Daylight

2019-02-04,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,"This games feel like it's unpolished and I don't think it's my computer's specs that's messing with me. Pros I feel like the concept tho might not be original since I've played Damned is great . I love the fact that you and your friends are able to share the experience of a horror game.The dark vibe from this game is well done. The noises and the rustling is a nice touch to spook the players.Amazing characters as well. I love that it has a new take of a different character having abilities especially the killers. It makes the gameplay unique and you can take the game onto your own hand when playing a match.Cons The first time I've run it it said it was going to take 10 hours to set up the game after installation and I'm like uh excuse me?After leaving my computer to do its thing I came back to find out that the file got corrupted somewhere and I had to verify integrity of game cache and found some corrupted files that I had to wait again. The game has been stuck in the loading screen a couple of times now I can't find a way to fix it either. It might happens rarely but it is annoying to bear with.Honestly I'm disappointed in these because the process even made me think ""wait is this game on beta or something?"" The reason I'm not going to recommend this game FOR NOW is because of the bugs. If I see it being patched or find a solution I might reconsider because honestly the game looks enjoyable and it's not half bad if I didn't get annoyed over the little things.",Dead by Daylight
2018-10-30,0,0,562,False,Recommended,As a survivor it's scary while you're new to the game but gets less scary when you figure out what to do but then picks back up when killers figure out what to do. Killers are diverse and there's probably a killer for your hunting playstyle.A lot of the bad things about this game can be boiled down to poor design and high rarity items being overpowered. The game can really screw you over at times but all things considered it just needs a few improvements to be a masterpiece assymmetric PvP surival horror.,Dead by Daylight

The comunity is kinda toxic but if u dont look at this parts the game is good it has a good graphic and there's not manny hackers like in other games. It's a good ideea with the generators to make and open the gate so u can finish the round the killers are well made but in my opinion there's Pallets ingame missing as a survivor u dont have alot of escapes. They should work on that. Besides those things the game is great. I like it and im gonna still play it but please atleast ban the people who are stream sniping streamers or face camping.

2016-08-20,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,"This ends now. Not recommended again and for eternity for many reasons When you play Killer and got Survivors who know their a little the fun goes out by the window... litteraly.You can run all you like but someone at least experienced will always escape the Killer from any harm.At least give a rage outburst when the game detect this kind t enabling the player to destroy windows opening like the Killer can destroy pallets when they are used. And even chooping the Survivor without any joy stopping from cleaning the weapon and giving them maybe blood transmitting diseases... The Killer can't move his view when he grab a Dying Survivor from the floor. And thus when other players have flashlights they immediatly use them in the eyes and... you drop the Survivor you where lifting up. Nice kill joy for enjoying killing. t again. Have one perk needed and locked to reduce light burn? One gameplay. More characters but only one simple gameplay (overall speaking) after a year of existance. On the contrarary more DLC value popped. And all this after at least a year of existence. Do they really hear the crowd of players or are they only following The Entity Of Cash? Read the other reviews complaining of losing their prograss for unknown reasons. But being said to save your own save files? Nice middle finger. Not enough weight on this last point since I didn't read enough but still saw bad reviews with this statement wihout seeking them... so good enought to spread the word.Yup I don't have much time in the game but experiencing this kind of t early on doesn't give me the will to keep consuming. To the trashbag it goes.10 September 2017 review Recommended Dead by Daylight or a game of Hunter &amp Hunted.Be a hunted ear the blood pumping and the pressure in those creepy destroyed places...Be a hunter feel the thrill of hacking those sheeps and sacrifice them for your god...I already made a review when there was a freeplay weekend shortly after release date. Now there's another one a year later and since I still liked the base gameplay except for some points... I want to go back on it. (old review at the end).Now more &amp old points I want to throw Good Now 7 Survivors and 5 Killers more maps available now the game is worth the 20 from my point of view. Gameplay still good for me.Meh The bloodweb system is still not an upgrade system. Now if you take it as a shop system... why not?Yes you can still get perks those stay after a game. It's also logic (thanks to the ingame guide) that a survivor lose his item and add ons if he dies (or lose his item? dunno about that) it would also be logic if the Killer isn't good enough at his job The Entity may be angry and removes something too... which isn't the case add ons on Killer are always removed.But still not a real upgrade system to me. Killer get more bloodpoints than the Survivor... or what? Can't sure clearly as I mostly played Killer and damn I kill good!Bad Still one gameplay after a year and there's still people (dev?) on it. So... No real bad on this point. Here I already thrown out three gameplay in my previous review here comes FIVE MORE!&lt A guide have been added for all the opportunities of gameplays they count have added yet&gt There's 3 more Survivors and 4 more Killers as DLC. Without counting cosmetic DLCs +25 to the cost for the ""Full"" game. Base game with 7S + 5K 20 . DLCs with 3S+4K 25 . So... what about a middle finger to full price DLCs of that sort in general where it cost more for less?Now I took the game with the 50% price reduction. Oh and I'm about to install it... what but it was ALREADY INSTALLED! WTF?Yes I ""reinstalled"" the game after buying it... in the end Steam just discovered existing files. &lt _&lt 20 August 2016 review Not Recommended &lt same three first lines of my preview there&gt It was a good game... until I saw some bad points...For the good points The gameplay is nice. There's a real feeling of hunter/hunted in it with the atmosphere in each maps increasing all this. Even more I was like in ecstasy playing the hunter... so good! The characters styles makes me feel like of the old schools horror movies which also seems nice from my point of view! It's easy to win bloodpoints (for the ""upgrade system"") in this game but you acquire way more if you play good or teamplay. It's even a little too easy but at least you don't feel like grinding is a thing and you can directly go for the upgrades after one/two rounds.For the ""meh"" points 4 survivors 3 killers and 3 maps at release is low content. But for the price of 20 ? You may understand it's low/medium budget game but there could have been a lil' more than this at the start I think. (at least 1 killer and 1 map) Only one gameplay. It may be enough by itself but there could have been more than just that.&lt A guide have been added for all the opportunities of gameplays they count have added yet&gt For the bad points The ""maps"" contains different locations so in reality there's more than 3 maps... but it's the atmosphere in each ""maps"" who's important and not really the details. All locations in a map have the same atmosphere and so it feels somewhat redundant to play each locations. It needs more maps with more atmospheres and less locations for each ""maps"". The ""upgrade system"" the ""bloodweb"" being procedurely generated... it's a bad idea. Because it somewhat seems you can't focus on a type of equipment or upgrades. Which you may want And because of the previous points items and add ons are destroyed after each game. DESTROYED! Offerings being destroyed is understandable but items you acquire? Come on it's like saying a flashlight can't be used again after one little use of 5 seconds! There should have been a ""reload"" system for items which needs the player to play more games before reusing them at least. As for the add ons a better system would be less powerfull versions could be kept and more powerfull versions would be destroyed. And because of the previous points... the ""bloodweb"" doesn't feel like a real upgrade system and more like a shop which you can buy ""one use items"" and perks with those bloodpoints. In the end characters/kills levels becomes somewhat not significant. At all.After two hours of free weekend play I got enough... and I don't want to pay 20 to continue. The items destruction was a shock for me and I would have prefered to not see the ""bloodweb"" system at all or a real upgrade system. So maybe with some time and updates it'll be worth it.",Dead by Daylight

Survivors play in third person view allowing them to hide and survey the environment while the killer stalks them in first person. Maps are procedurally generated so even veterans will have to relearn the maps to survive. As a Survivor use tall grass lockers crates and barricades to carefully navigate the killing ground. Remain calm and tactical. Panic is a sure way to get killed. Discover and utilize items to aid in your survival or team up with other players to outwit the monster. As the Killer predict Survivor movements and use a myriad of sinister abilities to trap them and offer them up as sacrifices to the Entity.Dead by Daylight Key Features Progression in game characters have a deep progression system which can be customized for unique strategies.Items search the killing grounds to discover items that will aid you in survival or carry them with you to your next match.First Person Killer the killer's camera is confined to the first person while survivors are given a third person view to help them evade the monster.Procedural Levels each game requires players to relearn the environment so that no experienced player can gain a significant advantage from map awareness.Multiple Killers choose to play one of several iconic horror movie motifs from the slasher to the silent wraith.

The first map I played was of a neighborhood with closets and places you could hide and it felt like a real horror movie. But it quickly loses any sense of realism with some other gimmicky maps. So there are generators or somesuch that you have to fix as a survivor and on some maps you might see 9 of them in a very small area with nowhere to hide except around corners and there is no apparent benefit to turning them on like there might be in a neighborhood with a blackout it just doesn't make sense and it revealed the shallow game beneath that was only covered by the veneer of a neighborhood my first play through. Can't recommend what I played. Perhaps the game will get deeper with time.",Dead by Daylight

As glitchy as it was/ still is I had tons of fun playing with friends running away from the killer etc.HOWEVER the balancing for this game is absolute trash. All of the best characters in the game are behind a stupid paywall and there is nothing nice for the people who paid for the base game. After the release of the doctor I just straight up uninstalled the game. I was tired of the absolutely horrid balancing of the game and lack of care that the devs have for their users.I would give this a 4/10 but there will more than likely be another update that will break this broken glitchy game even more than it already is.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-02,0,0,920,False,Not Recommended,"Ive put alot of hours into Dead by Daylight and I used to main killer started playing survivor so I could play with friends. Since the release of Freddy it has been the worst choice made by the devs to not work on fixing him quickly. Trying to juke him is impossible and when I say that its literal. No perk or any build counters him not only can you barely find him if he is near you but he has no cooldown on how quick he can put you back in the dreamstate mind you that to get out you have to give away you position by failing a skillcheck. The concept is great and I was pumped for Freddy but a killer that doesnt need deerstalker or nurses calling can stop gates from being opened because he hits a player a couple times and even if you manage to open the gate he can have Blood Warden which prevents you from leaving even further. The whole ""get gud"" isnt something possible against him players try to adapt to him but his add ons prevent you from getting out the dreamstate which makes action speed 50% slower. Hopefully the Devs will actually do something about him before November 1st so all players can actually enjoy earning 2x bloodpoints not just the killer.",Dead by Daylight

And to be honest currently the killers have a really good life while survivors are getting nerfed a lot. I don't think I'm bad but the killers do have mandatory perks while we as survivors have perks that don't do quite a lot except at max level I imagine. It's still fun but too many problems lags cheaters or the fact that I can't even play the game as it keeps crashing on launch for no reason even after checking the cache of the game.

2018-05-01,0,0,652,False,Recommended,So I ve been playing this game for a while and thought I had to finally make a review for it. I ll start this of by a pros and cons (by my opinions).Pros Extremly fun game Constant updates and bugfixes Doesn t require that much of your computer Easy to understand Play 2 winCons Unbalanced gameplay at high ranks Players are salty as f*** Takes WAY to long to get the good and useful perks Takes incredibly long time to get good atSo I just want to say I really LOVE this game it s a whole lot of fun and it has so much potential. Also the devs seem to care about it and keep fixing bugs and trying to balance the game. Although this it gets quite boring after a while because it takes to much time to level up your characters which you need to do to get the better perks which in their turn is needed to be able to compete at higher ranks. Also as the killer you stand no chance at high ranks because good survivors are ALWAYS able to outplay even the best of killers. Hopefully the game is going to get fully balanced soon and I really hope that the devs could make it easier to level up and get points for leveling up. Because that is really the only cons I see in the game right now. Really recommended if you want a game that is awarding you for playing and also if you have the time to put down a few 100 s of hours into the game. If you want a game that is easy to learn and doesn t take that much time I wouldn t recommend it for you.,Dead by Daylight

If you think you can kill some people as a killer (because you are a killer) you're wrong. Believe me in this game killers have no right to exist. The SWF group will take away everything you love and then make you suffer. Just remember one more thing before you start it YOU are a victim not them.

2018-07-24,2,13,1062,False,Not Recommended,"I do not recommend this game and I've played for almost 1000hrs now. I play both killer and Survivor to clarify. This game used to be very fun and with friends it was amazing. The Devs have grown to only want money and do not care about their fanbase. They either nerf killers and call it balanced or nerf survivors and say the same. The game is not balanced and unless you're a sadist or masochist you will not enjoy this game. They only break the game more with each update and only care about their new game DeathGarden which positively sucks There are also more hackers now because the Devs do nothing to stop it. They did a ""Tournement"" which had so many hackers it wasn't funny. They had an announcer who knew absolutely nothing about the game and refused to listen when people callled out hackers. My friend was banned from a Dev's stream when telling some issues with a killer he was having. There is no longer a way to contact the devs and the game is slowly going dowhill quickly. Some suggestions if I may.1. Instead of putting more cosmetics in the game actually fix the bugs that are present. Cosmetics mean nothing if you're permenently stuck in one place due to a bug. 2. reach out to the players. You're making people wanna stop playing with the ranking system. A new killer should not be with rank 10 survivors and vise versa. Also with the hackers it makes others who are veterans not want to play this game. 3. fix the balancing. You removed pallets but people still get face camped and looped. The toxcicity of the players are from them. So with balancing fix the exhaustion perks debuff. If you're running balanced landing you should be able to recover from exhaustion when you jump down. You will eventually get cornered and killed. Also fix the whole body blocking scenario. If a killer can block you from moving that's a major flaw. this goes for survivors being able to trap killers in ""fatshame"" places. 4. Fix the EAC. Make it so it actually stops hackers. Simple5. Updates should focus on fixing the game not ruining it. With every update as I've said it breaks the game. It tips it to one side each time. Killers should not be able to face camp. Maybe fix that in your very important COSMETICS Update. Cause actually fixing the game is totally unnecessary right?There's more top fix but Devs don't care about their players so they won't bother reading this",Dead by Daylight

2017-09-17,1,8,45,False,Not Recommended,This is often a fun game and has so much potential. The graphics are nice the music and settings are good the lobbies usually work out and you can get in a game quickly. The biggest issue with this game is that it's not remotely fun for casual players if they choose the survivor role. At the starting rank you will often be placed with killers who are experienced and have high level perks making them almost impossible to beat (bare in mind it is difficult enough as a survivor because of how OP killers are). In order to win as a survivor you pretty much need a whole team on teamspeak and even then most games you'll all be sacrificed. Killers also get far more points even if they only manage to kill one of you they often get more points than some of the survivors. Not everyone wants to play the meta fix the balance please.In summary Killers are faster they can one shot you they see the generators and just circle them they can stand by a hook and watch you die to prevent rescure they use perks to see/hunt you even if you hide well or dodge well.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-25,2,8,1050,False,Not Recommended,This game has a lot of bugs Developers or Devs as people call them that don't seem to play the game and people who think they are good when the game is in their favor. This new update swings the meta from about 30% from the survivors favor to 85% to the killers favor. Killers think they are good because they got super buffs and Survivors use to BM because they had the favor. This game does not balance does not seem to care about their community and if you want a game that's fun to play move on. It's not worth it. Tells you something when the people who started with the game no longer seem to play it. I am sure they are tired of people complaining about it but they don't seem to care any more. From what the Devs are talking about they will continue to run this game into the ground and I am terribly saddened by that because the game idea is fun with a toxic community and toxic company running it. Worst money I have spent on a game considering how little they care about their community.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-25,0,0,255,False,Recommended,Look at the reviews especially the date of July 24th.You wanna know why these guys are instantly so negative about the game?Not because they think that the game is misbalanced repetitive and so on after all they're not angry about this suddenly from one Day to another.The real reason is that there was a misbalance heavily in favor of the survivors and these are survivor mains who are off because on that day Patch 2.1.0 came out heavily nerfing the survivors and buffing killers thus balancing the game out.They're angry because they don't have an easy to win game anymore.I play both sides regulary and now the game is more balanced and more fun. Thumbs up for the devs for doing the right thing balancing the game. Ignore these negative reviews the game is fun and somewhat addictive maybe the Counterstrike of the Survival Horror Genre.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-10,1,3,32,False,Not Recommended,Edit I should clarify things. This is not the final review but as of now I will not reccomend it.As of now they dev's have done a poor/slow job. In its form as of now it's not worth the money. It's promising don't get me wrong. I want this game to do good but in its current form I would never recommend it to anyone. I understand why someone would like this game. I have my fair share of gaming guilty pleasures. From a game development POV though it's bad. It's buggy it has balancing issues its online system is faulty its ranked system is broken. Also to create a sense of progression this game shouldn't have to add in leveling and perks. You shouldn't be able to bring items into the game. If this game was good in itself it wouldn't need to add another sense of progression by adding perks and items and instead would just use the ranking system after it works like it is intended to. It needs more variety in maps a better ranked system better matchmaking and a party system. It's shallow right now.,Dead by Daylight

I understand everyone saying get good as a survivor but what are we supposed to do when we get better and then they nerf us again. Don't get me wrong I actually love playing killer and am pretty good at it. I like playing survivor mainly with friends but they nerfed the vaulting of windows pallets which are our main time killers. Seriously killers love it because even if they just face camp and tunnel the whole game they have a better chance of getting everyone. The game needs some nerfs for killers or just roll back survivors a little. That's all.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-15,1,2,37,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT I continued to find more flaws with the game after playing many hours of it so I will add edits and extras where they are due Time for an angry as fu ck review This game is just so fu cking terrible. Pretty much everything about this game makes me hate it. I'll give you a list of reasons why NOT to buy this game 1. Whenever I try to play as a Survivor it won't connect me. Litearrly one half of the entire FU CKING game is blocked off for me. I'm not entirely sure if this is just an issue of too people playing as Murderers but that's their fault not mine. If I'm playing the game I want to actually PLAY the game. 2. There are almost NO FU CKING SKINS. There are about 10 slots for all of the different skins you can collect but the only skin you can unlock is this bloody skin for being Level 50 which equates to about 50 hours of this shi tty game. I've been told that they're gonna add more in the future but at least give us one fu cking skin that doesn't take 50 hours to unlock! Everyone just looks exactly the same. I just hate games that release early and then give you all the s hit later. Sure I'm totally fine with a game wanting to release a game early so more people can play it but at least give me something I can play with. EDIT Wow one actual extra skin for every character. And it only took 3 weeks to happen! I'm glad that they actually added a new set of skins but I'm sticking with my original statement.3. The ranking system really pisses me off. I hate it so much. Basically you need to survive 3 games and die in 0 of them in order to rank up (which is damn near impossible). After multiple hours I was finally able to get to rank 19 but then I lost 2 games and am literally back to the same position I was before. I really fu cking hate it4. The Murderers just watch the people on the fu cking hooks. It means that you can't save your friend because they'll just ing beat you a couple of times and wait for them to die. The only reason this happens is because of the game mechanics. There's no reason to actively hunt players when you're watching one on a hook because the generators take so fu cking long to fix. Whenever I play as Murderer I fu cking have to watch the people on the hooks otherwise they get saved and I have to search for them all over again which is just fuc king annoying as hell.5. The generators as previously mentioned suck so much to fix. They're slow as fu ck unless you somehow find other people to help you fix them and they constantly send you into this arcade game style ""Press the Button at a specific time"" thing. When you fail to fix it especially when the game fuc king lags out and makes you miss it the generator alerts the ing Murderer and they can easily find you. You also have to fix 5 of those fuc kers when in a full match which is basically impossible.6. THE FU CKING NEED TO FIND HELP S HIT. When you get hit by a Murderer twice you reamin prone and crawl around at about 2 meters an hour. I've seen snails zoom passed me while I was prone. The problem with being prone is that you literally cannot get the back up unless you find help. So if the murderer gets all 4 of you on prone there is LITERALLY no way you can win. The game does this Recover thing where you can sit there doing fuc king nothing execpt lie there like a dumbass and ""heal"". However when you finishing Recovering which is slower than the fu cking generators you are told you need to find help. FU CK YOU. WHY WOULD I NEED TO FIND HELP IF I'VE SAT HERE FOR FIVE MINUTES ""RECOVERING?"" It's fu cking idiotic. I hate being fu cking lied to about that s hit.7. The items get burned every time you play with them. The items you earn through spending this stupid fuc king Blood Currency can only be used once in a game. So when I spend 5 000 blood points on some fuc king springs for my trap I can't use it again. It's just fuc king annoying and discourages you from spending any of your money on their 8. The game is extremely fuc king confusing. Half of the perks you unlock make no sense (What the f uck does ""Decreases your chances of landing in Fuc kboi Manor when on fire"" mean?) Also when you spawn into a game two or three random perks just kinda pop up and then fly the away. I don't think you can earn them so it makes no sense why you'd have them in the first place.9. Overall unrealistic gameplay. Who the fu ck stands next to a box of wood while a murderer is chasing after them and just pulls it down? That box of wood is literally so fuc king annoying when you're the Murderer. The game sometimes glitches out so while you're far enough way from the box so that you're not touching it and someone pulls it down you still get hit by it and spend five fuc king seconds standing there like a dum bass. Also the bear trap barely works and half the time when people run into the places you set them down they just run off with nothing happening to them. Whenever you hit someone as the Murderer you kinda lick the blood and it slows you down. It's fuc king annoying and half the time I lose players because of it. Also why the fu ck does my character take 15 seconds to pull down a FUC KING LEVER in order to escape? It's obviously just that the DEVs wanted escape to take awhile but they have no ing imagination and thought people would be okay with you having to pull down a lever for 15 minutes.10. People just disconnect all the fuc king time. When you Murder someone there's no reason for them to stay so they pretty much always leave. It's just fuc king annoying and shows how little people care about those they're playing with in this game. I mean I really can't blame them the game's just so shi tty.11. The maps are pretty ing monotonous and all the same. Sure you can't memorize where different generators are and because it's procedurally generated but every map looks the same and has the exact same sh it every fuc king time.12. It's so hard to fuc king escape as the Survivor. The Murderer is faster than you and the only way to get an edge on them is by jumping over an obviously placed obstacle that takes the Murderer half an hour to step over or those previously mentioned crates. It's just fuc king annoying and you're pretty much screwed whenever the Murderer finds you. Sure there have been some instances when I've escaped but they were mainly because the Murderer had no idea what they were doing and I faked them out.13. This game is just fuc king terrible.14. Rubber band lag (which occurs about every 4 5 games) makes the game unplayable so I basically just auto leave.15. Whenever you use an item it automatically spawns you with it for the next game which wastes is so fu cking quickly. I just don't see any reason why a player would continue to want to waste their items therefore needing this system.There you go 15 reasons why not to buy this game. I'll probably think of more but I fu cking hated writing this review 'cause the game's so sh itty and I don't want to type anymore.If you're a rich piece of and you're wiping your with twenties here are a couple of reasons why you should buy the game So I can actually play as the fuc king Survivor The graphics aren't except for the fact that on the lobby screen every character does the exact same thing The music is kinda nice but it's literally a loop of the same fu cking guitar for about 10 seconds. On second thought it fuc king sucks. I actually enjoy playing with friends it's pretty fun and we all end up laughing. That's basically the only Pro I have for this game.So yeah if you like this game you have a disability.Fu ck you all CranberryElf6",Dead by Daylight

2017-01-17,0,0,586,False,Recommended,"Are you looking for gut wrenching fear?Are you looking for a heart racing experience?Are you looking for intensity and challenges?Dead by Daylight is a perfect game for this.POSITIVES 1. This game will make your heart race to its maximum beat. When you hear that heartbeat get faster and faster to see a giant figure with a monstrosity of a cleaver trying to find you your breath fogging the cupboard in fear. This game will always strive its best to scare you and succeeds everytime.2. The maps are very well detailed and realistic and provide a mysterious vibe to it (If you're new to it) you will roam the forests and explore its abhorrent past each map highlights itself in a creative way by putting in completely new biomes and lands. For example Cold Wind Farm. The corn that scatteres the lands will block your vision in the distance it will help you at times by hiding you or confusing your enemy or not see the killer coming from which direction and die from a blood soaked harvest. The maps will always have its useful traits to help you survive your nightmare but be careful!3. The Killers. My god do we have some frightening characters however there are negatives to these killers and i'll get to that in the negative section. The Killers are very creative and original by exploring abnormal powers to give them. For example The Wraith. The Wraith has invisibility to sneak up on his prey without knowledge of his presence to strike them before they can blink. The Developers really know how to give a good scare and pay attention to great detail to these killers to make them as frightening as possible.4. The Soundtrack. The music added to this game is so perfect and on point. Being chased by a person 2x your height with a meat cleaver is scary enough but with the creepy soundtrack of orchestra will open a vein for your blood to rush through. It honestly will scare the living daylights out of you (see what i did there) and always impress us players. My personal favourite soundtrack for this game is ""Closing In"" a terrifying noise. (Mostly used by The Trapper which also my most feared killer)NEGATIVES 1. Bugs. Yes we all knew i was going to talk about this and i sure as hell need to. The glitches in this game are just so common and annoying they constantly distract me from the game and take me out of the experience if not it wont even let me play the game at all. I have made a list of the bugs i can remember. (Yes i actually have to make a ing list) anyway here they are and hopefully they can fix these overtime.1. Constantly being taken to the main menu after searching for a game.2. No option to wiggle off the killer.3. Decicive Strike doesn't work after skill check is successfully completed.4. Items will not appear in game after selecting them. (and lose them)5. Peoples levels are resetting for no reason (This has not happened to me)These are the bugs i know of at the moment. I'm sure there are plenty more.2. Unrealism. Is it me or do the developers strive for a realistic horror game? At first i thought yes. The killer trapper hillbilly and The Shape are all realistic characters for some reason i just really don't like how they put in these new killers that completely break the realism. instead of just putting characters on a hook and slowly bleeding out this weird in claw thing tries to kill you which just makes no sense. The Trapper is a possible human being his map is possible and everything he can do is realistic and possible. I feel like i'm a real life character in the middle of nowwhere trapped in this place but then these claws from the sky just take me to heaven or someshit? it's just very strange and i don't know what they are striving for.SUGGESTIONS Just a few suggestions i think should be added or deflated in the game.1. I think Iron Grasp should be nerfed a bit. Once a killer gets a hold of that and the one when he moves faster while carrying victims it is damn near impossible to survive. Instead of 60% in Iron Grasp it should be about 30%. 60 is in rediculous.I have a character i thought of a month ago that i posted on the suggestions and feedback and i just want to highlight it here again.KILLER IDEA THE LUMBERJACKPLEASE READ ALL BEFORE YOU JUDGE!APPEARENCE A ripped bloody red and black checkered shirt. Blue shredded jeans with thick black boots. a dark grey trapper hat. A melted and burnt face with glowing red eyes. The lumberjack has his sleeves rolled up with traumatic scars and burns on him. The Lumberjack is abnormally large perhaps bigger than the trapper in size build and height.WEAPON A two handed axe (long reach but slower hit time)ABILITY Whilst playing The Lumberjack every barricade he breaks every time hes flashlighted every generator that is repaired. Everything that is against him a bar fills up. This is called The Animosity Meter. Once filled to the brim the player can activate it by pressing a button. The Lumberjack then stomps on the ground as hard and aggressivly as he can then screaming as loud as he can in anger. The survivors around the map can hear his deep loud scream in the distance. This endures fear in all survivors and does the following The Lumberjack walks 10% faster Survivors repair/sabotage 25% slower Survivors have heavier and louder breathing The Lumberjacks terror radius is increased by 15%The effects above are only active for 100 secondsThe most powerful part of his ability Whilst The Lumberjack is in rage mode he is able to smash one generator completely breaking it again for the survivors to once again repair. However there is a downside this can only be done within the first 10 seconds of the rage activated so its either you choose the effects above or you break a generator and deflate your ability completely.MAP The Snowbank Forest This map is a large snowy forest with an abnormally large cabin owned by the Lumberjack.

2016-08-20,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Absolutley no way would I recommend this game! Thankfully they gave us a free weekend to try it out before hand. Why is it bad? Where to even start?First things a real pain in the to play with friends. The game makes it damn near impossible to group with a small group of friends and get into a game with other players. One of you can be the killer and create a lobby and invite the others but you can't seem to open it to the public however through some strange series of events that I couldn't recreate we did have one moment when strangers were suddenly already present in the lobby when I created it. This never happened again. Since a game like this seems the perfect match for playing with friends this is more than disappointing. Secondly everything about the general gameplay is either off the mark entirely or boring as hell. All the killers feel the same they even seem to use the same attack animation they move the same attack the same the only difference is one ability each that makes them at all unique unless you ""level up"" to get more options. So playing the murderer soon becomes boring and repetitive no signature kills no gory and amazing moments of slasher flick goodness here. Just whack em twice stick on a meat hook and watch em squirm every time. The survivors gameplay is pretty much just a bland. Start generators run out exit such diverse gameplay. Finally competition. WTF! Whose brilliant idea was it to take a rock solid idea for a fun scary dare I even say it party game and vomit COD all over it. The forums for a game like this shouldn't be full of try hard neckbeards complaining about balance and leaderboards but people comparing crazy fun experiences they had with their friends. Yeah it should be casual it should be fun. No one wants to watch you people play your video games you will not be famous you will not be pro especially not in a game like this. The devs for this game seemed to have just totally missed the point in so many ways. They chose mundane oversimplified gameplay to promote competiiton and aid in balance rather than focusing on what would make a game like this a hit. Halloween cannot come soon enough Friday the 13th FTW!",Dead by Daylight

2016-09-08,1,2,1708,False,Recommended,It's a game with a lot of potential. But you should treat it like a Beta version. It still has a lot of bugs and balancing issues. From glitched out items to vastly underpowered perks. I myself am rank 1 in both killer and survivor and I can say without any doubt that ranking up with killer is child's play compared to ranking up as a survivor. You really need to mess up as a killer to drop in rank.Furthermore the grind to level up is very long also because of perks that are useless. There are some perks so useless that when you would combine two of them it would still be useless (like 'this is not happening' and 'deja vu'). If you are new to the game a camping killer will ruin your experience. Unfortunately most of them will be campers at the lower ranks as its easier and will still reward the killer with points. Also if you're starting to play as a killer you'll be annoyed by people who use infinite loops. But you'll learn how to deal with both cases as you get better.Then the matchmaking. You'll hear it from everyone but it's true. The matchmaking isn't just bad it's terrible. If you want to play with friends prepare to spent at least just as much time playing the game as waiting to finally get into a lobby. And don't expect to do something else in the meantime while you're searching for a lobby as you have to press the 'ready' button every 15 seconds.In the end it's still a good game eventhough it still needs a lot of work.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-27,0,0,556,False,Not Recommended,So... From a more critical point of view... Yes part of these negative reviews are due to the fact that killers were buffed but saying that only that would make the game so bad is nonsense... The major problem is that the devs are REALLY stupid and they don't have a clue about what they are doing they buff and nerf things that are far from being the main problems therefore by doing so they only make the real problems more anoying... Let me explain more clearly...I just had a game (against a strong trapper not that hard to be strong since it has been buffed) on that game none of the problems were about the power level itself of the killer because we were playing a 3x1 because 1 survivor disconnected making the game hard either way and not helping the survivors at all (we don't even get a reward like quitter bonus like the killer) survivors receive no punishment WHATSOEVER when they harm their team by leaving the game and the cherry on the top was the killer camping on a 3x1 like straight up camping we all died from 1 hook cuz it was impossible to rescue (completly eliminating the reason why we play the game) and besides that the ruin totem (a device that we need to deactivate to be able to survive) was probably near the hook because we couldn't find it...To sum it up... The devs don't know what they are doing and this is clear... They don't change the speed in which the gens are being done they put totems that brings inconsistency for the survivors AND the killers making the game more RNG based (anoying type of RNG)... They don't change the fact that the killer is INCENTIVISED to camp because he is REWARDED for that if not straight up face camp at least a soft camping like pretending he is not... So yeah boiz the game is completly broken to the core and the more the devs update it the clearer it gets that they don't know what they are doing... It's downhill from here so I REALLY don't advise anyone to buy it... If you want a multiplayer survival horror wait for Hide of Die that is coming up because I'm only playing this DBD because there aren't many games of this genre... Anyways THE GAME IS !,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-11,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,It must be just me cause everyone apparently loves this game. I think it's monotonous and tedious. The gameplay loop of find the generators and run from the killer or find the survivors and hang them simply isn't fun or engaging. It's like Left 4 Dead dumbed down to a crawl. There are thousands of factors in L4D that can change the game. The director the potential ambush locations of the special zombies the gun and item drops how fast the human players want to rush it etc. None of that in DbD. Simply split up and find the generators. Aside from pulling down a hanged survivor there's not many opportunities for teamwork. You can't help a survivor hide or place bait or distractions. There's simply nothing here but the barebones. It doesn't help that Starbreeze are scumbag publishers.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-13,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a game that requires a mic for true optimization. DBD is a slower paced reverse form of Evolved. You play either as a Killer or a Survivor. If you are the Killer your objective is to sacrifice all 4 survivors to the dark god. If you are a survivor turn on 5 motors to power 2 gates open 1 of the gate and escape. While it looks interesting in the ad DBD is sort of situational. The meta game is the real deciding factor. Do you have communications in real life?Gameplay wise if you are a Survivor the game moves kind of slow unless you are an experienced player with knowledge of the map and how to escape. The same scenario applies to the killer. There are perks for each character that you unlock with Blood Points and a Shine of Secrets where you can buy special powerups. However all these things turn me off. Knowing that there is a Level Creep from the start of the game makes me wonder why new players would even want to play. Conclusion you can try it but I think that the game design creates a form of optimization where you get vastly greater odds of winning if you can communicate. Optimally you need to play with other people who are able to communicate over voice chat with you outside of the game. Level creep is also a major turn off.PROS1. Interesting ConceptFear suspense and trepidationCONS1. Level CreepFor both sides the higher level you are the more perks you can unlock. If you start new you have absolutely zero perks. So the game basically starts you off at hardest difficulty and you can't help but wonder why?2. Mic RequirementThis game is highly dependent on teamwork. A group of friends with mics will have a much greater chance of success over the solo killer. This is the true crux of the game. Do the survivors have communication with each other?3. Wait TimesTurning on the engine is so slow. It's like 2 minutes doing nothing but cranking a generator. There's a reaction mini game where you have to press the Spacebar else the killer will know you're there but nothing else.3. Unsticky TargettingIf you run and try to vault through a window the game will sort of slide your character to side. My guess is that the developers do this to make players get a sense of fear when they are getting chased. However it is very silly to do as you might not be getting chased.SUGGESTIONS1. PlaybackI kind of wanted to see the strategies at the end of the match. e.g. Where did everyone hide? How did the killer move? It doesn't have to be a full blow by blow. Just a minimap view would be great.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-15,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Dead by Daylight has some major problems.I'll start at the beginning. Right at the start of any match the game freezes and stutters heavily while it loads in textures. What the heck is a loading screen even for if you're going to continue loading during gameplay.This period of stuttering and freezing lasts about 30 seconds before things stabilise and its mostly smooth from then on but those first few seconds can be critical. If you're unlucky enough to have the killer come in your direction its possible to get cut down while you're still loading in.The game is generally poorly optimised framerates are far too low for the graphical quality on offer and there are no advanced graphics settings to customise only a generic low/medium/high/ultra. I am btw running on ultra though lowering it doesnt seem to make much difference to visuals.Everything is also just plain ugly. Part of it is the horror aesthetic everything's supposed to look filthy rusted muddy dark and dingy. But this is nothing like say resident evil 7. Too many textures are blurry and low res especially the characters. Too many baked shadows and highlights are used to compensate for a lack of lighting tech everything looks flat as if it were made in an era before normal mapping existed. Lights show through walls the gameworld feels cluttered and messy your eye can't comfortably rest on anything. And everything is covered in a sickening orangey/greeney/brown tint. The draw distance is short a lot of art assets are reused endlessly and every map looks and feels the same. The game is just an eyesore to look at beyond what the aesthetic calls for.There's a definite attempt at a horror feel but it gets lost on mechanics. For some absurd reason the survivors get a third person perspective and the killer is in a more restrictive first person view. Anyone with a lick of sense can point out this is the opposite of what would be scary. Survivors can pan their camera around and have 360 degree view at all times so its easy to outflank the killer or to watch him while you have your back turned and doing stuff right under his nose.Theres too much focus on too few mechanics. Exploiting windows and pallets to slow down the killer and stall for time abusing every geometric feature on the landscape. Survivors can be rescued from a hook in a comically short time and are immune to attack during many animations. The short unhook time is the dumbest feature of all people will run right up to your prisoner and unhook them infront of your eyes you can't interrupt the animation because of your attack cooldowns and invincibility frames for the survivorsThe killer's only recourse to the unhook mechanics is to sit there and camp someone while they hang but even then you can't stop it all you can do is get in one hit during the process and most likely take the rescuer in exchange for losing the prisoner. Blink for a second and they're both gone.But despite being forced to do it by design people somehow hate camping and will rage at you in postgame chat if you don't just quit. Probably due to the losing items on death (see below) survivors are always salty about losing. The community in general seems terrible and constantly angry at everyone. Survivor players expect you to roll over and let them win there will be salt in postgame chat if you do anything else.Generator mechanics are similarly stupid. The killer needs to go through a 3 second animation to sabotage a generator which will cause its progress to decay. But survivors only need to touch it for 0.1 seconds to reverse the sabotage. Which leads to more stupid moments as survivors run up and repair it right infront of your eyes and sometimes even before you finish the sabotaging animationThe gameplay forces you away from the horror feel that everything else is trying to inspire and gameplay often becomes slapstick like an episode of scooby doo. When you play killer its like herding cats or trying to pickup bars of soap with wet hands. You don't feel powerful or monstrous you just feel silly. Survivors are cheeky and do not give a fear is exactly the opposite of what they display as they keep unhooking each other in a game of whack a mole. Playing survivor is about exploiting all the t you can and a lot of it makes no sense from either perspective.In general there aren't enough mechanics. You see one pallet or wardrobe or generator you've seen them all. Theres only one gamemode and a handful of maps that all look identical and reuse assets constantly. It feels like a small part of what should be a bigger game and its disappointing that that's all there is.There's no way to communicate ingame. While it sort of makes sense that there's no global chat it seems silly that you can't locally shout to other survivors. Impromptu tactical planning with a risk of being overheard would add some depth to things.Also irksome you often can't communicate out of game. Since the game seems to use P2P multiplayer single lobbies with no run on matches. So at the end of every match on the postgame screen there's nothing to do but leave and start another. And if the host leaves instantly (which they often will) then the postgame chat lobby shuts down too and you can't talk to the other players about what happenedThe game gives you a sort of skill tree which you constantly unlock new things in. It seems great at first you can take one tool into a game with you each with a very specific niche and often weak feature. As permananant unlocks they seem minor and pretty balanced then i found out that all of this stuff is temporary. Items and addons that you buy there are theoretically persistent if you dont die. Die in a match and they're lost. You also get ""offerings"" which are consumable items that do something for one match like increase the chance of a certain map or give a small bonus to XP. Nothing that actually feels powerful or remotely worth the time it takes to use. So why on earth did these things have to be single useAlmost nothing can actually be unlocked and kept you're constantly knocked back to nothing and all sense of progression is lost. It never feels like you're accomplishing anything. Everything you do unlock feels pointlessly weak and token too. If these are going to be temporary things they should have been a lot stronger. Everything feels like it was balanced around permanant unlocks and then they were made temporary and loseable for no reason at allThere is some fun to be had. If you try to ignore the slapstick nature of many mechanics just immerse yourself and try to enjoy it it can last for a couple hours maybe a day or two. I'm writing this on a free weekend.but longterm? I can't see much to it5.5/10Needs a lot of reworking gameplay a complete graphical overhaul and more maps that are actually different.Maybe they'll make a sequel and improve on it.

2019-01-20,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This game could be fun if There should be hooks only under the main building and maybe 2 3 scattered around the map. Currently there is a hook few meters away from each generator and usually every 20m or so. Wiggling this way is useless. Dismantled hooks also respawns way too fast. Make killer slower. (Assuming the psyho has brains. D) Blocking the way is never a solution because it can going around at still be up your back. Also if the victim crouches and the killer does not see the prey escape it is common sense to search around. This leads to an issue that blocking and hiding not an option. If people run there are trails behind them soo yeah also not favorable. At least 50% of my plays were laggy as hell. Survivals should have stun capability of some sort so they can free each other (with a reasonable cooldown). Killers were camping they hooked victims. When the killer found let's say 2 3 generators constantly checking them and bleeding out sacrifices are a tactic that cannot be countered.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-29,0,0,114,False,Not Recommended,Dead By Daylight is great....as long as you're a killer main. Playing survivor in this game is just becoming less and less fun. Yes I understand the killers are supposed to have an advantage but every little thing that survivors can use to live is steadily being nerfed. Any major stratagy and mechanic survivors find to use eventually gets nerfed due to killer mains complaining when they can't kill all four of the survivors which they're not meant to do unless they're actually a good killer. The few times I've played killer since all of the changes it is quite easy to see who the devs listen to and who they ignore. Meta perks on survivors continue to be nerfed and rendered useless while meta perks for killers remain the same with certain killers recieving their own buffs. If you're going to play be a killer main but play the nurse so that when you act like you're super skilled at the game it will be true.Update Still no fixes to these issues and they've made them worse with the additions of new perks that make it so the one vunerability that killers had that being their hex perks which are able to be taken out now becoming a trap for survivors. They also refuse to fix the issue with killers dropping survivors who run decisive strike which basically voids a survivor perk while survivors cannot void the strongest of killer perks. Still can't recommend this game as it spirals farther and farther downard.,Dead by Daylight

Iron Grasp 3 can carry you all the way across the map with no problem. I Highly recommended this game once upon a time but those days have long since passed. Its Unbalanced!

2018-02-16,0,0,402,False,Not Recommended,i dont main killer but i do main survivor. right now the game is so unbalanced with certain killers being way to op. hillbilly and nurse with bbq chilli perk. they nerfed borrowed time a perk that helped against killers camping you on hooks. and to top it off so many killers have 1 shot kill moves either built into there kit of added in with hex totems and perks. Ifyou plan on playing hardcore and getting to low rank you will have to deal with this. survive with friends is good but not everyone is playing swf while killers can use bbq chilli and hillbilly or nurse at anytime. developers have stepped so far away from balancing the game and are saturating the game with perks instead to use as band aids against issues. the problem with this is once one issue is solved another arises. the game use to be fun and still can be. but as you move lower down the ranks i suggest swf. I know there are perks for survivors that are op as well but no amount of skill hides you when a hillbilly or nurse sees you and runs across map in 3 4 seconds,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-28,1,1,673,False,Not Recommended,I love this game so much but sadly as much as i love it i can't recomend it ! Wanna know why ? It ing sucks ( If you play survivor is ok but if you play killer...God forbid ! Well let's start with the palets if you find a looper he will go around the obstacles in the palet area for well let's say forever and it ing sucks cause you have to catch the dude and you lose time by doing so ! Also if you let him go cause you don't wanna spend precious time by trying to catch him bad for you cause guess what he is still alive ! As for the windows omfg on the Institute and Hadon it's a ing nightmare and Springwood and Auto are super full of palets yep you're right you are as good as dead on this map and wow you play killer which cannot die ! If we are talking about generators well that's the most ing OP part of the game for survivors they can repair it but not one not two all 4 of them ! 4 survivors on a generator ? Let's rush them all then and holly sweet mother of cool games they really do it just to make you get angry ! About perks hmmm they cand disable your perks if you are using a hex for instance ! Now let me get this straight it's 4 against one you can do all this i just talked about and you can also disable my hex ? Jesus christ so unbalanced ! You wanna know about items ? All are cool really but the flashlight ... isn't it too ed up when i work so hard to catch a survivor and when i finally do one of you comes around and blinds me with the almighty flashlight that is so powerful than the ing sun itself ? Let's not forget about body blocking oh yeah that part of the game when i catch someone and i try to take him to a hook but guess what ? Survivors can rush your and block you so can't get to the hook ! Of course you will hit them to get away but that means only more time for the survivor to wiggle and get free from your grasp ! Also if you didn't know if they down a palet on your you will drop the survivor cool right ? And finally after you worked you so much for almost nothing they power the generators and they can escape but it's ok cause you say ok i'll guard the gate and they won't get out ! Sadly my friend they have 2 gates they can use to escape ! Like it's not enough they also have a hatch spawned somewhere on the map that leads to freedom ! I would be ok with all of that cause when they release a DLC i pay for that mother ing killer to have it as paid for it but no a crybaby survivor can complain cause it's right to do so and my dear killer that paid money for gets nurfed ( cause it's OP . you know ) to the point that he is no longer a killer just a useless puppet that i can control and get done with it cause it was OP once and needed to be nerfed ! Don't get me wrong the idea of the game is awesome but seriously it's too ing unbalanced in the advantage of the survivors ! If you want to play survivor with your friends it's cool yo will have lots of fun but if you are buying the game for the killers you are giving your money for nothing ! With all that being said your game untill you don't do something to balance this i'm out ! You guys just lost not only a customer but also a devoted player !,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-23,0,0,290,False,Not Recommended,"Idea is good. Game is fun (to a certain point). I bought it hoping that they will improve it in future. At this time its not something i would recommend. Heres why 1. Terrible optimization. I have a pretty decent gaming PC and for some reason i have to run this game on medium settings and even then sooner or later i start experienceing fps drops. And no it is not my coolers or whatever.2. Lack of settings and stuff. In options you can do only 5 6 adjustments. You cant even turn off the damn music which becomes extremely annoying.3. Even on ultra graphic settings graphics are honestly meh... Animations and character details are 2008.4. No chat or other ways of communication.5. My biggest problem with this game is that devs probably never dealt with the game that is even remotely competitive. This game has so many BASIC flaws in terms of fair ranked play i thought this cannot happen in 2016 heres some of them Poorly designed stages. With low level Killer there are certain points on maps where it is just mathematically impossible for a killer to get to survivor. I had this happen to me a few times where i was 1x1 vs a survivor and we were just staring at each other until the match is timed out cause there is no way im getting to him and there is no way he lets me do it. Again killers are totally screwed by childish survivor players. They can just ragequit stripping you of points. AND GODS FORBID if you pick up a ragequitting player because you willl glitch out and be stuck just standing htere holding their disconnected noob till the end of the round. Absolutely idiotic (imo) progression system. Who the hell wants to spend points on MANDATORY CONSUMABLES? Just give us damn skill trees like any normal game. I dont want to be forced to buy a damn ""car license plate"" that ""increases the chance to be sent to a certain map"" pf who the hell cares? Can you imagine any other game that would say "" Oh you want to level up? Hm.... How about you buy and drink 20 potions first and then we'll talk?"" Pf.... No. Thats just stupid. You win you rank down. Yes this is how this game rolls ) Never seen stupid like that before )THese are just some of the cons of this game that i remmebered when typing this.

2016-07-07,0,0,566,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Very good game. Mainly just strategy and a tiny bit of horror. One thing I do not like about the game are the overpriced DLC's. I mean they are good DLC's but $7 for just a killer and a survivor?I think the customization dlc's are fine at $3. But now they have the Shrine of Secrets. Which makes it so you can get the perks of the characters without leveling them up. So.. Whats the point of buying the DLC? Now you do get to play with the killer and survivor thats one thing. Another thing is that you can prestige them to look cool. But now with the Shrine of Secrets there is no point of upgrading the character if it has a chance of popping up in the Shrine.Besides that I give the game an 8.5/10 on Creativity and a 7/10 on Gameplay!,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-21,0,0,584,False,Recommended,"Im going to start with my rating out of 10 I personally would rate this game as a 8/10 This is becuase its absolutely awesome to play it has a great fear factor and feels like a horror game as you dont know what is going to happen and its amazing if you can get a team of 4 (your friends) and then go and survive together while on skype or teamspeak etc. But the reason its not a 9 or 10 is that there is quite a lot of issues and quirks with the gameplay that i dont like too much 1. Killers have become too op in last patch they have a lrger attack range so they can kill after you have stunned or jumped over a pallet and you will get hurt posiibly on the floor if you have been chaes and previously injured. 2. Matchmaking is f*cking horrible if you search on your own it mostly comes up saying ""failed to join game"" or I will be sent back to the main menu but it is still possible to get into a match but takes like 5 mins Those are the two main issues but still it is a very enjoyable game and I have spent these 14 hours having lots of fun with friends surviving or killing people as a murderer (Yes I have only got 14 hourse but still wanted to give a honest review probably will make a new one once played a LOT more and added new content.)

2018-07-05,0,0,768,False,Not Recommended,the game was amazing. but sadly im gonna have to say i wont be playing much more after they make these updates. im a survivor main.... im bad at killer. so i personally dont try to be killer often. but people who main killer are a real challenge and thats really cool.. but they are starting to give the killer the main advantage... first off they have mori which i dont agree with. with that they can kill almost all survivors pretty fast because there is no limit on how many times they can use it. so ive seen my whole team go down in 3 minutes from that perk. makes playing frusturating. and id be fine with it if it were fair. for example survivors get perks like unbreakable but they can only use it once a whole game which really sucks for someone who isnt great at dodging killers and needs that extra life line. secondly we have sprint burst which is really helpful when being chased because killers are already faster then us so getting that extra burst of speed is amazing help but its now going to be useless with this update since it will no longer regenerate as your being chased. sabotage has become a useless perk for us once again. and now they are making killers faster then they already are? not cool.... self heal is being slowed down and making it that if we cant fully heal in one spot if we move we have to start over again which is hard when killers have nurses calling and can see us healing and get to us. they are boosting killers up to much to where it will genuinely be impossible to play against them. teams arent gonna want to help each other anymore in fear they will be captured by all the amazing perks killers are getting and perks survivors are getting. it not worth it anymore after this update. it will genuinely be a horrible game and im sorry but your going to lose alot of players . its no longer fair and the amount of players has already gone down. now its going to be worse was once my favorite game but it may no longer be a game i play daily and spend money on. i think if it becomes as bad as it sounds ill uninstall the game for good. so buyers beware.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-06,0,0,39,False,Recommended,I will start out by saying that I was very against buying this game but a friend of mine had it and pressured me into it. Boy am I glad he did! All of the bad reviews for this game are nitpicks (aside from losing your progress) that in the end do not ruin the gameplay one bit. Just play the game for a couple days and don't worry about how long it takes to get a game going. Just alt tab and browse reddit or something. I've noticed that most of the time the game works perfectly fine. Play the game for a few days because most of the glitches seem to be gone after you get some character progression and learn not to touch menus while the games are searching/loading. I learned to survive and realised that camping killers are only harming themselves. You can almost get the exit open with three people in the time one person dies from hanging on the hook. If you see a camper just go and work on the generators! They are giving you a free win.Also before you complain about the killers go and play a couple of them. Their eyesight and hearing is limited the survivors can easily outrun you if they know where barriers are and you have to get your attack down perfect or you'll miss every time. I found them being way harder to play than the survivors. In the end this is easily worth the money I got it on sale for and I'd say worth the $20 even with the glitches you'll encounter.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-31,0,0,188,False,Recommended,Games fun Needs more maps though gets extremely repetitive. I hope they are working on a huge DLC right now. The one new killer survivor and single map DLC is lazy if you ask me. I want to see different maps different objectives and a larger player customization. Things that need to be added More killers More player customization MORE MAPS More objectives ( Something other than starting generators ) Offline with bots would be nice.. Larger map like a new game mode with a large map. A story mode maybe that you need all 4 people to complete?? and not just starting generators. Maybe you need to find parts build something like a vehicle all while avoiding the killer. Once the vehicle is finished everyone needs to get in or be left behind to find the alternative exit. (Just an idea dont get your panties in a bunch). Map voting before hand. ( Each lobby votes for a map because lately I've literally been playing the same maps over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Yes its that repetitive. I would be totally okay with that if they weren't complete garbage not scary at all maps. ) Give the community Dev tools at the very least and open the workshop to the public. Let us make the DLC because we clearly aren't getting anything decent from you guys anytime soon. This game needs to step it up because the moment Friday the 13th comes out this game will die.My actual review The game play was slightly terrifying at first but once you figure out what needs to be done if anything the mechanics of some of the killers will just start to annoy you. The graphics are okay but look a bit pixelyish and not as great as they could be. Max settings 1080p and the game runs very smooth 100+ fps no problem. Its extremely repetitive that's for sure. For me though once the fear was gone the fun was gone and that happened pretty quickly. Some things people are saying about the game that i dont understand Not playing well i would have to assume they are playing on a potato because it runs smooth as can be on my end. not being able to get into a game. now this was an issue a while back but it takes no time at all to get into a match..so again someones on potato internet. Overall its a fun game. I just wish they would add more too it. Do i recommend it? I do if you can get it for a decent price otherwise i'd wait for a sale.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-03,1,1,876,False,Not Recommended,I used to enjoy this game a lot back then during 2017 and early 2018. Now the game has been through some heavy changes and they aren't particularly good ones either. The survivors have been weakened so much that now it boils down to one playstyle which is stealth. Stealth isn't fun period. There are less and less confrontational gameplay with survivors against killers due to the changes made to self care bnp exhaustion perks flashlights etc. so the way the game is going its completely killer sided. I understand that it is an asymmetrical game and that killers should have more power over the 4 survivors but the majority can agree that the killers are simply receiving too much at this moment.The developers have listened to the complaints of the minorities and the game is no longer as fun as before. Oh and if Decisive Strike gets nerfed as they say in the upcoming patch there goes more of your % of survival.,Dead by Daylight
2018-09-23,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Summary it is a cheap reference fest hiding a hollow walking sim not worth a dollar. Don't buy it. The gameplay is on the level of Gone Home ( not recommended either ).I'm a free weekender. The game tries to mash together online coop and survival to cash in on the dying fad without adding any original content. Behaviour is a Canadian jobber developer studio behind such games as Fallout Shelter so you would be really stupid to expect much from them. Even this game is a walking sim souped up with mainstream horror movie references. I have seen IRC chat logs more interactive than this game.In practice Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer walking sim with a killer thrown in to grief the walking sim experience of other players. You move around the map maybe interacting with sparse objects incl. other players every now and after about 5 to 15 minutes it ends. No end of the game gratification of any kind except for some currency points (there are four kinds of them) and run of the mill experience points. You are expected to pay 20 USD for the stuff you can find better implemented on some free Unity multiplayer games.Believe me I am hitting the highlights here. There are some really problems in execution. But as this is a dime in a dozen coop survival/action game w/ objectives like ""press e to progress"" I am going to put in equally little effort. Here is an incomplete list instead 1. Godawful optimizing issues w/ the menu screen consuming tons of processing power even in low quality settings.2. The game wastes your time. It doesn't help you and makes you grind for basic abilities. Beginners get the shaft.3. It is all about cheesing. Forget skill let us circle around a tree once to lose the killer.4. The game is tilted in favour of the non killers. If the killer cannot find the survivors it automatically loses.5. It gets repetitive very quick. It's super formulaic. Usually there is only one helpful thing to do in any situation.6. A beginner is restricted to Huntress a hard to play slow as death killer character with axes. A d**k move devs.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,Gotta say.. The game in essence is fun. However I find that it is almost impossible to rank up due to the killer rage quitting and making everybody lose the game and all the blood points and previous rank point that they have aquired. It also annoys me that the wraith can just follow anybody he wants anywhere with the survivor having no hope of losing him simply because of his movement speed. It is impossible to hide from somebody that you can't get out of line of sight from. The hooks are placed way to close together. I have had four three people coordinate a rescue from one teammate that got hooked The wraith managed to kill everybody and then hook every single one of us nearby and win the game. Getting into a match in itself if a task. As a survior I have found myself queing up for a match and entering a loading screen which brings me back to the main menu constantly for at least 3 to four minutes at a time before being placed into a match. As the killed you have to pray to god that nobody leaves the lobby otherwise it will never fill up. I have waited 20 minutes as the killer without a single survivor being placed in my game after the initial four. Matchmaking should be based on who has been waiting the longest. Not whatever system that has been set up in this game.I find that design flaws such as these unacceptable and so I cannot reccoming this game until changes have been made.I must add after further experiencing the game I have come across new issues based off of the killer's (host) connection. I have been rubber banded from escaping the killer and being pulled right back infront of him or being rubber banded back to the opposite side of a window and also teleporting inside of the killer because of their connection. I have now died and lost my rank multiple times because of this. DEVS DON'T MAKE THE KILLER THE HOST OF THE LOBBY. IF YOU DO AT LEAST TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SURVIVORS. The game isincredibly unfair at most times and a ranking system does not belong in this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-28,0,0,487,False,Recommended,Recently this game has had an update. To be completly honest it has improved massively. The game seems to be more balanced. The survivors are now using there brains and partying up. If you play a game against some teamed up players you are now sure to loose. BUT the problem with this game now is the community. This game has a very bad community. 1/10 games will acknoledge a good game or just move on to the next BUT 9/10 times they dont. Everyone seems to be insulting each other. Whether it be one survivor to another saying how they were or calling a killer camper for chasing a survivor remotely close to the hook. I can deal with that What I cant deal with is the crap you get as a killer even if you loose. Especially RANK 1 survivors seem to insult and ridicule a killer even if they all escaped. I recommend the games after match chat to be removed. Becuase people seem to be think to much with there big heads. Saying to much can push a killer to start hook or body camp. That would once again ruin the game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Dead By Daylight has A LOT of potential but it just hasnt fully come into it yet. The game's concept is great and i love the atmosphere of the game but everything else is lacking. The game is extremely repeatative. This mostly do with how the maps are structured. All of the maps are pretty much the same with just a different paint job for every single one. Being the killer is really fun and all of the killers have a unique power. However the hit detection is awful. You have to be like 6 inches away from the person to hit them and even then it may not connect. Also because of the powers there are some killers that are far better then others (The Wraith is great. The Hillbilly is okay. The Trapper is bad). Being a survivor is a lot of fun! it is very tense and thrilling when you are being chased by a killer and it adds a sense of urgency. Continually cooperating with other survivors can prove useful like when one of them distracts the killer while the other repairs the generator(s). For that reason the game is great played with friends. Unfortuantely this is where the biggest issue comes in there is NO PARTY SYSTEM in the game. I cannot get over the fact that an online based game does not have something as simple as a party system. You cannot duo que with friends or anything of the sort. The only one to play with friends is have a private match and hope that 4 other friends have the game and are all on at the same time. In private you can play with as many (or as little) survivors as you want but without 4 survivors the game is damn near impossible to have fun playing or even beating. Simply put the game isnt finished. It has a lot of great ideas and the gameplay (for what gameplay there is) is fun but it lacks the polish that it desperately needs. I REALLY wanna like this game but I cant. Don't buy it right now. Wait until they polish up a bit BEST ASPECT THE ATMOSPHERE/PREMISE WORST ASPECT NO PARTY SYSTEM FINAL VERDICT 4/10,Dead by Daylight
2018-03-26,0,0,1277,False,Not Recommended,As a Christian father I choose not to allow video games into my household but occasionally my boys will have sleep overs with other Christian families that might be more lax than ours. Imagine my surprise the other day when I overheard my second oldest boy talking about a video game he had played at a friend s house. As soon as I heard the name Dead By Daylight my suspicions grew and I immediately found myself wondering which body part the game might be referring to.I rushed to the computer that I keep locked away from my impressionable children and what I found was truly disturbing. Just 10 minutes of Bing research produced so much evidence that this game was a homosexual recruitment tool that I have now forbidden it. You better believe that I called the other father and gave him a good talking to. As a devout Christian he agreed with me and has now burned his Dead By Daylight DVD on his barbeque grill to make sure this threat to his family is gone for good.Here are some of the things I have learned This game is made by BHVR incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary of NAMBLA the people who invented child molestation. Just the name BHVR produces images in the mind of a Christian man that should not be there.Game play takes place in a forest where children are encouraged to use their mechanical skills to fix generators to create glory holes. In case you haven t heard of this filth glory holes are all the rage in gay circles where sweating homosexuals drill holes into walls and then perform sex through them without having to show their guilt ridden faces. There is one thing a homosexual hates and that is for their shame to be seen in the light of day. That is why their bars and bath houses are kept so dark at all times. And believe me friend this game is dark and shadowy.Glory hole in the game.Glory hole in homo gay forest. Hard to tell the difference right?There are four adorable survivors and one killer. Who doesn t love this? Kids sure do. Well these 2 survivors are a homosexual couple. The Jake one is the dominate bear and the Dwight one is the swishing bottom. Even the voices are clearly transexual which is a dead give away. I shudder to think of what life style choices a little child will think is decent after pretending to be one of these two gays. Instead of they have glowing orange sparkly lights in their sex area.As if that was not enough there are mechanical testicles and gay saunas around every corner. Not enough? Well this game introduces Sprint Burst which help the innocent children slide through a glowing red sphincter.I could go on but my stomach is turning at this latest homo gay invention. There is nothing christ centered in this game. Protect your children from this latest assault from the gay agenda.,Dead by Daylight

As a survivor you may play versus a skilled killer in which case no pallet loops or flashlights will save you.

Or you may be faced with the proverbial ""baby killer"" in which case you win but it's no fun because your team powered the 5 generators needed to progress the game in mere minutes.As a killer you may face a group of 4 prestige III Claudettes which can be seen only in direct sunlight who will make you life miserable with flashlights loops and then all 4 of them escape. Or you can put your various killer abilities to test use them as much as you can and have a party of 4 hanging in the basement.Balance is one thing players of different skills make this game replayable enjoyable unpredictable.Pros+ fun to play even without friends+ fun to play with friends+ diversity of characters perks and items to choose from for each game (don't mind meta if you're having fun with No Mither)+ challenging situations+ stuff on maps is RNG so each game is uniqueCons lobby times as a killer still buggy bloodpoints (which you spend to gain abilities perks items and add ons) are without the right perks not too quick to gainThe game is worth it.

2018-07-29,0,0,458,False,Recommended,"IntroductionAfter hearing about the influx of negative reviews of this game I decided to take a look as to why that was. The first part of this review will cover my observations as to why there is so much outrage about the most recent patch 2.1 or the first mid chapter patch. The second part will cover my thoughts on the game and why I am giving it a positive review even though the game is not balanced (but will a game ever really be 100% balanced)?Warning This review has foul language in it and may not be appropriate for some. This review is also coming from one whose hours are majority killer but I am playing survivor over killer now. I will go into why this is towards the end of the review.Part 1 Upset About ChangeMy first observation was that the majority of those who left negative reviews within the last week of me writing this review had under 50 hours played. In no way is that enough to have a full understanding of the game and its mechanics. My second observation is that they all use foul language and call the developers names. This instantly makes their opinion vald if they can't even form proper sentences or thoughts without resorting to swearing.My third observation is that they are complaining that the killer is overpowered now. In a game that is 4v1 that only makes sense. No longer can survivors run out in the open without risking being hooked or using an exhaustion perk to run to the nearest pallet.Conclusion Knee Jerk ReviewsAs a result of looking at reviews it's clear that not only do new players who do not have the patience to learn how to play the game as well as long term players (800+ hours) who won't take the time to learn the counters of the killers who got buffed in the recent patch. The trapper and hag can now place traps faster which means that survivors have to have more awareness as to where the killer is and what they are doing. Before the 2.1 update those two killers required at least 3 seconds to place a trap which wasted valuable time which in turn gave surivors more time to hold the left mouse button. The removal of the ""pallet vacuum"" in patch 2.0 made looping a killer (literally running around in circles between a pallet and whatever obstacle there is based on the map) a less effective strategy. Before you could easily run around 3 to 4 times (based on the streams and videos I watched and a small amount of times I played survivor before the 2.0 patch) and instantly teleport to the other side which made you safe from a killer swing.This was the most frustrating part of playing killer when I first started playing the game. That is why I started playing the killer ""The Nurse"" who could teleport through walls and obstacles making survivor looping almost useless. She also required a lot of skill to be successful with her and could be easily avoided by good survivors. That is why I played killer at the start of my time with this game. The killer required skills like mindgaming the survivor (hiding their red stain from the survivors) or using their eyes to find hiding survivors who blended into the environment. Every match I played I was thinking of getting 4 kills which made the game a challenge since it was very difficult to do this post 2.0 patch.Now the main reason for these negative reviews are the actual ""bad players"" who once thought they were ""good"" because of the pallet vacuums pre nerf exhaustion perks and slow killer animation times which made flashlight saves easy (although lightborne makes it impossible to flashlight save now which needs to be fixed). They are frustrated because survivor actually requires skill now and they expect to instantly win when they press the ready up button. The same thing happened when Freddy was released because he was considiered ""OP"" and the bad players flooded the steam forums for this game saying he was impossible to win against so the developers did a knee jerk patch to nerf him (this was before I started playing so this may not be 100% accurate). This can also be confused with ""entitled survivors"" or ""entitled killers."" I have no idea when this started but because of some people think they think that they deserve to win (escape or get a 4 kill) because they are playing one side. Most of the time the ""entitled survivors"" will be the most toxic people you will meet in a video game.These surviors are usually hovering around the 16 to 20 ranks and think they they deserve to escape the trial or purposely lose ranks and use survive with friends to bully new killers who are just trying out the game. If they do escape things like ""gg ez baby killer"" or ""duuud easy baby killerino"" something that was made popular by a streamer / YouTube creator who not only hacked multiple times but showed exploits on stream and now is hardware banned from this game. Tells you something about him and his followers. I digress but if those survivors die because they made a mistake or just aren't good you can expect ""you are trash go kill yourself"" or being called the N word (hard r I believe I have pictures on my profile being called this multiple times because a survivor died to me when I had less than 100 hours played) among other horrible language. You can expect similar sayings by ""entitled killers"" or have them block you in an area where you cannot get out and are forced to either close the game or wait until they move or do the same (something that is bannable by the way). Part 2 My Review and OpinionsThis game with the latest patch (2.1) is no longer ""Bully the Killer Simulator."" All of the rank 15 survivors who thought they were ""god tier"" are now upset that it takes actually skill to not get caught or hooked. Playing ""Nascar"" or surivor by running circles around pallets is no longer a way to evade the killer for 5 generators anymore. Things like losing line of sight running away when they place a trap (against the trapper or hag) or playing mindgames are now required to be a successful survivor. Now onto reviewing each side.Killer I first started playing this game as killer because I saw that each one had it's own unique power such as slowing down survivors as The Clown or removing your terror radius and putting reverse bear traps on survivors as The Pig something that cannot be said about survivors. I also thought that killer required more skill since they cannot injure you. For most chases you are in control of their movement. You move right at a jungle gym? They go left. You broke a pallet to the right? Move left to force them to go right where a pallet isn't. Behind a solid wall where they cannot see your body? Look one way but move the other tricking them that you are actually going the other way. Simple mindgames.That is the fun part of playing the killer. The less fun part? Chases. Running around in circles because a survivor found a safe pallet or a jungle gym right next to the killer shack creating an almost infinite loop if played properly by them. This comes down to each map being randomly generated as well as how those loops are designed. In a recent developer stream they mentioned and showed some of the obstacles being tilted and higher up allowing mindgames to happen when they could not be before. This is a step in the right direction but was only available for one or two maps for one realm if I remeber correctly.With over 10 killers in the game now with their own power there are certain killers which you will be more attracted to play. Killer is fun to play but I think the recent changes to The Hag and Trapper may have been a bit too powerful (1 second to place a trap for the hag making her a top tier killer because she can stop loops like the Clown but faster.I ran out of space to type but I still wanted to review the survivor side. I will try to do that in my comments.",Dead by Daylight

But as soon as you reach the rank 10 and below this game is absolute garbage.Killers are stupidly OP (Nurse and doctor)Emblem system (Which is the rank system) is legit trash killers pip so easily. On the other hand susvivor emblem is legit way too hard. You get chased the entire game fpor 10+ mins? Oh you can't pip because you didn't help with gens or your team. You do gens but don't get chased? you you won't pip. Your teamates kill themsevles because they rage? You don't pip because you didn't help your DEAD team. You did everything right but didn't survive? You don't pip it's a survival game bro.The devs don't listen to the community at all. They can't balance their game at all. The only killers played are Hillbilly Nurse and Doctor. Why you wonder? Because if you don't get a 4k with them you are legit trash come on dude they are busted as You can call me a salty survivor main I played this game since the beggining when survivors were OP and yeah it wasn't fun for killers. But why do you have to change the roles now? Just balance your stupid game.Also killer perks are way too busted compared to survivors'. You can see survivor on the entir map for like 5 secondes when you hook someone you see everybody healing in your 32m terror radius range. Hex Ruin it says it in the name it ruins ing everything fun gameplay survivability because you can't do a single gen because of that Whispers killers knows if you are close to them they will just search like a ing moron for 2 years and a half to find you. This game is not fun it's frustrating as windows are useless and pallets the same because 8 out of 11 killers don't give a single about pallets or windows they will just run you over.People will get bored of this game eventually if they don't do something major about all the problems. If they listen to their community it might get a lot better.Btw plz delete Nurse. ''I think we did a pretty good game so far'' Mathieu Côté.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-21,1,3,1,False,Not Recommended,"""Dead by Daylight"" or as I like to call it ""Kite the Killer "" is a disappointment on some many different levels. The idea of the game itself seems promising but in its current state I'm afraid it fails one too many levels to be fun.The public seems to have caught the 4v1 genre bug and two of the most current titles that come to mind are (the superior) ""Unfortunate Spacemen"" and impending ""Friday the 13th"" release. I've certainly caught this bug and had high hopes for this game but my heart sank quickly after I began playing the game.First let me explain how a round is won. As the Killer you must find and melee hit a survivor twice (or once with the comically useless ""Chainsaw"" trait but more on that later). On the second hit you pick the survivor up and must find a sacrifice hook to hang the survivor on which if left there after about a min or two the hook comes alive and ""digests"" the survivor. Okay....As one of four survivors you must start three of six generators to restore power to open one of three electrical doors and escape thus winning the round.#1 The survivors have no real way to attack the Killer however they run just about as fast as the killer and are capable of pushing debris and obstacles in front of the Killer's path. They are able to leap through windows about 75% faster than a killer can climb through. So in essence speed is absolutely on the survivors side and in most cases this is absolutely a problem hence the laughable kiting. It's hard enough to find a survivor as it is and when the Killer finally does come barreling down on them the survivor has 2 practically fail safe ways to escape Spam debris pushes while running in a zig zag pattern or run to a two story house where the survivor will run to the upper balcony and wait for the Killer to lumber on up before jumping off. When the Killer pursues the survivor just runs back up rinse repeat until the Killer gets disorientated or annoyed and leaves or the remaining three survivors turn on the generators. I've never seen a game penalize a hunter for cornering his prey.#2 While the description of this game ""emphasizes"" team work I've never seen a team game promote the team splitting up and having everyone go solo. The maps are a good medium to large size with numerous generators to start at all corners of the map. When the team splits up say north south east west this makes the killers run around chasing his own tail even though he is alerted to the generators starting up. This takes time which allows the numerous survivors just repair away no problem. But even if the killer does pick a correct generator that a survivor is at ...#3 ... The survivors have numerous alerts to let them the Killer is coming to them. First there is a ""Heart beat"" system which basically an alarm is giving the survivors a good 5 second warning the Killer is headed their way. There are also numerous perks which allow a survivor to know if the Killer is looking in their direction i.e. actually has a clue where they are currently hiding. Any chance of stealth and successfully navigating to a survivor s position on the Killer's part is undercut by the numerous alarms the survivors have who will immediately hide upon hearing those alarms. The Killer can attempt to find the survivor in the area all while three other survivors diligently work on their generators. The moment the Killer moves out of the area and the alarms stop the survivor returns working on the generator rinse repeat. If the Killer does miraculously find the survivor ... Kite the Killer waste his time. Rinse Repeat.#4 Practically all Killer abilities are useless. The ones that aren't barely do anything. Vanilla Killer is Vanilla Killer. The Killer can have three loadouts The ""Bear Trap"" loadout ... allows the killer to place traps around the map to snare a survivor. Sounds like a good idea and possibly an answer to the circular kiting but wait even though there are like 10 traps spread out through the map you can only have one active at a time. That makes sense. You have the ""Wraith"" loadout which makes you invisible however it takes a good 4 seconds for you to re materialize and your presence while invisible still alerts the survivor that you are in the area and by the time you re materialize the survivors see you and the Kiting begins. And finally you have the ""Chainsaw"" loadout which is 100% useless. The chainsaw give you a charge ability that if you actually hit a survivor instantly knocks them down for you to pick them up and hook them however while fast you can only charge in a straight line attacking the first thing you clip. This means that the by simply listening for the chainsaw to rev (it takes about three seconds for the ability to charge and release) the survivor can turn left or right or simply move a piece of debris in the Killer's path. The Killer will either miss the mark complete and go charging way out of the vicinity (if the Killer is lucky enough to even find an open patch of map) or he will clip any little thing before even getting to the survivor comically slamming into walls debris etc. while the survivor kites.#5 The matchmaking system is a joke. Like the best joke of the year. You're a level 1 Killer? Well prepare to go again level 20 survivors who are just full of perks. Get ready to be taunted by a team of 4 who will turn on all 6 generators for the hell of it and open all 3 exits while running circles around you while spamming you with their flashlights and kiting you.#6 With team making patches get ready for #5 issues to go through the roof as players use Skype or someone outside com program to coordinate with one another while the Killer stands in the middle of the map getting rolled.#7 Even if by grace of the Gaming Gods you are able to attack and capture a survivor the hooks (unlike the mob of generators) are spread thin all over the map. And to top it off the survivor can still escape your clutches while being carried. I'd say realistically you have about 20 seconds to get the survivors to a hook before they break free. Did I mention you move twice as slow carrying a survivor? Did I mention when the survivor escapes you are basically kicked downwards and spun around for a few seconds giving that survivor a head start ... to start the Kite game over? Rinse. Repeat.If this was a finished product upon purchase I would have returned it but I try to support studios and products that have potential so I kept it and will see how it pans out. In closing the concept has potential ... but I really don't hold out much hope. I just don't see how the devs are going to fix and balance these problems without major overhauls. As it stands on paper and in the trailers the game looks awesome. Actual execution sucks.",Dead by Daylight

Only workaround is to lobby hop lots of times and pray. can't adjust gamma. my lighting setting is rather poor and I need to adjust those values in order to actually being able to distinguish between rocks and trees let alone survivors and rocks can't adjust volume by element (such as music ambience heartbeat etc..) just total volume keys aren't rebindable afaik lobbies are full of jumpers (see above) afk people no idle kick it seems poorly designed survivors (on ultra they're pretty crappy) killer seems to have it pretty easy and probably wins most of the time (aka how am I supposed to power 4 generators with 1v1?)Summary Don't buy until patched.With lots of tweaks and fixes (that should've been done during beta lol) it could end up being a good game.,Dead by Daylight
2017-08-29,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,Organized team of survivors will win 9/10 because killers are underpowered overall and if you so much as passivley check in on a hooked survivor the chat will be filled with toxicity the moment the post game stats drop. Fun game but falls short because the community is toxic and the developers are not fixing major balancing issues but continue to release new maps even though the core game is still highly unpolished and unrefined. Worth it if you get it sub 10 dollars because it is a fun experience at times but otherwise pass.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-15,1,3,1,False,Not Recommended,The game just isn't fun without a group of friends to play with. Matchmaking sucks if you're just trying to play to have fun. The perk system means that if you want to play at parity with veterans it's a long tedious grind. So if you don't have a core group to play with and don't want to spend 10 15 hours playing catch up don't buy it.Evidently they also reset the rankings once a month. This doesn't remove unlocked perks and abilities. So if you on or around the 13th and you're new good luck. Your fellow bottom rankers will have access to abilities and powers that you've never seen. Bad matchmaking means that if you're coming here for a fun scary game you aren't going to get it unless you bring four other friends with you.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-24,6,8,1798,False,Not Recommended,"been playing this game for 1200 hours. Every patch brings new bugs and game breaking mechanics which reduce the overall fun for only the survivor side and are not fixed or managed in any way until the killer population of players complain about them. I will first of all mainly say that this game is enjoyable if you have four friends and even a fifth for kill your friends because that is the only way you wont get facecamped tunneled or overall essentially ""t bagged"" in front of your mother's grave. I truly enjoyed this game in the beggining because you could play solo and everyone was on an even field however due to recent killers and perks added to the game along with their new currency system they have heavily favored killers experience over that of the survivors as well as being mainly in it for the money since feedback from the regular population for this game is overlooked and laughed about. I do not reccomend this game because I have had a more negative experience on this game then i have in any other multiplayer game of this genre in my lifetime. Yes even Evolve had more actual entertainment than this game. I do however still spend my time rotting away in this pitiful hell of a game because sadly enough I have spent so much time and I do enjoy being a completionist so I will prbably be here for awhile longer or until the devs delete this game which i hope they do.",Dead by Daylight

2017-11-19,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,This game is one of a kind it has alot of potential. All the pieces are there but the devs are extremely incompetent.Survivors completly dominate the game even without perks the game has fundamental flaws that favor the survivors.They can body block teamspeak 4 stack team coordinate flashlight attacks. Then the perks add a whole new level of bull certain perks can completly negate any progress the monster has done. While the monster is technically faster than survivors his first person perspective makes survivors more agile they will win everytime when they find a window or baricade. With all these negitives only 1/4th of the monsters are viable. And to new players or perkless survivors these monsters can completly suck the fun out of anything.The community is toxicThe devs dont care about balance broken.But there is a good game in here somewhere if you have 5 friends and want somthing interesting def pick this up.,Dead by Daylight

I recently spent 10 minutes searching for a game just for the killer to leave the lobby this happened again with the next lobby. If the matchmaking was more bearable this game would be brilliant unfortunatly as of now its rather disapointing.Edit The game has vastly improved since I first wrote this review but unfortunatly it is still not quiet worth it the issue is no longer the game itself for the most part with only same bugs and issues remaining as far as I can see the problem I find is the community who takes every chance to abuse whatever bugs glitchs or tricks they can in order to win often at the expense of the integrity of the match being played.I do enjoy this game tremendously when i manage to find a lobby with players that are fair and skilled but these lobbys are only just about half of the lobbies you can find. Its up to the community to fix this issue not the devs I can only hope the game can make it past this current Meta of abusing the game features to win.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-19,0,0,544,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight executes the concept of an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game incredibly well with its co op features characters and creepy atmosphere.The game is set within randomly generated arenas with themes such as an asylum scrapyard cornfield and many more maps. There are four survivors one killer. The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors knock them down put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods known as The Entity. From the survivor's perspective it's not as easy as it sounds. It s not just about kick starting generators and running away from the killer. Team work has been set at a high premium as survivors must look out for each other by using medical kits to heal their fellows freeing them from hooks and distract the killer when one's teammate is in danger.I recently obtained the platinum trophy of the game on the PS4 after putting in roughly 400 hours of playtime. I couldn't get enough of it so I decided to buy it on Steam as well. It's one of the best games I've ever played and I've played quite a few throughout my 16 years of gaming (I'm 21). There are some elements that are yet to be resolved. Peer to peer hosting punishes the survivors if the killer's connection is poor and there are minor bugs.The developers of the game keep pushing out updates with new downloadable content bug fixes new features to the game. This is an absolute must have!,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-12,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT AND I REPEAT do NOT buy this game in its current state I have 57 hours on the game and yes its fun 20% of the time but the other 80% is getting killed by a person playing freddy even tho you try to hide from him hes just busted cause you just start abrububtly hear his lullaby and the next thing you know he in your face pulling you into a dream and then he just hits you once and lets say you drop a pallete and you get away from him but guess whats the best part? HE CAN SEE YOU IF YOUR SO MANY METERS AWAY FROM HIM WHILE YOUR IN THE DREAMING STATE WHICH YOU CAN ONLY GET OUT OF BY FAILING A SKILL CHECK SO IF YOU DONT HAVE SELF HEAL YOU MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE THE DAMN GAME,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-09,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,So if the killer leaves all survivors lose a pip and whatever offerings they brought into the game. Also the community is full of toxic little kids that either troll you in game or try to add you and cuss you out lol. This game needs a serious rework. No party system to play with friends in public games which makes it impossible because there's no way to communicate with anyone. Just gonna stick with private games I guess.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,15,False,Recommended,good game but wil wait for steam sale. Get this game it is so much fun. If you have friends urge them to also get it. it is so much better with a friend.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Smooth gameplay.Finding players to fill the lobby sometimes take a whileNoticed that most interactions between survivor/killer is laggy for the killer. When a survivor is picked up or grabbed it looks like just the player's model is rendered at around 10 FPS (surrounding game fine). For the third party another survivor this looks fine. It is just the killer that gets this There are some places where the player can jump through windows run around and repeat and so the killer cannot catch up and so the survivor lives.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,20,False,Recommended,I have a love hate relationship with this game.The mechanics are awesome the monsters are horrifying and fun to play as but not too OP that the survivors have no chance.However.This game's matchmaking is something to be desired. It is very hard to find players that will join your killer lobby. The visuals are amazing the soundtrack tense and eerie and aesthetically this game is a solid 9/10.But until I get these expectations I rate it a 7/10 These are my expectations A) Better MatchmakingB) More KillersC) A change of shorts.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-17,0,0,21,False,Recommended,Awesome game! But currently reallllyyyy buggy. This game introduces a whole new concept of horror games that made me extremely exited to play. Dead By Daylight offers a really fun concept and when playing with friends it offers a excellent party game. The only drawback to this game is that it is currently very buggy and still needs some work but i do believe with some critical tweaking and fine adjusting this game will climb to the top of my most played list very quickly.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,4,False,Recommended,Pro's Great gameplay non repetive games randomly generated maps nothing is the same! Good grapichs for what money they had. No micro transactions or DLC at the moment. Cleaver upgrading and leveling up systems for suvivours and the killer. The 3 killers are very balanced and suvivours and killer have a equal chance to win! Con's The game seems to have a lot of bugs and not a lot of content. The opdimaztion is bad as well. The wraith's cloak is non working and needs fixing.8/10 would hook someone again!,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,39,False,Recommended,English is not too will this is a Machine Translation evaluation of some of the wrong place I feel sorryI think the game is very happy but as a horror game I feel that the horror of the survivors is not enough.I have some ideas for the survivors of the game to improve the sense of terror and tension hope that developers can be improved The sense of substitution of the third person to tell the truth is not too high so when playing for a while and then will feel the game and not a terrorist the less a lot of funIf the general view becomes the first person to turn the third person into a detection skill may be more frighteningAnd then the butcher caught people can add a variety of sudden dynamic visual angle of shock action so that I think it might be more fun,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-13,0,0,523,False,Recommended,"First actual review for a game... I have to say this is an amazing game! Ignore the buthurt ones who complain about the game ""not being patched immediately."" It has been out for only ONE month! The Devs are on twitch occasionally announcing whats to come in the next patches responding to the fans and sharing what they plan to do in the future of the game.. Also posting many announcements and notes on the games official Twitter page. The Devs are people too so take it easy.All in all i bought this game for a WHOLE $17.99 USD which is NOTHING IMO (A mid/low class income guy) Heres a simple breakdown Its got four survivor choices who all have unique perks you unlock as you level them and greatly benifit you and your team. Three killers (Bound to be more... hopefully soon D ) with the same setup (unique perks that benefit greatly)... one killer hosts a lobby and waits for four survivors to join and ready their loadout (tools attachments offerings perks etc...) while the killer waits for them to ready up he can see the opposing players classes levels ranks and prestige lvl if aquired to know what hes up against and pick his killer accordingly. The survivors however cannot see anything info about the killer aside from his offerings until they encounter him his hooks or his weapon noises in game. Once the game begins the survivors have a goal to repair five of i think eight randomly spawned Generators which power up two randomly spawned escape doors which the survivors use to win/escape.Now the RANKING SYSTEM The survivors have four point categories that gather their in game score.1. Objective Generators/looting chests/ opening escape doors.2. Survival Escaping/ struggling while in the final stage of being on the hook.3. Altruism Healing self/allies saving allies from hooks reuniting with split up allies.4. Boldness Running from the killer escaping the killer sabotaging killers hooks stunning killer being a ballsy mother er.The ranking system requires survivors to gain a minimum of 10k points throughout these categories for one pip and 20k points for 2 pips (pip level towards next rank). Each category maxes at 5k points towards your rank while the remaining points in the maxed category are just extras for leveling. For example you need either 5k points in only two categories or 2.5k in each and so on to level atleast once towards the next rank. so essentially you can help teamates do very few or NO objectives (Pls do objs though) and kite the out of the killer and end up dying in the end and STILL RANK UP! I strongly disagree that the ranking system is as broken as half the other reviews for this game say.Anyways im getting to into this review for how little i do this xD. Look up the killer if you're more interested. I highly suggest you purchase this game. ...Sincerely a happy customer.",Dead by Daylight

I bought this game after having seen Funhaus play it and then having had it recommended to me by some friends. Although it is admittedly flawed in some areas (including the precise balancing of some of the perks) I have overall had an enjoyable time learning the meta of the game and trying to improve over time. I definintely recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-27,0,0,162,False,Recommended,I love this game I can't stress that enough. Everytime the game freezes I have to reinstall the game to just play it and in just trying to stop the infinite loading bug you have to do certain things in game to just find a match (Using the play with freinds option for those who don't know can stop you from freezing in solo matchmaking). Sometimes I just drop the game in total frustrationof all the bugs. But I always find myself drifting back to the game. Its just so well made. The absolute terror you get from being chased by the killer is riveting you actually flich in real life when you get hit by him. Plus the thrill of hunting down people ingame is also so fun tracking down and cornering your prey will he take this route or that one... is hiding around the corner? Or maybe he booking it for the escape hatch? Two completly different ways to play no match is alike another. I will continue to slog through the abuse the devs will through at me because I beleive in the potential of this game and I pray literally by the way that the games devs can fix these bugs. Good luck future Fog Dwellers.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-31,0,0,154,False,Recommended,Great game overall but really buggy even this long after release. Devs should fix the bugs then deal with balancing issues afterward rather than just release new dlcs without fixing the core game issues. It's concerning how many people lose their data I personally deal more with infinite load times and always we lose 1 survivor at the start of a match so most my games 3 survivor vs killer which sucks.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-02,0,0,14,False,Recommended,Not very good if you're looking for a fair game and that could change with future updates. Killers are much more likely to kill all survivors than all survivors are to escape. It is very good with environment making survivors feel true dread and turning killers into real monsters. This is probably going to be the most fun with your own friends. I could stand to see different objectives for either side (navigate a maze of catacombs instead of fixing generators or only kill one survivor in a much more complicated easy to disrupt ritual). That all said I haven't seen any other game do 4 survivors vs 1 killer better. This is the biggest step from a cool idea to a fun game I've seen in this area.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-07,0,0,161,False,Not Recommended,I think the game will be pretty much dead in 6 months. Even playing during an event the matchmaking is getting so desperate that as a lvl 15 killer it was pitting me agains 3 survivors 7 or lower including a rank 2. Game is fun as survivor but is miserable for killer if you don't have the meta perks. Survivors will infinite loop all day long and take advantage of cheap tactics but salt and call you out really quick at end if they even think you were a little campy. Player base isn't great. The experience with killer could be alot more fun but the infinite looping needs to be fixed and pitting a killer without metaperks while survivors are running sprint burst decisive strike etc is just rough. Good potential but as a killer game is more stress than its worth.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-27,0,0,411,False,Recommended,This is my first and might even be my last review on Steam. This game gets review bombed every big patch or content release by players that are generally not very good at the game in the first place and refuse to change their already bad style of play to get better and would rather claim the game is terrible and going to die (It is actually growing). Right now everyone says that BHVR is killing survivors and that their way over buffing killers. However as someone that routinely hits rank 1 survivor I can tell you this simply isn't the case. Previously even an average survivor could straight up bully even a good killer. Now BHVR is finally working on balancing the game and I think they are making good movements in the right direction. I think they have closed the gap between survivor and killer by a fair amount but that survivors still have an edge over killers. I think that BHVR will continue to improve the game and I am excited to see their upcoming ideas since they are finally showing their willingness to work towards balance and ignore the mass amount of low rank players complaining that they can't survive 100% of the time against a monsterous killer with power from what seems to be some form of a god.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-27,0,0,418,False,Recommended,"Really fun. Frustrating at first while you learn the ropes (and want to win) but I really enjoy how it plays off the thriller slasher movie theme so well and gives you the ""experience"" of it on both ends.Once you get better at the game and shift from the ""horror game"" mindset to the competitive mindset the game still remains very entertaining with loads of mindgames stealth risk/ reward strategies. You get frustrating matches but the ranked matchmaking system I feel does a fair job at assessing your skill level on average.They are continuously updating this game and just recently survivors got a well needed nerf since at high level play the objectives get done way faster while survivors tend to be really good at making chases last forever. The influx of bad reviews I suppose is from these survivor mains upset that they can't dominate every round. So keep that in mind when looking at the reviews around this time was posted and this patch went live.The game is virtually not any different at lower ranks and still just as fun.",Dead by Daylight

2017-01-27,0,0,94,False,Recommended,"TL DR A little rough around the edges but otherwise enjoyable.I think Dead by Daylight has a lot of potential. It brings back fond memories of cops and robbers with a deranged twist that appeals to my f&amp %$ed up side. The gameplay is fair for both teams (I've sunk about 30 hours into killer and survivor at this point) but it definitely doesn't feel like that at first. Matchmaking could use a revamp as their lobby system is janky (the killer is the lobby host and survivors who solo queue find a game much quicker than a party does). There's a decent variety of maps ALREADY and they plan on adding more. Each map has sub categories as well so even if you end up in Autohaven Wreckers there's no guarantee it will be the portion of it you know and love. From the Survivors perspective Welcome to being the ""robber"" in cops and robbers. You goal is to power up 5 generators (or the amount of survivors in the lobby +1) and escape VIA the exit gates or the escape hatch (which spawns randomly at 2 generators but won't open without a key or until one survivor remains). These objectives take time to complete and randomly pop up skill checks to keep you on edge. The killer moves faster than you can in a straight line so be sure to run around trees break line of sight and tactical use of pallet dropping (creating a temporary baracade) to stun the killer in order to get away. It takes 2 hits to knock a survivor down the first glancing hit causes the survivor to bolt away from the killer creating distance and while this happens the killer must clean off his weapon creating time between his or her strikes. Once downed you are able to wiggle free from the killers grasp but if you do not then the killers goal is to hang you on a hook and sacrafice you.From the Killers perspective Welcome to being the ""cop"" in this cops and robbers scenario. These four survivors walk into your front yard they're touching your generators they're sabataging your hooks looting your s%&amp t from chests like they own the place! Oh you're going to show them. You're going to show them well. Upon spawning and throughout the match you gain global vision of all of the objectives on the map. You cannot see if anybody is currently working on them without a line of sight however. Your goal is to patrol generators and catch these sneaky bastards before they slip through your fingers. You will be globally notified if a generator becomes completed as well. Set traps flank survivors catch them off guard and slash them down just when they think they've gotten away by hiding in a nearby patch of grass. Lets talk level ups In Dead by Daylight your 6 killers and 7 survivors all play differently and level independantly excluding your overall rank. At the beginning of a season you will be rank 20. by gaining 10 000 bloodpoints (or more) within a map you gain a ""pip"" and every couple of pips you rank up. This allows you to play against people of a similar skill level as you. Bloodpoints are earned by doing things during a match. Whether that be sabotaging a hook looting a chest opening an exit gate turning on a generator chasing a survivor sacraficing a survivor etc. You take these blood points and use them toward this tree known as a bloodweb. upon filling up a bloodweb a new one appears and your character gains a level. You may unlock items to use perks or even attachments to make your items slightly better. In all I'd give this game a good 8/10. You can play it for one game or one whole day and it will remain fun throughout. You don't feel committed to getting the top tier gear or pay for the best weapons in the game in order to win. It's skill based tactical cooperative (if you can figure out how to talk with your team there is no in game chat function) and all in all an addrenaline rush for both sides. I picked up this game on sale 33% off and after playing for a while I would have happily paid full price for it.",Dead by Daylight

2017-02-26,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"This is a Good and bad game I recommend the game but there is problems... Survivors The game itself is a good fps/thirdperson game You have to work with you're team. This makes the game more challenging and more fun! If you don't work with you're team you most likley will lose. But there is some problems with survivors. When you're healing or fixing a generator there is this circle were you have to click it in time or you will ruin the generator or the person you're healing. Sometimes it will happen really fast. I feel like they should nerf it so its easier to hit it and you don't up all the time.Another thing will survivor is that you will lose most of the time. The hook should be nerf as well so you don't die as fast. If you get hooked twice you die. And trying to escape is nearly impossible. The Flashlight is almost impossible to him them. I was in a game and tryed it and the flashlight was litterly in his face and it didn't blind him... Killer Killer is the easiest role in the game. All you have to do is kill simple its so simple that you mostly win...Theres different types of killers. Some have different ablitys and there's one were you can put spy traps down. So when a survivor comes by it triggers it and the killer can see you. This should still be in the game but reduced because they can abuse this and put it everyway as many times as they like to. I was playing in a game 1v1 and there were only two generators. The killer put both of the spys at them and everytime I went over there they would come over and I had no chance of winning. It went on for like 1 hour back and fourth hiding and then trying to fix the generator. I finally gave up and let the killer won. Like I said this should still be in the game but reduced. Another thing wrong with the killer and this is why they ""Always win"" is because they camp around a person on the hook. So thats almost impossible enless you create a disraction but nobody does that enless you're with friends. My final verdict is 6/10. I was going to give it a 8/10 but I feel like the roles are unbalanced and there should either be more stuff to win with the survivor gear/more chest/ ect or reduce the killers ablitys otherwise I think this is a great game.I recommend anyone to try it out if you like fast pace games and getting scared!PEOPLE DON'T PLAY THIS GAME IT TAKES FOREVER",Dead by Daylight
2017-05-07,0,0,1628,False,Not Recommended,There's been some recent updates with the game. The Huntress the newest killer is completely broken and extremely difficult to go against. If it wasn't for the fact I have spent lots of money and have so many friends playing it I would most likely stop. The concept of a range based killer is great but her execution was completely horrible. As much as I respect the Devs they made a foolish mistake. Instead of fixing her they decided to rework the Doctor who frankly didn't need any rework done to him. I'll probably get people mad at me for saying this but the Huntress needs to be fixed. Until that day finally comes I'll most likely be maining my non Huntress killers. I doubt it will actually happen though.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,0,0,894,False,Recommended,One thing There is a huge difference between someone who just started this game and someone who fully understand its mechanics. That being said killer is much harder the higher (lower) rank you are and you will need to make sure you keep aa clear head vs VeRy salty survivors.But I would say the lower (6 20) ranks have much more annoying killers to play against as survivor due to camping. And no I dont mean staying in the area when its obvious survivors are around that doesn't count. Real camping is when they're in your face and refuse to leave any gap for a survivor to rescue.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-29,0,0,288,False,Not Recommended,I want to say that I very much like the game it is a game with a lot of potential and very fun to play with friends or alone as a killer. I really love it to succeed but it doesn t look like it because I don t see any interest on it from the developers. I couldn t recommend at this point because 1. Play ranked have no motivation you play and receive no rewards at the end of the season regardless of your position. 2. Create a team is so messy its like the game is not done for playing with friends which is the best part. 3. Game is very simple once you have reached certain level because is not rewarding at all of anything that you achieve. 4. There is only one game mode. 5. There is almost no events or special things done by the developers it looks like that there is no one hearing the community. 6. Toxic community. 7. VERY BAD mapping generation. Some maps have plenty of hidding zones and balanced and other are the contrary. 8. No dedicated servers. You rely in the killer connection. 9. Very buggy map you get blocked between a log and a rock that clearly allows you to pass over. And like this are a lot.10. Too much randomness in the Blood Web. If they change some of this points (at least the point 1.) I will change my review.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-24,0,0,904,False,Recommended,This game perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere of horror and in all intent and purpose this is just a more horror based version of Evolve but this game delivers more than what most horror games deliver fun and fear going hand in hand. This game is outstandingly fun when playing with friends and when playing in public matches. This game however fun has its faults. One of the biggest things wrong with this game is the matchmaking as of now its utterly broken and leaves you with people who are either rank 1 (the masters) and the rank 20 s (the absolute worst) with all of them having either no perks or the absolute most insane OP perks. Another thing that is a fault in this game is the balancing of the perks at this point a lot players play the exact same setup of perks leaving the game feeling un diversified for the killers. Also the newest killer to join the game is incredibly powerful and will leave most people in awe at how quickly they will die. Overall I love this game it is extremely fun and these faults will eventually be ironed out.,Dead by Daylight
2017-02-08,0,0,267,False,Recommended,Great game to play with friends. For survivors it depends how you load out against the killer. For killers if you got the right load out against survivors you'll have the advantage. As for the PIP system for ranking killers have the overwhelming advantage. If a survivor gets disconnected form the Killer host the survivor will loose PIP for not getting enough points. The killer can continue playing as the disconnected survivor counts as a kill. Basically don't count on the ranking system to be fair.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-14,0,0,400,False,Not Recommended,If you see my hours played you will see a pretty fair amount of time was put into this game. After playing it on and off since release I decided to finally uninstall and write this review. The developers for this game have decided that they want the killer to not only be at a disadvantage but they want the killer to have to struggle each game just to make it so you don't lose a pip. This game is only fun to play as the killer imo. When playing the killer it feels like you are trying to babysit children rather than killing adults. You go in thinking it would be great just to kill 2 of the survivors. This is of course at any stage after the lowest rank 20's. If you go up against a group of survive with friends you will lose. But if by miracle you win it would have been such a stressful victory that it doesn't even seem worth it. When this game was new the killers felt fun. You could easily kill 1 or 2 people but then struggle for the last two. But at least it was fun. It's not fun running around the map trying to kill 1 person. In fact this game makes camping a VIABLE option. Camping is ENDORSED by the creators. I hate camping as much as being camped but most matches you have to camp even just a little. On the survivors side most games are either too easily won or are boring. If you are a beginner you will struggle and matches will be difficult. But after that point it becomes almost faceroll especially with survive with friends. All in all if I were to rank this game after the first 100 hours I would have said this game was an 8 or 9 out of 10. Not anymore. This game caters to the survivors which makes no sense with the idea behind the game and the fact that if a killer was trying to actually do this the mori to kill people in the downed stage would be usable every match. No killer is going to waste the time to hook a survivor.Final Verdict 3/10. Would not recommend to any1 unless you have friends. And even then be ready for 1 of your friends to be sacrificed for the team.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-13,0,0,115,False,Recommended,I have 100+ hours on this game.I've had this game for almost a year now and while I do not play it as often anymore that does not deny the fact that I've had so much fun playing the game. Going in I was afraid the game would be too frightening and that that would turn me off from playing the game but it really isn't scary whatsoever. Getting used to the killers at first can make you anxious or give you chills but I've only ever truly been scared playing this game once (jumpscare attack from The Pig). Since the new Auric Cell/ingame store patch came when The Clown was released I haven't played that often (so I can't really say much about those aspects of the game) but otherwise it is fun. Not very many gameplay bugs to my knowledge only visual ones but they don't harm the way you play the game (just makes your character look a little funny). I haven't purchased any DLC and still have had fun with just the base game characters/outfits. Each game is ranked in a sense since you go up in rank (20 being lowest 1 being highest for both Killer and Survivor) based on the amount of points you earned during a match. If you want to have the most fun though I recommend you get in Kill Your Friends with 4 other people or get on a call with friends and play Survive With Friends. Even on solo queue this game is enjoyable! 10/10 I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a new multiplayer online game in their library D,Dead by Daylight

WHICH... aren't really ""Better"" than any others. It's a well balanced (enough) game. Even without all the DLC you'll still have a great full experience. (You can still play with DLC survivors/against DLC killers DLC does not limit the matchmaking) Speaking of Matchmaking...My Three Faults for this game...is that you can't stay in the lobby you have to exit to the main character menu after every round. I find this time consuming slightly annoying when I'm in the mood to ""Go go go""AND That LAGGY KILLERS ARE CHEATERS... Why should I be dropped to their slowness? It just makes running away almost impossible running into walls and ""glitching"" down hallways failing skill checks... It's all effected by Lag and not to the survivors benefits at all. Makes the whole round kind of pointless and frustrating. + DISCONNECTING PEOPLE are bad. Don't be elitist. Just play. LASTLY on this one.. your item is still consumed if the killer just disconnects. wtf is that?AND the Killer queue is long AF on PC it seems. I'm sure this fluxuates a bit but I can wait a good 15 minutes on Huntress and still not even see a single person jump in the lobby. Sssooooo....WTB Survivors? Its easy to kill It's hard to be helpful. Takes real skill to outsmart killers D (taunt) ALSO I understand if the ""Ping"" is bad or whatever red no good. but otherwise man up n play. If you leave after getting hooked once or one person dies.. you suck as a gamer.But that's really it... Overall Damn well made 7/10 Not something to No Life out on but Almost worth doing so",Dead by Daylight

Dont buy it if you wana play as a killer.What I expected as a survivor Me hiding in terror so the killer wont find me and hope he finds someone else while i put my fingers in to a generator and magic happens and i get a chance to escape.What I got as a survivor After about 20+ youtube vids and about 2 3 hours of game time i blinded killers to save others i pallet looped them for ages and tbagged my way out of most of the games where i didnt get a dc ed survivor as a teammate or if I didnt get a hardcore god killer main (cause f**k good Nurses) What I expected as a killer Me running around and causing terror and havok killing survivors not letting anyone escape.What I got 15 minutes of chasing getting blinded no progress in any way and just no fun at all.Wana play this game only play as a survivor they got it easy in this game You can run faster than the killer you get to blind them you get to jump off the shoulders of said killers cause you got a perk you can run around a bloody box not get hit and once the killer gets near to you you get to slam a pallet on them tbag em then run to the next box/window/whatever trash that you can run around and have a pallet near it and repeat the whole bloody thing for basicly 90% of the game while the other 3 survivors do the borring stuff of fixing generators clearing totems and opening doors for you to escape.Out of the 78 hours i played about 20 of em was with survivors and i got every perk i needed cause i made a ton of points from mostly winning games. The rest of the time i played as a killer and got nothing. With 30 hours i got to play against 500 1 2k hour guys (cause thats fair) and got rekt so hard i sometimes thought i was getting negative points at the end of the game.What you can get as a survivor sprint burst (run faster than the killer for a short durration)borrowed time (give a free get out of jail card to a hooked survivor)dstrike (get out of jail card for you)lithe (jump over a window and run faster than the killer)adrenaline (last generator fixed you heal instantly and run faster than the killer)self care (self heal)tons of palets windows to run around loop throu em and have a fun chase with the killer.flashlights when your dstrike or loops or windows or hiding or pallets fail you.tbag killersWhat you get as a killer you can chase the players... (once you find them)you can hit the players... (once there are no pallets or windows around and once you caught up with them)you can kill the players... (once you hit them 2 times got them to a hook and repeated this 2 more times)ps Dont you even try to camp as a killer cause how dare you take away the fun from the survivors those special snowflakes and have one kill in the game while 3 of them will make more points and get to level up while you as a camper wont level wont make any points.,Dead by Daylight

There are too many cons I dont even understand how this game can be released (with that i mean i can understand this game being an early access game but 1.0 release? come on). As the killer if a survivor disconnects when you put them in a dying state and trust me they will dc just because you got them in the first minute of a game you will probably de rank because you dont get enough bloodpoints (your exp) to rank up. There have been games that i de ranked even though i killed 3 out of 4 survivors and had all 5 engines intact. This game punishes you for being good if you kill the survivors fast enough you might not get all the bloodpoints needed for a rank up. That goes for the survivors as well if your team is really good chances are that you will get a low amount of bloodpoints and thereby de rank. I will probably continue play this game but i really cant recommend it in its current state.

ENJOY CHEESE AND ABUSABLE MECHANICSIf you want to play as a survivor just leave the people player the killers are the only ones going to have any fun.While I think the concept and overarching gameplay is solid the developers did not take into the account that players are human and will always cheese mechanics and not actually play like a stereotypical killer.Killers camp sites they've hooked someone on and its really boring to sit there on a hook knowing theres literally no chance of rescue or that you will escape because on top of that theres a trap under your feet. GG. much fun. such wow. Yeah I went there because that's how stupid that is.On top of that enjoy TSA style random search checks in lockers because hiding in them does jack ! #% since your character makes so much effing noise whether you're hurt or not.

I mean c'mon I accept the fact that you can't punch the outta the killers and just have to run away and hide (that's what makes this game kinda cool) but leaving the survivors almost no chance from escaping after they got catched (especially by the trapper) is just not cool. then at least make it possible to escape faster from the hook on our own or add the ability to open chests while you're on the ground and to heals yourself with a medkit that would make it all much more fair.

2016-07-13,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,"This game is a lot of fun on the surface I still enjoy playing matches but whenever I come back to the storepage I find myself agreeing more and more with the bad reviews. Dead by Daylight is a great idea it's exciting and gets your heart going makes you jump etc. When you get a killer who is a try hard but has no idea what they're doing it's hilarious fun (had a map where two survivors DC'd right away and myself and one other ended up escaping after healing each other many many times and body snatching each other off hooks. hilarious.)There's no tutorial there ARE however what amound to a few FAQ about each role if you care to look for them. Storyline? haha there's got to be a reason why we're in here right? right?? Well it sure doesn't let you know. Closest thing I've noticed to any kind of backround information about what's going on is little blurbs when you level up which come in the form of diary entries from someone entering the ""bloodweb"" in their dream. ""Neat!"" i first thought ""this is kind of Lovecraft ish can't wait to learn more!"" but no. that's it. The writing even takes a nosedive around level 10. (This guy keeps going back to the bloodweb in his dreams and is stressing out over acquiring items from it before THE ENTITY (what?) grabs them first.) this wouldn't be so so bad if they were in items. This dude is stressing out over ing flashlights rags gloves first aid kits etc. That reminds me The bloodweb spread for each level is randomly chosen for you which is cool. except for the first ten levels that doesn't mean anything since you can't progress to the next level until you acquire them all. (Why bother with the web then?) There's no reason for you to choose what order you get them in until afterwards when the entity starts crawling in.USING ITEMS.Most useful item in the game is likely the TOOLBOX. It speeds up everything allows you to wreck the hooks it's great. ONE HUNDRED SIXTY USES. 160. that's a lot of wrecking. Too bad if you die you lose whatever item you were carrying for good.What insentive does that give anyone to use their items??When the success of you game depends so much on things out of your control why would anyone bother risking items they think would actually be useful?laggy killer (host)? you're already dead.other players disconnect by accident or to avoid giving the killer points? you're dead.spawn right next to the killer? good luck.idiot teammates die right off the bat? good luck sneaking around when everything you complete alerts the killer to exactly where you are.The only reason i know what a pip is is because of other reviews here. nowhere have i seen it explained and I am still uncertain as to what all the requirements are to gain/lose them. I'd gained 4 annnnd now they're gone. whoops?I haven't seen any glaringly obvious hacks happening although I had a game where the Hillbilly bee lined for each person from across the map (I had a great view from up on a hook to see this from...) and after the game there were no perks employed by him that would have allowed this. No idea what was happening there. Everytime you lose a match you will find yourself either thinking ""I'm really glad i didn't take that item i was thinking about!"" or ""I really shouldn't have taken that ing item.""Every time.Still it's a fun game. I'll keep playing it but there is so much they need to fix. There's a small chatbox in the lobby where you can talk to... strangers? yeah. neat okay. maybe you can organize a stragaty in under 60 seconds with people you've never met before while the game encourages you to focus on yourself rather than teamwork?Well if you add that person as a friend i guess you could eventually come up with a gameplan that works. Oh you can't? why on earth would you even display usernames then?? Well AT LEAST you can stay in the same lobby and hash out SOME kind of stratagy with teammates who stay... right? nope. oh. yeah this game flat out denies any hope of community in game. It would be so great if there were mics employed ingame where say within 8 meters of eachother you could hear the other person killer included. This is the type of game i've been waiting for and i didn't even know it it's super enjoyable but I have to ask myself how they got it so god damned wrong for being so good.",Dead by Daylight

2018-09-22,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,The theme is great and the immersion is complete thanks to really smart gameplay mecanisms. Everything looks finely tuned (Behavior has made a really great job)......except the fact that the game is really frustrating. I mean it's too much! It really feels like you can't do anything when you play a survivor. You live only if the killer decides that you can live... I've spent some time to watch some videos of rank 1 players about how to vault how to infinite loop how to manage a mind game with the killer forget everything! It's absolutely unachievable for new players. The game let you only two options You play a killer you spend 20 minutes in a lobby waiting for ppl to join. You have some fun for 5 minutes and then you get insulted and you don't even know why (looks like the word 'toxic' is the most used word in game). You play a survivor the game start quickly (great). The first seconds are great you repair a generator. Then the killer finds you and he decides to focus on you until you are dead 3 minutes of plain suffering and frustration. You try some absolutly ineffective tricks with windows and pallets. You lose. You realize this game hate you. You cry under your desk...I only recommend this game for sadistic people who likes morning alarms stepping on legos dentists and spinnach soups.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-12,0,0,468,False,Not Recommended,This is an amazing game if you have friends to play with only issue is you will either be stuck in the loading screen for about 2 hours play a game get hooked and then camped by a camping Or you will be stuck in a loading screen then all kicked to the menu. Then you will play another game after waiting 3 hours in the loading screen. Then you will die in 30 seconds after spawning because the killer knows where everyone is...This game is so ing infuriating but addicting at the same time.The devs nerfed the survivors because so many killers moaned even though it is so hard for survivors already... Now its 10x harder!Except when it resets everything to 0. Game is unplayable when you've been reset. Good job devs. +1Fixed loading screens fixed matchmaking would make this a good game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,312,False,Recommended,Pros Good value for a $20 game. The graphics aren't amazing but they get the job done with varying resolution options. Escaping against a killer that is human controlled is a lot harder than it sounds. Different killers and survivors to play as that form unique traits as you level them up. Light cosmetic options althought I expect they will be added as future DLC for free.Cons Matchmaking connectivity needs to be fixed. It will sometimes place you in a bad lobby with a horrible connection or just simply refuse to find a match at all. And the lag always works in the killer's favor. Playing ranked P2P kinda sucks.The only common complaint that I see for this game that I will not defend is the ability to play with your friends against other people. This would be very hard to balance. Having a team full of coordinated individuals against one killer would be broken. You would always know where the killer is and there would be no risk. Blocking communication between the survivors is the only way to ensure the survivors don't have an advantage.All in all I think it is a great value for a $20 game. They do need to fix the matchmaking connectivity but other than that I think it is a fun game to play.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-15,0,0,920,False,Not Recommended,"Now since the new update has come out I am starting to really dislike this game. I am going to state a lot of reasons why I turned my postive review to a negative review. First of all I want to talk about the pick up time for killers. The pick up time for killers is now insane and it makes it impossible to flash light save anymore. Back then it was easy because we would shine the flashlight at the right time they would of got the save so I really dislike this change a lot. Another change that I really dislike is the exhaustion. While running back then you would recovery slowly but now if you run you can't recover from the exhaustion anymore! That is kinda dumb because if you are in a long chase and the killer is tunneling you and you are pallet looping the killer how do you expect to get away? I get it you could go through windows but would you rather be able to run away far away and get away? I think I would like that to. Anyways I think those are the 2 main reasons why I think I am starting to really dislike this game. If the devs come back and they buff survivors and equal them out with the killers then I will return but overall I am done with this game.

2019-01-21,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Overall the game is very fun to play even a masculine jerks will scream like hoes when they star playing this gem but the downside is that there's no stable server where the killer (host) has a good ping to host a lobby.,Dead by Daylight

The main question is How do you like your asymmetrical games? Can you cope with t? Are you easy to enrage and likely to complain? Are you an all or nothing guy? If you answer with yes better stay away. You will not gain the same experience as in L4D or Evolve. To like and love DBD bring patience and frustration tolerance.

When you face a team of survivors that are immersed in the game or a killer that actually makes the game frightening but exciting at the same time this game is quite unique and creates hours of entertainment for those matches.

2018-11-23,0,0,1856,False,Recommended,I have been playing DbD since the release. The atmosphere in the fog is adorable every singe idea of this game seems to be genious. Still the gameplay has been changed the developing team today contains many co workers that have to be paid. No wonder the developers make their own business by selling humble outfits for real money and they make absolute wrong decisions concerning the balans so that every 6 year old child can be able to play a killer. You don't need to develope your own skill playing as killer anymore just run modern killers and their perks which show survivors' auras. You don't have to develope your strategy of locating the survivors neither (listening to the steps and crows patrolling the generators) just run perks showing thier auras. The new developing team makes our favourite game miserably simple. Worst we do not have any equivalent yet but if I find something worth playing I will easily uninstall DbD.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-19,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,Ok where do I begin this game first off is really broken. I mainly play a Survivor all the time and I can tell you this. You can literally always win as the Survivor and I can even prove it in game to. All you have to do is run thats it run jump threw a window then wait for him to go around and jump back threw. And then again and again and again. The Killer it is basically impossible for the killer to win unless you have idiot players. But if you do the trick you win. The killer focuses on you while 3 other people do a stupid Generator. Even if you left him to go to another player. Guess what lol that player will just do the same thing. I really wanted to like this game and tbh I did when it first came out. But this game is Unbalanced unfair for the killer and 100% boring. The reason its boring is simple. As a Survivor you do NOTHING but hide and turn on a damn Generator like really. Thats all you do. Just turn on a Generator the entire game. You turn 4 on and you basically win. So not only are you just sitting there doing nothing but screw around with a Generator. But the killer can't stop you from doing it cause all you have to do is just run to a damn window or wait by a barricade for him to be stunned. And if they have the flash lights lol just another LONG stun to waste time. That is basically it. For a game where the Survivors should feel afraid of the killer there not if anything its nothing but Survivors Taunting the killer to come to them. Do not buy this game I mean it. You will either like the game for about a hour or 2 then hate it and never touch it again. Or you will just straight out hate it at the beginning. In conclusion this game deserves a 3/10. The game is fun if you play a Survivor at the beginning of the game. But after you play him for about 2 hours you will find yourself very bored and wishing you never bought the game. As for the killer lol. There is nothing fun about being the killer. You don't feel like a badass or a actual killer. You feel like a idiot just walking around looking at Generators.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,2,2,0,False,Not Recommended,"If you like losing 90% of the time then this game is for you. I've played 4v1 survival games a great example of one (that just got poor marketing due to cosmetic day one DLC) is Evolve. Evolve shines where Dead by Daylight fails. As a survivor you have to deal with (at this point in time) 1 of 3 killers. The main mechanic to evading killers is awareness (seeing the killer) and your senses telling you the killer is near via a heartbeat sound. However one of the killers completely circumvents this mechanic.I'm sorry a CORE mechanic to your game and everyone is honestly surprised that everyone is picking the Wraith? How droll. And for anyone saying ""well I've won X games as hillbilly"" or ""I've evaded the wrath plenty of times"" Guess what a good wraith is going to be far enough away from a particular spot (not moving) and unless you have the eyesight of a raven you aren't going to spot him in time to run away. As the survivor it's an extremely frustrating experience being unable to see your fellow survivors unless they are in mortal peril. It's also very frustrating having NO communication ability whatsoever. I hope Friday the 13th does this time of horror survival genre better. Either way I don't care what people think about my review. My opinion and review of this game is that it's bad. So bad that I'm getting a refund for it.",Dead by Daylight

The only reason you complained because it was too hard to win as a killer and/or a survivor. However the game as is should be a hardcore mode for survivors and a easy mode for noob killers.

Unfortunately devs went full retard and made a lot of updates...The game is no fun anymore any ret4rd can get 4 kills every match with killers perks.No one is playing survivor anymore because people know it's not fun anymore.It's all about killers they got a lot of buffs and survivor got nerfs and more nerfs.Every survivor strategy got nerfed so they don't work anymore and there are still some noob killers who cry about decisive strike and other things. No more pallets a lot of maps with open area with no obstacles so you can't run away from killers nor hide you have a lot of effects for survivor like exausted stagged exposed and no effects for killers.And of course every killer is using BARBECUE AND CHILLI a perk which the killer can see survivors auras when hooking someone so basically the game is NOT FUN ANYMORE NOT FUN FOR SURVIVOR WHATSOEVER.NO FUN ANYMORE! NO FUN!Save your money for another game.By the way every killer strategy is still valid like FACE CAMPING and dropping survivors that uses DECISIVE STRIKEThe goal of the game is to hide and do gens right ?Well you can't just hide anymore.Even Pro Players like 72hrs stopped playing.As you can read about it here https //www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/75tpm9/72hrstom_is_done_playing_dbd_and_maybe_with/https //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 1595622197Pretty Good (blow) Job so farhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0mgZG2xBoYQ Anyways if you want to buy this crap just go for it but expect to find a lot of toxic players and get a lot of stress.This game is not worth anything anymore.,Dead by Daylight

You need to learn jukes every update comes with new techniques every new perk every new killer that comes out changes the way to play and this makes it my favourite game.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-07,0,0,308,False,Recommended,Dear developers The game is awesome and based on a very creative and interesting concept and it was even better after you fixed the matchmaking. After the last patch or so I have to restart the game every time I want to play another match because I get stucked into an unlimited loading screen. Please fix this glitch it makes everyone willing to stop playing such a great game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-06,0,0,517,False,Recommended,I love this game. Both killer side and survivor side. Okay the Devs still got some work to do the game isn't perfect. It can be hard to join sometimes but I usually get into a lobby pretty fast (after i restarted the game a couple of times i have to add) But i think the Devs are working hard to fix the problems and they come up with new content on a regular basis which is awesome. New killers New maps New Survivors etc.Then there are two things the Devs really cant do much about 1. Camping killers Basically it's the killers job to get a survivor on a hook and then the survivor will slowly die but you can be saved by your fellow survivors (and they generally try to save you) UNLESS the killer will just stand right infront of you and wait till you pass 'to the other side'. Or they partol the area way to close to the hook (mostly done by newer killers i think).2. When you're a killer and you're actually any good you're gonna get a sh*tload of hate salt rage toxic coming your way. But I guess you need to deal with that or the best thing in my opinion just ignore it and have fun hunting.That said I think the game is lots of fun and especially when you're new it will get your heart pumping. Both as killer and survivor.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-08,0,0,38,False,Recommended,This game is a lot of fun playing both as a survivor or killer.I personally prefer survivors because I get to play that with friends and have the same goals but when they're not around killer will do just fine.It's actually funny to see a few groups whining about killer problems and all. There are many difficult killers there in my opinion but then again some very skilled survivors. Slight balancing might be needed but I definitaley do not agree with the the people whining about killers being underpowered or anything of such sort.

2016-06-17,0,0,10,False,Recommended,"I RECOMMEND THIS GAME COMPLETELY BUT PLEASE READProsIt's a fun game not so much as scary but tense.You can choose to save or abandon people which is kinda great it brings out the monster in all of us lol.Each map has random generator spawns which can give advantage to the player and you can also be awarded ""Offerings"" which can be used to alter the map and it's surroundings to either help the Killer or the player.ConsThere is no party system yet(although I hear it is their top priority) so you can either go solo for a while until this comes out or you can try and join the same game as your friends(easy but can take a anywhere between 1 15 mins). ALTHOUGH you CAN play a private match with your friends however no XP is rewarded as can be expected.Also the Killers are great however I don't like the idea of the wraith the fact that he can go invisible is kinda OP(however the player is alerted when he goes invisible by a bell tolling and he cannot interact or attack when invisible which kinda makes up for it) but overall I think the character itself is a little OP.Also and I think alot of people would agree when you are hung up on a hook most killers if not ALL will just camp the hook which in my opinion is kinda bad because it's basically setting you up for a GG although when the killer camps the hook it allows for everyone else to fix generators and escape thus making a ""loss"" on the killers part.OverallIs a great game and is worth its money you could play hours on end without getting bored as each map variant offers great advantages and disadvantages to killer and player alike You will NEVER always win at this game teamwork is KEY however you could pull a sneaky Shane on Otis from TWD and escape alone D. However a small tweaking for friends to connect and play with each other is much needed and personally I feel the Wraith Killer could be minorly tweaked.",Dead by Daylight

This game has new content almost monthly and DLC is optional and enjoyable. The maps in every update are free so theres no split in the community so it keeps the game fresh. There are some bumps of glitches and things you'll need to find how to get around (example) Infinite loading screens. The community is... Toxic no sugar coating that but you just need to learn to ignore the impatient! This is an excelent game and I really prefer this game over many other 20 dollar games.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,547,False,Not Recommended,It's a ok game. They release more content than fixing the bugs. The matchmaking is one of the suckiest I have seen in a game. This games matchmaker makes World of Tanks matchmaker look great. The killer has some OP perks while the survivors perks are ok. Once he has you on the hook good luck getting off. Basically you are done. Another thing is the killer get to see your level and rank. Which mean he can choose to go up against new players. You can get in a game with a veteran killer with 3 new players.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,0,0,580,False,Recommended,Beneath the awful survivor favoring balance even awfuler survivor main comunity and noob unfriendly gameplay (thank goodness they put a tutorial now) there's a really fun game to be had. I wasn't really planning on making a review but I feel duty bound simply 'cause the toxic crutch depending salty players are review bombing the game as I type.This is a PvP asymetric game where you can either play as one of four survivors or a killer trying to murder them one by one. Thing is you'll find that being part of a numerous team makes it pretty damn easy to overwhelm the killer even without perks if you know what you're doing. Especially in a premade group with coms. Now that the developers are beginning to TRY and shift the balance a little bit to favor the killer for once the people who have been having it easy (and still do) are up in arms.All in all it's a potentially great game being held down by unfair map design and by how many people with personality disorders it attracts.

2017-03-17,0,0,479,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a satisfying game when it is played right. Survivor side is frustraiting because it heavily relies on teamwork and as much as I'd like to say its easy enough to play without friends I wouldn't reccomend it. It also pretty difficult to start out compared to the killers side.The plus side for killers you obviously don't need any friends to play. The frustraiting side for the killers is the amount of toxic and bad manners survivors give. Rather like playing a survivor yourself Players choose to make the game fun or not.That isn't to say Killers don't ruin fun of the game too ending games way too quickly and camping hooks. If you have friends and aren't tight for cash I'd pick up this game if you are willing to buy a few low priced DLC's too. Its a game you need time and patience for.

Killer just camps the hooks until your dead Not enough environmental features it is literally one big open map where he can see you from across the field Not enough variety in killers weapons Generators have a stupid system were you have about 2 seconds to press spaceOverall I was extremely let down this looked like it was going to be hundreds of hours worth of my time but it turned out to be worse than evolve!

Yeah good.See there is but one game mode Turn on the generators while not getting inevitabley killed.Turning said generators on takes a disgusting amount of time and at random invervals you'll be forced to endure to nearly impossible quicktime event or the machine will sputter in your face taking even longerNeedless to mention the killer can see every ing generator on the map absolutely fair.Now I'll discuss the survivors and their mechanics.All the survivors are just alternate skins of the same character they all play the same with no distinct attributes while you can customize them with random items which I'm assuming drop throughout later gameplay these are only cosmetic differences.Though ou can branch off into a skill tree and assumidly play a specific role in the survival of your team but from the start you don't pick a class and don't start with a skill you have to grind some form of skill point currency to upgrade your character rendering you pretty much useless throughout the primary bulk of gameplay.The monster encounters as the survivor is the most disgusting rage inducing part about this mess of a game.When seen the killer will hunt you down and hit you with it's weapon of choice one hit and the surivior is a limping struggling mess greatly inhibiting escape while a second blow will knock on the floor rendering you pretty much ed.Don't try telling me 'Oh thats realistic getting hit by an axe will you up like that.' I don't play a game for realism even if I did any 'Realism' gets thrown out of the window later on.The Killer will then pick you up and the quicktime button mash begins press A and D rapidly to wriggle free from the killer's grasp...execpt it doesn't work.No matter how hard you struggle you cannot break the killer's grasp.Then the killer impales you on a hook a hook which 'Killer vision' can home in on from anywhere on the map now you must QTE click to free yourself from the hook though you have almost no time before a myraid of spider limbs come to impale you at this point you mash space and either die (99% of death) or RNG saves you and you get released (1% chance of surviving) though a buddy can save you considering how abnormally long it can take to finish a survivor sometimes it's instant somtimes it takes minutes.Also notice how most of the 'gameplay' consists of QTEs and button mashing.Quality.As for the Killer their are actually multiple killers with varying skill sets and weapons that deliver some variety unlike the surviviors.You can be the Trapper whom just throws down bear traps stalling and injuring victims or you can just cheese the game by placing traps beneath the hook so even if a survivor is freed they'll be caught in the trap basically play as the trapper or you're just handicapping yourself.You can be the Wraith who can just turn invisible camp generators and hooked survivors before instantly wrecking any survivor that comes close pretty ing stupid.You can be the Hillbilly who just ing sucks his speciality is a chainsaw that you can't swing freely hardily works and when it does work you dash forward for a 1 hit kill...if you can even land the hit see you have no control over the dash and if the survivor so much as sidesteps you miss and they get away note The Hillbilly is cancer.Finally the nurse who I was told to keep away from because she is too complex. Never touched her though I can assume she is also cancer.The Killer's basic attack is ing terrible although it's a two hit kill system after the first hit you'll be forced into some animation rendering you unable to proceed with a second attack while the survivor runs off.Once you grab a survivor without prompt you're just supposed to know what to do with them easy to figure out once you've already played but at first how are you supposed to know?Also disputing any claims of realism while the survivor is hooked I tried hitting them multiple times with an axe in an attempt to weaken them the survivor groaned and a gruesome sound effect played when I hit them but they could still struggle as well as ever multiple hits did nothing your 'realism'The killer is also an unagile piece of while survivors can vault the killer slowly hobbles across obstycales it's tedious.Essentially as the killer you run around a dull looking map hoping to find someone if you manage to knock them down and drag them to the hook you'll need to babysit them until they die because there is no prompt for when they escape I've even been awarded points and given the message ""Sacrifice"" even though my sacrifice escaped the hook ing .TDLR The game is looking with one game mode with objectives and the worst most boring mechanics I've seen in years.In conclusion this game is terrible and the only praise I hear for it is that ""It's fun."" ""It's realistic."" and ""It's scary."" These aren't explanations on why this broken boring piece of is good.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-29,0,0,384,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight in short a 1v4 horror game. 1 player is the killer who's ultimate goal is to place the survivors onto hooks and sacrifice them. 4 players are survivors who have to complete 5 generators as a team unlock an exit gate and run to freedom Pros Survivor can be very scary Killer is extremely fun for the most part Lots of variety of perks and characters to customise your survivor/killer with Many different playstyles according to perks or (Only for killer) character chosen Matchmaking has been fixed mostly queues for me don't last longer than 30 seconds now Able to easily queue with your friends Private unranked matches available for fun where items aren't used A different game every match with different killers who run different perks or different teammates etc. In my opinion a friendly community (On discords etc) Friendly devs with frequent streams and good tech support Many updates Cons Connection depends on the killer's internet extremely laggy connections are quite common High rank survivor gameplay is quite tough killers know a variety of tricks that they really shouldn't be able to do Lots of bugs and hacks For the most part hacking isn't prominent but glitches and bugs are present and are abused High rank killer gameplay can sometimes seem futile when facing 4 master jukers who taunt you constantly The survivors are basically reskins they have their own perks but when you get them to certain levels they unlock those perks for the other survivors The game has major balancing issues with perks and killers some perks are useless some are essential (cough decisive strike) Matchmaking in terms of ranks can be horrible. Rank 20 (The worst rank in the game) killers can be matched with rank 1 (The best rank the in game) survivors Ranking up can be tedious for both sides you have to get enough points from 4 categorys to pip and 3 5 pips earn you a rank up DLC is almost always paid and only includes 1 survivor and 1 killer not necessarily bad just worth mentioning Infinites exist.

2017-11-01,1,2,979,False,Recommended,"This game is sooo much fun.. literally the max. value you can get out of 20(!) bucks. The game's mechanics are pretty simple and therefore very friendly towards newcomers and ""casual players"".To learn and understand the game the best while still having a s#!t ton of fun I suggest to play both sides (survivor and killer) frequently instead of ""maining"" one side only. At this point I want to mention that it is possible to play survivor with friends in a public match(""Survive with Friends"") vs a random killer or only with friends the killer is being played by a friend as well in a private/unranked match(""Kill your Friends"")The balance of this game is definitely not in a perfect state yet and I as many others do not agree with all decisions the devs have made in the past but it is getting better over time since release. The developers of this game really care about this game they released so much patches and new content over the last 16 months.Just a lil' heads up This game had 3 different killers and 4 different survivors at release. Now we have 10 killers and 11 survivors! (In case I didnt misscount).The only real negative points I wanna mention here the high rank meta can become a little bit stale but new balance patches and a big variety of different killers definitely helps on that. the community(especially when you get closer to the higher ranks) is pretty toxic. especially the constant ""survivor main vs killer main"" flamewars are annoying. Since we have a so called ""soft ban"" system here in DbD to deal with any kind of misbehaviour it got tremendously better. Before deaththreats cancer wishes and harassment on Steam with group invites were standard whenever you played killer. some flawed game design decisions (but it's getting better!)TL DR this game has a more than fair price. If you are a fan of the survival horror genre just give it a shoot not much you can do wrong with 20$. Keep in mind that you are also able to refund within the first 2h playtime on Steam )If you are still unsure just check out some ""Let's plays"" on YouTube or some streams on Twitch",Dead by Daylight

As a casual this was very unenjoyable after two playthroughs...For what it is it is fun and exciting but lacks so much. A single player mode with AI would be hella fun and more levels with various different designs the two whatever levels became repetitive and new hiding spots and interactions and objectives are a must...This is basically just a prelude to hopefully a more polished Friday the 13th I can't wait for that game...If they keep the somewhat good aspects of this broken game into that game I'll be hyped...yeah anyway only good with friends and got boring quickly a bit of fun to be had but not worth the price...,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-27,4,2,25,False,Not Recommended,Fun game but there are some serious issues with it. Killers can hit through vault objects even if you arent infront of the opening. Making vaulting to escape the killer irrelavent and pointless. Vaults act more like death traps than evasion tools. Pay to win Only way to get noteable killers (such as freddy) is to buy them even though this is a premium game (quite the money grabbing scheme). Premium killers have a clear advantage. If you are going to charge someone 30 dollars for a game include a decent amount of content. Disgusting. Is your dev team based in Israel or something? Community is terrible most survivors either disconnect and waste your items/offerings or are just terrible players who do not pull their weight. Having not played the game earlier I could not tell you whether this has always been the case but this game screams money grab and in comparison with lots of indie games in development has very few and poor game dynamics.

Plus when season resest you will have perk level 3 killers against you as a survivor with not character perk 2 or 3 however you can have a new survivor with on perk against a maxxed out killer.

2017-11-06,0,0,288,False,Not Recommended,"I have to say I don't write reviews often but I had to say something. This is a fantastic game with great mechanics and only about 6 or 7 major bugs and glitches. Sometimes they cause you to get killed and that's unfortunate but over all a good game......or at least it was. Then they introduced the killer known as ""The Nightmare"". He is SO overwhelmingly overpowered that he is really no fun to play against. Also he is PAID content so they have effectively made the game ""Pay to win"" which is truly one of the more terrible things to be as a game. I didn't mind the The Doctor The Shape The Cannibal and the Hag being paid DLC because even though they are much better than the regular killers and still sort of pay to win you can still out play them fairly well with stealth and quick thinking. The nightmare effectively ELIMNATES an element of the game which is stealth and evasion because he is COMPLETELY invisible. Also once he is visible (once you have aggro from him) he can see you at ALL TIMES! So either you can't see him or he can ALWAYS see you. He needs a rework or at the very least a handicap to make this game fun again. I almost always just give up against The Nightmare so I can get on to the next game. It's as if you were playing your favorite game and every 5th level was a level where overpowered enemies mercilessly destroyed you and everything you were working towards all while laughing at you. Every once in a while you manage to kill one of them but eventually you are overwhelmed beaten and sent to the next level with a bunch of your stuff destroyed.",Dead by Daylight

2017-10-03,0,0,746,False,Not Recommended,"Now before I begin I want to say no I do not have over a 100+ hours on this game and I don't care.For starters if you're brand new to this game and think it's going to be fun then I'm sorry but you're sadly mistaken. Whether you choose to be a survivor or a killer is your choice but just know you're going to lose a lot before you start getting ahead. Every thing starts at level 1 however due to no real match making you could more than like be placed up against people whom devote their life to this game and just get utterly crushed.Not only that but your characters are allowed only 1 perk until level 15 yes 15. Now I know what you're thinking level 15 isn't that high why should I worry about it. Well dependant open how well you do in a match will depend on the out come of how much blood points you get. To level up you need to fill your bloodweb up by using these bloodpoints. At first it runs between 4 5 spots on the bloodweb which will vary in amount of blood points need to obtain an item or perk. These range from 3000 5000 and 8000 blood points. As you continue to level up you need to spend more and more blood points because the webs grow bigger and bigger. By the time you hit level 10 something called the entity ""awakens"" and starts to take some of those items or perks. So by level 10 you the player start to lose things. Max level in the game is Prestige 3 level 50.When a player prestiges the lose everything including perks items and booster items and recieve a simple cosmetic for prestiging and set you back to level 1. Now I forgot to mention the bloodweb is randomly generatored so all of those good perks and things you had good luck getting them all back. Due to the random generation you may not get the perks you want sometimes even after you hit level 50. Yeah you get a brand new bloodweb if you don't prestige and fill it up but that leads to more grinding and whether or not to prestige again in the future.Now the community while play this game can vary a lot. However when you get higher in rank which rank doesn't even matter that much because there is no real match making in the game you will and I promise will either come up against a group of flashlight users OR an ability spamming killer. Currently in the game the meta is to play as the killer The Cannibal AKA leatherface and use his chainsaw ability which can multi strike a survivor when the first hit alone puts you into dying state. That is not fun but there are perks to help with that! Even with that said it help you take only one hit before the next chainsaw swing puts you down. All killers are faster than survivors and get fast with a passive perk called bloodlust.If that isn't enough to steer you away from this game the survivor's side is just as bad. If survivors have certain running perks you and said survivor can constantly getting into what is called looping. It simply means dancing around and object for what seems like ages at times or if you get lucky they might slip up yet it's hard for them to do that. As I mention previously about flashlight groups imagine you are the killer and you put someone down and go to pick them up. Suddenly the rest of the survivors show up and use the flashlight to blind you and drop the person you just picked up now imagine that this happens constantly through out the match and by the end of it they all escape and you killed no one. Doesn't that sound fun?There are alot of bugs that come around and to top it all off with a cherry most of them never get patched. I encounter one bug that was always a problem and was never fixed. Getting stuck on a tree. Yeah that's right. If you are crouching as a survivor and get too close to the tree while either hiding or peeking around it you can get stuck on the tree and can't get away. The only way to get off the tree is for the killer to down you and pick you up and hopefully be nice enough to let you go.This game in the long run though is not worth it at this point in time. If the devs actually did something or somethings correctly then maybe I would have continued to play. Like I said though IF they did but they didn't.

2017-11-10,0,0,1183,False,Recommended,Seeing lots of negative review about the game lately pisses me off. Even though the game is unbalanced the community is toxic af and there are still bugs in game (let's be real here try to name a game that have no bug or glitch) but still it doesn't change the fact that the game is extremely fun it sometimes gives you a good scare and it brings out the mind game between the killer and survivors. Moreover spending only $20 to be able to play +700 hours is the best thing the devs can give to their players. Also remember that there are roughly about 60 70 people working on the game yet they are able to release new DLC/content/event every 1 2 months make weekly twitch stream for updates balances and bug fixes and change the meta once in a while by buffing and nerfing perks... I think that they have done a very good job to keep the game fun and fresh.And again with only 60 70 people working on the game there is no way they can please thousands of players at the same time so give them a break and just enjoy the game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-22,0,0,66,False,Recommended,This game is a good one with loads of potential but like many games on steam there is bad that comes with the good.The Good Killers and survivors are unique with different perks styles and (for killers) weapons. All of these give each match extra tension and variety while you figure out what you are up against. The killers overall are fairly well balanced in my experience as it is definately the player who makes a good killer or survivor though the priveleges of rank certainly helps and I know I personally am better at surviving against some killers than others. Gameplay mechanics conceptually are awesome. Unlike many similar games that rolled out around this time Dead by Daylight really emphasises these concepts in their mechanics. Lots of potential on developing this. You can play with people with any DLC but can only select from characters you have purchased or came with the base game/free DLC. A reasonable compromise that lets you use the maps and makes sure everyone can play with everyone.The Bad New content is nice but matchmaking is oftentimes a joke with long cues (particularly when in a party). The worst of matchmaking problems have ended but they still need to figure out two things cue times and the poor matchmaking regarding skill levels (Rank 1 v Rank 20's or visa versa) because both are still (STILL) pretty nasty for this old of a game. More recently there have been people who have clearly hacked either via generating bloodpoints or by simply modding characters with extra skills and what have you. I know cheating is fairly expensive to monitor but these sorts of things ruin the experience and should be high on their to do list.In short this IS a good game but it is not a completely polished product at this time. Lots of potential with only 3 large problems in my mind that really need to be emphasised. Cue times rank disparity on teams and the growing cheating problem in the game. If you are patient with such things go for it! Otherwise maybe wait.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-26,0,0,3,False,Recommended,This game has been out for six months already and I hyped it perhaps a bit too much. It's a fun game it's a cool concept and it serves it's purpose however I keep running into a main menu game breaking bug that forces me to exit the game and restart it. That and a bug that throws me out of online lobbies are things I can't help but think other people are experiencing too. As always DLC shouldn't come before bug fixes and with bugs this large you'd think they'd get fixed sooner but all in all a decent game. I bought it on sale I wasn't going to pay full price because I had heard it was pretty buggy.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-29,0,0,809,False,Recommended,This game is pretty fun when it works.I've noticed a lot of games are disconnected upon que.. like A LOT.I really hope the devs fix this.Another thing.... is there an anti cheat in place? I've seen killers randomly show up right where you are.. like out of nowhere.Plus.. I was recently in a game where the generators didn't repair even after sitting there for like .. forever... is this a known glitch/bug? Overall.. besides the few issues above it's a really fun game when you get a bunch of friends together.Survivor mode is more fun then killer... imo.I've played as the killer and yeah.. it's okay at times.In game chat would be nice.. I know steam has their own little chat menu.. but it's just not the same as in other games.Even built in voice chat would be cool.. although yeah we can use teamspeak or whatever.Anyhow great game and I do recommend it and I believe it's still on sale.Cheers!,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-26,0,0,384,False,Recommended,"Long story short this game isn't for everyone. Grinding through early character levels to get skills is necessary to even ATTEMPT to compete with other players with full perk loadouts who you will frequently be matched with despite the huge imbalance in chances of you winning bugs are very common and often slow to be fixed dev streams can be disheartening for players realizing how certain team members actually feel about broken aspects of the game. That being said it's a fun experience in a niche genre and it keeps me coming back for more despite all of its flaws. If you plan to play frequenting r/DeadByDaylight and the community page here on Steam will be your best bet for not suffering from some of the worst bugs.DbD is an 4v1 asymmetrical PUG PVP 3rd person horror survival or 1st person hunting game depending on the role you choose. Overall the gameplay is pretty simple survivors rush to complete generators while avoiding the killer and saving their friends from the killers' hooks either ends in all survivors sacrificed or a few or even all the survivors escaping the desecrated grounds only to relive the Entity's nightmare another day.The world building is decent but if you are looking for an interesting story this is not the game for you. The vast majority of the lore exists to justify gameplay mechanics and the rest is just a dash of background info on the characters. Game comes with a few characters to play as and you have to pay to unlock other characters in pairs of twos.Issues with the game? We have to deal with a lot of bugs. This is the studio's first major game and it shows. They try but bugs take a while to fix and they often release content that just reintroduces the exact same bugs as previous DLCs have added (as if they didn't even try to playtest their own game). Additionally there has been a bit of an imbalance in content being added to the game that is exclusive to streamers and their fan base. So if you don't like most of the cosmetics being exclusive this also isn't the game for you. The matchmaking is also just bare basics ""let's get 4 survivors and 1 killer"" and doesn't do a good job at all of making sure players have similar skill levels or perk availability.What do I mean by ""perk availability""? Simply put you start out just as a killer or survivor using your basic kit of skills (survivors run fix generators pull levers perform first aid to heal allies and pull friends off of meat hooks killers have their supernatural ability can see where survivors have ran smash pallets attack survivors and hang them on hooks). But as characters level up they can acquire perks skills that alter gameplay in some way. In theory all of these perks make it easier to meet the win condition for your role (some do this much better than others). But when I first started playing I lost the majority of games I played because my bottom rank perkless character was being matched with rank 10s (even sometimes rank 1s) with a full quadra perk loadout. Translation for those who don't play the game they had incredible buffs to their role while I had none AND barely knew how to play so it was nearly impossible to win. The game is a lot more fun now that I've spent the time grinding characters up to get their perks and unlock teachables but there are still times where the matchmaking (when it isn't buggy and crashing) still completely fails to even ATTEMPT balancing player skills.",Dead by Daylight

The Nurse can teleport when finish teleporting she looks down and becomes slow. making a advantge for the survivor to escape The shape (Michael Myers) The coolest killer in the game because he is from movie Halloween. He's like the trapper but without traps...Just a knife...Thats it.The Hag My favourite Killer in the game and also the MOST PANIC STRICKEN KILLER IN THE GAME. What she can do is she can place 10 traps that can LITERALLY JUMPSCARE YOU...10 TRAPS THAT CAN LITERALLY JUMPSCARE...THATS NOT ALL SHE CAN TELEPORT TO HER TRAPS WHEN TRIGGERD...YAY...So yeah im not doing the survivors because that will take to long RATING 7/10 Want to know the lore of the killers and survivors go to this link https //www.deadbydaylight.com/manual/lore/,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-20,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,Well let's see here you got a guy with beartraps that will always be placed right under a hooked victim a ghost that will just camp someone that's hooked hoping to get 2 people and a hillbilly who is just wanting to grow he's crops in peace. Plus as an added bonus they all run faster than you isn't that fun. And your team pfft they left you hours ago they aren't coming back for you even though you risked your life to save them only to find yourself switching roles except they won't try to save you. And I already played this game for two hours so I can't refund this game that makes me want to throw my set up out the window. Also why can't I matchmake in a party every other game can do it? I don't wanna waste my time playing private mode just to enjoy a fun match with my friends like you get nothing out of it when you play in private. And that's another reason why your team left you hours ago and it's because you're a complete stranger to them and they'll most likely just use you as spare time like the rest of the community.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,5,False,Recommended,"As of writing this review I have a little over 2 hours but I have decided to write it early to clear some misconceptions you might have from other reviews especially negative ones. The main complaint I hear on the forums is ""there are no players"" I can tell you this is false as Steam stats shows that over 15k people are online as of Day 1. I have had little to no problem playing as the survivors waiting a max of 10 seconds each time I lobby as them and of course a lot of people want to play Serial Killer so it is slower. Yet when I do lobby as Serial Killer it only takes 2 minutes tops. I live in NA and this may be the reason why but what I am saying is that any connection issues are most likely on your end. There are guides to how to fix the problem if it occurs like changing your region. I just don't want people saying stuff on DAY 1 like ""gaem is ded!!!11!!!!1!!!"". Once this gets cleared up I will write a more lengthy review on the game itself. Yet as the game is now it is fun and interesting.",Dead by Daylight

2018-10-11,0,0,453,False,Not Recommended,Its called DEDICATED SERVERS.Do you know what those are? I'm so tired of joining game after game and have crap ping to people cause they live across the world from me. It gives them an ADVANTAGE in a game that has RANKS. Get your god damn together. I've had this game since it came out and I thought maybe BY NOW you'd guys have gotten your act together. Friday the 13th had better servers with better ping then 90% of the games I get stuck in this game.Also the peer to peer server host allows hackers to easily you know HACK. I still see people using hacks that were an issue WHEN THE GAME FIRST CAME OUT and you guys STILL have not found a way to stop them? Then you come out with a bloody PAY shop? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You milk money out of people but can't have the most SIMPLE thing really needed for this game.The game is pretty fun but holy there is some rather serious issues with actually playing the game HACK and LAG free. The devs need to stop buying licensed characters and spend that money getting rid of the hackers and laggy people constantly hosting and making the game horrible for every one but themselves.I do NOT recommend this game for the obvious reason of the devs being greedy and lazy.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-18,0,0,61,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight is not worth dealing with the toxic ill behaved players in trials (matches).Whether you are a Killer or Survivor the gameplay is just un fun because of the people you play with and against.There isn't enough alleviation from the poor behavior on both sides of the fence.I've never turned away from a game to the point of not even asking for a refund but instead just having steam remove it from my account. This was a first for me and I didn't even think twice about the decision.It's seriously that overwhelming. It's either some Toxic Survivor or Toxic Killer and there is no break from it.Does it make it right? No.Does it make it fair? No.It makes every trial an unnecessary ball ache.Definitely buyers remorse.And...I suggest you tread that DLC sales pitch very carefully.I purchased 1 because I wasn't sure about Dead by Daylight. I am very grateful that I did purchase just the one while the steam summer sale was on. I'd feel rightfully upset had I done otherwise.While not dealing with the absolutely horrendous 2010 WoW addicts level of toxicity this particular group of gamers harbor Dead by Daylight itself doesn't offer much.Definitely not enough to overcome the horrible community.The overall game is very simple. It's mostly comprised of skill shots. No reticule and lots of indirect suggestion. Nothing is laid out in plain sight for you. It's a game of cat and mice not mouse mice.Some might say this makes trials more versatile because the rules are not lacking but very simple thus not being overly restricting so it allows for some unique interaction between killers and survivors.Survivors need to repair generators to power an exit gate and leave while not being caught and put on a meat hook by the Killer.Killers need to chase and catch Survivors to sacrifice on hooks to the entity so they can't escape.That's it.However because the game is so simple there's nothing really to look forward to.It maintains a huge level of RNG. Too much to really be competitive.Because perks items and relics (all objects in game that augment your character and their abilities) are all earned through an RNG system. This DOES prevent some forming of a META because the game will simply by design occasionally force both Killers and Survivors to play differently becasue the access they have to these skills and items are not reliably available.While I understand this may not be a direct reason it's not as enjoyable to play through regardless. I've always been generally against METAs as they tend to reduce a game down to mind numbing monotony. I don't think this is a good approach to that and make no mistake there is a form of META but it's not as persistent as it is with other games where skills and abilities are absolute and can reliably be accessed.I've got a pretty nice build Why does that need to be subject to RNG?The game is mechanically flexible enough between Killers and Survivors during trials (matches) that this is an unnecessary inhibitor to making builds.Looking at it as a whole Dead by Daylight ranges erratically between skills that are useless and those that are clearly broken or too favorable to those that have them based on the emphasis of the objectives in trials. There's is a middle ground but this doesn't mean the under utilized and over utilized skills aren't at extremes in both utility and numbers.All this being said I don't recommend Dead by Daylight 1. The community is not worth engaging with at any price.2. Dead By Daylight lacks a great amount of depth in gameplay.3. For as much success Dead By Daylight has experienced and the number of reliable DLC purchased. The user experience should be above what it is which is poor. This includes how your community interacts with itself.4. Dead by Daylight doesn't have permanent servers.*This review will not change.Thanks for reading.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-10,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,The concept is unique and interesting but the game doesn't seem ready many join game failures several games ended prematurely due to lag or multiple player disconnects several games I was able to win due to the killer apparently being bugged he was standing still and repeatedly swinging his weapon at a wall while players went about repairing generators and escaping with impunity. Lag is very dangerous in this game as with most online fighting games and ended up leaving me dead more than once.BE WARNED beyond the technical issues the game itself is extremely graphic gory dark and violent. Some games give you a sense of horror through music and sound but here you see your injured character moaning and crawling leaving a trail of blood get picked up like a sack of potatoes and hung up on a meat hook.

Freddy killers are overpowered although we won against him once or twice by sheer luck by the hatch. Camping killers are a pain especially when the killer that was matchmade to you has 1 500 hours in the game and has level 3 very rare perks that he can see where you are in the map by hooking survivors and whenever you are healing your fellow survivors. Game is a turn off to newcomers you cannot 'git gud' by being matchmade with high tier killers and dying every single time.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-18,0,0,375,False,Not Recommended,The short version The game is fun for some 8 hours maybe but I can't recommend it past that. I do not get matched with players of my skill level. Players are toxic. Gameplay is repetitive. Immersion is broken as Survivors become better at the game.The long version I thought this game was thrilling when I first played it. I started as Survivor and I thought it really captured the fear of being stalked by a powerful Killer. After some 10 hours though I started getting frustrated as I was making little progress in getting better at the game (I got sacrificed 2 out of 3 games) and the gameplay is somewhat repetitive.I was excited to switch to Killer to see how that goes but then that's when things really started going downhill. Despite playing several hours as a Killer the best I've ever managed was sacrificing two Survivors (despite having played many games as Survivor in which the Killer got all four of us) and that's couting matches where there have been disconnects. What makes matters worse is that players feel the need to insult me in chat at the end of the game. Most games I play Survivors are so skilled at running diversions taking shots for their allies that they can unhook someone right after I've put them up even if I'm still nearby. They gang up on me so much that the roles are reversed and as the Killer I've reason to fear them. I've watched a YouTube video where Survivors basically ignore the Killer and do whatever they want on the map it's so easy for them to evade him.This game had a great concept to begin with but I'm left with a very sour aftertaste.,Dead by Daylight

Then you will experience the best part about the game...hammering the ""Join a Lobby"" button or waiting for a long time in the ""Create a Lobby"" since the networking system is a total screw up. Most of the people already wrote thatthis game is a ""Failed to Join"" simulator and they are right! So after spending a couple minutes of hammering the ""Join"" button you end up in a lobby with people that played this game already for a couple of days. The game starts and since you are a newcomer you end upto be the first victim. The killer comes near you hits you once so you can't really escape that fast anymore hits you twice and you end up on the ground. Then he carries you to a hook where you get sacrificed. The ground animation and the sacrifice got a possibility to escape but let's be real here...they are just decoration or a good way to destroy your hardware. Hiding in this game is another point that is nearly useless. If you stay too long on one point the damn crows will circle around you and the killer will find you with ease. So compairing the game to other titles will end up in titles like Depth Evolve and any other game that is a competitive simulator with level system where there is a group of low health subjects fighting one high health subject.

2018-12-17,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,Can say without a doubt one of the ABSOLUTE WORSE games I have had the displesure of playing in my life. I got it under the recomendation of friends waiting 4 months to finally play it for 2 hours to only find out the following 1. The game is horribly made and too damn loud. I turn my settings in game out of game and set set down to singal digits for me to just be able to tollerate how unberably loud this game is. 2. any and all items I had that made the game remotely playable and somewhat fair were all items I had to win and pay for. I can be fine with that if it were not for the fact that the killers which you can just buy and get stuff with were just always going to be better regardless of what I had or was sharing even in a custom game with people saying they were going easy on me.3. How annoying the display/ alert system is. I know its a horror game and all no game should be this furstating to play with the stupid alerts to have you do something appearing and then only giving you milleseconds to respond before you get damaged are damaged etc etc.4. The killers are WAY too fast. Even with super rare speed perks and the killers having none and holding my sprint key I was constantly dying because I could not get away fast enough to avoid anything.5. If I filled a bar and did something that means it is done. Multiple times I struggled out of a Killer's grasp when I was being carried to a hook only to not get freed and was still hooked and again even with perks to get myself all of the hook all attempts to get off of them resulted in me dying faster.I cannot express this enough this is the WORST GAME ever to be made. I dont wanna pay money to play a game that if I want to even do SLIGHTLY BETTER I have to shell out even more cash to get it because game designers cannot make a balanced game and give it so you for free. These micro transactions to give you new killers and perks that make you better as a player and the only way you can be as good as them is to also pay for that is bad game design and bad for players. If any people who made this game are reading this you should honestly be ashamed you made such a terrible game. If I could I would without a doubt get a refund for this pile of I purchased. Do not play this game save your money and get a game that is actually worth your time because I can assure you this is not it.,Dead by Daylight

From playing rank 17 to 9 as killer I have an over 90 percent 3k kill rate. The main problem is that they nerfed survivor into the ground and then gave killer constant wallhacks in the form of way too many Aura reading perks. If you are even thinking about playing this game as a solo survivor then I would really not recommend that. They made it where any killer even one that has an IQ of 4 can now 4k the survivors consistently. They nerfed all aspects of SURVIVAL. They nerfed the chase stealth and even being able to get someone off the hook from a camping killer. This was all thanks to many killers who have over 3k hours on the game and do nothing but spam forums day after day complaining how they want easier games.

The only downside I have about this game is that its buggy. It would be great if they fix some of the bugs because they're a major issue to me and my friends. Some problems that im having are when I get placed in a game but get an endless loading screen and the only thing you have to do is end the game through task manager.. I also have a cool addon idea for this game. The killer can be Chucky he would have a low camera height like The Hag. His weapon would be a standard knife. Outfits could be the original one from childs play 1 without any scars&amp stiches and his second outfit could be one with all the stiches and marks on his clothes.Special could be that when you press the RMB he lays down on the ground and goes invisible and whenever a survivor gets near him he can gab onto their leg and stabs them to knock them down on the ground. or another one could be that whenever a survivor is in a 7m range of him and Chucky see's him it sends Chucky into frenzy and he chases the killer screaming and giving him a slight speed boost making his screen go red.I have no idea on perks as of yet.Overall I rate this game 9/10 and I think it deserves Steam GOTY!!,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-12,0,0,1273,False,Recommended,The most important thing I can say about this game is that it is absolutely FUN. Playing either side of a classic style horror movie is simply a blast and the game is being improved on a regular basis.That said there are bugs quite a few in fact. Some of them are extreme. There are some imbalance issues a couple of which are major. And while not being bland by any means the game is in its current state somewhat limited in scope. All that said the game remains a blast. I have soaked aroun 80 hours into it thus far and am only getting started. 4 Survivors 3 Killers a multitiude of perks 50 levels to achieve plus prestige a competitive ranking system...this game has much of what multiplayer gamers love and all for the relatively low price of $20. Fun improving and cheap. So long as you aren't expecting a full on digital miracle this game will give you hours of thrills.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-06,2,4,1542,False,Recommended,Every negative review i've read on here as been 100% spot on. And yet pretty much every review starts with a paragraph or two about all the things they love about this game. The reason is I and so many others have sunk 100's of hours into this game and yet we feel negative towards it because there's so much to fix still. But trust me when I say it's not all bad far from it. It is grindy there are bugs and no progress seems to be being made. But $20 for 100+ hours of gameplay. I believe i've paid about 15cents per hour and had some deeply frustrating moments but also some breath taking and exhilerating moments. Things i'll never forget. Even after all this time it's still terrifying. I've been robbed of a victory at the last second. I've done stupid things that got me killed. I've also risked everything to help a teammate and seen daring rescues. So I want to point out a few things to augment all the other very accurate and negative reviews by highlighting the postives. Pro's The concept Totally unique great idea.The sound/music Amazing very atmospheric leaves you totally gripped. The characters Again just incredible concepts and artwork. Terrifying and believable.Gameplay So much to love about this game. Hunting and being hunted by other people. Even though i hate how psycho some killers are it only adds to how intense and scary the game is. Yes it has some very annoying bugs. And it could be so much better. But it's the kind of experience that keeps you hooked. That gets you thinking while at work and leaves you frustrated that you can't play it while away from your computer. whether it's the perk combinations or tactics it gets you thinking. if nothing else i'd wait for a free weekend and give it a try. Who knows maybe they'll fix the all the bugs one day.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-22,0,0,4364,False,Not Recommended,"Almost spending around 3000 hours on this game i have concluded that it is not worth the money buying it! There is one quick sentence to explain why. The devs don't listen! Yea argue all you want ""They do listen it just takes time!"" Time time!I have spent more hours on this game then i have spent on all of my other games combined! I love this game to pieces! But i am at the point of almost uninstalling the game because of the devs work! Most of the devs are killer mains and there is nothing wrong with that! But most of them have or are camping and tunneling! No this review is not just about camping and tunneling but I want to go over the biggest issue first! Since day one of this game's release there has been camping and tunneling but now i have seen more camping and tunneling killers in one day then i have during a whole month at the launch of this game! Me personally I am a survivor main! I don't like playing killer because I feel bad for killing people exspecially when I know they have just come out of a match against a camping tunneling killer! It isn't fair! It really isn't! The worst part about the devs in this game is they don't listen to any of the community! They only listen to eachother! ""Hey this survivor is sooooo much faster then the nurse let's buff the nurse and make the survivors 30% slower""! All the ""feedback"" they have got is not from the players but by the people that play the game! I would really love to see the devs play a survivor match against a camping tunneling killer all day then see how us survivors feel! It isn't fun anymore! Ever since 1.5 all the devs have been doing is buffing the killers and debuffing the survivors! Yes i know! The survivor should not survive all the time! But it is a bit repetative when EVERYTIME the survivor dies! But no the devs don't care they only care about the killers! Perks like ""Borrowed Time"" shouldn't exist! You shouldn't have to run a perk to try and save your teammates! There should be a little bit of immunited for a second for the survivor that gets pulled off the hook! And then the devs come out saying ""Camping is a lagitimate stratagy!"" No no it isn't! What camping is is cowardly! The devs are just too afraid to admit that they are bad at killer! That is the only reason they came up with that statement!The other issue I have is the devs are constantly trying to add more things to the game to get people to come back! That is not the right way to do it! Everytime the devs come up with 1 new thing they add 30 new bugs to the game! They won't fix them tell it gets outa hand! I for one have sent the devs an email about my Myer's being broken (The Evil Within' meter won't go up when I am stalking a survivor) almost 5 months ago! And I still haven't got a fix for it! The Asylum glitch Nope they didn't fix that for 2 weeks when they could have fixed it the moment it happened!Now the final thing i want to talk about is the OP AF killers! Doctor! Least favorite killer in the game! Reasons? HE IS BROKEN! But no the devs don't care they just keep buffing him! When the doctor first came out he was fine! It was perfectly fine! But then he had 2 new updates and the last one set him to be the most OVER POWERED KILLER IN THE GAME! The devs themselves have even said the game is primarely about being stealthy and hiding! HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE SNEAKY AGAINST A KILLER THAT KNOWS WERE YOU ARE IF HE SHOCKS YOU! And now you can't even escape doctor. If you are shocked you can't vault or throw down pallets. You are basically screwed! And Cannibal! The second most OP character in the game! But no once again the devs don't care. They only care that they can get a 4 k every match! Cannibal's chainsaw attack should not be near as wide as it is! He should not be as fast as he is and his lunge should not be as long as it! But no the devs don't care!That is my review of this game! In my opinion don't get the game. The devs don't care about you or making this game better. They only care about getting the money they get from people buying their game that they won't fix and are making more and more people leave everyday!",Dead by Daylight
2017-11-03,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,The game is super boring. Basically forced to play solo. Could of been way better designed. Killer just camps hooked players and forces the survivors to play solo. Survivors really have 0 option to combat the killer. It would be A LOT more fun if the survivors had a way to stun the killer (flashbang etc.) to allow them time to get someone off a hook and run. Survivors shouldn't be able to leave if someone is hooked forcing them to play as a unit. As a 4 man survivor stack it is legit impossible to save someone who is hooked if the killer just camps their body which happens nearly every single game. Extremely Disappointed.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-01,2,2,1636,False,Not Recommended,The new patch is just awful. Pallets are still completely unsafe. Killers get a free hit across a pallet stun. Vaults get cancelled mid vault by doctor. Flashlight blinds are now impossible. 3 second delay after unhooking before you can start healing. On top of all that killers get lag advantage. I will not be playing this game until the devs fix these issues and I encourage all other survivors to stop playing to make the killer queues as long as possible.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-21,1,2,3443,False,Not Recommended,"Dead By Daylight is a great game in theory. If you have friends you can have fun playing as survivors or if you have no friends or life you can be a killer. The game involves a lot of grinding. The game is terribly balanced and is immensely stacked in the killers favour. The killers whine to the developers that survivors (particularily survivors who are friends in teamspeak) are overpowered leading to constant buffs for killers. In addition to this killers are usually bad people who will camp your body once you get hooked resulting in you dying before anything even happens in your match. The killers are able to hook you quickly due to cheap ""perks"" such as Iron Grasp Insidious A Nurses Calling and many more. Often the killer won't even hook you but will straight up kill everyone in the first 5 minutes using a ""Mori"" which is a cheap offering people use to kill survivors outright. The idea that survivors are OP in any way shape or form is so laughable it made me uninstall. I did have fun in my over 300 hours playing this game but only against killers who weren't bad people. When you have to leave it up to the nature of the player to determine how others will enjoy the game it's not balanced. If in the future the developers figure out a way to punish killers for camping hooks I may return to the game. I would not recommend the game to people unless you like grinding and getting dicked by unsporting ""killers"".Edit Oh yeah. I forgot to mention there is no way to block or dodge toxic killers in this game. And the BEST PART of DBD is the fact that your save data will spontaneously delete itself. Yeah. You have to manually go into your files and create a back up save file every time you exit the game unless you want your data to be randomly deleted.Edit The new Freddy Kreuger DLC for this game was fun at first but is now mind numbingly unfun and boring. The only counters to Freddy are SWF and pallet looping the two things that were already a problem in the game. On top of that Freddy has cheap add ons where a survivor will literally spawn into the match already in the dream world. The survivor just spawns in and is already being punished with half efficiency action speed AND having their aura visible to the killer. And the Freddy DLC being released on Double Blood points week just ruins it as every match is Freddy and they all want to slug you to death. Want to play Killer? Just have to wait 15 minutes to get a lobby since literally everyone is playing Freddy right now.Edit Killer EditionThis game is literally broken. The Killer is supposed to be the power role but it is actually the survivors that hold the power. Voice communications aren't built into the game and it wasn't balanced around survivors being able to communicate. But using third party software that is exactly what survivors do.One survivor can run the killer around the map using what are known as ""pallet loops"" and ""semi infinites"". Running in circles around pallets and vaulting through windows a survivor can literally run the killer around the entire map while their team is completing generators (all 5 of which can be completed in a matter of minutes if you aren't applying pressure). If they have an OP perk called Decisive Strike they will probably escape again. You may spend an entire match chasing 1 survivor who might escape you and teabag you at the exit gate. Basically to win as a killer at high ranks you rely on survivors making mistakes and that's not something they will do very often unless they are BOOSTED or inebriated. With the current change to the victory system killers must secure a certain numbr of hooks/deaths to rank up although survivors don't have to survive to rank up. If you're gonna play killer in this metagame don't expect to get any kills and if you do you will get harassed called a camper told to kill yourself etc because that is what this community is. The killer isn't feared. If you play killer you are literally submitting yourself for the survivors entertainment at your expense (basically you are a clown). UNLESS you play 1 of 3 killers and you are good with them (Nurse Billy or Huntress) you may stand a chance. All in all the only fun you will get out of this game is playing survivor and trolling the killer. Just remember there is a real human being controlling that killer and they probably aren't having as much fun as you.2 years on and the games progress can STILL randomly delete itself. That means starting over from scratch. Even if you have a backup of your save file and you send it to the devs they are too incompetent to do anything other than refund bloodpoints. If you had a legacy or rare cosmetic skin you are out of luck. Devs are corrupt and give out legacy skins to people they know and close friends like the community manager it's a disgrace. The point of legacy is it is supposed to be earned.",Dead by Daylight

2017-12-10,1,2,1697,False,Not Recommended,"CAMPING SIMULATOR GAME FROM DEVS WITH LOVE CLICK MECANCER HAVE HIGHER CHANCES TO BE TREATED THAN THIS GAME!Fun intense game with available lore about characters. Years later still needs tons of improvements lot of old &amp new bugs to be fixed glitches (they usually fix 2 buggs &amp 4 new one appear) but devs ignorance is most present and lately they care only about nerfing survivors boosting killers &amp stupid cosmetics.Game can be repetitive i played other repetitive games but this can be the same thing all the time so you can get bored fast if you don't like to farm after few rounds of hide &amp seek repair die evade or play as killer and you can get exploited by 360's exploit moves which btw can be done only on PC.I wish there was more enviromental details like heavy rain snow storm dust storm snow forest fire stuffs like this... only fog &amp some rain in the same map is not enough. Later they added a snowy glitched map.Most of killers are camping tunelling &amp it's frustrating to have the match fked up because of this. They sit near the hook until survivor die or if you lay on ground they sit over you so no one else will come to heal you (my suggestion is if more than 5 sec near the hooked player you start lose X points/sec).But same here to devs simply ignore this and they release killers with perks which making camping more ""effective"" and not bannable actually they barely ban anything most useless anti cheat software.Also there is nothing to stop rage disconnecting abuse since in game report system is a bad jocke i played with &amp against the same abusive exploiters players over &amp over again and they continue doing it becase they know that no one take any measures if you dc 3 times out of 5 matches should be insta ban!Plus EAC aka Easy Anti Cheat BS it's 200% useless game is lurking with cheaters/hackers worse than in CS &amp PUBG. I paid for all the dlc's because i like to support the games that i enjoy &amp i actually still enjoy this game even in this state devs exploit players like me but like i was write above there are a bunch of stuffs that still hurt the gameplay years later and the developers simple don't care they want players money and we are dumb enough to pay them even if the content &amp support is terrible as it is.Suggestions events should be awesome but this are not either a Krampus killer with a snowy storm map is a MUST in this game for the X mas winter event. Same for the Halloween event which should be the best event in this game make it happen with the Jack O'Lantern.

EAC is the worst useless anti cheat ever &amp gives a lot of errors chat is bad (while in lobby) if write in chat then go spectate &amp come back to the lobby you can't see the chat history anymore also ctrl+v/c is not working but even with that the cheaters spam the chat no ping limit! make many matches unplayable when join a poor internet host (even f2p games have options for ping setup limitation e.g. i would like to set mine up to max 150ms so i would play only against those players limit). players that are host (killers) &amp abandon the lobby will send everyone to the start so have to start que again this happens a lot curent achieve increased to 9 consecutive games from which the host abandoned (and no i wasn't in a SWF team) i suggest cooldown/lockdown from que at least 1 hour for whoever disconnect as the lobby hostJust a glimpse of how much this game is broken &amp filled with a toxic community https //clips.twitch.tv/BraveCogentRadicchioPraiseItGame is literally full with cheaters exploiters boosted accounts multiple bans actually does nothing to them if there isnt a permanent one.

2017-01-20,1,10,2343,False,Not Recommended,"A good game which is absolutely ruined by two factors.1. The game directly encourages people to play like trolls due to the points system. The objective of the game as a victim is not to escape you only gain 5000 points for that. You can get more points if you get chased rescue other survivors from hooks drop pallets on the killer and THEN escape. This leads to victims teabagging the killer to force a chase swarming around hooks to rescue people rather than fixing the generators lurking around pallets instead of fleeing etc. The hook swarming by victims encourages the killer to camp the hook which leads to endless crybaby behaviour after the match from the victims such as insults and false reporting.2. The first point wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the second. Trash talking and abusive behaviour is part of gamer culture after all. The second (and biggest) problem about the game is the control freak developers. If you look in the forums there are many threads that are locked. There are many users that are banned from posting. The anti cheat system which is a mandatory part of this game results in many false positives but the developers would rather ban nine legitimate users instead of letting one cheater go. On their Twitter accounts (which aren't followed by the vast majority of players) they arbitrarily declare certain playstyles ""cheating"" and threaten to ban people over it because they're not intelligent enough to make those playstyles unbeneficial or impossible through patches. Rather than acknowledging the issues and fixing them the developers just prefer to add a report button so bedwetting victims can report a killer everytime they die.By listening to the most negative hostile voices and obeying their demands the developers have essentially become the game's most salty survivors. This community isn't toxic it's just a normal gamer community that sees abusing the report feature as a way to get a tactical advantage. The developers however are 100% raw sewage because they let the inmates run the asylum. They'll kill the game with their police state attitude. Allowing people to report other users for ""griefing"" is a licence to let them report for literally anything. They shouldn't take such reports seriously but they do.I won't use bots I won't hack and I won't insult other users but I'll play this game however I want regardless of the consequences. I suppose this will lead me to getting banned at some point with a possible VAC ban on my record even though I was playing the game unmodded and perfectly legitimately all because I was facecamping or some other negligible tactic which annoyed developers with zero sense of a proportional response.",Dead by Daylight

2018-08-01,2,3,36,False,Not Recommended,"Even though I have not played that much I am currently Rank 15 in Season Level 24 player and Level 36 Kate Denson Survivor.All I have to say this the community is toxic as hell especially killers towards survivors. This game is so unbalanced in terms of killers versus survivors. And I will begin a list of reasons why Any perk a killer possesses will make their playthrough easier however most survivor perks are totally USELESS. For example Boil Over is totally effing useless where is this 75% struggling effect that helps me escape a killer? I don't see it. And the perks that are useful like Resilience only have a 6 9% increase rate? Really? That small? DEVELOPERS SERIOUSLY?! But look at a killer Perk like Hex holy crap that perk really does damage to a survivor's Skill Check for generators. And you can actually see it. It's not fair. Don't even get me started on the Slipper Meat perk TOTALLY USELESS!! What is the point of having 3 extra chances of getting off a hook if it NEVER works and RARELY works unless you have a ""luck"" offering?! How the hell? There are hooks EVERYWHERE hey devs want to be balanced? Why not put the same amount of hooks as there are generators. There are five generators so put five hooks in the map. Not more than a dozen hooks. Why do killers have second chances but survivors don't? We as survivors have to level up so hard or wait to unlock a perk in the Shrine of Secrets to even get something that can remotely help us. Ready for this developers?* For example look at The Pig this killer can not only hook us but even if we get off the hook she has already attached a trap to our face which we have to get off during a time limit while trying to avoid her. Michael almost makes no sound and shows up unannounced to most survivors. Other killers can teleport become invisible see through closets throw things and have special powers. Why not give survivors special abilities beyond being able to wiggle better escape a grasp (RARELY) hide see things and/or run ""faster""? The flashlight is mostly useless why not make it so survivors can throw things at killers to stun them? Why not make it easier to break hooks? Why not give survivors ""special powers""? It is not fair The Hag can teleport in front of a hook if you trying to save some multiple times. It is not fair that if I am saved off a hook and I get re hooked I die? The only negative thing that can happen to a killer is getting stunned. That's it!! There should be more it's not fair they are immortal. I get the concept of the game is avoiding the killer but don't make the killer untouchable. We as survivors get punished if we camp out too long in a closet and have ravens become perched on it so killers know where we are. Why can't killers be punished for camping too long in front of hooks waiting for a player to die? Can't you make the Entity disallow the killer from being around a hook too long? SO UNFAIR!!!It's totally not fair and on top of that the killers have WAY TOO MUCH stamina they are always faster this is not fair.Why are there so many in game hints for a killer to spot a survivor but even when a survivor levels up with a perk like Spine Chill its still completely useless? Killers have ravens generator explosions pain sounds running sounds grunting sounds that notify where survivors are. Whereas survivors can only see each other if the are on the ground or hooked. It's not fair we can't be notified where each other are.So basically this game is really EASY for killers and really HARD for survivors.Peace out devs you guys are horrible.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-28,0,0,68,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight A fresh idea with so much potential that's muddled by so many nagging issues.I love Dead by Daylight and despite this review I still play it but honestly the game has so many issues I would never ever recommend it to someone I know and the sad part is so many of the issues I have with the game could be easily fixed however the developers of the game are either totally ignorant of these issues or are just unwilling to fix them despite the game being in 1.3.x when it feels like an Early Access title.I'd say the main kick in the teeth is that these issues seem to take a back seat to the tons of DLC they pump out none of the profit of which seems to be invested into the game better. I'm pretty sure a $20 game with not only cosmetic DLC not only character DLC but BEST CHARACTER P2W is pretty god damn anti consumer. YES seriously the best killer in the game is a DLC and he's way above the rest of the killers in terms of power making him the most commonly played killer in the game and making a game with the potential for so much variety be even more linear predictable. Anyway with that complaint out of the way let me tell you about some of these issues The biggest one is MATCHMAKING I don't know who the thought it'd be a good idea to use P2P (YES I SAID PEER 2 PEER) CONNECTION A GOOD IDEA IN 2016 BUT THEY DESERVE TO BE FIRED. Not only is the matchmaking p2p but it ING SUCKS. Sometimes you just get ing infinite loading screens sometimes it'll kick you out of a lobby for no reason right out into an infinite loading screen your match making experience will either take around 2 minutes or it'll take a around 10 minutes depending on how the game's feeling. Then since this game made in 2016 uses P2P hosting the killers can lag switch you for easy killers. The Community. You essentially have two types of people. The killer and survivor mains. The killer and the survivor communities are just horrible toxic they call the other party cry babies and demand nerfs for borderline exploitive tactics that killers or survivors use (Face camping for example or survivor pallet looping) yet defend their own exploits while never wanting to find a middle ground. Everyone is obsessed with winning rather than having fun sometimes you have a killer just sit there one pixel from your character holding down space bar so if anyone tries to save you they get captured too making rescue literally impossible while the 3 other survivors just get all the genies up since the game calls one kill a victory for the kiler. Horribly thought out easy to exploit mechanics. You have survivors who can just endlessly loop around killers making it easy for survivors to waste all of a killers time you have face camping killers who can literally just stand a pixel from a hooker character and make it impossible for rescue since the game calls 1 kill a victory are just to name a frustrating few.TL DR It's P2W it's P2P the developers are totally ignorant of the games issues or are just flat out refusing to fix them because they're too busy pumping out P2W DLC don't ing support these horrible practices.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,2,4,75,False,Not Recommended,i dont recommend this game at all.You cant play with a team against a unknown killer..what is not just a bad thing if you are a teamplayer but even if you play solo cause it takes 10 20 minutes to find a game cause every 5 secound someone is joining the lobby than realising that it is not the same lobby as their friends and than leaving. at that non stop.so you have problem to find a game as a survivor? try to find one as a killer! cause everyone wants to play a killer ( what i rly understand i tell you more about it later) but you need 4 survivors to play a game you just never will find a game. I waited for 20 minutes and just one survivor joints the lobby and leaved it after a second. the one game i could play as a killer was rly a sign of pure luck.That much for the techical aspects.But even worser are the balance.i watched many lets plays about this game and gets very hyped...but i realised that in not a single game that i have seen any suvivor..well survived! the normal hunter with the traps was already so far ahead that it is nearly impossible to win. but i thought well its the beta in the final game they will nerf the hunter a bit....i was so false. The 2 new hunters are even so much more op that even i as an total beginner could easy hunt all 4 survivors down...before they could even activate the third generator. Maybe the game gets more fair if you unlock better percks etc. but the balancing at the beginning that i have seen so far is absolute nonsense.maybe the developers will fix the technical issues and the balance problems but at this state i can never recommend anyone to play this except to play with 4 other friends and i just hope that steam give me a refund.maan after i was so hyped about it this game is such an dissapointmant.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-17,0,0,1461,False,Recommended,This game is my favourite game so far. The reason why is because in most games its the same objective like an fps game shoot die shoot die u know wats gonna happen right? But in this game theres 1 objective turn on all 5 generators and escape but u never know wat could happen u could die u could escape u could get on a hook u can save some1 theres many other possibilities and u get to choose if u wanna play as killer or survivor. This game is 9.5/10 because i have 1 small issue is that its not really well optimized but other than that good job with the game ),Dead by Daylight

2018-05-26,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I rarely write reviews but this is quite possibly the worst game I have ever played. Period. Janky controls aren't the half of it players exploiting game mechanics to make them unkillable to the killer which just ruins the fun of being a killer when someone can dance around you for a whole minute or use the wood pallets to kite you into mindlessly following the same person for what is essentially the core of what the game is. Not to mention the plethora of complicated and unneeded ""depth"" to the game with the perks and items that may as well be a foreign language with little explanation as to what they mean this is coming from a gamer who loves perk progression and similar systems. My experience as a survivor was different I got to sneak around for half the matches fail every skill check on the generators whilst I watch the bar painfully and slowly fill up before blowing up in my face and watch myself die over and over which I can assure you is not fun.I wanted to like this game I really did but both sides Killer and survivor where possibly the worst experiences and least fun I've had as a gamer that has left me frustrated and disappointed.

2017-01-04,0,0,407,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight is a great game at its core the object of the game is pretty simpleYou can play as a killer in first person view your goal is to hunt the survivors and sacrifice them to the entity or as a survivor in 3rd person view your goal is to do generators and help other survivors escape.For such a simple concept the game is highly addictive the graphics imo are great and set the mood well the sounds are amazing the game feels like you are in the actual horror setting.

2016-12-30,0,0,447,False,Recommended,This game may get a ton of bad reviews and the community may knock the devs a lot but lets be honest there is a still a ton of people playing this game. Why is that you say well because it is a really fun game that is even better to play with friends. Even though its the same objective each time you jump in its just addicting to continue and load up for the next. Speaking from mainly playing as survivor its a lot of fun trying to dodge the killer sneak around power the generators and escape it really is a rush!Now to be honest there are some bugs that pop up every so often. I see these bugs maybe once every 10 games. By bugs I mean killer having 2 different killer moves (Nurse with a chainsaw for example) is that game breaking sure am I still going to go and load up for another you bet your a**!This game is great. It has issues to work out but we are all on the holiday season right now. If we give the devs a chance I think they will continue to improve the game.

(A hint to that later)I am really enjoying playing the game and haven't encountered any bug whatsoever til now so I really ask myself which bugs users are talking about. I only experienced some people disconnecting because of connectivity issues but nothing more.The bloodweb The bloodweb is a procedurally generated skilltree that allows you to spend your hard earned bloodpoints (LITTLE HINT Use killers to farm points in the beginning and use them on survivors) to buy items perks offerings and more.As a killer You have your very own skill and you are walking around the map trying to find and kill the survivors. After landing a hit on one of them you need to wait a few seconds for a post hit animation that slows you down and prevents you from hitting repeatedly. You have to watch out for people using wooden planks to stun you and keep an eye on the hook you just hooked a wounded survivor on in case he gets freed. If a survivor is hooked long enough he ""dies"" and gets sacrificed. Mindgames when chasing one of them are welcome (fake a left turn and then go right).As a survivor Teamplay and stealth are key to victory. Each survivor has an increased chance to find perks fitting them in their bloodweb. (Meg will find more helping her escape run faster or hide easier etc.) You can heal your teammates repair generators (if you repair enough of them you can open the gates and escape) sabotate hooks search crates etc. Eevery once in a while While you are doing these things you can hear a sound that warns you of an impending skill check. Skill checks mean you have to hit space at the right time or you will make noise alerting the killer. Items with their corresponding add ons help you in this task or in survival.",Dead by Daylight

2016-09-16,0,0,267,False,Not Recommended,I just played a game where I was the survivor and the killer was the trapper. I was the last one alive and the killer caught me. What he did afterwards should not be allowed in the game. He placed two traps next to each other picked me up and stepped on one of his own traps drops me then I get trapped by the second trap. He did that for the remainder of the time and it went on for about 10 minutes of me not being able to do anything while he was farming points like that. I did not want to leave because of the leave punishment of dropping down one whole rank. I think this is a major issue that needs to be looked over. Add on) I just played a game today 9/23/16 and for some reason my screen froze and I got kicked out of the game. I went down a whole rank.... They really need to do something about this too deranking due to the server... this game just keeps getting worse with things like this. After the update it just became worse. Takes longer to get into game keep getting kicked out of lobby. Edit 9/10. So now it keeps saying CHEATER DETECTED and will not let me play any games even though I have been legit. Waste of $20 if this game keeps doing this to me even though I m not cheating. This si the third time it has happened to me. The first 2 times i Verified the integrity cache and it worked but now it does not. Did it 4 times and it is still saying CHEATER DETECTED. They need to fix all these damn bugs cause I did not pay $20 to be labeled a cheater and not be able to play this game. If not I demand my $20 back. Edit 10/1. I just played a game today and the killer was taking me to a hook. I wiggled all the way and it was max but I couldnt get off. It was max for 5 seconds and I could not get out of the killers hold. I heard this happened to others before too so this must be a bug and needs to be fixed. If its not a bug then the killer mustve been hacking.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-03,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,LITERALLY! one of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had with a hide and seek game... You pick survivor which is mis labeled as DIE WITH FRIENDS. If you play killer all good you can be a braindead faceroll retard with autism and still kill at least 2 people. Meanwhile there are little crybaby's complaining about how the trapdoor should be harder to find or that certain survivor perks are broken / this has got to be the funniest F**KIN S**T I've ever heard. I could literally play killer with one hand and still kill 4 people I don't want to play the game solo... I'm not a loser. Anyone who is a no life loser. Take it away on killer. This is your game. I'd have to find some mega level genius hacker or something and get him/her to script me some speed hacks and crap just to win against certain killers. All killers outrun you by a mile I might add. Wiggling is futile. They see better then you some teleport and a few have one hit kill. If that isn't enough you leave scratches when u run and blood when you're hurt that take forever to go away I'd get a refund but sadly it's been past 2 hours. All this game does is me off unless I play killer. Play deceit or some other similar game. This one blows unless u wanna play solo as killer. P.S. I know there's things I don't understand about the game but it's obvious killer are busted AF! I'd know a thing about busted games been gaming since 95' ),Dead by Daylight

2017-11-07,0,0,1985,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is a fun and enjoyable game. Although the game has repetitive objectives actions/perks taken and used throughout the trial will make each match different in how everything plays out. My only complaint is the fact that the game's developers didn't do an 'acceptable' job of optimizing the game overall. This can create a noticeable amount of lag/drop on framerates at times (even with the best gaming equipment) which might hinder your progress during gameplay as killer or survivor.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-20,0,0,1831,False,Not Recommended,"Edit 2 2018killer nerfs in this game since release to counter it as we were challenged to do (which would again somehow ""prove"" that survivors have been receiving the short end of the stick and therefore survivors cannot be overpowered)Disclaimer Since the original list includes the fixing of exploits (and other questionable things) as ""nerfs"" the fixing of exploits bugs and other things of that nature on the killer's side are therefore listed as ""nerfs"" here aswell.Also keep in mind that it only lists what has been nerfed or ""nerfed"" without any mention of any actual context or any comparison of the severity of nerfs between that of killers and the survivors (since the original list has also thrown context completely out of the window (for context never seems to suit the survivor main argument))Anyway here is the actual list which needless to say is much bigger than the survivor counterpart General killer nerfs removed the ability to be able to prevent the unhook prompt from popping up by standing in front of a hooked survivor (since you listed the fixing of an exploit as a ""nerf"" that's what I'm doing right here aswell)* buffed pallets from the stun happening at the middle of the pallet drop animation to the start of the animation the ammount of pallets have been increasing each time shortly after they supposedly made less pallets spawn on the maps Nerfed bloodlust (3 times) increased the hook timer by 15 seconds per stage Removed the ability to be able to bypass borrowed time with insta down mechanics* removed the ability to be able to consume decisive strike without it having any effect on the killer when dropped* Made it harder to rank up for killers with the victory cube nerfed the ivory and ebony memento mori offerings Changed the killer's fov to make it harder to see survivors at a very close range* Changed the scratch marks to in many instances not accurately represent where the survivor ran off to* Changed the sound occlusion multiple times to make it harder for killers to hear where survivors are* buffed mist (offerings) making it harder for killers to find survivors added indicators for survivors to tell them when certain hex perks are being used increased the (default) duration of the stun after wiggling out Increased the wiggle penalty for dropping survivors from 25% to 33%. reduced the size of the target lock on hitbox of survivors added the ability for survivors to be able to enter the hatch from all angles removed the killer's ability to be able to see survivors on hooks added that the killer blocks the aura of the hooked survivor when the killer stands or moves in front of the hooked survivor from the point of view of a survivor looking at the hooked survivor* removed the ability to be able to use items that belonged to other killers (i.e. myers with a chainsaw etc.)* added tiles in which there are areas which are unsurpassable for killers but passable for survivors (the so called ""fat shaming"" spots)* increased the angle from which you can blind killers introduced pallets which can be broken from only 1 side* introduced pallets which are standing upright that cannot be passed or broken by the killer until a survivor performs the ""drop pallet"" animation* increased the range from which killers can be stunned with a pallet drop added the pallet vacuum for survivors changed the combine harvesters on coldwind farms to be more survivor sided (twice) removed the killer's ability to be able to fly* reduced the ammount of crows that spawn on the map changed the way survivors interact with crows by making it so that when a survivor crouches near a crow it will not alert the crow removed the ability to be able to earn bloodpoints from hitting a survivor that is on a hook* reduced the ammount of information that is available to the killer about the survivors in the pre game lobby reduced the overall skillcheck chances of survivors working on generators which decreases the overall effectiveness of perks which affect skillchecks Removed the 3 O'clock skillchecks which decreases the overall effectiveness of perks which affect skillchecksPerks nerfed shadowborn (twice) nerfed spies from the shadows (spies from the shadows did not work at all for a long period of time)* nerfed bloodhound nerfed No one escapes death (twice) nerfed Play with your food nerfed Save the best for last nerfed unrelenting nerfed thrill of the hunt nerfed iron grasp (twice) nerfed brutal strength nerfed deerstalker nerfed a nurse's calling nerfed franklin's demise nerfed sloppy butcher nerfed thanataphobia (removed dead survivors affecting the living)* nerfed knock out (made open handed affect it) nerfed whispers (increased the volume of the whispers to make it harder to hear survivors)*Trapper removed the ability to be able to trap hooks increased the minimal distance at which the trapper can place a trap next to another one changed honing stone from putting someone into the dying state guarranteed to having a mere 50% chance of putting a survivor into the dying state after having been caught in a trap shadownerfed the size of the hit box of the trapper's traps several times changed the setting trap indicator to no longer match where the trapper actually sets his traps* removed the trapper's ability to be able to place traps on the hatch decreased the time it takes to disable a trap from 5 seconds to 2 seconds removed the ability to be able to set traps through staircases and certain floors* changed the trapper's traps to get stuck into walls or other objects when the traps were disabled or the killer would grab someone out of a trap near a wall or object*Hillbilly increased the duration of the stun when bumping into an object removed the ability to flick* removed bloodlust from when using his chainsaw* reduced the effectiveness of the addons which reduce the volume of the chainsaw increased the cooldown on the hillbilly's chainsaw removed the ability to be able to instantly break a pallet with the hillbilly's chainsaw within a 3 second window when the hillbilly had revved up his chainsaw and afterwards didn't hit anything at any given point after the last time he broke a pallet* removed the hillbilly's ability to be able to put a survivor into the dying state while simultaneously breaking a pallet when a survivor slides over a pallet as the pallet is being chainsawed*Wraith added an increased cloaking time on the windstorm addons (white and blood) increased the rarity of the blink addon without changing it's qualitiesNurse reduced the ammount of default blinks from 3 to 2 reduced the nurse's movement speed from being the same as trapper wraith hillbilly etc. to being even slower than the movement speed of survivors (while running) nerfed every single addon she has nerfed the range of her lunge after a blink removed the ability to be able to look up during her fatigue* removed the ability to be able to break pallets interact and grab during the nurse's fatigue* added an attack slowdown when swinging while carrying a survivor* removed the nurse's ability to be abEDIT....negative now due to the massive killer nerfing going on atm.Latest killer freddy will be turned to nothing he will.be a worthless midget running around the map.Not only this the dev seem only to listen to the survivor cries. Is it perfect? No. Is it fun? Bloody hell yes. This game isn't going to be for everyone. Odds are you ARE going to be helpless as a suvivor. That's the point. Survivors are suppose to be helpless against a Killer. As a suvivor you don't play to win games you play to survive them. And as a Killer you play to do one thing and only one thing kill. If you don't like being helpless against an unstopable Killer IF he finds you then odds are you aren't going to like Dead by Daylight.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-21,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Greetings Reader If you are planning on buying this game first off the visuals are great and any type of windows computer even with low specs can run this game. I will warn you there are a few things killers and survivors love to do a lot. CAMPING (Killers) &amp WINDOW HOPPERS (Survivors). If you rage and hate being camped and never escaping death make sure you play as the killer. If you hate window hoppers more then play as the survivor. The game is great and the concept is amazing. It isn't what I expected because when I watched it on youtube it seemed that it would be even more fun. But it is addicting and I would recommend it to anyone who does not want to be scared. Personally this game does not scare me but if you are younger than 12 I would say don't play it. If you are younger than a mature age which may be young adult do not play this game because it is not appropriate for everyone. My favorite killers (Listed by order) are the Wraith Trapper and Hillbilly. I also want to include I bought this game one day ago and I have played it for two hours already almost three. I love how their is no drugs sex language etc. in the game. There is only gore and violence which is good for a horror game. Making a multiplayer horror game is a great idea because it really adds to the layer of mystery because you don't know what the killer's character is or who the people you are playing with happen to be. I would recommend trying to get some friends to play so that you can fix the camping problem. I rate this game 8/10 because of its concept and the multiplayer involved. I do not like 2/10 of it because of the camping but if I play as the killer it is much easier to play. Also the windows hoppers are really annoying. I usually just ignore them and go for the other survivors because while I chase the window hoppers people are getting generators!Have fun MrJastyP.S.This game takes many days of practice before you can master killing and surviving. I would recommend practicing surviving first. It is harder to survive because there are more buttons you have to use than the killer. Also I would recommend getting a steam controller because it is much easier to play with a controller than a keyboard.,Dead by Daylight

It's really a great 1st person (killer) 3rd person (survivor) game which gives you the feeling of an RPG game while each character has his own traits.

Belongs in the late 1990s.,Dead by Daylight
2017-10-14,0,0,204,False,Not Recommended,"At the point of writing this review I have 134.6 hours logged in the game. The game has some glaring issues that massively detract from the overall fun factor of the game.First and foremost I believe the survivors should have invulnerability frames when jumping over a palet or through a window. It defeats the purpose of trying to escape using them if you're locked in the animation as the survivor but the killer can still hit you. Furthermore YOU CAN STILL BE HIT BY THE KILLER EVEN WHEN YOU FULLY MAKE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A PALLET OR WINDOW!!! THIS IS INFURIATING!!! Before people question my internet or my computer my internet is fast my computer is a top tier gaming rig and my monitor outputs the game at 144hz. It's not my setup. It's the game and I call t.Leatherface swings his chainsaw seven times after being charged. SEVEN TIMES!!! This makes it next to impossible to dodge because it's an instant one shot down if he even hits you once and he gets seven chances. The odds are extremely in his favor. He also runs extremely fast so he pretty much makes the hillbilly obsolete in pretty much every way except the hillbilly can use his chainsaw charging move to get across the map faster. The hillbilly is properly balanced because even though his chainsaw move is a one shot down he only swings it once and he's can't move much left and right while running so he's challenging to control when he's running. Leatherface is a good killer but he needs to be balanced. Instead of seven swings maybe four. Also maybe make him run a bit slower.The Doctor is extremely annoying to play against to the point that it is literally no fun. The Doctor's electrical area effect move makes it impossible to hide if you are near him. Every player playing the Doctor that I've played against just spams this move every couple seconds. Eventually it hits someone then they just chase them down and inevitably hook them. Then when survivors try to go for the hooked player the Doctor is still spamming the electrical move and finds where people are before they can even get close enough to help. Also just being near him even if he isn't doing his electrical move starts charging your sanity meter eventually making you go insane. Once you reach level three you start seeing things and screaming which gives away your position. You can take a minute and ""snap out of it "" but you don't actually snap out of it. You only go back down to level two. So you're not screaming but you're still at a major disadvantage because again your sanity meter charges from just being in general proximity with the Doctor. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING and not fun.If you are playing with friends as survivors and you can't connect to the host the game should dump you back to the lobby you and your friends started in not all the way back to menu. This game has been out for a long time now that's just poor development plain and simple.Lastly I feel that the killer perk ""IRON GRASP"" detracts from the spirit of the game. As a survivor it's already hard enough escape the killers as most of them run WAY FASTER. Then you have to fill up the struggle meter on top of that for a small chance of being able to hop off the killers shoulder. When you get downed and you're getting picked up there's a slight hope you could still escape and maybe depending on where on the map you get picked up you might be far enough away from a hook to struggle free before the killer reaches one. Adding iron grasp makes this literally impossible because no matter how far away from any hook you may be you are NEVER getting that struggle meter full. You would be lucky to even get it halfway. So whenever me and my friends realize that the killer has iron grasp we don't even bother trying to struggle because it's pointless.There are also elements of the map that look like you can go through but you can't. You're running from the killer you see a body sized split between a rock and a tree so you go for it. Nope you get stuck because that body sized split is actually a wall with an invisible texture on it to make it look like your could go through but you can't. This led to some unfair deaths but as I've learned to spot these areas and run around them these unfair deaths happen a lot less. This is poor design imo.I've had a lot of fun with this game but at this point those flaws are drastically weighing down the longevity of the game to the point where I don't see myself playing much longer unless these issues are resolved.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,4,5,147,False,Not Recommended,"I'd give a hard pass for the $20 entrance fee that the game asks for. I know I'm not some ""DbD VeTErEn"" with copious hours to say how the game has changed over time but there's problems that get in the way of making it a great asymetrical multiplayer game. I would only pick this up if you're able to play with friends when playing as a survivor which is the only circumstance that I bought it. From the survivors' perspective this game feels just bad for the majority of the time I've spent on it. Queuing solo is the worst way to play a survivor. There is no way to communicate with other survivors in game with the exception of only two emotes to ""follow me"" and point (so if you play with a novice player there's no kind of direction that you or others can give to them in order to help out the rest of the survivors). Although the experience of getting matched with constantly horrible teammates is from my perspective it seems consistant with what others have said about this game. Killers and their annoyance can vary greatly but the more experienced killer mains popped up than novice killers some of the dlc killers feel more cheap in their abilities especially players that have commited to using them ie pay to win. The largest complaint towards killers are the fact that some player just love camping and there's really no good way of rescueing another player. Sometimes it just feels as if every killer I played against for a time had the most annoying perks on which felt like a constant string of games where I'd be killed swiftly regardless if I was playing cautiously. Playing as killers on the other hand feels for the most part fine as in no new player is going to dominate over survivors from the start. It does take time to get decent in order to be a good killer. Playing as killers feels like there's at least some learning curb while survivors on the other hand feel really punished by actions of toxic survivors and killers. There are more than enough times to play as a lone survivor with no generators done because of either incompitent survivors or (mainly) killers that have wiped out anyone that can get enough generators to get a hatch to appear on the map (in these senarios which is easy for killers to patrol undone generators making the task of escaping nil to slim).What really hurts this game is the part of the player base that I've played with most of them being toxic. I do like how it's a horror movie themed game plus it's a funner experience when playing with friends. You're playing Rainbow Six Siege toxic 2.0 electric horror boogaloo minus a voice and text chat. For the people that say ""Oh YoU CAn PlAy SelFisH aAnD EsCapE"" or ""YoUr NOt SuPPoSe To WiN EvERy TiMe"" or ""YoU HaVeNt SPeNt EnOuGh TiMe WaTchIng YOuTubE StRAt VidEoS"" there's plenty of multiplayer games that have a much better sense of balancing and learning regardless whether or not it's an ""asymetrical"" multiplayer game. In a compitent game if I loose I can change how I play and eventually win at some point because I learned which is an occurance I have never had with this game especially when considering the survivor gameplay. Bad killer a really good chance you'll escape good killer quit the game there's no way to outsmart them because of the game's perk system and killer's abilities. Only buy this game during a sale and when you have three other friends ready to play DBD with you when playing a survivor. Or better yet play gmod murder. Playing with friends is the only way that I've managed to get almost 50 hours out of the game.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,0,0,1362,False,Recommended,This game is great and I love it to pieces. It's totally worth getting for the people that enjoy the type of game it is. You'll need to learn and try to adapt to all the issues that the game currently has and hope that you dont have a group of toxic people because that just ruins the fun for everyone. It really doesn't deserve all the negativity it's getting. The devs are working on finding that perfect balance that we all want to see in the game but obviously that requires time and ideas. Instead of all the complaints they're getting from frustrated people they should be getting ideas and constructive feedback to help.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-28,0,0,237,False,Recommended,well devs i think it is the time to stop campers PERMANENTLY!!!! I am thinkng of a circle around the survivor that is hooked and if the circle stays in that circle for more than 20 seconds he will be forced to leave the game the circle must be outside of his heartbeat range so please try and add this into the game to stop campers by a very harsh punishment,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-16,2,1,1106,False,Recommended,No matches found sim 2016.However once you do find a game it is quite enjoyable. This one time a killer dispatched my entire team (who I believe may have been new to the game) however upon capturing me (after a lengthy chase) he proceeded to take me to the exit hatch where he allowed me to wriggle free and escape but not before I was able to thank him by crouching several times and spinning in a circle he too even joined in. So if you're looking for a game where you can dance with the very person who is out to brutally murder you then this is the game for you. Btw whoever the killer was in this game I would like to thank you firstly for being a good sport and secondly for restoring my faith in the people who play the killers of this game.

(Depends what u like ofc) This has such a good objective and its good ballanced on how hard it is for survivors to survive and how hard it is for killer to kill survivors! You will proably find the game hard to begin with but when you learn how to move and where to go you will start enjoying the game! When you learned the basics you can learn the pallets and how to use them (they are wery important for survival) and also try to master the flashlight so you can help your team! There is ofc bugs like there is in every game but the developers are always fixing bugs and they keep you updated every week on theyr live stream. I have over 700 hours and can there for afther experience say that this game is wery recommended to buy if you like online horror games with and objective to escape as an team!,Dead by Daylight

Sadly however and irrespective ofö the game's potential for fun. Dead by Daylight suffers some gigantic flaws that will practically be impossible to balance or work out. Namely the biggest issue with the game is the fact that as the killer you basically HAVE to camp the person you have hooked due to how sluggish the killer's movement and attacks are and how insanely quickly the hooked victim can be rescued. All of the killers' abilities are completely situational and none of them can really handle a group of survivors that work as a team. Now that might sound crazy in this kind of game but look around at other reviews and watch some gameplay and you'll see. Only really 2 of the killers at the moment are remotely viable Leatherface whom is undoubtedly the best and Hillbilly which is really similar but has a worse off chainsaw attack. The rest of the killers aren't even fun because it is so easy for the survivors to keep them at bay.Whilst playing the free weekend it became really obvious that to solve one balancing problem in this game you would cause an even larger bunch of problems. For example if you buffed the killers people who play survivors would complain. If you buffed survivors (they are already better) then you would get even more complaining from the killers. Due to the game mechanics there is just no way to ultimately balance everything because the game relies so much on whether or not you are playing in a co ordinated group where everyone is commnicating together (or knows the game really well). For example I had quite a few matches with groups of 4 who were impossible to beat. I didn't want to camp the person I eventually hooked but it made no difference because each person took it in turns basically allowing themselves to be hooked whilst the others repaired generators. Finally the community just sucks even if you don't camp hooked survivors as the killer you'll still get tons of groups who will taunt you in the end game lobbies. I can't imagine how toxic the game would be if they incorporated some kind of 'voice team chat' feature. Some rare late game perks can solve a bit of in game taunting (camping the gate to teabag etc) but I don't feel like putting 40+ hours into a game just to get a perk that helps stop this kind of unsportsmanlike behaviour.Conclusion Dead by Daylight could be a great game but the mechanics are ultimately very black and white. Either the surviving side or the killing side has a huge advantage over the other. The game tries to balance this with different maps abilities a massive array of perks and addons but in reality all of these things are still built on an incredibly uneven framework. If you get a bad team as survivors you're dead. If you get a good team the killer has no chance. I've watched Twitch streams where groups of 4 win more than TEN TIMES in a row. Finally regardless of what side you play even if you do everything perfectly you can still lose. Plenty of times I was the only person repairing generators and in one game I actually did 4 out of 5 on my own just to end up being the ONLY one who was sacrificed because no one even tried to rescue me when I got hooked. It was fun to play for about 5 hours for free but that's all I needed to know to realise that under all the perks and skills the framework simply cannot be balanced (and the community sucks).,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,0,0,130,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is an amazing game. I'm appreciating the new balance changes especially since they've pointed out to me that I'm actually a terrible survivor (LOL). The changes however have definitely helped me improve my strategies and learn to play more carefully. In turn I've become a much better survivor. I still have a ways to go but it's nice to seem the improvements in my own gameplay. I don't know why everybody seems to be so against it. The game has always swung wildly in survivor favor. This game is difficult for killer mains considering how much they have to put up with when it comes to survivors. It's great to see that they're getting more opportunities to have the game played fairly. I wish people would realize that if they're being caught and constantly killed it's usually their fault and they need to improve their gameplay. Whiny troglodyte survivors git gud.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-01,0,0,798,False,Not Recommended,"This game started out fun and addictive. But almost a year this game has transformed into something really . All these updates they make new features instead of focusing on bugs (in The Halloween DLC they said all bugs have been fixed. As if!). They can't balance the sides (and at the moment they have made the killers much more op.) The ton of bugs in game is ridiculous as well! Not to mention the fact that the developers have gotten ignorant in the concerns of the players ever since they started making many DLCs.

2016-11-06,0,0,464,False,Not Recommended,"The game is definitely not playable as it is right now. The new killer ""The Shape aka Michael Myers"" is much to strong. He is picked in at least 7/10 games. Almost every killer choses him because you can easily get a lot of points with very low effort. He is definitely not balanced as he has the skills of other killers combined just better. The survivors need to be buffed or this killer to be nerfed. Also is he not included in the game when you buy it. You needed to buy a halloween edition to get him. So you pay to get the best killer at the moment. That might be fun for the killer players but definitely not for the survivors. I have seen it quite often now that people immediately disconnect when they are caught by Myers. I have never seen this when there was another killer around. Another big problem right now is the camping of killers. They always stay nearby when you are hanging so that your teammates have no chance to set you free. When people try it they also die. Teamplay is not encouraged right now.That was what is very annoying at the moment. The base game is really great and lots of fun. When some things get changed it might be playable again.

2016-08-20,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a game where there are four survivors trying to complete objectives as a Killer tracks them. The survivors cannot harm the killer the most they can do is shine a flashlight in the Killer's eyes to make them drop their captive. The Killer can hook survivors on hooks to sacrifice them to some Tree God because those damned kids ruined the park or something. Survivors have a chance to then free their friend from this Tree God's wrath in hopes they can all get out. Being the Killer is badass because nothing can stop you and winning is fun. Beign a survior is tense and scary as the Killer can track you and just murder you. I've yet to play with public players but a game with friends is always good fun.,Dead by Daylight

On the other hand a survivor who is MOCKING waiting behind an obstacle just to wait for the killer to run around is fine instead of chasing and using windows for example like they are meant to be used TO MAKE THE CHASE HARDER AND NOT JUMP IN AND OUT TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE AND TIME WASTING. The community of this game sucks worse than the one in League of Legends and mate that's a hard point!Srsly don't buy this game if you aren't fine with that.

It should be noted that this game is clever and thrilling enough to help set the trend of the 4v1 multiplayer style games we have been seeing with Dead by Daylight Evolve and Friday the 13th.A lot of these reviews are very harsh because of the bugs. I will be honest this game has bugs. I explain it to my friends as a game that is built tremendously well on a weakened skeleton. Whilst one plays the things that bother the most are the disconnects the loading screen times the glitchy character movements from time to time and so on. To me this game is very much a quality game. Boy I am not sure if I have ever been so thrilled while playing online with others. It really gets the blood pumping. Starting out knowing absolutely nothing eventually coming to an understanding of how to survive learning each killer's unique play style and abilities/calls (which are promised to petrify no matter who they are) and even MICHAEL MYERS?! That's just too cool. And yeah I would buy it if asked to.HOWEVER as you have read... be prepared for some frustration. In my opinion it is worth the pain and suffering it is going to cause at times. If I could suggest anything at all to the developers it is that I wish the connections felt a little more stable. I am not a programmer and do not understand what that entails but I do know what it feels like on the side of the player and it can more than definitely be annoying.Get this game. Enjoy hiding with your friends from inevitable death. Try to look past the flaws because all games have them. Thumbs up.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-20,0,0,208,False,Recommended,I have nothing to say but it's fun and scary. I hope you're adding more.So i made top 5 ideas should be in Deas by Daylight.1. Add more hiding places like hiding in the box.2.Add killer have a gun. Killer don't have to use melee weapon to kill survivors. Ok sounds overpowered but it's annoying survivors going some places the killer have bad time to catch them. So i recommend having the gun then survivor gets terrified.3. Add survivor/perk can punch to stun the killer.4. Add a perk killer can break the walls. Survivors will get jumpscared by the killer. Like fixing generator and hear the heartbeat and they don't know which way he's coming. And suddenly BOOM the The killer breaks the wall. Scary little bit.5. Survivors can pass through between broken wall. Yes I am talking about 4th one survivor have more access to escape form the killer.That's all recommend everyone play this game and developers GREAT JOB!!! ),Dead by Daylight

2018-07-14,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a Singleplayer horror experience with broken AI.You have 3 other AI in your team when you play survivor they mindlessly walk around minding their own thing when you expect the AI to be at least competent enough to repair generators.Well if that isn't enough the killer AI is broken aswell when it hooks a survivor it just stands there and waiting for other survivors to try and rescue the hooked one.If you somehow manage to take all the generators by yourself and gets downed when Exits are open don't expect help just struggle until death when you get hooked because the broken survivor AI just escapes without looking back. Practically being useless throughout the entire game only to leech of your hard work. The only way to win is not to play like the AI do.Also there is a few issues with the game in general as well 1. Too many hooks throughout the map 2. Killer feels 20% faster when 10% would've been more than enough since escape is near impossible. The AI will take your juking into calculation and is very hard to trick maybe because that seems to be the only area of the game and the AI that the developers are working on lol.When it comes to the graphics they are more or less a$$ you can clearly see the damage that the console peasants cause the PC Master Race it just saddens me that they even try to appeal to such a weak audience.Long story short maybe wait for a second installment and then check reviews on the game before you buy it see if it's actually good or just getting good reviews based on the classic horror fan in us all.Well if it's 50% off then I guess you can grab it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-18,3,1,20,False,Not Recommended,"I can't for the life of me protect this game there is so much wrong with it that what you're about to read is only just the beginning.1. The killer is so fast that it is almost impossible to escape him. (Especially the hill billy who can chainsaw sprint and 1 shot down you)2. In the off chance you find a pallet to knock over and stun the bloody c*nt within 5 seconds of you stunning him he's already back up and right behind you ready to shove his love toy up your a$$.3. When he does catch you you can wiggle to escape him BUT WAIT THERE""S MORE you can't even get the wiggle bar to the half way mark before the physchotic bast*rd holding you sticks you on a hook because the thing's are f*cking everywhere and you're almost always within a couple meters of one.4. In the very and I mean VERY slight chance the bast*rd doesn't camp the hook you are currently on most of the time they will put a bear trap right in front of the damn thing so in the yet another very slight chance you escape or a friend tries to help he'll know so because the bear trap will either get you or your friend.5. Even if your friend disarms the bear trap the killer is most likely not far and come and not only kill you BUT kill your your buddy as well.6. Plus another fun fact if you somehow have friends well guess what buttercup you can't even play with them unless you go into a private match that give you no XP plus if you only have 2 people to play the game with you're f*cked. (Unless you're one of the poor souls begging in the game group chat to join their game so they can play with theres friends with a full team)7. After you realise your team of survivors imminent doom you not only want to smash your skull on one of the many hooks on the map you also want to understand how this sh*t of a game came to existance.And now you know why this game is a complete and total piece of garbage you're welcome.(Update) They have added a new feature so you and your friends can now play with a full team BUT all other problems I stated do still exist plus many and I mean MANY more!

EDIT 17.06.2016 maps appear to not be actually procedurally generated and thereby are predefined and not randomized by mathematical algorithm contrary to what is claimed in advertising.I'm keeping this review concise being as that this game is that short. This developer is an established developer since 1992. Fans first. Don't trust Starbreeze. I didn't trust them after they ruined their perfect record of Two Brothers Payday 1 &amp Payday 2 where they didn't develop this game but Behaviour Digital Inc a Canadian developer in Quebec very well may have killed this game Dead by the Day after Release. Starbreeze could afford to hire a celebrity &amp famed videogame voice actor (Fallout series) to advertise their game but Starbreeze could not pay heed to their own sponsorship's actual development. Mismanagement for money. Don't trust Starbreeze. Be responsible. Report the game on the Store Page as ""broken"".

2018-05-27,0,0,840,False,Not Recommended,I wouldn't recommend this game as anything other than a game to play with four other friends. It suffers from numerous issues that make it extremely unfun and borderline unplayable at times because it pretty much relies on sportsmanship from the killerFirstly if you get captured the killer may very well stare at you until you die. Since you are playing with randoms chances are they won't save you and you die there. Or they save you and take your place and they suffer the same fate. They may also not take advantage of this since you cannot communicate with them and thus tell them to do something else and they may very well just straight up watch you die with no benefit. Even if three other players take full advantage of this 'strategy' the one player left to eat is... Well left to eat This completely kills the game for whoever gets capturedSecondly relying on strangers you cannot talk to. You cannot write while ingame nor is there a mic option allowing you to talk to players while nearby so you are essentially playing a mute. This means that you have to rely more or less entirely on moving around like a moron while trying to suggest that you want to get healedThird. Imagine you start a game which is intended to be four players. Now two of them disconnects. There's pretty much 0 chance of victory in any other way than using the hatch which is limited to one player anywaysFourth. The hatch is a complete pain to find because there's no indication of where it is meaning you have to blindly roam or simply KNOW where it is which messes with newer players and does nothing for veterans of the seriesFifth. There doesn't always seem to be an indicator of which killer you're against. Sometimes you'll get tips on the loading screen to give it away and then other times nothingSixth. The mechanics such as being trapped by the pig are pretty much not explained so unless you research every single killer through and through you're bonedSeventh. Some maps feel heavily favourable for the killer because there's little terrain to hide behind and no way to outmaneuver them. This feels sluggish. The open large maps with fog are the best ones because it gives more room for movement without completely gutting either sides. The Saw based map? If you get seen you're basically dead. There's too many dead ends with walls and corners to get stuck in and VERY few longer segments to break free from the chase. While outrunning the chaser is nigh impossible in general at least the more open maps give an opportunity where as indoor segments are a death trapAs a result it can be very fun if you have four other players who are friends whom you can talk to and have fun with while laughing at the mistakes and death but all of the issues mentioned above will put a rather abrupt halt to it and they are rather prominent when playing with randoms,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I played a bit during the free weekend and while it has potential I managed to identify a pair of glaring (and in my opinion deal breaking) issues with the game.First is the ludicrous difficulty in joining a friend's game. I didn't even play for two hours and I can't count the number of times a menu glitch screwed my attempts to matchmake with my friend. Many restarts were had trying to fix this issue.Second the nurse is BROKEN. So OP that any half competent killer can and will eliminate all the survivors. Her ability blink allows her not only to move faster than any given survivor but also to bypass any obstacles (INCLUDING WALLS) in her path. The survivor's main methods of slowing down the killer pulling down barricades hopping through windows and navigating terrain are all rendered useless since she can phase through them as though they weren't there at all. If the killer is the nurse and she catches your trail the most you can hope to do is delay the inevitable.Don't spend your money on this it's more frustration than fun.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-18,1,1,70,False,Not Recommended,Here's a transcript of my Reddit post as the mods there have removed it I have some urgent pre season consumer advice if you're of the general assumption that minding your own business and relying on common sense is a reliable way of staying out of trouble It doesn't seem to apply in this game.For example while at first I thought my permanent ban would be promptly reversed as a random mistake Behaviour's customer support have failed to act on any of my requests to provide information over the past six weeks and at this point I'm convinced they simply don't know what's happening possibly opting for the silent treatment in the hope I'll either evaporate or buy another copy as mentioned in the topic.Only one of my emails was answered in which they state they are looking into my case but my patience and four (plus one tweet) subsequent emails (both to DBD and to Behaviour's chief email addresses) have all been conspicuously ignored. Another player claimed to have a similar issue and contacted support after I did and received a response before I have. This leads me to believe Behaviour's game is too unruly to provide the kind of consistent experience many consumers are hoping for and with this in mind I urge potential buyers that there is a chance you will be removed from the game without warning or explanation by people who are presumably careless overworked or both.While this policy is in effect I cordially invite Behaviour to prove they are not attempting to extort victims who are banned for coincidental assumptions which can't actually be evidenced in the hope people simply buy their way back into the game rather than protest as I am. The easiest way Behaviour can do this is by investigating who is responsible for issuing these bans and recognizing they may need additional training in pairing evidence with supposition.I've also created a Steam feedback topic which discusses the effects of banning people and in it I highlight the importance of staff to strictly follow conclusive evidence to protect the integrity of their product though it mostly deals with the information surrounding my case particularly. Go here if you're interested in doing Behaviour's job for them https //steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/5/3183345176711493001/Lastly at some point in the near future I will look into opening the necessary channels to Steam to voice my protest to someone in sales as I fear they would be interested in protecting the safety and integrity of their customers and Behaviour's actions may be indirectly damaging their brand. If Behaviour are responsible for my situation but are unable to explain it that is an interesting situation.This is probably my final attempt to gain some kind of closure on this matter and I urge the company to recognize there is a chance my case may be more common than is realized but that those particular victims lack the skills to voice their protest effectively. The consequences of this as I mentioned hurt sales indirectly as dissatisfied customers detract from the product's potential as I am doing here. Like my candid Steam review I would be available to remove or modify these unflattering commentaries if Behaviour are willing to convince me they are serious about treating their customers fairly.As a general supporter of underdog indie companies I wish Behaviour all the best in their future endeavors and again hope issues like mine are unusual. May I also add on a personal note that as a part time game admin our staff have a very strict banning procedure and it's embarrassing how at least one individual is allowed to inflict this degree of ineptitude on others and although I worry how much harm this is causing I am secretly grateful to their dedication in providing a flattering contrast to their more professional counterparts in other games.Apologies for the unflattering tone and thanks for your time.Edit 1 Depressing replies as expected but this is a cautionary tale not an appeal. I at least hope the person who banned me knows who they are and aside from this incident I hope their colleagues are proud of their work.Edit 2 Correspondence for the curious https //imgur.com/a/cMYNZEdit 3 I should probably invite anyone who knows something similar to have happened to share their experience. For those who aren't lottery banned enjoy the game. I've tried to warn as many people as I care to.In my profile you can negatively track when Behaviour bother to give me an explanation.Do not buy this game folks. I implore Steam to investigate.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-12,0,0,2115,False,Recommended,"This game is a game that keeps you on your toes The developers have really had fun putting this game together and its extremely fun when there are good rounds a good round defines as... The killer being actually skilled and has a good playing style Having a good team of survivors that know how to rescue you off hooks Having people who aren't abusing the chat at the end because they lost People who abuse the report system for players/killers for pointless things Having a game that is bug free Having the perfect layout for perks items+add ons and offeringsAs a killerWhen you play killer you have a choice of 5 killers don't matter which one you play there is always going to be that one person that has something smart to say at the end. It being about how traps or perks are going to get nerfed or something that goes against your play style. Besides the definition of a good killer is one that doesn't camp hooked and gains bleeding points for the survivor being rescued and then healed (if healed). Yet as a Killer you need a stradegy a way to get enough points to get your pip that contributes to your rank as a killer 1 being the best. Or to kill everyone and double pip earning you two pips to your next rank. Besides that the killers job is to go from gen to gen and patrol the area to ensure there are no survivors working on them. If a generator has progress simply look around for a hiding survivor in closets or crouched. Look around corners and dark/shaded areas as the survivor wll tend to blend in. Kill all the survivors before these gens are powered and you win. As a survivorWhen you play survivor this is where it gets interesting the job as a survivor is completely simple and straight forward Survive. The entire game is leaned towards the survivor role. The killer is not that powerful as they used to be. Thats because a lot of people complain about things they clearly need improvment in and the community is needy for the survivors to be better. Yet again these people mostly play survivor so they don't understand it when it comes to the killers perspective. So the killer is often overlooked in this game as people dwell on how killers need to be nerfed when they're objective is to kill you. Besides the object of the game is to have a stradegy to repair all five gens and escape the killer. You have to lure the killer to palets that can stun him/her if they're close enough to the palet. Giving you a chance to escape the killer chase. Then to be healed if you have been hit looking for another survivor. On the other hand if you are the last one left and there are only 3 gens left to repair don't. There is a trap door which you can escape from but its a matter of finding it. Once you know how the game works then you will find it very easy and very fun. Is this game worth it?Yes this game has a lot of potential I am personally a programmer and know how the smallest this can be simply overlooked these developers reach out to there community. Yet they only seem to care more about the streamers more but thats because they rely on them to promote the game. This game is very fun once you become skilled and know how a survivor plays or know what they're gonna do its simple yet complex to the idea of the stradegy. The survivors are easyier considering how they have the upper hand in the game. The reason why I reccomend this game is because its a fun game to kick back grab a cold one and be best of the best for your team or for yourself as a survivor. As a killer its fun to go up real players and not AI's.""See you in the fog"" DBD Survivor Difficulty Easy Hard (Auto Hook repair &amp Bloodlust)Killer Difficulty Easy Master",Dead by Daylight

Mouse controls were very weird and I could not determine how to fix motion. mousing up moves view down not intuitive. Running around in a graveyard chased by crows? running running hearing other people screaming and Piano discordant sounds. I guess other players were being killed? Is there a tutorial?I got to use WSAD to move simple enough and space bar.. which allows me to vault over walls. No map. No idea of what I am supposed to do although I guess I need to find a generator. No idea what it looks like or how to use it.Eventually I hear the humming killer / whoever the killer is getting near running and dodging. Okay so they miss my character with some axe throws.

2016-09-10,1,1,29,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a pretty rad game. You can choose to be a survivor and try to make your way out of some hellishly fun maps or play the killer and try to KILL PEOPLE! As a killer you kill people and put them on hooks and send 'em up to the sex god named the entity. I personally play the killer because killing is fun and sending them to the sex god is always appealing! As a survivor you must try to survive and escape the map whilst the killer is killing people and sending them to the sex god. You could also try saving each other but from my experience it's not a very good thing to do because the people you save ditch you! (usually)Pretty sexy game would send people up to the sex god again.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-11,0,0,79,False,Recommended,Product received for free. The Game is Fun and makes me pretty spooked to even play survivor playing the killer is fun It doesnt feel like no matter what you do you can't catch survivors and it also doesnt feel over powered both are pretty balanced.NOW the Cons of the game? Christ not only does it take forever to find a game or a game with people actually hitting the ready button (specially the killer how do you not hit ready.) BUT BUT when you do find a game you have a chance of getting the bug of Forever loading. This game is very buggy sometimes when searching for a game too fast or too much itll bug out with the loading screen to get in game causing you to have to stop the processEdit 07/FEB/2019So I realize in my last review I didn't know that you connect directly to the killer.Anyways this game is fun the games take a bit to find and the servers are still... peer to peerWhich i cant really agree with since most times you go against people in different countries... causing the ping to rocket to 500 1000. Once the servers come later in the year this game will be amazing. It's fun to play and honestly if you got a couple friends who get scared easily put them in this game and hear them scream i can assure you you're going to have a great time. also perks OH MY LORD are gross sometimes lmao.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-10,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Played about 15 mintues of this game with friends. Sad that my friend bought it for me as it was a waste of cash really. Found it mundane and pointless as a survivor have fun as when you start it's error after error after error since generators explode constantly only giving you a 0.5 second que to press space and by that time it's already gone boom as there were no sound que's like people have been telling me about. Since it's so unbalanced i find it pretty pointless. Mainly because you have to find servers with equally matched opponents and can't jump in with friends and play otherwise you'll get absolutely trounced as the killer will have the advantage as you have to play in order to level up / stand a chance against killers. Which to me just seems annoying. First play the killer spawned quite literally next to me and downed me in 2 seconds second play I kept on failing skillchecks as they weren't well described and I can't be bothered waiting to jump into a game time after time after time to practice it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-12,0,0,1097,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight A game i loveGreetings Killer and Survivor and (maybe) devs i want to write a little review about the game. I only see totally negative posts and thats annoys me. But now i'm coming with a review that is (mostly) positive!First of all i will write things i like about the game and after that i write things what they could improve and maybe ideas for the game.The positive aspect of the game First The idea of the game. Really i like the idea playing survivor and killers. First of all it is a new idea. I dont know a game what is similar. And thats awesome. Second The different aspects of the killers (they are unique) and the aspect of the survivors. I like it that each killer is totally different and the survivors are almost ""the same"". With ""the same"" i mean every survivor you play you really feel like you are ""just"" a survivor. And thats awesome. Third The feeling when playing the game. I totally like the graphics even if they are not over 9000 HD. It fits TOTALLY to the style of the game. The atmosphere is totaly awesome. I want to see the game when it gets 4k Textures but it can still stay on this graphic style. Its just fits the atmosphere.Fourthly That DLC style. I like the way how the game handle DLC's. If you want to play the new survivor you have to pay for it. If you want to play the killer 100% of the time you can pay. BUT! you dont have to pay for the killer you can play him for free if you get the shard on another killer. Thats totally awesome (maybe the price is a bit off but its alright). Fifth That the game is still in works and the weekly stream. I really like how the devs (yes you there who (maybe) reading this and programming the game) stay in contact with the community. And yes at the holidays there was a bug that killers got other abilitys from other killers but the devs had holidays and there are only humans too. It wasnt a bug that crashed all games or deleted all players. And the users who use it at ranked games will get punished ( do they?) So its fine. Sixth The time that the game needs to update. Yeah fast updates are great but i like it when you have time to learn the new things before there are new content released. Sometimes its to much in short time. Now i'm going to say some things that i dont like about the game. First The holy damn community. Yes. It's annoying to read every second or even 1.5 comment that this game is and stuff like that. Yeah bugs happen in every game. Stop complaining and post them on the Bug Report forum. Thanks. And maybe give good information instead of ""How ing stupid motha... is this game"". Thats just totally annoying (most of the time even funny). Second Some bugs. But yeah. They are in every game. Third The potential not used. This game has so much capabilities that arent used. I hope it will be updated with all of his capabilities. Like the survivor can stun the killer with hand and such things. Fourth The community. Oh did i say that before? Thats the most im annoyied about. Fifth Not much maps. And not much free customasation(Sorry dont know how to write this word) or customisation at all. They are few but i want more. ( 3)That was all about the things i wanted to say. And yes i dont have much points for the bad things. I really like this game so much it makes so much fun. I dont know what is all planned for the game so maybe even some points can be deleted.GreetingsStrichcode 92akabarcode 92",Dead by Daylight

2016-10-08,0,0,697,False,Not Recommended,"If your looking for something short term it's fine if you're looking for something that's stable and going to last long term run away now.Here's the good points.Suprisingly good gameplay.Can have a lot of fun if you meet one of the very rare teams that will co operate.Gets the creepy hopeless atmosphere just right which is something a horror game should do.Large number of Survivors and Killers each with their own playstyles and unique perks. This mixes up gameplay and provides a lot of replayability.Ingame items add a wide array of different ways to play the game. From healing team mates faster to fixing generators easier to sabotaging hooks with lightning speed.And here's the bad.Developers have so far made over 15 000 000 (excluding sales of DLC and Delux editions of the game) and what they've used it on may shock you.NO dedicated servers. The games relies on Steams region Peer to Peer. This can be exploited in a lot of ways. You can be DDOS'd by the Host (Killer) Hosts can change their download region to somewhere thousands of miles away so that the Survivors lag making them easy prey and this can also cause Survivors to disconnect due to packet loss issues with the regions resulting in losing any offerings you tried to use.Developers say they have no intention of adding servers. Apparently buying the rights to use the serial killer from the 1978 film ""Halloween"" by John Carpenter was a better use of allocated funds than fixing the games issues or lack of servers.Downloadable content exists that's just reskins (The 80's pack). Not only are they just reskins but they're reskins SO bright that they single you out to the Killer like a sore thumb.The team responsible for patches and pushing updates doesn't know what they're doing. There's a serious bot issue in the game and to fix it they removed Steam Streaming and utterly ruined game performance. And the bots still exist. So they achived nothing.Game has issues running on high end gaming rigs. Some users with GTX 1080's 1070's 980's and 970's aswell as AMD GPU's aren't able to run the game how they should be. My own personal rig can run The Witcher 3 on Ultra just fine but has frame rate issues on this title on Low Settings. Something nobody has issues with until the above mentioned ""fix"".Developers have favouritism. Twitch Streamers and YouTube ""Lets play""ers get given exclusive rewards. Not only that but they also complain about things they personally do not like and the developers change them. So the top 20 or 30 of these people decide how the game will go for the thousands of other customers.Behaviour Digital Inc have 375 employees and they've been developing games since 1992. 24 years. They are not a small or new company by any stretch but fanboys on the forums will still claim they're ""Indie developers"" and they should be let off for any mistake they do.The ingame chat (which now has a toggle for on and off) is often used to be toxic and abusive to other players. Light hearted fun like leading Killers on wild goose chases as a diversion to save your friends and teabagging will likely soon be outlawed due to whining. The games anti cheat EAC is about as useless as Battle Eye. Legitimate cheaters go unpunished but people using wiggle macros or mice with DPI switches get given bans according to some talk on the forums. Each EAC ban is permenant. Even if you're found to be innocent as written on their website.EDIT 20/11/2016 Today EAC has stopped 99% of survivors from playing due to an Error code 1. Developers are locking threads about the issue and atleast one person I've seen banned for suggesting the developers get in contact with EAC to try and fix it.23/11/2016 Today a bug appeared. Twitch exclusive items became available to normal players. OH NO. The devs are already working on a fix. Meanwhile 10 000+ bug reports many the same due to repeated game breaking issues (Your truly has issued 7) and lots from release still haven't been fixed.07/12/2016 Today the forums got innundated with tons of people who have lost ALL their game progress due to a bug which has been present since atleast August. Restoring your save data manually will trigger the EAC and perma ban the user from DBDL. No word yet from the devs other than they are ""trying to fix it"". Which they have been doing since August. 08/12/2016 Today the developers released ""The Hag"" DLC which doesn't even work for anyone upon purchase. Currently 3 locked threads about the issue in the forums. And it's only been 10 minutes since it's launch.10/12/2016 Developers and moderators are now editing users replies on the forums either to take them out of context or make them look stupid. In addition they're also purging threads that contain criticism of how game funds are spent and criticism about overall game mechanics. Basically censorship of anything that goes against the statue quo.09/06/2017 Developers mock fans and admit they're making things to deliberatly break their own game.

2017-04-20,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,I pre ordered this because the trailer looked awesome and it was on sale. I love being scared and thought this would be the survival game to end all survival games. I was super excited when it was finally released but that excitement lasted about 5 minutes...Not only did I not receive the full advertised discount (to which I had no recourse) I was never told the killer would have crazy magical powers. The killer can become invisible locate everybody (visible or not) and is super fast. So what is the point of hiding from him running out in the open or running away from him? And I could never start one of the generators as there is no time to react. There is no tutorial/practice mode or even a pause before you try starting it to tell you what to do. All that being said why do anything? The best bet is to not play.If the gameplay wasn't bad enough many reviews point out how toxic the community is and that is a game breaker for me. Do not underestimate how much this can ruin your experience even if you somehow master the fundamentals of the game.This isn't the only developer to falsely advertise the game and its price. But Steam will not do anything about it. Having submitted a game to Greenlight myself I know how little enforcement there is on the advertising front. Many developers will try to get away with as much as they can to make a buck. But good luck getting anyone to invest in their future titles.Steam yet again manages to steal money from me. But maybe it's my fault for pre ordering. In the future I will wait for a title to release before buying even if it will cost more or lack certain DLC. I feel Steam should allow refunds two weeks from the release date (if there's no early access) not the purchase date. But that is an entirely different conversation to be had.The scariest part of this game was being ripped off.P.S. I've noticed quite a few of you like to downvote my reviews and they are usually honest long and detailed. Please note disagreement with the recommendation is not a valid reason to downvote.

To me when you have to uninstall it cause you get tired of the bullies and ignorance it becomes too much. The developers of this game has changed over the 2 years that it has been released. What I mean by that is the fact that they cater to killers so much! You can not even have a good game most of the time because people always sandbag you or team with the killer. They try to defend the killer for camping and tunneling but yet have no skill of their own. If you do buy this game make sure you have some good xanax ) Happy hunting?,Dead by Daylight

A blast to play with friends and still pretty fun to play with strangers Genuinely terrifying to play especially when you first starting. The game has a nice design to it.

2016-12-11,0,0,17,False,Recommended,Hey Everyone Quick and honest review of Dead by Daylight. There's no single player so make sure you're not investing for a campaign cause there isn't one. HOWEVER the multiplayer is really good!. A Major downfall is that basically any game you decide to jump into wether you're the killer or not you can be playing against people who're much higher level then you. Which in this case is a downfall cause the higher you level the more perks you unlocked. Overall this game may get dry at some times but they're constantly releasing DLC. I hate horror movies and games but this is one of those games i couldn't pass cause its really worth it!,Dead by Daylight

Lets not forget how impossible it is to win against any of the killers you have to pay for. Can't see freddy at all and by the time you're put in the dream world theres nothing you can do. Mike myers you can't counter. by the time you notice him you're already dead same thing with the pig. The cannibal one shotting you no matter what.

2018-01-22,1,3,1435,False,Not Recommended,Hours 1300 Result uninstall the game.Why? Because it has to many flaws bugs and annoying aspects of the game sinds a few months ago the devs destroyed their own game. They said they would prob put dedicated servers online. afther making A whole lot of money they still dind put dedicated servers. thats how mutch they love their community. to many bugs and laggs that make the game unfun. not to mention that some of the latest perks are game breaking.sinds the game was based on hide and seek with bbq chilli. its not hiding anymore its just a matter of min until you get caught not found but caught because the killer is always able to find you anywhere on the map with that perk xD.not only it stays with that if you go on YOUR OWN REGION. ASIAN players just host killer lobbies. with pings that go from 400 min to 800 or even higher making pallets drops impossible. hitting the player across the pallet while the pallet is already dropped.Next to THAT most of the killers and survivors are very Salty in the 2 years i played the game i only met a few ppl maybe 10 that were nice. well that tells you how nice the community is most ppl take this game to Sweaty. i loved the game back in the day when it was pretty good balanced but if the devs dont care about the connection. or ppl hosting on diff regions. well afther a while you get to frustrated. and just wanne stop playing the game. I had a good time when i played the game but sinds alot of killers keep leaving the lobby and you have every day that you have to wait for 20 min to start a game. 3 times a day. im thinking to myself why did i bought this game.Bugs are taking forever when they fix it and to be honest the devs especially the main Dev is not that bright. just see for yourself and you will find soon enough what i mean by that xD.im very dissapointed and i would want to get my refund to be hones i wanted already a time ago. good luck on the game but take from me you will be dissapointed. at some point so why bother to buy a game when in the end you feel bad about buying it back in the day.and last the perk is not only the prob but also few killers for example the doctor. how can you hide while he is able to take a addon were he is able to hit survivors from epic far away when you instant give away your position when you scream. not to mention his range on his lunge enough to make a player frustrating. that was not before that killer came out. these devs are aiming to destroy their game. Huntress killer has a beautiful hatch trow projectile. and when you pull a pallet down and your just out of that animation. and you run away the hitbox still is gonna say that its a hit. and that hitbox they dind fix it for over a year already if im correct that already tells you how dedicated they are at fixing their game.Or the map layout were you want to run away from the killer basement and aim for the window but there is a locker next to the window and the game thinks you wanna go into the locker and keeps you sucking into the locker while you want to go trough the window just having a war with that and get knocked down by the killer to be brought back to the basement. great what a fun ride.only thing that might be fun to do is when you play with 3 man survivors. or 4 group. thats now the only thing thats has a kinda fun mechanic to it. but at the other hand not for the killer what results into a ragequit of the killer.so once again. if you want to spare yourself from the crap that this game has to offer you plz dont buy it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-20,0,0,1605,False,Not Recommended,"Ive been playing this game since day one June 14 2016. The developers have made a great game cant argue with that but they have NO IDEA how to maintain their game.They primaily listen to players with less than 100 hours and have no idea how to play the game. All the killers who say to the devs ""im not good and dont want to get better so just make me srtonger"" Their ""skill"" is augmented rather than authenticBut now killers with 1K+ hours who know how to play are unstoppable with this update. Case in pointMy first 10 games after the update out of 40 survivors only 2 survived.Next 10 games i used 1 perk (Whispers) on various killers and some with splinters which means perkless. Out of 40 survivors 9 survived and note only 1 survived PER GAME (Which means hatch escape)As a killer perks or no perks i have yet to see survivors power the gates yet.Im not even a killer main but i know how to play killer. So killer mains who have invested their 1K+ hours on killer will have a much easier time getting 4Ks than i didThis is a pathetic catering to new players which is immedietly backfiring due to long looby waits as survivors are few and far between.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Ive been playing this game since day 1. Back when it was trapper and wraith... thats it and this is my opinionkillers have never gotten any significant nerfs they got less pallets bloodlust less efficient pallets blocked windows NOED too many exposed and aura perks/abilities kicking gens nerfing BNP Introduction of franklins LAG SWITCHING and bunch of other buffs i cant all listIt is so hard for killers to not get 4ks without survivors using syringes or keysThe devs try so hard to make this game ""balanced"" but you cant and they wont. This kind of game cant be balanced. And the only people who seem to have a voice in how the game changes are noob killers with less than 100 hours who say ""im not good at this and i dont want to get better DEVS MAKE KILLERS BETTER!"" and when the devs do make them better after months of whining they dont even play the game anymore1600 hour veterans like myself are ignored cause theres so few of us. people who know how he game was and great ways to imporve it.all i can say is git gud you ing noobs and stop trying to ruin this game",Dead by Daylight

2018-05-29,0,0,1584,False,Not Recommended,The devs need to work on the balance of this game competent survivors basically ruin anyone who wants to enjoy the killer role.Bigg issues Flashlights A huge offender it is mitigated by some perks but honestly I'd like to see a punishment for multiple people running flashlights. This way flashlights wouldd still have some power but people would think twice about making flashlights a mandatory include to their kits. Decisiive strike The devs are rebalancing this as we speak but I don't think its going to be strong enough without nerfing sprint boost or dead hard. Sprint Boost/Dead hard Honestly the biggest offender looping is far too easy to do and far too effective thanks to these perks. Bloodlust was introduced to deal with it but without buffing bloodlust further or nerfing these movement perks...bloodlust just isnt where it needs to be in order to deal with this. Self care/Borrowed time More huge offenders I understand the need to stop face camping but honestly there are better ways to make killers want to leave their hooks. Using perks to band aid problems is a really bad way of balancing this game.,Dead by Daylight

This is just a made up killer but i hope this killer will someday exist in dead by daylight.The killer can shoot arrows. it finds his/her arrows around the map and if it hits you you will get hurt as a ordinary punch from a killer. the killer can use one arrow 3 times before it breakes. if the arrow misses the killer can pick it up and use it agian. when it hits you you can remove it wich would take 5 seconds if you dident remove it in 25 sec the killer could see you in 3 seconds.

2016-06-15,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,FRIDAY THE 13TH ON A BUDGET! I bought this more or less because I am looking forward to the friday the 13th game and this was supposed to be filler in the interim. The thing is I hope I didn't just jinx it because this game is just really not fun. It's extremely repetitive. I mean there is absolutely no variety. The levels though different feel identical there is an extremely small variety of characters so everyone more or less looks the same the gameplay boils down to going through the exact same boring motions every round. Basically after playing 4 rounds I literally felt like i had experienced everything this game had to offer. And the graphics would look dated in 2005. Ultimately that wouldn't be an issue if the gameplay was fun but it just isn't. Basic and boring. avoid unless you absolutely need your Friday the 13th fix NOW!,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. So I'm going to say it straight about this game it's not fun. The only fun I had was laughing at the game with my friends at how bad the game was. Since steam has stated you can no longer promise your buyers later features for games. Also since the base form of combat for the survivors in this game is just running away and not fighting back at all. I don't expect this game in the future to include it. The essence of a horror film that involve survivors surviving always involve the survivors fighting back in some form. If the killer is human shoot them if their ghosts exorcise them. Escape should be a third objective or the last resort it should not be the main and only means to win.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-18,0,0,622,False,Recommended,This game is very fun even playing alone or with friends. Its still an early version of the game and yes it does have bugs still but they are ALWAYS putting out updates and new content. Its not as scary as I would like it to be since its 3rd person and 1st person only on the killer. Its a challeging game and i love the 4v1 idea. There are other games out there with similar ideas but so far this one is the best.If you want to buy it then go to LINK REMOVED and find the game there for a lower price. I do hope they add new things like voice chat if you are a survivor you have to be close enough to another survivor because there is no communication in the game other than spamming crouch or using point and come over here animations. Some killers are using hacks camping and laggy servers.Laggy servers can be easy to get away from by testing the chat in the lobby before the game starts.Killers these days camp ALLOT. Its everywhere and very annoying. To fix this use the report player or mic icon when you die on the side of their name. Or record footage upload it and send links to bhvr_crows profile.Same idea with hacks if you think people are hacking report them.The graphics are decent for a horror game in a forest. It can be repetitive because you do the same things but its challenging to get awayand always seems fun to me.They were going to implement a feature where going on the hook 1st time is infinite so they can cam you but you wont ever die unless you try to get off.Then the 2nd time you could die. This makes the killer think its pointless to camp because the player wont die anyways.I do think this would be good since it makes no sense to be on the hook 3 times before dying.So basically i really like this game alone or with friends. But there is some things they need and WILL fix in the future.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-17,0,0,1388,False,Recommended,"Due to the new soft ban system I have to rewrite my review.There are still toxic players out there but since they one by one learn that hate speech in the chat is not wanted and punished the chat stays quiet more and more often.I even got some ""gg"" out of a sudden now.So I now can recommend this game again.The gameplay was great from the beginning on and the developers put much effort in balancing the game. It is really thrilling to see if you can catch the survivors or if you can escape the killer.Also the new killers Michael Myers Leatherface and Freddy Krueger are big fun to play. I totally recommend both add ons. Leatherface's chainsaw is just awesome to play together with the chilling original voice of leather face. Michael Myers stalking function and movie soundtrack also make this character great fun to play just like in the movies. Freddy is pretty different in play style but also a bit weak. He is good for beginngers but don't expect to catch all four survivors with him since he is a bit to weak to accomplish that.So since the harassement now finally seems to go back a bit I can recommend this game again.(Don't hesitate to report hateful speech if it is ruining your game experience! ) )",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,I have never in my life written a review before but I absolutely have to for this garbage of a game. This game is hands down the most unbalanced piece of creation the gaming community has ever experienced. The developers should be ashamed for what they have created. The hook system is amazingly stupid because all the killer has to do is camp next to a person that is hooked and theyll for sure die. Dont even get me started with the wraith.... a killer who can teleport and go invisible? BISH WUT?!!!! Friday the 13th game wil show eveyone how it should have been released.

2018-10-16,8,1,1068,False,Not Recommended,Imagine healing taking longer than doing the generators.So the main aim of the game is to do 5 generators. open an exit gate and escape. With the extra 4 seconds of healing this makes self care an extra 8 seconds. Sloppy butcher is now a meta perk which further decreases normal healing speed to 20 seconds and self care healing to 40 seconds. You can almost do a generator in that time solo providing you hit the great skill checks or duoing a generator will guarantee its completed in the 40 seconds.That being said the devs are heading in the right direction with how strong survivors can be with items/add ons/perks and are trying to address the problem with camping but the decision to try and prolong the games for killers with heal speed nerfs is not the answer as even the best survivors will eventually get caught and becomes less a game of skill to eventually dying anyway.Survivors have ds and killers have noed rework them both make the game more fun.

Time to channel my inner game journalist and see how bad it really is.Start game as a survivor take 2 minutes to load I hope it's worth it. It isn't. Spawn find a girl. She runs of in the other direction. i decide to walk forward and suddenly a knife is thrown in my back. I try to run but he throws to more in the same volley and I fall. He picks me up and I spam M1 trying to struggle (Didn't know I had to hold). I spam A and D to wriggle away but I'm on a hook. Spamming M1 until I try holding it almost works. By the time I figure outand try it's too late. The wierd spider demon comes up just as I had heard. Spam space not a difference. I am therefore dead without a single minute.3/10 Completely unbalenced towards new players when killers level up they're unstoppable. Teamwork is not incentivized rescuing people from the hook is high risk minimal reward. Two survivors together is just begging to both be killed. Nerf killer classes or buff survivors a smidge and try to fix lag.I think the worst part was my second server getting farmed. Get chased knocked over guy heals me get chased again... Maybe he's trying to raise my boldness but why bother? Not buying this peice of trash after free weekend. The entering closet animation is so choppy the door closes on its own and my arm is phasing through VERY visible to the killer. Helping other people is like saving a canary from a mineshaft. It's the right thing to do but it'll take time and generally won't do much. People may like you for it unless they want to know if the mine is filled with toxic gas or they just hate birds and need to be hung. People on the hook always want you to rescue them but they can never know the danger of going into thier ambushes. Sometimes it's best to die just to be polite to the killer and so your burden on others gone.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-29,0,0,533,False,Recommended,A near perfect mp game of cat and mouse chases and tense stakeouts dressed up in classic horror tropes. Even after hundreds of hours each round feels like a new test thanks to the variety in maps killers skill builds and equipment loadouts that allow a very personal expression of your playstyle with both Survivor and Killer modes this is 2 games in 1 package. Devilishly skillful at the highest level capable of flipping you between absolute elation and abject despair in the twirl of an axe nothing is as satisfying as a last gasp escape or a selflessly coordinated hook rescue. It's striking just how unique and honestly bizarre the mechanics are best explained by Keith Stuart https //www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018 01 27 everything i learned about game design last year i learned from dead by daylightWell maintained and frequently updated competitive multiplayer despite balance and ranking issues (particularly on the Survivor side currently being addressed) with weekly dev streams chatting through it all.

2018-09-04,0,0,465,False,Recommended,So I love this game. I dumped almost 400 hours into this game. I had a big break in the meantime but I recently picked it up again and it has only gotten better.But let me tell you one thing first This game has a STEEP learning curve. Really steep. Some killers can be downright useless if you don't know how to use them like the hag or the nurse but once you know what to do with them it becomes so much more fun. Same with survivors. You'll get your torn apart by decent killers. But once you pick up on how to play the game it will become so much more fun. This is not a game you play one hour per week and have loads of fun. This is a game where you dump lots of hours into and once you become somewhat good you'll get addicted.Now yes this game has problems. It's map design on some maps is downright frustrating for either the killer or the survivors. However the newer maps turned out quite nice and are actually fun. But the devs are constantly (but slowly) work on the game buffing nerfing reworking and rebalancing the game also they are adding new content in the form of DLCs which are actually fairly priced if you ask me. 7 per DLC is totally fine if you play the game a lot given that the game itself isn't that expensive.Overall if you enjoy the asymmetrical horror or have a few friends to play with this game is great. You can dump countless hours into this game way more than I did. Also this game offers a lot to unlock so you're constantly progressing your characters. I can only give this game a thumbs up because I only see a few flaws. The mentioned maps are a problem certain perks are outright useless while others are completely busted but as i said the devs are constantly working on it.,Dead by Daylight
2018-09-04,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun in short bursts. They devs (seemingly) try to balance the game but has not yet happened. The community is SOOOOOOO TOXIC. The devs clearly could care less about the toxicity. If you decide to play a killer you are either trash or trash. Whether you win or lose. After game chat is always the worst. Then you have the survivors who just teabag at the exit gates or anywhere in general as a taunt. I play both killer and survivor but more survivor and I can without a doubt tell you most of the people you play with will be toxic. Such a fun game too bad the devs refuse to take steps to remove the toxicity.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,131,False,Recommended,"Great Adrenalin pumping game (RECOMENDED"" First off lets say this game really gets your heart pumping! Loads of fun and you really feel like you accomplish something! The only ""negative"" to this game is that you cannot que up with your friends in RANKED. This being said you can still play in private match which offers no EXP or progression. Now i can understand it would be WAY too easy if you were playing ranked with friends and had skype to say where the killer was at the time. Immersion Now with that negative about no que with friends in ranked and no text or voice in game. This just really adds to the immersion in my opinion. You dont see any players name no voice. All you see is your fellow random player who may risk it all to save you over his/her life. The music is terrifying in this game thus adding to the world. Knowing you are slower then the killer adds a whole new thinking to hiding over running. You must outsmart your killer. Sacrifices will be made for you...or by you. The Killer Not as easy as you may think with some of the kilers. It is really fun to be honest. Learn the mistakes of your prey capture and sacrifice them while stopping them from starting generators/ escaping. You have a much less FOV as you are in first person giving the survivors a better chance at hiding from you. Final Thoughts Pros Great Immersion Great soundtrack Horrifying Screams Beautiful enviorment FUN! Get this game Cons No ranked with friends ( but with good reason as listed above) No way to progress in private match ( with friends) Some may say no VOIP or text chat in game is bad But i dont think so it really gets you in the game9.7/10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!

2016-06-15,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,* NO GROUP MATCHMAKING*I have to sadly say that I have basically the same negative review to give as everyone else.On paper this game is great fun try and avoid the killer fixing generators or rescuing dumb teammates.OR you freak out survivors and hang them up as a trap for equally dumb / dumb friendly teammates.Sure it's pretty repetitive and the levels somehow are pretty much the same but it is fun.For a bit.Random matchmaking leaves you with people who hide the entire map or fail every check or have that amazing lone wolf mentality all the first people to die in horror movies have.I bought this game with a few friends after 2 hilarious warm up private matches we were ready to show the world our skills.But nope I dunno whether this is the devs idea to keep people from farming survivor/killer ranks or whatever but it's a pain in the This game is begging to be able to queue with friends. Until they include group matchmaking and like me you think you can play it with friends DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-16,0,0,178,False,Recommended,Representation Playing as the survivor the game offers an intensely dark atmosphere with surroundings that look beautiful at ultra settings. When you're sneaking through the thick grass that moves when you crouch through it and you hear your heartbeat (in game) rise you will feel that pressure and anxiety induced by the killer yourself. As the killer the atmosphere changes due to tunnel vision of the first person view making stalking and ultimately killing a thrilling hunt. Gameplay It is hard to comment on the balance of the 4v1 so soon after release. The survivors are challenged with fixing the generators in order to open the electric powered fence to freedom while escaping the grasp of the killer. The killer's goal is to slash his four victims twice and then carrying them to sacrificial poles spread throughout the level. The game (and it's balance) largely depends on what the remaining 3 survivors are doing during the time that the killer is hunting one of them. If they act smart and fix generators during that time balance will be in favour of the survivors (numbers game). If they however slack the killer's chances will grow with every survivor that is impaled. This is because a set number of generators must be activated before the gate can be opened making a sole survivor's chances very slim.The main problem lies within the game's ranking system. Both the survivors and the killer benefit greatly and perhaps only by lenghty games. As it is now you can kill all 4 survivors within 2 minutes of a game (truly outplaying them) and lose a rank because you did not score enough points. This means that winning or losing a game is not a requirement for gaining or losing rank which in essence can be good but not the way it's implemented currently. Overall I think that the game as it is makes for a thrilling and addicting experience. The minor bugs and/or ranking issues are things that can be dealt with easily within the first few weeks so I'm not worried there. If you have the $$ (18 euro) around don't hesitate to buy and try this wonderful game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-16,0,0,22,False,Recommended,So... I bought this game yesterday and my first impression is that the game is hella fun. It still needs some work of course but you should expect that from a game on release day. You get the option of playing as one of 4 survivors each with their own special abilities to repair enough generators to power up an escape door. Or play as the killer to find hack n slash and sacrifice as many of the survivors as possible before they escape. I can see this game going far in it's future and many other games to follow in it's footsteps. Much much fun!!,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-16,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Product received for free. My hubby bought this game for me I tend to play the killer a lot. I never thought I would like this type of game. I am a fan of horror just not random maps and Kill kill kill type of game. However I find myself already addicted to it I tell myself ok just one more mtch than 10 more matches later and im still playing. It does open my eyes to more games like this now to give them more of a chance. Sure there is glitches here and there and some people will come in the lobby and leave right away which can make it hard to get a full team of survivors. I highly suggest giving this game at least a try I hope to help my brother get his own copy so I can have someone else to hang with in it.,Dead by Daylight

Feels like it should be more of a G Mod gametype but if you're into that kind of thing this is a pretty good ordeal.

2016-06-16,0,0,40,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game after playing for a while i thought it would get really old and i would loose interest but i still find my self going back at it. At launch the game has no way of finding a match with friends this needs to be fixed for me to honeslty say i recommend this... because out of all my hours played in matchmaking i would say 2 hours is lobby hopping trying to find my friends..This short paragraph is more for dev's but give it a read! The game lacks feeling like a finished product. i think there should be alot more items in the game along with partying up and joining a game with friends. i would like to see more enemy characters and i would like to see more outfits for survivors. More interactable objects like the pallets (maybe boxes you knock over But you cant climb over them only break them!) I would also like to see newer objectives instead of just generators just a random new one to mix up the game.Pros Atmosphere Randomly generated maps Animations are clean Gameplay feels good and finished not too bugy Fun to play as both sides XP system is very fun i wish there was more content inside it.Cons Can't queue with friends in online match (not talking about private matches) No in game communication Game mutes steam chat microphone (THIS SUCKS) Can't lower in game music without lowering all sounds Flashlight is garbage,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-17,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,They should be ashamed to release a game like this. You can't setup your key binds nor proper settings. Vital things ! AND they have the nerve to release this multiplayer coop based game as described in the store page without a proper way to play with friends. Of course boosting your sales with some cheap/high incoming marketing leading to probably more sales during the first month then in the next 11 months that wasn't a problem.What do you think happens when your main costumers buys the game with their friends and first see a VERY LACK OF FUNDAMENTAL THINGS like proper settings only to then learn that they CAN'T PLAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS unless they wanna do 1vs1 or something like that.What a surprise because none of us thought it was actually an early access.

2016-06-15,0,0,283,False,Recommended,"So i like this game the idea and the game itself is so thrilling but the game is very bugged and glitched that you really are going to wonder why did the devs release it with this many flaws. First im going to go through with the cons and then pros and after some other things.Cons Extremely buggy and glitchy. No way to communicate as a survivor at all (no voice chat text chat etc only way to communicate is that you go to ts skype etc. No group search sytem yet (Devs confirmed that they are making this but its not in the game yet). I feel that the game is unbalanced for the survivors. Bad optimizationPros*Good graphics.*Private match system is alot of fun to play with friends.*Even though i feel that the game is unbalanced for the survivors its still a blast playing as one.*Scary and good athmosphere.The game is awfully bugged (game says steam goes offline even tho it doesnt you can get stuck when picking up a survivor as the killer for the rest of the game this includes the survivor also gettign stuck which means the match cant end unless you leave a annoying bug that makes it so that nobody else can/will(?) join your lobby (not private macth) and a bunch of other bugs).This game feels like it is an early access game even though it isn't. I will give this game a 6/10 and i recommend buying this game once the bugs and glitches (most of them) are fixed.EDIT Section.17/06/2016 Changed rating from 5/10 to 6/10 due to game getting more stable since lauch day with more and more players.Removed/edited a few sections (removed section that included killer camping by the hook and edited the bugs/glitches section).Changed recommendation from ""I do not recommend this game"" to ""I recommend this game""",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-09,0,0,470,False,Recommended,"Let me start by saying I LOVE this game. I love the cometitive cat and mouse style ""horror"" (thriller) feel it has. I like that it requires a different kind of skill set than other competitive based games like CS GO. I most of all love the devs for having an amazing amount of inspiration for this game.Sadly This is a prime example of what happens when an ambitious developer team releases a product too early.This game shows great promise but in all honesty it feels like an early access game that simply was pushed out of beta to increase sales give the illusion of significant progress etc.The game has significant balancing issues and countless bugs (god forbid you get stuck in hell hill's cracks) and now that this game has picked up a significant player base the devs are feeling the pressure and are struggling to fix the numerous bugs that should've been squashed in beta.One of the game's most unique aspects seems to also be its biggest problem Extremely competitive matchmaking.Due to the (forced) ranking system and no truly ""casual"" matches being available unless you create a private match with friends the playerbase should expect the ranking system (or even the LOBBIES) to be polished and developed.They are ANYTHING BUT THAT.You not only spend a significant time trying to even enter a lobby (especially if you have friends or a non 20 rank) but you also have to deal with getting matched with COMPLETELY RANDOM RANKS disgusting P2P and rampant point farming. This feels lazy of the developers to so blatantly ignore and these problems should've been fixed a long time ago.Honestly I know that this game wasn't expected to become so popular so fast and that the devs were surely overwhelmed due to this but if they had prioritized these massive bugs and balances from the beginning this game would have been a far better experience. (as of currently)But i'm also very glad that this game exists in this interesting competitive style and I know this should will become something great in the (not so far) future. As of currently i'd give this game a 7.5/10. Thanks Behavior Interactive!",Dead by Daylight

There is some parts where as the human players can knock things over when running away from the villain the villain can kick and break his way through the obstacles which players can create . The villains are played in first person because in first person the villain cannot see players sneaking behind him if the killer is 3rd person you would often see players more easily which isn't fair to the survivor characters .survivors are played in 3rd person . Loving the game and recommend whoever gives this game a thumbs down hates Originality i cannot think of any other game which is like this .I found this game when i came across Friday the 13th on steam . which is similar also i think .This game is WORTH every cent i spent .If i known the game was this enjoyable i probably would of purchased the Deluxe Edition !,Dead by Daylight

I do have some problems with it however so I'm going to do a pro v con list.Pros Atmospheric and pretty fun to play. Challenging. Randomized maps. The overall premise of the game. The art. Especially for the killers is badass. Graphics are pretty decent. The idea of the blood web is pretty cool.Cons Matchmaking takes longer than it takes an old man to figure out a computer. The lag in this game is real. One minute you're running from a killer the next you're stuck in a rock. Killers camp like its ing Halo. Legit the campers are s. The map is too small.

2016-06-15,0,0,69,False,Recommended,In no other game is killing your friends/ attempting to save them/ leaving them for dead in order for you to live as enjoyable and as utterly terrifying as it is in Dead by Daylight.This game is definitely fun especially if you have 2 4 other friends as you can hear the occasional scream through the skype call as your d bag of a friend Zach brutally handicapes your other friend Austen and hangs him on a meathook to be sacrificed to some Spooky God.Pros Perfect AtmosphereBalanced despite being a 1v4 (survivors have to work together and cooperate if the monster is even half way decent)Pants moments are plentifulSkype calls will rarely be as tense and funny at the same timeCons No rebindable keysMatchmaking doesn't allow for parties so you're either with 4 randoms or have to play only with friendsOccasional d/cs seem to happen 1 out 5 games (but will most likely become much less common as patches come out)EDIT As I've played more games it's dropped to about 1 in 10 so still a noticeable annoyance but less commonOverall This is a great game especially if you convince a few friends to grab it as well. Public matches are either pub stomps by the monster or nerve rackingly close as most monsters I've played against while a survivor are actually not terrible. While the party system (or lack thereof) may seem annoying its not too bad and in either case a close match that you win feels very well earned and desperately fought for.,Dead by Daylight

Hell no lol after playing both sides i realized there are no people complementing good plays or even a good game unless a survivor survives then they say gg and if your a killer they say gg if they kill everyone. Its all negative. Prices are high af and not worth the buys escpecially since most killers like doctor and freddy just become a gimmik later on and have no good potential unless the map which are a few that support that play style. Hell freddy only can be good or viable if you slug people on a big map even then SWF aka (survive with friends) will make tht perk and many perks playstyles useless. Check out Marth88 graph on how powerful survive with friends can be. He went perkless no items or offerings with a swf group and they were rank 1 and made 86/100 killers de pip. Which is saying alot lol and its quite frankly still broken. You can be carried as a survivor if your bad just basically let your team be toxic and tbag the killer and run him around while you do a few gens and leave. Poor killers have a long que time even at peak hours... 25minutes at rank 11? and 20 minutes at rank 1 and that is if you dont dodge these swf groups sadly. It becomes stale and the gen rush meta doesnt make this any better. Why did you even change brand new part if gen rushing is still as meta then ever since that rework . Save your money and your stress and sense of self for a game worth playing. I dont reccomend league of legends dead by daylight or overwatch and even HOTS. as relevant as they are they create toxic metas and people from these games usually have such an elitest and toxic demenor to them. Not fun Not enjoyable. Just a sad game right now.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-26,0,0,26,False,Recommended,So first off I did not play this game till much after it was released so I don't know if the comments regarding the games imbalances are from an early state of the game or not but it is very fun.Each killer plays differently and the survivors have their own unique perks to keep them alive.the maps are pretty random each time you play though the trapdoor spawns in the same spot I think.That being said it does have a VERY toxic community at times with people often using you as bait when you are a survivor or being a general nuisance when you are the killer. But if you can accept the fact that these sad people are in every single multiplayer game in creation you should be able to enjoy this game.Also be prepared to be called a camper cheat hacker and any other term you can think of for cheater when you win against people because you are smart and use your killer's abilities to their fullest( such as traping pallets and survivors as the Trapper using the teleport traps as the Hag and so on).,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-03,0,0,354,False,Not Recommended,Ive waited a while so i could undestand the mechanis better before posting a review . Curently the game is set up for survivors favor killers cant make a mistake or the survivors run all over them and the killer has to wait for the survivor to make a mistake in order to achieve their goals . This is the general life and death survive or die aspect of the game .Bloodpoints wise i do beleive that the killer has the upperhand as they can gain bloodpoints far easier than the survivors which helps to offset the bully tactics that most matches ive played tend to have . So a killer can level easier and get new perks faster then most survivors and also spend alot longer time waiting for a game in que .All around its fairly ballenced the community is what will make or break the game in general . There is maybe 1 in 4 matches where at least one survivor if not more wont disconect this is becomming a issue . The more dc's the less bloodpoints for a killer overall and the harder the game becomes for the remaining survivors . I have also noticed alot of matches where people have admited to useing discord or other means to comunicate as a organized group of survivors . I am not sure exactly how this is done but it does give them a huge advantage over a single killerand takes away from the killers fun and ability . I have seen groups of randoms work in a pac and do a exellent job that is the way its meant to be played and i give them props for that .It is a very fun game when people actualy play it like its suposed to be . be warned though if you dominate as a killer expect to be flamed in the aftermatch and accused of cheating . Most survivors I have met dont beleive a killer can win with 2+kills without cheating which tells you a little about how the game is rigged survivabily wise against the killers .There are alot of great players there are alot of ... not so great players as well (im not talking about skill) so its a potluck . They are adding a new killer and survivor as well as more customizations soon . They do work hard at trying to keep the game balenced and fresh . With that said though people may take alot of what i said as being negative im just telling it how it is good or bad and i would still recomend it . Issues with the comunity is not the developers fault . After 3 more months of playing the game and seeing the state its in i had to change my review . The swf discord groups run rampant over the game now and most (not all) are highly toxic . Survivors complain about camping and tunneling in the forums 10 times a day killers complain about swf groups about the same . The developer just sits idely by offering half off sales to help replace lost players and a new killer/survivor every 3 months to generate intrest and more money as a solution to not balancing the game around their own decisions . the decisions im talking about is the swf groups and telling killer that camping and tunneling are valid playstyles . each side has their own complaints and rather try to solve the issues at hand they just say we are going to do something about it and then seems like they ignore it and hope it goes away on its own ...,Dead by Daylight

Exciting keeps you on your seat and is different from other games of the same gene i.e Evolved.Cant moan at the price but the only thing that gets me is when your the killer and your chasing someone all people do is circle cars and because you are slower then them its just an endless boring chase that ruins the game.

2016-06-14,0,0,4,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight has been a truly fantastic experience. I bought this game since my younger brother is visiting from several states away and figured it would be fun to sit on the couch together and play unfortunatly local co op is not an option in this game. But after playing a few rounds by passing the controller back and forth I relaized this game wouldn't work for local co op at all but we did have fun watching the other person play freaking out when the killer was close or yelling out bad advice for where to hide/run. Overall we have played this game for a few rounds and we fell in love with it. We will continue playing to try and achieve the character perks that can be bought with the rewards earned in game. So I would defiantly recommend this game to others.A few things that some people have mentioned The killer is not OP at all I have played the killer a few times and trust me although he is strong and impossible to kill it is fairly ease to hide. I watched my little brother literally crouch behind a car and simply wwalk around it at the same pace as the killer in order to avoid him. All of his abilities help those situations.secondly Some have complained about the wait time to be a killer. You have to understand that everyone wants to be a killer and unlike the survivors only one person can be the killer per match. this results in a long line for killers. but a very short line for survivors... which leads me to my third point.Yes people will often quickly enter and then leave lobbies in an attempt to find their friends this can be slightly aggravating but isn't a huge deal considering how quickly they are replaced with a new player.,Dead by Daylight

As a victim it really does feel like a combination of peril and heroism.You get those same tense moments you see in horror movies.You hear your buddies screaming and wonder if you should try to go help them or hurry up and finish the generator your working on to increase your own chance of survival.Its fairly clunky and the visuals are fairly simple but atmospheric.

For the price tag it seems fair.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-16,0,0,208,False,Recommended,Not enough adolescent teen sacrifices lately. This game makes up for it. Concept is simple. If you're a killer track down the wimpy flesh bags. They leave tracks when they run making it easy to find them. Find them place them on hooks. Wait for their team mates to try and rescue them. Rinse and repeat. As the survivors your job is to not die. Don't make noise don't run around taking pictures get the generators hit space bar and if you hear your character's heart beat try not to run hide instead.Three different killers wraith trapper and hillbilly. Wraith has the ability turn invisible and move really fast but can't attack when doing so. He's really good at finding survivors but not as good at taking them down. Trapper places bear traps to catch the survivors who enjoy exploiting the fact that survivors can vault windows easier than the killer or to protect survivors who are being sacrificed. Hillbilly is my fave ). Rev up dat chainsaw and scare survivors out of hiding or use it instead of his primary weapon when chasing down survivors for a 1 hit knockdown.Survivors have a lot of freedom in how they want to play. Knock down hooks with the toolkit to make it harder for the killer to make a sacrifice heal themselves or team mates with first aid kits or distract the killer so that another survivor may escape or get a generator running.My biggest problem is too many quitters. Lots of people leave the match because they don't like playing anymore the moment they are caught or sacrificed by the killer. Use that time to watch your team mates and see what they do right or wrong. You can play with friends but only in private matches. This is fine considering unlockables don't really offer much of an advantage but annoying when you realize how cliche random survivors can be. You got the overly confident who keeps vaulting windows and t bagging (funny when you're a trapper though). The saviors who focus only trying to get everyone out alive (doesn't happen) the stupid every worst horror movie actor who's the first to get caught gets saved watches her savior get caught flees and gets caught again (usually the players who quit early) and the every man for himself guy who goes for a few generators and then waits for everyone else to die so that he can use the escape hatch.,Dead by Daylight

Never had too much problem getting a match as survivor but I haven't had the chance to play monster yet because I can't find 4 survivors that will stay in the lobby and ready up. Hopefully if they implement friends+matchmaking then there shouldn't be as many people leaving to find their friends.Otherwise it's a great asymmetrical multiplayer game. Plenty of oppertunity for helping or leaving teamates that leads to emergent situations. There were 3 of us left. One was on a hook and the monster was camping the hook. I ran in to draw the monster out while the other team member helped them down! All three got out and survived.

2016-08-01,0,0,280,False,Recommended,This game is great when it works and pretty bad when it doesn't. Luckily this game almost always works as intended. For a twenty dollar price tag you're getting more than pay for with this game. When this game was first launched I found too many flaws in it to recommend it to ANYONE. Now however the issues that plagued this game at launch are now gone and all that remains is an innovative and unique experience. Now there are still some flaws. Some killers are DLC only and from a cynics perspective one might see this as pay to win given that killers have their own unique powers and some are more powerful than others. But the game is surprisingly well balanced. There are a few things I don't perfectly agree with but nothing gamebreaking nothing completely overpowered. Another flaw is that the playerbase is notorious for being salty. If you're playing as a killer prepare to face a great many people that blame you for losing their own connection issues playing with strategies they find to be unfair like camping an area and so on. But if you can look past that and I recommend you do this game is more than worth the money and the time you will no doubt put into it. Enjoy the game for what it is and ignor the part of the playerbase that CAN be toxic and you'll find that despite its small flaws the game holds up and will stand the test of time.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-09,0,0,862,False,Not Recommended,It's taken me a long time to finally decide on my decisive opinion on this game and I think after nearly 700 hours of playing it I have come to a conclusion. Do I recommend this game? Yes and no.Before I start my review I would like to clarify that in terms of balancing I think the game is the best state it has ever been in. Dead by Daylight basic foundation requires 80% of the playerbase to mostly play survivor and 20% to play killer. For the best part of 2 years playing survivor was stupidly easy. STUPIDLY. EASY. Crutch perks broken game mechanics and survive with friends has seen survivors bullying fearsome blood thirsty killers driven by a mysterious force of pure evil with wooden pallets windows and flash lights. Because of this the majority of people didn't mind playing survivor because it was so so easy. In all of the games I have ever played bar perhaps Rust this is the most toxic community I have ever seen most likely because of the massive differences between the sides of the community. Now after 2 years the developers seemed to have finally begun to understand how to balance their own game in the way it should have been for the past 24 months. Killers are now scary and in control. However this is where the problem arises. Because of the teachable perk system survivors eventually just become skins with no bonus or benefit to playing one survivor offering any bonuses in certain areas over others (except claudette who literally disappears from plain sight). For example if you play Claudette or Quentin the supposed 'medics' you do not get any bonuses for healing or performing altruistic actions. Survivors are ultimately skins. There is no different game experience when playing survivor as none offer anything else to the others. They go into the game turn on 5 generators and attempt to escape. Survivors also generally earn less blood points than killers which is the currency used to purchase almost anything in the game. Each killer is vastly different from the others with unique abilities to help them kill survivors as well as perks. You can play as Trapper and hide metal jaws in the grass ready to trap your victims. You can play Huntress throwing hatches at your victims across the map. Every killer is a different experience with a different playstyle. Did I mention killers GENERALLY (emphasis again on generally) earn more blood points too. Now remember for this game to work efficiently they need 80% of the playerbase to play survivor and only 20% to play killer because of the 4 1 ratio. Last year playing survivor generally gave you more points and was an easier not necessarily more enjoyable experience (depends on whether you want a free ride or a challenge).Coming into the game at this point would you want to play on the side which generally rewards less blood points and doesn't give a unique experience depending on who you play? Or the side who literally dictates the entire game whose game experiences from killer to killer AND who generally earns more blood points. To answer the question if you were thinking of buying this game would I recommend it? As killer yes absolutely. As survivor? Not so much.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-09,0,0,142,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight is a game I always find myself returining to. Its enjoyment comes from a intense game of hide and seek with deadly consequences while the matches are short and quick so you wont have to worry about spending to much time per match. As a survivor you work with three others to power generators and escape. The killers goal is to find and kill all of the survivors by hanging them on hooks around the map. If you like suspense and sitting at the edge of your seat then this game is right up your alley. While there are many games to play with friends this one is one of my personal favorites as getting a full squad of my buddies can lead to crazy amounts of fun. guy who doesn't actually have any friends,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-26,0,0,1475,False,Recommended,I'm editing this review right now because of people complaining about killer gameplay and how its boring and unsatisfying. I'm just gonna say if you're gonna camp you WILL get no where. When you camp as killer you are missing out on hunting a survivor chasing a survivor and hooking the survivor more than once. This ruins your bloodpoints and ruins your chances of pipping for the match. My strat (as of right now) is to chase a survivor hook that survivor then gen pressure as well as chasing another survivor. If you can't find any survivors at generators then go back to the survivor when he gets unhooked. If you see a survivor but you also see that the other survivor was unhooked do not go for the hooked survivor go for the survivor you just found. The unhooked survivor will most likely be healing/getting healed before they do a gen and once you catch the next person they will be forced to save him.It's my non toxic way of getting a 4man.Ever since the new update my mindset on this game is rapidly changing. I don't feel as negative as I was on the old versions of the game and I gotta say the 3 months without the game were good but I started to miss the cat and mouse chase of the game. I launched the game again and I do not regret it. The New Cosmetic System (Store) I don't really like the whole Fortnite styled cosmetic system but at the same time you don't have to pay for the new currency as you can still get Shards the same way and buy them with that. The cosmetics are really clean and good looking. They don't look rushed or anything which makes me satisfied with the models. The New DLC Actually Amazing. I haven't seen a better DLC enterance from Behavior in my entire life. The Clown plays pretty well from what I've seen and the new survivor is pretty good as well. Overall a good DLC and I must have for newer players. Also the Clown's bottle mechanic is actually pretty good and shows what the Unreal Engine can do effect wise. (one reason I'm glad for Unreal4 now instead of Unreal3.) The New Engine (yes i know its been released for a long time but its something i haven't talked about.) The new engine makes the game look a lot better compared to what it looked like. The flashlight's beam consists of rays but it also used to just be a textured cylinder so I'm fine with that. The blood is now animated so PLUS to me. The only thing I don't like about this update is the new mesh for jackets or even anything with moving clothing. It just goes everywhere since it has no restraints including Feng Min. Claudette's Jackets just look weird when you move but Feng's one just goes everywhere. The New (delayed) System of PalletsBelieve it or not I think this is a good thing since now people can't teleport to the other side and I'm a survivor main showing sympathy for killers (i know amazing right?) and their struggles to catch someone doing pallet exploits. It's a good move in my opinion. Thats right OchiDO no more vaccum pallets...Overall with all of this new content over the 2 years I would give this game an 8.5/10. Also too addicting. (old review if you want to see it.)I used to recommend this game but this game is slowly dying. The devs don't know how to handle their community and they don't listen to their community either. So here is the 3 reasons this game is going to most likely die.1. Banning people for exploiting in a KYF match. (Kill Your Friends)Most reasons people are being banned from this game is either because of the Hag Space Program or exploiting in general. The thing with the Hag Space Program though is that you have to perfectly angle it and will most likely fail the first time. Most of the time the killer wants to play the game and won't try to exploit. It shouldn't be bannable because its in a lobby that rewards you with nothing. You are able to play with your friends including having one of your friends as the killer but when the game ends you get nothing no completed daily ritual nothing. People who have gotten banned by the Hag Space Program (of what I know) is OchiDO and No0b3 (which his is perm as of right now.)2. Work on this game.The developers are not centering on fixing a bunch of things but rather making DLC that just extends how much survivors/killers you can play as. But lets be honest here we would rather want more work on the game than working on new things. The best thing they have done (in my opinion) is the Emblem Update and thats not even out yet. (Other than being in a PTR)3. Support.A lot of people can probably feel someone's frustration when emailing them and never getting a response back including if its something like you getting banned for no reason and trying to ask the devs why or even just trying to get assist with an issue you're having. It has been like this ever since this game was released.I don't get why the devs are banning people for something that is wrong with their own game. They aren't using a third party item to get an advantage they are just using the game's issues and glitches to get the advantage. What makes this even worse is that instead of seeing the glitch and fixing it the player is banned.Unban No0b3Unban OchiDOand if you ban my boy Monto then thats my last drop of hope for this game gone.,Dead by Daylight

It doesnt really bug out when you're in game but when youre in the menu screen resulting in having to force quit. It happens randomy too and so far ive had to force quit 3 times in a row to play a game in one session while other sessions it doesnt happen.

The game is fun suspenseful and sensibly priced. DLC is cheap and the content is worthwhile for the most part (especially on sale). The developers regularly update the game and stream on twitch to update the community and seem to genuinely care about their fanbase. Yes the game had it's faults over the last two years it's still somewhat survivor sided (unless the killer is a good billy/nurse) and the early learning curve is somewhat difficult but past that and it's an enjoyable time sink with a great (although quite salty) community.

2018-07-09,0,0,191,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Haven't played since 2 years ago and joined for double point weekendGot this game for free and in that sense it's definetly worth it. Not many bugs I've noticed got stuck once this weekend camping at a tree with crows. Definetly fun and can be intense when the killer is chasing you causing adrenaline rush. As the killer at least for me you get satisfication on hooking the survivors and trying to kill them. Not fun when you get owned by the survivors but does take time to learn how survivors play.Pros FunSort of casual game you can play off and on will be same gameSpecial events double points sort of thingCons Ranking system doesn't really fit imo just rewards consistent playersPay to play game with Free to play mechanics (grind)Could be grindy before getting ""tier 1"" perks on same survivorPeople say community is toxic but only experienced it if killer just focuses you or people don't like how you play.Really made review bc more clarity should be given on dlc content whether it is going to be free and to make comments about cons of the game. Like is older content going to become free for everyone when new content is added? What about those who bought the content that is now free?I think the shop is a new step but prices don't match dlc prices (dlc cheaper in terms of characters). Gives people a sense of a goal because they can unlock new content by just playing. Don't really agree with a purchase game to have more paid content besides the fact on license content (thinks of overwatch vs COD).Actually why I stopped playing because it was dumb. If I want to play other characters I had to buy them. Now some you can buy with ingame grind and some are now free which wasn't initally the case. Depending on how popular cosmetics are may give owners a steady income. Rank system seems same as 2 years ago lol. Problem the system is how do you make it fair when the best tier perks can be used within 1 character. So those who have not played much are kind of at a disadvantage. The rank System just rewards consistent players. Not how to manage a fair perk system. I guess if you play the game a lot this will never be a problem until new content is added and you're behind the curve. Game is skill and perk based. Perks just detmine who easy or difficult a particular trial may be.Perk change that seemed to happen is the 3 teachable perks or specific surviver perks are given initially now. I think there should be a higher chance to get specific surviver perks to tier 3 before reaching teachables. Does seem like owners listen to community 50/50 from my blind eye. Haven't played too much. I do like that the owners are trying to make the entry into this game easier / more bareable. I feel this allows new / more casual players to keep playing or start the game.TLDR Haven't played in 2 years game in better direction than initially still fun owners continue to listen to feedback.",Dead by Daylight

The community is awful tho with poor sportsmanship and no way for someone to actually get banned/ temp banned for toxicity this game quickly gets frustating to like. On top of the community it feels as if the devs (developers) haven't ver played the game. There are so many bugs that the devs fail to fix fast and the balancing team doesn't understand what is considered OP and what isn't. It isn't completely their fault because they can't even trust the opinions of the people that play there game. Because a majority of DbD players are whiny children who thinks everything is op except for what perks they run/ killer they use.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,1210,False,Not Recommended,"I don't want to give the game a thumbs down because I really love playing both survivor and killer. They're both super fun and enjoyable however most of the reasons behind the game having any cons really comes back to the player.Pros Lots of variety. Each match is different from the last and no one strategy is gonna get you out alive or get each survivor. There are currently 7 killers and 7 survivors each with different perks that allow you to mix and match to customize how you play. Currently there are 7 (might be six?) maps to play on and each one requires you use different methods to hide from the killer or devise different tactics to outmanuever survivors. Both sides get to choose offerings and items to assist them which I absolutely love (and hate sometimes).Cons Cheaters. Loads of cheaters. People playing with their friend as the killer and taking the killer their friend to other survivors and then unhooking them so the killer can then hit and rehook them. Sometimes it can be hard to find a lobby as a survivor and when you do the killer's ping is so high you lag/rubberband and it's a terrible match for everyone. If you stick around someone on a hook too long as the killer you get fifteen invites to some kind of group mocking you for ""camping"". I also get called a myriad of names at the end of most matches but that's the internet more than a con.All in all I love the game but the people sort of put a damper on it. Don't be discouraged though if none of this sounds like too much of a downer and totally get it D",Dead by Daylight
2017-07-19,0,0,16,False,Recommended,Great game with fun teamwork aspects when playing as a survivor. Very satisfying when you can succesfully start all the generators and escape the level.

2017-07-20,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,This games was good for a while when it launched it was very fun when it first came out and i enjoyed playing with my friend as a survivor. But the game has taken a turn for more flashy content instead of solid quallity content i.e. the updated graphics pack when the game had the chinese new year/ valentines day update. This serverly reduce frame rates and made the game all around less fun as looking at a pretty texture is as good as having realistic frame rates that make the game look better. Majority of people who probably bought this game do not have Godly PC's and the new graphics pack would only downgrade their graphics and performance as they would have to decrease their graphics from Ultra or High to medium or maybe even low idk to get the game running at 60fps+ i would rather my game be on ultra but look like it's running at medium graphics and be running at above 60+fps than have my game run at 45fps at ultra. Also i don't think anyone would mind if this patch was scrapped for balancing and more REAL content instead of minecraft texture packs signed someone who shouldn't waste time on reviews on dead games( IK this games dead and Friday the 13th is just a better alternative but i still spent 20 bucks on this game).,Dead by Daylight

It's something completely new (to me anyways) and I just love it! 100 or so hours played and I still get jump scared every so often by a shifty killer. This is definitely the sort of game where you would want to play with some of your friends teamwork isn't necessarily essential but everyone benefits if all 4 survivors work together.EDIT Still enjoying the game and the regular content updates. Just be aware that one of the scariest things about this game is that it's released but playing with 1 or more friends may result in you spending 15 minutes finding a game before it kicks you out.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-05,0,0,948,False,Recommended,This is the first game review I have ever written.If you are a new player trying Survivor and you enjoy playing stealthily or as part of a team the game is very fun to play. It is as close a game to my dream game that I have ever played (my dream game is 50+v1 Monster/Killer in a destructible city map with the objective of escape).Once you get to grips with the game's mechanics the frustration of failing or making skilled moves to avoid the Killer is exciting and will keep you gripped. When you lose the fear factor of the killer the game can become easy to play at lower ranks (with like minded and skilled players). If you start playing aggressively as a survivor it takes a skilled killer to beat you (Huntress with hatchet aim Nurse with skilled blinking etc)I can see why the latest patch has given the killer's a boost.The only negative I would raise is that additional game modes might reinvigorate the community and could potentially help the overall balance of the game. In its current state I personally believe it becomes too easy for 4 survivors to beat 1 killer. I would like to see 2 Killers v 6 survivors but may create additional balancing problems.TL DR if you want a game that mixes stealth with objectives while your pants this is the game for you.,Dead by Daylight

Then when the full game was released i was so excited for it because in beta you could only play as one of the killers (the trapper). So when i hoped in my very first lobby people were leaving then joining then leaving again. My first thought was that they just wanted to play with their friends but then another answer poped in my head they were just disconecting from the server and returning to the main menu because thats what happened to me. Then when i joined and actually played the killer was a wraith so i thought ""ah ok i'll just play"" but no the wraith is too OP they kinda really need to nerf the wraith killer but overall when you get a killer who doesn't hook camp or over abuse the wraith skill then the game is pretty fun. Also my opinion is that i have seen some people say that the game would be alot better with a ""invite a friend to a public lobby"" thing. Well i completely disagree with that because this game is based around working as a team without people asking for it if someone is on a hook its common instinct to help them... But yes you will get those people who will only care about escaping and getting the generators rathing than helping a fallen survivor but hey in every game you play you are gonna encounter a few of these people i guess for me its exciting just to see what kind of teamates you get and what type the killer is.I recommend this game but if you are one of those impatiant ""i want everything now"" people well then this probably isnt this kind of game for you at this present point in time.8/10 Keep up the good work devsAlso remember people this game not long came out so gives the devs a break and let them do what they need to do rather than asking for everything right of the bat.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-06,0,0,53,False,Recommended,This game can be very fun if you are willing to put with a screwed up match making system their is a ranking system yet it will match a rank 1 killer with a group of rank 20 survivors. The killer has the option to drop his lobby and rejoin to get a more favorable match he can see what rank/level/gear the survivors are before deciding to accept the match or not. As a survivor you have no idea what killer you are facing let alone what rank/level they are. When playing with friends I find the game will often drop you back to the main campfire lobby where you and your friends have to rejoin up and try and get into a match. One would think after you click ready that you'd be put into a match making que and wait till your turn is up you'd be wrong it searchs see's no game is ready for you and unreadies you. So you have to keep clicking ready for 1 2 minutes Don't wanna take a loss just alt f4 and quit game and no harm no foul nothing more frustrating when a killer doesn't wanna lose points and he kills his game you gain no points for the match he losses none. This game has already been cracked and several different hacks for both survivors and killers that can completely ruin a match. While this is nothing new to PC games its just frustrating when an already lopisided match gets worse because the killer is using cheats. So key things for this game to get a thumbs up from me Fix the match making system to A.) be more fluid I.E. I don't have to spam click ready for 5 minutes to get a game and so that it doesn't randomly drop me and disband my friends group B.) Make some damn sense don't put me in with a rank 1 killer when I'm rank 18. C.) Stop allowing the killer to see what he's going to face so he can decided its to hard and not face it I can't see the killer why the hell can the killer see us?*****************************************************************************************************************UPDATE 10/13/2016Came back to play this game after a few months of nothing and a few thinsg have changed. For starters they removed the ability to see everyones level at the game lobby so you don't know if you have a team of pros or a team of noobs the killer also can't see. Huge improvement. They also fixed the match making system so that you don't have to keep spam clicking the ready button click once and it puts you in a que another huge improvement. The match making system itself still needs a little help. I was playing as a killer and kept finding myself getting que'd against rank 12's and lower that had all the perks you'd want and well my killer is lvl 1 without any perks. Now thats not to say I didn't get a few kills in here and there but more times than not it was at the end when they were being greedy and trying to max out their points and I got lucky. They finally also fixed the Alt F4 so people will no longer disconnect in a match they think will be a loss a big bonus means people play to win and not just say it and leave. When you que with friends it would be nice if after the game was done you didn't have to remake your group again. Thats a minor annoyance I hear people complaining that the killer is just a pushover and easy to defeat.. while I agree there are some things just frustrating. like I hook someone and go to place a trap at their feet someone can run up and get em off the hook before I can set the trap or before I can stop trying to set the trap and take a swing at em. but all and all I find it fairly balanced you gotta get in the head of the runner that your chancing and predict where they are going to go don't always follow the same path or try and take down every barrier they put in your way.,Dead by Daylight

I still countnue to play this game and i recommend it if you play with friends,Dead by Daylight
2018-09-08,0,0,952,False,Not Recommended,"While I myself am recommending against this game it can be fun at times however mostly on survivor also only get this game if you are okay with dealing with a toxic community and devs that currently are doing very little about it and focusing on content rather then game mechanic/map balancing.here is the current standing of the game from my opinion.Survivor Currently in the power spot in my opinion as those with decent amount of skill at the game can make even nurse (the strongest killer in the game currently as negates looping) have to work pretty hard as they understand what they need to do which is predict the mindgames of killers know where pallets and windows are as well as which are safe/unsafe and understand what their teamamtes are doing to optimise gens/rescues (which is made easy by SWF). Currently though as the devs are still strugglin to find a balance of pallets/windows this is made easy and most pallet loops are safe and their are very few maps that are not survivor sided (the one exception being meat plant which is killer sided). moving on from map design in cases of survivor we have perks and items (as well as their add ons). These make the already strong survivor even stronger as it is quite easy to get rank 1 with no perks as survivor as long as you play optimal ergo as you can imagine giving these optimal survivors second chance perks such as decisive strike and borrowed time makes the game a much more survivor friendly place. These perks are mostly used by the toxic side of community or the newer members of the community while the newer members it's understandable as they do not have the skill a veteran would when it IS used by a veteran killers should prepare for multiple teabags.Killer While Killer should be in the role of ""power"" currently this is not the case due to the reasons mentioned within the survivor part. this being said currently they are in the best place they have ever been as the devs of the game have allowed the killers a few extra tools to catch those pesky generator repairing survivors. These being bloodlust which as long as the killer does not break chase (or pallets) allows the to get faster and faster and also generators to decrease progress that any survivors may have done to them (these were not in the game upon its release) furthermore while the our afore mentioned devs behaviour have indeed decrease the AMOUNT of pallet within certain maps they have yet to change how many SAFE pallets are alowed within a map thus leading to horrificly survivor sided maps such as coldwind farm maps thompson house and cowshed barn maps which have the infamous pig tree and of course cowshed loops that can allow a survivor to add a fair amount of time to a chase that should have been completed. Now while you may think (oh but that's there to help survivors survive whats so bad about it?) the main problem is that these loops allow both skilled AND unskilled survivors to survive beyond what they originally should as these infinites can often be used in tendem with safe pallets which forces a SKILLED killer to break the chase for another target should the target survivor be skilled enough. Ergo should all the surviors be skilled ones even a skilled killer that DOES NOT play nurse or clown struggle to get even one kill specially if they are honorable killer who do not camp/tunnel (I myself do camp but only in situations that need it such as the one above and if the hooked individual is near a exit gate that is open). However it is my hope these are fixed within the next patch. all these things lead to a killer never really ""controlling"" the game but rather fighting against the survivors in a game of cat and mouse. Moving onto killer perks i don't have much to say here as most are pretty interesting and the current ones that really only need to be change are insidious and Noed as insidous is just plain useless and only advocates toxic behaviour (camping in ever situation possible) and Noed is a crutch perk that like ds does for survivors rewards the killer for bad play (all gens finished).So while I myself cannot recommend the game due to the current state of mainly the community and map/perk design. I will say the base idea of the game is fun and despite these i do still have a few enjoyable games (where no toxic members are to be seen). though most of these are indeed survivor games. P.s. Before i forget they also need to focus MASSIVELY on bug repair as the game currently A randomly close/crashB Gain a lobby bug where no more surviors can join a lobby THAT STILL has space (therefore the game will not start and either someone needs to leave so the lobby sends out a tickets again to the system sayin ""SPACE HERE"" and hope it acknowlegdes it or the entire lobby needs to be remade.C fix audio issues with heartbeat as either it's just me and the sudden complete dropout of a killers heart beat is normal (even though they are not running insidous afterall it is useless) or as usual they have messed something up again in a patch.14/09/2018It has now been confirmed that I firmly believe that no one should buy this game as the developers advocate bullying as the allow people to stream snipe thus allow for streamers (a major part of the community as they both test and advertise the game for them) to be targeted and abused as and when the toxic part of their community desires.",Dead by Daylight

2017-08-03,0,0,232,False,Recommended,"Dead by daylight is a multiplayer team based game where 4 survivors try to outrun hide and escape from a relentless killer.As a survivor the main goal is to repair 5 generators to open up a gate where they can escape.As the killer the main goal is to slaughter all 4 survivors by putting them on meat hooks and sacrificing them to ""The Entity"".Each killer/Surivor has an in depth perk system and a leveling system.Survivors can use items like flashlights and medkits to their advantage while killers have a special skill like using bear traps or a chainsaw.Thats about it gameplay wise.The only downside to the game in my opinion is some of the players.Some can be a little toxic sometimes.Overall I reccomend the game to fans of the horror genre.I give Dead by Daylight a 7/7",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-20,0,0,214,False,Recommended,Recently really gotten into this game and I can and will reccomend it for you to buy. (and hay its 40% off too ) ) The game is a 1 vs 4 survival horror in which a killer (choose from currently 4 free killers the other 3 can be obtained through DLC which also gives you a survivor) chases hunts kills or sacrifices the 4 survivors (choose from 7 free survivors) each character has its advantages through its unique perks but you can level each character whether it be a survivor or a killer to get there unique perks teachable so that you can take them on different characters. Theres are set maps but the contense inside them variates between each trial (game) for instance the basement can switch positions and the generators hooks. barricades and alot of the walls in the game are also random. So each trial can be different providing endless hours of fun even though your playing the same game over and over. Some killers may seem overpowered at first but the more you play vs them the more you can see there weaknesses and strengths so you can learn to play agaisnt them. It works vise versa some killers may find a certain survivor with a certain perk overpowered but again the more you play the more you realize how to counter that survivors tricks. Theres only one problem I have really with the game is the Doctors new map which for me is just meh. But all in all this game is great to play alone or with friends. You might find yourself playing all night sometimes haha. Well I hope I helped convice you or not convince you to buy Dead by Daylight. )Thanks Andro &lt 3,Dead by Daylight

Once in the game the lag always depends on the killer's connection (the killer creates the lobby therefore hosts the game). I stopped playing after a while because of the community nonetheless the game is extremely fun. I have now purchased the PS4 version and there's no chat (aside from your pre made party if you have a headset) that other players can be salty. At the end of each game you can give props or report players for different reasons. I like that about it. I haven't played the PC version for a while and I have no idea if it's the same as the PS4.Anyways if you're looking for a fun game that gives you some scare jumps (but just in the beginning) I recommend this one.

2016-10-25,0,0,424,False,Not Recommended,Dead by daylight is a trash game. The devs will never balance the game. Survivor is broken as The only reason why nothing gets changed about survivor is because more poeple play survivor than killer. Which means the more people you keep happy the more money you get by in game purchases. My favorite part is when you get to use really good killer add ons then survivors just rage quit and you dont get to enjoy those said add ons. The survivor on the other hand gets to keep their items if they rage quit. This is the few but many reasons why the devs suck the survivor mains CO K's. The game is very addictive because of many reasons which makes me very sad to put this one down. Maybe one day the game will be fair but until then peace.,Dead by Daylight

From the survivor view it's all about team work. Even though the game is repetitive it NEVER gotnold or boring. The game is still fairly new so there are a few minor glitches. The most annoying one being not able to join a lobby constantly. But spamming the join lobby button seems to work just fine. I can't wait for DLC for this game.,Dead by Daylight

Wait for a moment that you know you are truly safe or truly screwed to break into a sprint. Very few bugs in this game as far as actual gameplay but the menu can get a bit freaky sometimes.

I play it every day if I have the opportunity.Don't let the negative reviews scare you away from this aweseome source of thrilling entertainment! I am but a very average player of this game. I do get outplayed and looped by talented and more skilled survivors when playing a killer. I do get caught somewhat easily by a tricky killer. Guess what instead of crying I'm actually learning from them. And I really feel like getting better.Lots of people whining about bugs. I rarely bump into them and the game actually is getting better and better.Pros atmospheric graphics thrilling action packed gameplay opportunity to learn from your opposites some great teamwork mechanicsCons the killers are the hosts sometimes with potato connection some laggy players (like in every multiplayer) sometimes toxic teammates and opponents matchmaking needs to be fixed sometimes you bug out.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-18,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,All the reviews giving the game a positive rating have either chosen to neglect the bugs and glithes or balancing issues in an attempt to be funny or just because they dont care/havent experienced these issues yet. If you're looking for the True horror experience this is the game for you..unfortunately the game is rushed.To be 100% fair this game gets almost everything right. The Atmosphere the tension. Its all there not to mention the graphics are incredible. The only issue i have with this game at this current time is that Matchmaking can take upwards of 25 minutes and the game is riddled with bugs. First sometimes matchmaking doesnt even search for a match and keeps sending you back to the campfire screen as a survivor meaning the only way I can play is as the monster. Plus theres the ANNOYING glitch that ends the game for you as soon as you join! The developers are working on these bugs as they addressed it in a forum post not too long ago and within the next few weeks these should be fixed. As the game is NOW in its current state Do not buy it unless you're willing to put up with many bugs to have 1 fun match.There is also the issue of Balancing. On the player side infinite window hopping(the monster moves slower through windows than survivors) so the monster can never win (technically). THEN theres the monster balance issues. Namely the WRAITH. Unfair BS monster who can turn invisible avoiding the heartbeat sensor part of the game and just all around making him almost impossible to beat. If you want to win games as the monster play Wraith or dont play at all thats how it is at this current state.Once you get past all the people tryin to randomly match up with their friends because the game has NO INVITE SYSTEM (yet) for some reason the game is genuinely enjoyable.I have decided against refunding in the feeble hope that the devs fix the matchmaking problem and the game begins to flourish like it deserves to.If you are going to buy this game I suggest buying the game and trying it for an hour then if you dont like it refund it at help.steampowered.com. I recommend this game only if you understand the multiplayer difficulty the current bugs and glitches of a rushed game and are willing to wait for matches.Happy Hunting!,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-15,0,0,19,False,Recommended,"I enjoy the concept of the game but it doesn't do itself justice. The game revolves around about 4 5 objective that need to be down (simple enough right) the only thing stopping you is the killer. The killer are the main concern in my book as they are overpowered in a no scary way but full on cartoony way. The chainsaw killer has a skill that does a dash with the chainsaw... well lets just say I was trying to survive against a killer on skates. With no cool down team it seems the killer flys around the map with ease too much ease. The Churchbell Killer has his natural speed way too high. You can ""stun"" the killer by blocking the their path at the right moment which on paper sounds good but in the game it did completely nothing. The Churchbell Killer felt as if I was trying to run from a faster surivior. Also the hooks are more of annoyance then scary... (another rude thing is the killer can easily camp the hook and literal get a 100% kill.). My recommendation buy it when it is finish unlike most Alpha or Beta games now a days.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-15,0,0,103,False,Recommended,First off I will say as on 15 Jul 16 I would not purchase this game unless you have patience. But let me expand on that.This game is overall fantastic. It has a great concept and its mechanics are pretty good. The audio brings suspence and the models of the characters are amazing. However the issues are the glitches/servers.As of late with alot of maintenence to add party mode (Essentially you have to luck out on connecting with friends you can't invite them without it being a private match) this game has become unplayable (unless you're lucky enough to get into a match). Now don't be disheartened by this. The developers are constantly giving updates which is a good and majority of the time this game is functional. I would personally suggest buying this either when its on special or a week or two from now. Overall I give this game a solid 8/10.It does bring the horror element without it being completely scary depending on your play style. For myself I usually pop out brick when playing horror games except for this game which still keeps me on the edge of my seat allows me to actually enjoy the horror aspect of it. Hopefully this review has helped ),Dead by Daylight

You are at a spooky place and have to run from a killer (If you are the survivor) fix generators (there are five most of the time) and save your friends... (If you want to &gt P) *You are on your own for the most part (unless you find others) but you have to fix generators on your own (roughly 5 for most games unless it is a private match).*You can create a public match (If you are a Killer)*You can make a private match (and get your friends to join)*Different difficulties. You can join a game where the killer is a pro or get a killer that is new. *You don't need to buy the DLCS to experience the different Killers. (If you bought the game but not ((for example)) the Friday the 13th killer you can still run away from that Killer. ((just can't play as him though))).CONS*When you connect to the game lobby as a survivor there is a chance you can be stuck there for some time. (I waited an hour to join a random game once) *When you are in a lobby and the game is loading the map w/killer you can be stuck at the loading screen for sometime. (The most I ever waited was 20 minutes and then when the game loaded I was the only survivor. Everyone left )*As the Killer the chainsaw guy if you kill a survivor on a hill and drop him. You will get glitched and stuck there until the game ends. (It only happens when you are on the end of the hill near the clif part) (This happened to me everytime I did that so there might be a small glitch there. (Even in pravite matches) But it's not bad you can kill them but don't walk off the ledge) *If the Killer has super bad internet so will you. You would lag and glitch sometimes. But it doesn't happen THAT often. My thoughtsThe game is awesome.Has a really intense atmosphere when playing it. Really awesome of letting the players show their teamwork.The killer's killing styles are all unique.Each time you level up a killer/survivor you get more perks that can help you kill/escape.I really enjoy playing this game especially with friends. I would reocmmend this game. Out of the 8 Pros and the 4 Cons that I listed I still think it is an awesome game to play with friends and random people.Side note that I thought was awesome If you are recording your gameplay it doesn't buffer or lag when you do. Really awesome quality also when you upload it to YouTube or anyother play.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-10,0,0,384,False,Not Recommended,The game is buggier than most open world survival Early Access titles.

It's fun for a bit because you're initially scared of the killers and what they can do and have fun surviving with your friends. Using teamwork to try to outsmart the killer is a good concept but this game just squanders any chance of fun that the survivors try to get. The hooks that the killer uses to hang survivors they've caught are FAR too frequent making the ""wiggle"" function completely useless. The killers are frequently faster than survivors making it impossible to outrun or get away from them when they spot you. Also the fact that all of the DLC is far too expensive when it shouldn't even cost anything to begin with. The developers are clearly not using any funds from these stupidly priced DLCs to better their game because it is just horrendous nearly 3 years after release.

While it looks nice and plays ok it has some glaring issues.I though the murderer was gunna be a mix and match of murderers and monster... really they are just the same guy with a slight skin change and a single diffrent defining skill and perk. First off there's barely any content in it the tutorial is basically a short video that barely explains essentials like HOW SURVIVORS CAN ESCAPE FROM THE HOOKS!!!. I hook this one guy go off to deal with another and he's just hopped off.Also survivors move at the same speed when injured to normal humans are all the same and there is always an infinate juker these are players that can jump over a piece of enviroment and you can't hit them and by the time you get across they've already gone ready and ready to go again which ruins the game.This game has potential and sure it will become better over the coming weeks/months but I can already tell this one is for the bargain bin and it's player count is gunna take a hit I've already refunded it myself.It's got alot to work on if it wants my hard earned money.But honestly if you like the idea I recommend it and suggest atleast giving it a try.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-03,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Although it is an online only game it is personally one of my favourites. It has a mixture of intensity strategy and excitement.You can either play as a hunter which hunts 4 survivors or be one of the 4 who are hunted.Your objective as a survivor is to escape through one of two main gates which must be powered by a certain amount of generators.You have to repair these generators without being cought. Oh did I forget to mention that if you get cought by the hunter you can be hung by him if you cant wiggle out of his grasp.Your team can either save you or continue with repairing the generators. If you happen to be last alive by deaths of your team or by them escaping you can escape through a secret hatch if you manage to find it.The game has a very good upgrade system with which you can unlock items to be used in games as well as perks.I am yet to find different clothing for characters which may come through an update later in the game.This game does have a few bugs which do affect the game a little but the good qualities outweigh the bad.

If they added voice chat this game would honestly be perfect for someone who loves to horror games. Some times of night it takes a while to join a game so the servers might be having trouble keeping up but the game has never crashed on me and some times like 1 out of 30 games I woulld say have been laggy some times not a problem but one time my character was moving the killer was like 20 feet away and then I jumped through a window and got downed when he had to have been like 15 feet away but besides the rare glitch or lag this game is perfect like really 9.5 outta 10 if they add voice chat without it like 9.0 outta 10! Hope this helps anyone deciding on buying this game the devs have been releasing patches which is nice to see that they want their game to do well!,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-03,0,0,76,False,Recommended,Only two problems with the game. The loading screen leaves no indication to when the game is going to be starting. (There are 5 marks have each one load relative to their players by representation?) The injured and struggling moans are awkward repetitive and annoying on their own. I understand they kinda need to stand out and the ones that are there are ok but in their sequence and with such few samples it starts to sound like someone defecating. The gameplay itself is 9/10 with the only problem being that it's obvious when a killer has a higher level than you when he can sniff out your location in a well hidden spot in under 20 seconds. Balance the match making please.,Dead by Daylight

Steam is saying COOP when i can not even go coop.I get failed to join a game very often which is annoying. But what bothers me the most is that the game is saying you can play COOP but that isnt even possible.Another point is that I sometimes finaly join a game but it send you back to the homepage so you can find another game.

Unlike some people who saw the game in the F2P Weekend I actually have a review based on gameplay unlike the ones who only played less than 10 hrs. Many of these reviews are negative because of the matchmaking glitch from F2P players who didn't know how the matchmaking was before 1.1.0. I still very well recommend this game even though it had a bad blunder. It only lasted a day so it was alright. Patience is Virtue. If you actually visit any of the dev's Livestreams you'll know they actually listen to people and are cool dudes. That is all________________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEWDead by Daylight (unless you have the Full Moon offering then it's already Daylight). This game is a great game. Of course it's rough around the edges (Bugs Glitches Unbalanced at times) but it's not common like people are saying. In fact most people who write negative reviews are usually ones who are salty from the last game they played (not to be biased or anything). I have actually seen someone in the reviews who is so salty on his FIRST MATCH that he returned the game and his girlfriend's too. At least I get enough salt for my steak lunch.This game is a asymmetrical 4v1 horror game where 4 unfortunate people are stuck in a creepy place with a killer. The killer's goal is to toy with and sacrafice the survivors to the Entity.Pros Releases your inner Stratigest Gives you that Adreniline rush when you are being chased or are chasing someone Breaks open your inner maniac Introduces you to the world's best jukes The nervousness of the beating heart A great horror themed sountrack that will keep you on your toes.Cons (Only a miniscule amount are gamebreaking) Weird ""Fail to Join Game Popups"" (Just retry) Hop spots (Leave that survivor alone for a while or utilize the nerf BE did) Survive with Friends is buggy and it is hard to join games (No fix yet) Special spots in the map where the Survivors get stuck (Avoid the bases of hills or going under a rock) Other small but not gamebreaking bugsI would give this an 8/10",Dead by Daylight

The game itself is actually very nice it's built 4 vs 1. 4 Humans against a ""let's say monster"" its difficult to escape but it is also difficult to get all 4 survivors dead. You have to be smart trick the monster and hide in lockers and stuff. The objective of the humans is to activate the engines so the escape routes open and you can run away. The objective of the monster is to kill the humans it has advantages because it can see the engines where the humans have to go. Obviously the humans can help each other with healing and repairing engines and they can block the way behind them when they put wooden obstacles on the ground.THE GAME IS SICK I LOVE IT BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU SEARCH SO LONG TO EVEN FIND A MULTIPLAYER GAME!!!

2018-09-19,0,0,12,False,Recommended,I found this game extremely fun. Absolutely loved both aspects of it. As a survivor it feels like a legit horror experience that can spook you pretty easily and as the killer its a fun game of cat and mouse. While the licensed killers are a little lack luster or tough to play I do like the inclusion of some of the big horror names. Too bad Jason got his own game wouldve loved to play him here. Overall I gotta give it props for pulling off something I was skeptical would be good. If your catching this review during the free week definitely pop in and give it a try. Dont worry about system specs I had my concerns as well but theres tons of guides out there to make it run on systems.TL DR Fun game both roles are great in their own way.

2016-07-06,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Please for the love of god devs fix vaulting and the whole online matches right now since more people are higher levels it's practically impossible as a killer to win when you get paired with high leveled survivors. They all abuse the vaulting system and pallets and it is entirely unfair to a more lower ranked killer. To me and several others it's basically making the game unplayable online. The survivors are supposed to be the ones that are at a major disadvantage but once they get to a higher level and have all those perks survivors have a massive advantage over the killer. Please fix this. I love the game but in it's current state online as a killer is broken.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-02,0,0,193,False,Recommended,Very Good Fun But Beware (see cons at bottom) ***Update on Points and Ranking System***The game needs a lot more thought and attention. It's perfectly possible to sacrifice every single survivor in a match and not earn enough points even to maintain your current rank. It's ridiculous!Dead by Daylight (DBD) is a brilliantly fun and engrossing multiplayer game that thrusts you into a true heart pounding killer versus survivors horror experience.You can choose to play either as one of three distinctive killers (each with their own special ability/skill/item) or as one of the four human victims whose sole job it is to escape the arena in which one of these killers is hunting them relentlessly. As a survivor part of the beauty of the game is not knowing which of the three killers the opposing player has chosen until you come into close proximity of him for the first time during the match.The killer wins the match by murdering at least one of the victims (killing all four gives an even better victory and yields a lot more points to be spent in upgrading the character) and a survivor wins a match by escaping the nightmarish human sacrifice game into which they ve been thrust.To escape the team of four survivors must reactivate 5 of the broken down generators littered throughout the map to supply the power to open the sealed exit to freedom. To be successful the killer needs to do everything possible to prevent this from happening.A unique aspect of the game is that you play the killer from a first person perspective with a relatively narrow field of view (this cannot be adjusted from the options menu much to the annoyance and discomfort of some players). Conversely you play one of the survivors from a third person perspective. This can be quite disorientating at first but you ll soon get used to the shifting perspectives as you change between playing the hunter and the hunted. The idea of this is to give the survivors an observational advantage to evade the killer stealthily and to limit the killer s ability to locate them. Careful observation is key for success in finding or in not being found. Seeing as stealth and evasion are the survivors only means of defence the killer would be completely overpowered without this somewhat controversial handicap.To compensate for the murderer's restricted vision the character has heightened hearing that visually indicates the origin of noises on screen. Did a survivor just fail to repair a generator successfully? Then the killer will be able to pinpoint the position of the resulting electrical explosion from anywhere else on the map. Woe betide any survivor who remains in that area trying to fix the generator anew. The cat and mouse style of game play can be so tense under these life and death circumstances that it s bound to raise anyone s heart rate while providing a fun and satisfying experience.One of my biggest gripes with DBD is that there s no reward for being a stealthy survivor who eludes the killer even if you are eventually caught and sacrificed. I ve been the last remaining survivor in quite a number of matches and have had to spend a lot of time carefully sneaking around the map avoiding detection and completing the survival objectives. Over 20 very patient minutes later I m eventually caught and killed. But then and this is the truly galling part I ve got absolutely nothing to show for all the hard work effort and skill.My biggest issue with the game is that on occasions killers will spawn far too close to one of more of the survivors. Because of this you can be found and killed very quickly even if you re hiding behind good cover you haven t done anything to attract the killer s attention and you re nowhere near any one of the generators (at the start of a match a good killer will make a beeline for the nearest generators). PROS + Very engaging game play that rewards good teamwork.+ Excellent chilly and foreboding environments that add good depth to the atmosphere.+ Great sound assets and music that add to the suspense and the horror.+ It s great fun to play as both a survivor and a killer.+ Each killer has their unique flavour which affects the play style that adds lots of re playability value if you enjoy being the murderer.+ The more you achieve in a match (killing survivors activating motors escaping the map etc.) the more points you earn and the closer you come to unlocking and being able to use good upgrades. The upgrades with which you re presented are procedurally generated.+ An immensely satisfying experience when you finally escape the clutches of the lurking evil or when you sacrifice all the souls of the condemned. CONS YOUT WILL GET STUCK ON INVISIBLE BARRIERS AND THEN BE SEEN AND CAUGHT BY THE KILLER. The game is unbalanced because survivors can keep cheesing it through windows and the killer will never be able to catch them. Relatively basic graphics. Especially certain player animations. Game play bugs that include temporary invisible barriers and survivors getting stuck on rocks and trees when crouching to hide behind them from the killer. Also buttons don t always trigger their intended actions quite often you ll need to press ctrl a couple of time before you character actually crouches. Unless you have amazing team mates then the matches seem to be balanced in favour of the killer. Connectivity issues. You ll be disconnected quite often when trying to join a lobby. Even if you join successfully everyone may be disconnected before the game play itself begins. The ranking and points system. It truly is difficult to gain enough points to maintain your current rank let alone to earn enough to progress up to a higher rank. Additionally it s all too easy to lose enough points to be demoted to a lower tier. Two examples as a killer if you do everything perfectly you only just gain enough points to progress. As a survivor you need to do a vast amount of work not to be shunted down to a lower level. As with any other online multiplayer game the quality of the players heavily determines the quality of your game play experience. If you re a survivor who s put into a match with people who have no idea what to do or who just act like idiots then your chance of survival drops dramatically. If you re a skilled player who manages to evade the killer s sights for long enough you ll still be left with a heck of a lot of work to do that almost guarantees your death as well. Players continually jump servers and end up wasting your time while you re waiting for a match to begin. No indication of ping when you ve joined a lobby so you could end up in a match with terrible lag and ridiculous rubber banding. You can leave but the game will penalise you for quitting it will effectively count your leaving as a defeat when it comes to scoring and ranking. What We Need A reward system for stealthy survivors. Bugs fixing. Especially invisible barriers and issues that cause you to get stuck on rocks and trees. Some system that prevents the killer from catching you within the first 20 seconds of a match! Who wants to wait over 10 minutes to play a game that lasts a mere fraction of that time?Killers need to spawn a reasonable distance away from the survivor spawn points.In conclusion Dead by Daylight is an immensely fun and surprisingly immersive multiplayer game to play. No other game has had my heart pounding and racing quite like this one has. However due to its current bugs and somewhat rough presentation it does feel like an early access title at times.As always I ll be updating this review when relevant and feel free to leave me questions below.Until then my killer looks forward to sacrificing you to the demonic overlord...,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-24,0,0,402,False,Recommended,"Now Lets talk about Dead By Daylight and what have I thought about this game. I have played it long enough to finnaly make a ""Review"" on this game. Lets get into the basics. This game is a survival game where there 4 survivors and 1 killer the survivors must fix 5 generators and find the exit gate and escape. Each game you earn ""Blood Points"" You use these Blood Points to spend on the ""Blood Web"" (Level up system) Where you find perks to help you survive your matches. Each survivor has 3 main perks. 1st perk is level 30 2nd perk is level 35 3rd perk level 40. They are mostly OP and you can only get them on the survivor your playing based on what perks they have. The only way to share perks is by getting it in the blood web at level 30 35 40. Now what do I think of survivors? I think there really balanced because of the way you play. Do you want to play defensive do you wanna be the guy trolling the killer so the other survivors can get the gens done. Its about your play style and thats what I think of survivors. The killer is the person who stops the game each with differnt bio's explaining why they are here to kill survivors. There are a bunch of ways to stop survivors from getting out. 1. The killer can obviously slap the survivors two times and put them on a hook (To kill survivor you must hook them 3 times or wait them out as there blood meter will go down) 2. Kick the gens to make sure they can't open the gates which gives you time to go hook some survivors 3. Just bait them out and kill them one by one. Each killers like survivors have 3 main perks depending on which person you play. These help you in matches to killer survivors.(Btw survivors can get the hatch if theres only one survivor left and they have done one gen) Over all this game is one heck of a funtime to play with your freinds.

For example me and my friends had to patch the game 3 4 times patches that were roughly 134mb always the same size. Another example would be the lag due to the host (whoever that might be) because from all the reviews i read and what me and my friends noticed it is definately hosted by a player which causes huge lag issues and snapping to weird places.,Dead by Daylight

Never getting it though not until they had a free weekend. Ended up putting it off till late and finally playing it. HOLY HUMAN FECEES! This game is awesome! Even with knowing what to do and how to play it was just amazing. I felt terriffed of the killers and yelling my off when they were chasing me. My first two games were as survivor's and I survived both times. First was a killer whom only hit someone once. The next game we got slaughtered when just myself and one other teammate were left and I was ""distracting"" the killer by trying to not die. They managed to get the final generator up and open a door when well. I lead the killer to them and got them killed. My bad. My next game was as the killer were even though they were experienced. I managed to kill all of them getting a really awesome feel for being both prey and hunter. Next game I went back to being a survivor and ended up dying being sacraficed to Spider Jesus. Honestly this game is awesome and I recommend in full I'm buying it on sale but still. Damn awesome game. P.S. Play in the dark makes it so much more terrifying .",Dead by Daylight
2018-09-23,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Overall the game have some unique gameplay and enjoyable hide &amp seek version but this time it's more horror and intense gaming than you expect with some good soundtrack. However the game is unstably dying time by time I highly recommend you don't play this game alone because of how bad the community can be while you find your solo queue since this game should be played for fun and entertaining with friend or better yet with your friends. The game should not considered to be played seriously but enjoyable that will brings happiness laughing and shouting towards your computer screen and your friends.

2018-09-12,0,0,724,False,Recommended,I highly recommend this game since its a lot of fun. Although i want to propose something to make this game even better..I'm sick and tired of dc's from killers. I mean survivors dc'ing is punishable with 2 pips ( if i remember correctly) and award the killer with some blood points for his lost time. But if the killer dc's the survivors get nothing and they also lose their offerings. I just had a streak of games where the killer instantly dc'ed (or after 30 secs in game) just because me and my friends put bloody party streamers and envelopes. And that awarded me with 5000 points and lost my offerings. What i would propose is to give survivors their offerings back in case of killer dc in a logical amount of time (like if the killer dc's in the first 2 mins of the game) and the opposite like giving killer his offering back if 2+ survivors dc. Thanks for your time and im sorry for saying all that in the game review. (i just didnt know where else to express my opinion). Again great game keep up the good work!,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-25,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Had tried this game over free weekend's in the past and just couldn't get into it. That was before it became available on PlayStation Plus and I've played it for a few hours every day since...nothing gets my heart racing like it. Completely hooked (don't excuse the pun) and I've only dedicated my time to a few survivors so far mainly focusing on one which is now near level 50. Haven't even started playing as a killer yet so I reckon I'll be enjoying this for some time to come. Thought I'd try out the PC version during free week it runs nice and feels alot smoother during skilll check's/whilst trying to escape killer but can take some time to find a full lobby. On PS it's almost instant at any time of day or night. My only other problem with this game is some killers are super OP especially in indoor tight levels. It's forgiveable though as this is one of those games that is near impossible to make fair for everyone all the time. So good when you get survivors all working together and I'm almost always saved from the hook on both platforms.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-23,0,0,40,False,Recommended,a short story what a match... the killer was the hillbilly. not a great player actually but had his skill moments. we outran him most of the time and it was very fun. however the phases went smoothly I repaired 4 out of 5 generators and then in the escape phase when both of the exit doors where open the killer was able to down one survivor and hook em up. i saw the other 2 guys just running out the exit and leaving him behind. I couldn't leave him behind like that so I decided to go for quick save. I was able to sneak to the guy quietly even if the killer was staying close and looking for the last guy. I successfully avoided him in a small corner right next to the hook but looked back and saw me. I was unhooking the guy the as he slashed me in the face with his weapon and downed me. you know what the other guy did? he ran out to the exit... xD 10/10 would sacrifice my A$$ again.ps what a jerk P,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-06,0,0,710,False,Not Recommended,This game has a fantastic basis for an idea of a game but the way that it is actually handled and run makes it seem like a beta instead of a game that has been out for multiple years. Survivors are hard to play as solo while the killer perspective is somehow worse. It's incredibly easy to be stunned and looped in a chase while survivors pop off generators every 5 seconds. The actual in game is terrible as well as I've come across a few speed hackers (some whoe don't bother to hide their name publicly revealing their Youtube channel which has tutorials of how to get these hacks).,Dead by Daylight
2018-08-19,0,0,134,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a 4 v 1 online survival horror game. 4 survivors face off against 1 killer as they try to power generators and escape before the killer sacrifices them on hooks for the entity. The entity is a overseeing power that is the realm that the suvivors and killers find themselves in. The game is not for everyone. If you are not a fan of horror games dont turn away just yet. I dont like the sterotypical horror game but this game has a certain twist to it that makes me want to play more. If you dont like to be scared try playing killer as its completely different than survivor. You get a first person view and you get to cause thrill and fear. Its overwhelming at first but as you learn how to play it gets more and more fun. I prefer survivor as I like the ""never feeling comfortable always checking behind me for a killer"" gameplay. I play as two survivors. Kate Denson and Feng Min. Kate Denson has completly different perks than Feng Min since Kate is built for distracting and evading the killer while Feng is built for fixing generators and not getting caught by killers. I like the mix of these two since when playing only one survivor the game will get stale very quickly.There are multiple DLC's for this game. None are required to have the full experience but you do unlock new killers and survivors. The survivors come with 3 unique perks but you dont have to buy the DLC to unlock the perks because you could get lucky. The ""Shrine Of Secrets"" is a new way to unlock perks without having to use bloodpoints to make your survivor/killer have that certain perk. There is no way to tell when you will get that perk but randomly in the bloodweb it will pop up.In closing I would take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. Most are just survivor mains that are complaining about an old patch of the game where killers were heavly overpowered. This is now fixed and the game is pretty balanced. Goodluck to you survivors and I hope the Entity treats you well.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-18,0,0,188,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight has it's flaws but it is a new game so with that in mind lets just avoid the topic of whats wrong with it. It is a procedurealy generated 4 vs 1 horror genre game. It pits 4 survivors with 1 killer chasing them through a map. The survivors must power generators and activate an escape door to win the killer only needs to slash and hook survivors and sacrifice them to the entity. The game will make your heart race and you can get a sense of dread when a killer is chasing you overall the game is a lot of fun. The devs give us weekly info on updates and changes coming via twitch and the moderators of the forums are very helpful to players. (Like I said I am avoiding bugs since they are being looked at all the time.),Dead by Daylight

I love being the killer and stalking the survivors. Hearing the whimpers when they are injured...god it's so much fun. Now is the game perfect? No far from it. The learning curve is steep especially for the killer...did not know what the scratches were all over until I watched a few people play it (mostly Ryan from AH). This game is awesome to play with friends. Have them freak the out and run from you is satisfying...especially when you have Teamspeak on and they are screaming at you to leave them alone while having that scared/crying scream going on.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,1146,False,Recommended,"Edited Version Go to the bottom if you wish to see why I now like this if you wish to see why I disliked the game at the time then continue readingTheres a few reasons why I say no to this game 1. Matchmaking sucks2. Last Breath made the game unbalanced and matchmaking worse3. Crashes4. Unfairity every game you play5. The game itselfYes yes I know some might say ""Well I don't think you should worry about those things its a fun game"" well I won't lie this game is really REALLY fun but the devs make this game like if they had a dog locked in a cage and gave him 1 tiny piece of meat every 2 weeks and I'm not saying the devs are bad or anything but seriously they don't fix any bugs or glitches now let me move on to the reasons and why I put them there.1. Matchmaking sucks So you just bought the game you start with your favorite character (I.E. Jake) and you play a match for the first time only to be found that it takes about 30 minutes to find an actually good match but when you play the killer is rank 10 or higher and you can't get for points (Have fun grinding)2.Last Breath made the game unbalanced and matchmaking worse Yes the idea was great at first and a new killer and survivor are cool but Last Breath just makes the game so much worse the Nurse is OP to all hell and believe me I killed 2 people as her while LAGGING thats right LAGGING (how much more OP can you get?) the perks in Last Breath for the Nurse are also way too OP Nurse's Calling is basically Deerstalker but 5x more OP because you can see if they're being healed and then getting into a match takes twice as long also Nea she's good she's balanced3. Crashes Now believe me when I say crashes do actually happen but do you want to know the worst part? You lose everything you ever gained during that match that crashed you basically died and got no points so if you brought that key so you could escape through the hatch with your friends and then crash say buh bye to that key and your 3 pips you just gained for rank 184. Unfairity every game you play Now when I say 'Unfairity' I mean it whenever you get into a match your either paired with a bunch of low ranked noob survivors and a rank 1 killer/high leveled killer or your a rank 20 killer at level 1 and you go against a Survive with Friends team of 4 rank 1 and you can't even get 1 point and do you think the devs care about that? No not really if they fix it soon then yes I will think they care5. The game itself The entirity of this game is just complete cancer right now as you either wait in the main menu for 5 hours waiting to get one good game where your killer is lagging hacking higher ranked then you or is a way higher level than you and you can't do jack about it it also happens vise versa as a killer you go against high ranked or high leveled surviors or that very rare time where you find a little hacking survivor and can't do about it because you don't have the level to deal with themOverall Just don't buy the game right now I'd suggest waiting until this game is either bug free or is made F2P because everyone leaves because they bought a game thats fun very few times but is buggy as all I mean you can buy it but I suggest doing a private match because those are more fun than any other thing Dead by Daylight tries to scam you into this game should still be considered Early Access and not a fully released game if you want a game like this that doesn't suck try getting Dead Realm or something besides this buggy worthless yet kind of fun gameEdit Review With all the DLC and bug/ glitch fixes that have gone through as well as the nerfs to perks and killers/survivors the game is much more worth the money you spend for DLCs and the game itself the creators have gone a long way from the beginning DLC to now and is definitely worth it",Dead by Daylight

2017-09-14,0,0,63,False,Recommended,The game is fun and all especially if you're playing with your friends. When i first bought the game i was very impressed by the gameplay and how it spiced up a simple game of hide and seek. But after many hours of gameplay i started seeing the serious problems the game has. I will list down the main pros and cons from my experience. *Note that this is from my point of view. It is fine if you the person reading this has a completely different opinion i respect that.Pros Varieties So many different types of killers with different playstyles! I like how this forces the players to change their playstyles. E.g. when facing a trapper be more wary and walk slowly. Perks and Items It is great that players are given boosts to enhance and adjust their gameplay experience! It spices up the game based on the types of offerings each game types of items as well as the perks set before each match.Atmosphere The atmosphere each game always makes me feel uneasy. That i feel is one of the best feature of the game well designed maps with good elements (dust and ruins) and colour scheme (dull and dirty).Cons Game connections Making the killers the host of each public game is absolutely ridiculous. I don't understand the logic of relying on a player's internet connection instead of a proper dedicated server (correct me if i'm wrong). One moment we have a smooth game. The other we get the other side of the coin a person with a toaster for a router. I've had experiences where the killer is from a village in Thailand with horrible connection i know that i can't blame the person for having bad internet connections. Not everybody is priviledged enough to get good enough internet everybody deserves to have fun. From what i've read there are plenty of people posting feedback about this same problem.Campers I would suggest having the developers implement more objectives the killers should focus on. As of now the game is filled with killers whom are fine with letting go of a few survivors just to get a secured kill on the hook. What is the point of being a killer without the desire to hunt for more blood? I feel that this is where the motivation for the killers are lacking. Perhaps an introduction of a new feature who knows? The point is to make the survivor fear the killer not because of them camping but give them a reason to fear the killer and give the killer POWER to intimidate the survivors.Collision Issues There are a lot of objects in the game with extremely weird collision. There are gaps especially the rocks in some maps where it seems big enough for the survivor to fit through but turns out not. This caused many of me and friends' deaths. Closing Statement I consider this game my love at first sight for Horror Games. The simplicity of the gameplay and concept always intrigues me. I am sure others that enjoy the game sees the same charms of the game as i do. Though the game isn't perfect more can be done to further expand the potential of the game. This is definitely a great game for you and your friends! But just be sure that your friend who is hosting the match has good internet connection.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-01,0,0,267,False,Not Recommended,"I'm re writing this review because I now have more experience with the survivor side and I got some insight to their support.A thing to note is that I've been playing this game for about 2 weeks but I've watched a lot of people play it so I did have a lot of insight of what to do and what not to do.To begin with when I started off the game was incredibly exciting. The tension was unreal and my heart rate raced when the killer was around or I was juking them or the exit gate became powered vice versa for the killer. The tension still remains but it's not on the same level.The game looks very good. Overall the quality is high and the dark gloomy scenery really adds.Going into the gameplay I'll start off with killer. When I started from rank 20 the killer felt incredibly powerful running no significant perks. I rarely ""lost"" games (1 or no sacrifice) and the survivors were pretty upset in the chat afterwards. Once I reached higher ranks it became significantly more difficult to ""win"" so I thought I simply encountered more experienced players and that I need to git gud. When I hit rank 10 I begin to see the ""meta"" which are perks that are considered very strong and almost all survivors ran similar perks. At rank 5 I felt I needed to get some insight to the survivor side so I switched.Starting off as a survivor from 0 is horrible. First off you have no way of healing yourself when damaged and survivors at rank 15+ usually aren't that cooperative and altruistic because there are no perks to really support it. Survivors are heavily reliant on perks. Both on the survival side and altruism side. Risky saves are very rare at rank 20 but when I was playing killer at rank 10+ they used things like ""iron will"" (undetectable moaning) ""sprint burst""/""lithe"" ""we'll make it"" (allowing them to heal a hooked survivor in a matter of seconds) borrowed time (allows for suicide saves) and you always saw the same perks match after match after match.Couple this with the fact that the balancing of matchmaking is non existent. The game features seasons in which ranks are reset with everyone going back to rank 20 15. You're new to the game? Here's a prestige 3 killer fully perked with a skill gap that is larger than the Grand Canyon facing four completely new survivors that got the game on Humble Bundle and have absolutely nothing. Not exactly the best way to introduce new survivors and the same applies for killers.Looking back at its history things are constantly being tweaked because they're imbalanced. This has been repeatedly going on ever since the release of the game and there has always been something that is incredibly overpowered.Network wise it's peer to peer and the killer is always the host. I've only experienced two games where there have been survivors so laggy that it is unplayable. The two in question were from China. On a side note I am unsure if it is a delay thing but you can slam a pallet in the killer's face and still get hit from their lunge. This happened for me a lot both as a killer and survivor.Then we have bugs. This game has A LOT of them. There is one bug so bad that it completely wipes away all your progress your rank your progress on characters teachable perks literally everything and it did happen to me only 4 days after getting the game putting a lot of effort in it. I was told to contact the support to receive compensation with what you use to level up so I could start off where I left. It has been 8 days since I sent the mail and not word after the automatic response. After chatting with some people on the official Discord server some people had waited over three weeks sent several mails and still not heard anything. According to the admins the studio was backlogged with work but that would indicate that their employees cannot keep up which is unacceptable.Lastly this game is an absurdly colossal grind. This is how much time you need to spend on this game Blood points required level 1 50 1 626 000Blood points per level after 50 43 000Amount of survivor perks incl. teachables 44 (3 ranks so 132 142 bloodwebs first 10 levels not guaranteed to offer a perk)Amount of killer perks incl. teachables 36 (3 ranks so 108 118 bloodwebs)Average time of a game 10 20 minutesAverage points per game 10 000 15 0001.

Level 50 Prestige 3 all perks on Prestige 3 ( (1 626 000 x 4) + (43 000 x (137 50) ) ) x 10 102 450 000 blood points (2 049 hours)2. Killers2.1.

Level 50 Prestige 3 all perks on Prestige 3 ( (1 626 000 x 4) + (43 000 x (113 50) ) ) x 8 73 704 000 blood points (1 474 hours)Time based on 12 500 points and 15 minutes per game.To complete literally everything in the game 3 525 hours or 146.8 days that's 0.5% of the average human's life. In that time you could for example learn three group 1 difficulty languages or make $75 000 (based on median wage in the U.S).This is not accounting for any blood point boosts or double/triple blood point weekends. This is how long it would take with no boosts on average.For all the many reasons I cannot recommend the game in this state. There are too many issues with it. It was really fun at first but got infuriating quickly.",Dead by Daylight

2017-09-14,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. I'm reviewing this on a free weekend not to mention I barely looked into the game properly so please don't flame me.Let's see... starting off the people are quite good and friendly 'most of the time' when you get into a match. They try to save you heal you and you usually feel that you should return the favor. (Unless you're just a selfish person) The killer survivor thing does seem okay on balance. A bit hard to wrap your head around and definately feel the killer is OP if you are not used to the ""Cat Mice"" style game.What I am actually sad about the game is a lack of tutorial. Yes there is all the written parts which is just a gigantic wall of text. Maybe a really basic tutorial game showing as both sides (or 2 different tutorials) and going through the very basics will be very nice.Also... the settings section is very... 'lacking' with the absense of being able to set the screen size set any detailed settings which makes the user (if they are willing or know) search into the system files and edit it themselves to lower the burden on their low end PCs. Honestly it's not a game that even needs to be fancy why.I also ran into a large number of authenticating problems today (9/14/2017) which I guess is one of the backfires of the Free week?

However compared to its first launch its seen some great improvements. Now its something that I can recommend. It still has its moments but its on its way as long they keep listening to the community. Previous issues like the wall hoppers and campers have somewhat been remedied. There are still campers however at higher levels Killers will have to change their game since survivors will gain access to perks and items that will greatly aid them.

2016-12-16,0,0,9,False,Recommended,The Gist of the Killers and SurvivorsDead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game that pits 4 survivors against 1 killer. Currently there are 4 survivor characters in the roster to choose from. There isn t a real difference between these survivors since the Bloodweb (the upgrading system) gives you random perks and item drops per level. For the killers there is the Trapper who specializes in using contraptions like bear traps to catch their human prey. Another killer is a shaman like assassin called the Wraith. The Wraith takes advantage of the darkness and can almost become completely invisible. In its specter mode a translucent distortion in the near vicinity can alert the survivors to the Wraith s presence. This staff wielding predator cannot attack in its Specter mode but if planned well the Wraith can surprise an unsuspecting survivor. Lastly there is the Hillbilly a chainsaw wielding disfigured man who can charge towards any survivors without any reservations with his blood caked chainsaw. The roar of his thirsty unforgiving friend is the only warning a survivor needs to get the hell out of dodge. GameplayFour survivors are trapped in an arena with a killer and their main objective is to simply avoid the killer and escape preferably alive. They re dropped in 1 of the 3 maps currently available. The maps are chosen at random in the start of every game.The Survivors I d like to start with some of the strategies I picked up during my time as a survivor. First things first survivors can attain victory when a certain amount of generators are fixed to power up the gates which are the sought after exits. Exit to what you may ask? To more swamp I guess. Maybe there s a McDonalds on the other side and you can buy the killer a nice little happy meal.A simple heartbeat is an important sound cue for them and listening intently for this can mean life or death. Sprinting can make a survivor s tracks more likely to be seen by the killer so a smart survivor knows never to run unless the popos I mean unless the killer is giving chase. Working with members of the team can turn the tide of the game but if the killer seizes a teammate and hoists them up in their strong shoulders unless someone has a flashlight (this item can temporarily blind a killer) there s not much anyone can do (You can do what I do and go up to the killer and give them a hug because really just share your love. Don t be stingy fool.) You can start your very own rescue operation and bring your fellow survivor down from the meat hook but take heed the killer could still be lingering nearby. If and when you do this feel free to heal them up and be kind a Samaritan.,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-23,0,0,259,False,Not Recommended,"Review is and will be long. Continuous update from newest to oldest.December 16 review The game has been updated and balanced a bit but the devs are once again moving in the wrong direction. The game is heavily balanced towards survivors. I have swapped to playing a survivor and being a fairly poor survivor player I can more often than not outplay the killer easily. Pallet looping infinite looping around structural ""walls"" and looping through windows to palllets and structural ""walls"" allows for a survivor to kite indefinitely.I freely admit that I'm a fairly poor survivor and even I can farm points against killers. SWF lobbies allow you to gang up on a killer to prevent him from hooking downing or killing any survivors.They updated generators so that they all complete once the 5th generator is done but they also decided for whatever reason to put a fire under the stark white skull totems that already stand out against the drab browns greens and grays of the map. Using any hex perk is completely useless at the moment until they fix how totems function whether they hide them better or make them harder to spot overall.The one positive that has happened with the latest update is that bot killers seem to be far fewer though they didn't even mention an EAC update in their patch notes that I saw.November 23rd review Can not recommend this game until the devs do something about the completely unbalanced match making and the hackers who are all rank 1 with ultra rare perks. Most of my time played is from playing with friends due to how ing the multiplayer was at letting you get games. Now I have to deal with this and I have too much time played in private matches to be able to get a refund or I'd refund this trash until it's worth buying on sale in the future.",Dead by Daylight

I've had tons of fun in a short amount of time as both the hunted and hunter. This game also has a very friendly community and in fact I lost so poorly the first time I was the killer one of the survivors friended me and gave me a ton of tips to be a more effective hunter.,Dead by Daylight

I got to paly it for free and I enjoyed being a killer even though it is tough.

2016-12-16,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. It seems like a fun game from what I've experienced in the demo. I've only briefly played it because I've spent the majority of my time trying to find a lobby and load into a game where not everyone disconnects. If it weren't for the bugs this game would have real potential. BUT this game is riddled with bugs and matchmaking. I've yet to play a game where someone didn't disconnect immediately at the beginning of the match. Bugs like that might happen in a game during release week when servers are melting but it shouldn't be happening 6 months after. I would not buy this game but I might consider playing it with some friends if it were free which is terrible for the game. Overall Great concept decent gameplay absolute development.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-16,0,0,103,False,Recommended,I have been tracking the price of Dead by Daylight for a time now. Since some of my friends refuses to buy it. On Norwegian prices it has always been 98 now that it's on a sale it's still 98 wich means they raised the price on the game just before it went on sale.Anyways it's a really good game with a few annoying bugs. The more friends you are the longer time it will take to find a game. If you wanna play with 5 friends you won't get any points to progress wich kinda removes the fun right out of it.This game will make you scream like a little while getting hunted down by a scary killer. It's also really fun to play as a killer you'll get adrealine from torturing your victims. But it's a lonely life and you won't be able to play online with friends.I'll give this game a 9 out of 11.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-16,0,0,522,False,Recommended,This is an awesome horror surival game. In this game you run and hide from the monster and turn on generators to open the exit while the monster hunts you. (another way to escape if you're the only one left is a hatch placed randomly on the ground) It's not super jumpscare y like most horror games. The online mode in this game is very smooth but i like playing with friends better. Because who doesnt like scaring their friends? I don't have the best laptop in the world but on low graphics i usually run about 30 to 40 FPS. I strongly recommend this game. P.S. You can play as freaking michel myers chasing around campers!

The balancing between killers and survivors are a little biased with survivors having a tad too much power but it doesn't deter me from playing as both. Really fun but some survivors are very toxic so you have to be careful about that otherwise a really fun experience.

2018-06-18,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"Nope. I played for the free weekend and played with a bunch of other people that didn't know much either I guess that was the trick to it being an ok game because after I bought it and got into it the whole game changed and the community was horrible. First of all I've seen other reviews say ""its got a horrible community like all online games"" ... lies! League at it's worst was better than this. First game I played I lost all survivors lived and after the game they talked plenty of trash this community is a bunch of entitled children. The game itself is pretty harsh on what it rewards you for doing and the only way you're going to get it done is going to anger these people. These same people are also going to use very cheap tricks (standing in the way so you can't hook for instance is major bs) to ruin your experience while complaining that if they don't you're going to ruin theirs.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-29,0,0,74,False,Recommended,"This game is an unholy buggy piece of and abuse. I want so badly to enjoy this game truely and when the game WORKS correctly and people play in a sane manor this game is amazing I'll be honest. I think its only fair to give credit where credit is due HOWEVER the number of bugs ive found in literally 3 hours of playing this game is remarkable and shameful that the creators patchers or beta testers allowed for this unholy piece of crap to be published before it was ready. Between hunters strictly trolling to half my god damn body poking through a closet it's VERY hard to enjoy. But the thing is I just want to feel a sense of achievement for playing the game and I think I'd be ok. But there is NO PUNISHMENT OR GAIN for you or the survivors if the hunter just camps you. I promise you that if you buy this game that is what 70% of your games will be. You will go down or a teamate then you get put on a hook then you get to sit there and watch as either you get camped and your team tries to rescue you or you get camped and your team finishes 3 without you. Honestly id be fine with the later if i got some kind of reward for being the sacraficial lamb. But instead I get to sit there and struggle to try and punish a camper in the only way i can by forcing him to watch me die as one of the two already stated options unfolds. Then I go into a closet one game and get whacked to death cause I gave the game the benefit of the doubt. ""Im sure its just a glitch for me he wont see me"" SURE ENOUGH HE WHACKS ME AND I GO DOWN! LOOK AT HOW MUCH FUN IM HAVING PLAYING THIS GAME D this truely is one of the laziest attempts at a money grabbing scheme I've ever seen but as i said the worst part IS THAT THE GAME COULD BE SO FUN IF IT WAS ACTUALLY FIXED. I hate half attempts and that is exactly what this game is right now. Half the time when you get downed the game bugs out and doesnt give you the option to be revived or pick yourself up. How this made it through beta is astounding. If youre gonna play with friends I guess I reccomend but otherwise holy christ do not buy this game until a later date. Alot of people are going around saying that people dont deserve to write reviews because of the lack of the amount of time they put in. i played about 20 games in 3 hours but I just cant come to enjoy it. And i think that only furthers the fact by showing how many glitches occured for me within that short time span. But on top of that im thinking about asking for a refund on this game and the less time i have logged the higher the chances ill get accepted. Edit With the recent patch on 6/29 this game has gotten alot better and the community has seemed to get better. Camping has gone down to about 30 40% however some of these results may be due to me playing with higher ranked players due to my ranking up. If I could mark this as a neutral review like ""Eh maybe"" I would however there is no option for that. Read a couple more reviews that are recent and try to see how and when the game gets patch to make a more intelegent decision. These patches are going to bring this game to light of a reccomendation for me because it can only get better and I've gained faith that the devs will do that.Edit #2 Played the game for about 5 hours straight today no real problems but the fact that the wraith (when cloaked) does not cause your heartbeat to rise and therefor you cannot tell if hes right ontop of you. The perk premonition helps with this alot however it feels like the killer that should trigger alternative sensory abilties would be the one that can go invisible. Id be willing to bet that the wraith has the best win rate in the game by (number of wins)/(number of games played) not by number of wins. Regaurdless since unlocking the saboteur perk ive greatly enjoyed destroying hooks to get the harder to achieve skill which is anything having to do with dealing with the killer (cant remember 4 scoring methods) But yes this allows you to get more nodes towards ranking without having to directly stun or deal with the killer. Admitably i had so much fun and was so addicted to the game this morining ill be changing this review to a positive one.",Dead by Daylight

Although Ive clearly been a bit disappointed. It takes the server a long time to load just to get into the game and when Ive played the game it happens to be a bit glicthy. I'm not sure whether its because of my wifi or the wifi of someone that I happen to be playing with like how it does in Call of Duty BO2 Zombies but I can say I dont have a tolerance for that. It's quite annoying that whenever I turn or try to move from a bush to another especially since the killer is around that it glitches up and I either miss the bush and end up far away from it and I almost get caught by the killer. And even when Ive tried joining a lobby it tells me that it cant find one or that I failed to enter one. My internet is perfectly fine Ive checked it more than once and its even one of the fastest. I understand this is a new game and there will be bugs that need to be fixed especailly since there is quite a lot of them but I payed for this game to have fun. Im not having any fun since it glitches and I cant even find a lobby without having to create one myself and becoming the killer even when I want to play as a survivor. If you're thinking of buying this game wait a little bit longer. There's many things that the developers need to fix. And if anyone wants please add me as a friend on steam.

The developers seem to care more about the DLC's than in game bug fixes and updates. Money &gt Fanbase? A lot of people lost their progress suddenly. Including me and my friends! All survivors back to 0 etc!!!EDIT after mailing the developers they gave me back all my blood. They are very fast and willing to help!Suggestion Smoke grenades/ flash bangs for the survivors so we can at least escape or help our friends.

Then you wait for at least 5 10 minutes for everyone else to even press the ing ready button.

2016-07-13,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Product received for free. So much to love about this game but there's still room for improvement. I'm sure the game will be updated as time goes on though. There's a perfect blend of feeling helpless as a survivor and merciless as a killer. Visuals could use a little bit of polish however it's to be expected when it comes to an online PvP game. Character models will always clip through each other and other oddities can happen. The sounds in this game really make the game come alive. I found myself always looking around for the killer while repairing the generators not knowing that you'll hear the heartbeat when the killer is closing in. Definitely would've helped knowing that since there are random QTE skill checks while repairing generators.The game has two setbacks. One is the limited matchmaking options. The only way to invite friends is to host a game and be the killer. I'm sure there will ways to join a game and play as survivors with your friends at some point.And the last part is some people just have no idea what they're doing in game and make the game harder for you. Which that's not on the developers just people being dumb.,Dead by Daylight

Don't get me wrong the game is very fun but the fact that there are known game breaking bugs/glitches running around in this game tell me that the devs don't care much for the game. Recently people have complained about killers being able to see ranks so they heard us out and removed that. The twist was that they removed it for survivors as well which is stupid. Now I have to confirm everytime with my friends if they're in the same game as me. They also haven't thought about putting a queue in when you click ""find match"".

(Note This is an extremely long review)Pros Super Fun To Play Let's you play both sides of the game (Killer Or Survivor) Terrifyingly good (Really Scary). Fun to play with friends. Quick and easy to enjoy. Excellent design on maps. Excellent detail on the killers Has a story which most games like these don't haveCons After a while and many years (If you play for that long) you will probably get bored of the same thing. (In other words they must add a different gamemode to play) (As Said above) Choppy gameplay and loading. (Depending on your computer) Killer constantly camps you giving you no chance to escape or do anything. People leave the lobby just to annoy other players. (Note Probably should disable that option to leave for killer and survivor) (Note This is a new dlc available now as you read this) Added it purely to make the game better yet it needs to focus on more important updates (Which are all said above) Has a story but doesn't have much of a backround to it (Which people need to know otherwise the cutscenes at the beginning when you load up Dead By Daylight are really just cutscenes with no meaning) Needs to have new ways to escape other than repeating the same old thing (Maybe a way to kill the killer by using some form of weaponry It'd be cool to see the killer's status say ""Perished"" or maybe using some form of gear or crafting to climb over the gate? Note Only trying brew ideas around the community not saying this will happen)Well folks it's now 1 36 and I think I shall be heading off either way this has been an extremely fun game but needs to strive for improvement for now I'm leaving this a not recommended game until they mend the proper things that need to be mended I'm not saying you shouldn't get this game I'm saying you shouldn't get it if you don't like experiencing buggy gameplay or just irrotating simple things that just get on your nerves either way it's fun to play scary can play with your friends and most of it's designs (Maps and killers) are well thought out and looks nice when playing which any horror game needs this has been fun to review and I certaintly hope this shall help developers and the community in the near future for this well thought out game Good Luck!UPDATE 29/04/17 Fantastic! The DBD developers has listened to us and fixed lag! The only reason you would most likely have lag now is because of your PC but to the people with good PCs are finally able to play the game on Ultra they've added tons of new content/DLC which gives some backround on the new killers and survivor plus including all the things the abilities do! I'm so happy to see that people can finally play the game with some enjoyment now there is really only one thing left to fix camping seems like it ruins gameplay and not many people should do it and maybe even add more ways to hide so it will decrease chances of camping happening every game.Now there is only one thing left to say before I put this review how it is my brother (talked about above) can't play everytime it loads up it crashes he has tried defragging the PC doing CCleaner and all that stuff I have no clue about we did detect something its something to do with system32 files which we can't delete or change (obviously) if community developers or anyone knows how to fix this please get in contact with me or my brother bye for now D.Brothers profile link http //steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032560245/My profile link http //steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077759514/",Dead by Daylight
2016-11-01,0,0,514,False,Recommended,This game is only interesting at lower level/rank. When you reach higher level/rank no survivor will be scared of the killer at all at that point the horror game turns to a kid chasing game. Survivor taunt the killer keep running around tea bagging the killer window abusing..... there are only a few maps experienced survivors know very well where is the generators are. Only good at a few first hour playing.Update 1.5.0The game is much better now finally no more crash when solo finding match item bugs and game play I think much more balanced so far. I am not sure about map distribution yet but after many positive changes now I give this a recommendation,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-27,0,0,395,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Love the idea of this game. However the execution of it is a bit wanting.I have not put much time into the game yet largely waiting for more of my friends to be around and get on to play with them for a better experience. The community sucks as usual with most online games that require cooperative play. It certainly gets the feel and effects perfectly your adrenaline will be pumping playing this game. A friend gifted me this game. I would not buy it for full price at least in the current state. Even though my review is fairly negative I will still recommend this game. There are a lot of facets to it I have yet to learn and I am sure it will be more fun when I can play with friends and not random kids with temper tantrums. So after putting time into the game and seeing how the development team works I am changing my review to a negative would not recommend. Game has become purely a money grabbing scheme by the devs with zero fixes on existing bugs but continual paid updates that just keep adding more bugs and balance issues. A total disregard for their player base the few changes the devs make blatantly ignore the community's feedback and pleas for fixes and balance. The paid updates have also become pay 2 win by adding massively over powered characters that you can only get if you buy them. The game was solid and fun for about 2 weeks with managable bugs that were not game breaking. It has only gotten worse in the weeks and months following.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-05,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,it would be a great game but many months after the go live the develpers still can't release a patch which fixes the matchmaking issues and this bug is really frustrating f*cks up sometimes the whole experience.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-17,0,0,704,False,Not Recommended,"Played 30 hours. I'm not good at this game but while the first few hours were fun I quickly came to realize that at the lower ranks this game is basically repairman simulator 2K16. It is very possible for 2 3 people to easily win at the lower ranks at the cost of the other 2 simply because the game encourages the killers to camp the hook they put a survivor on (at the lower levels at least). The entire 30 hours of my gameplay were either grab all the generators while other people are being killed or try and save them and end up dying myself because the killer literally stands in a corner watching the hook or runs around in circles around the hook 80% of the time. As a killer its very possible for a survivor to literally jump through windows or slide across boards continually to avoid you. Not only that but unless you're the trapper there is literally nothing you can do if you decide to stop camping a hook if you want to guarantee yourself enough points you basically have to camp the hook otherwise its possible for everyone to escape. The game is also a buggy mess. It's very hard to rank up because sometimes even if the post game lobby shows you gaining rank you can end up losing rank somehow. I was rank 19 got a win with 14k blood points and I thought I would get progress toward the next rank. Turns out I didn't and I went back to rank 20. This happened about 8 hours in and similar problems persisted for the rest of the experience.The game can be laggy as hell sometimes too messing up your skill checks and can make it frustrating. And if you DC during the game you lose rank as well. Most of my review is frustration not only because the ranking system is so broken. If you don't really care about ranking then it will be very easy to overlook most of this review this game probably seems like a game that you can easily enjoy by just having fun with your friends. Unfortunately there is also no group queue and the game probably isn't balaned for group play but it's okay because the devs were streaming while enjoying E3 and promised to work on it in a few weeks.*EDIT*Now that I've played a ton more and hit rank 1 both as killer and survivor without using infinites or bp burrito or self heal as a survivor or camping as a killer I'll add some more.There are 3 types of high ranking survivors legit good ones (10% of them) infinity users (50%) and people like me (selfish who only help after getting enough points) 95% of high ranking survivors got there using sabotage and sprint burst. Pretty much the key to ranking up is either being a cheeser by abusing map design (using infinites) or not being the 1st guy caught.There are different types of killers depending on which one they are regardless of rank since every killer should get to rank 1 eventually unless they have a legitimate mental problem the hard camper who legit face camps you with or without insidious (most likely a hillbilly) the sxyhxy who ""patrols"" around hooked survivors yet always seems to be within 6 seconds of the hook and never breaks sightline or has an obstacle between them and the hooked survivor and of course the guy who never camps but either doesn't care since he's gonna get enough BP anyway (wraith) or knows you're going to run into his trap soon (trapper/me). There's still no good matchmaking system but they've added Survive With Friends which is still super buggy and you'll be lucky to find a game after 10 minutes. Overall they have made the game much better so I'll change the negative review to a positive one but don't expect a great or balanced game.EDITAnother update after the Last Breath. I hit rank 1 as Trapper when the trap shows instantly. Not only does it take a second for traps to appear to survivors to interact with (disarm/sabotage) now you also can't sabotage a trap without disarming it. Not only does this make trapper even more overpowered it also encourages even less team play. Disarm a trap trapper knows where you are you don't disarm traps your teammates run into traps. This is honestly compeltely I would be shocked by these devs but after watching them play I realize they're just s. Stay away from this game stay away from these devs. 2 months and the game is even less balanced than before.EDITMud DLC Update. Have over 500 hours in this game now. They just nerfed hillbilly a killer no one wanted changed and buffed camping trapper again which is a killer everyone wanted nerfed. These devs try hard but they suck so bad at balancing this game.",Dead by Daylight

2017-10-06,0,0,101,False,Recommended,"THIS GAME IS BROKEN ATMThe cannibal is OP with his chainsaw attack (It's almost just an upgrade from the Hillbilly the only thing taken away from you is the fast af sprint but you still get a speedboost) that can kill multiple survivors FOR 3 SECONDS! THAT'S A LONG TIME FOR THIS GAME WHICH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO SAVE A PERSON ON A HOOK. The Trapper Wraith Nurse are good and balanced and the Huntress. Eeeeeh debateable maybe her axes hit box is a tad too big but the DLC killers Cannibal The Shape The Hag and maybe the Doctor are just so OP. Also one of the maps has a place that you can get stuck. and it seems so stupid too you jsut walk in between to a rock and an object and you kinda just like plop into it and then you cant get out.WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR BALANCECannibal needs a nerf to its chainsaw time or the speedboost needs to be removed or nerfed. For the Shape you shouldn't be able to store the meter and it's not STALKING because if a survivor is watching back at The Shape about 10 meters away it's just watching not stalking. He needs to either not be able to store the meter or he needs to be doing ACTUAL stalking which means looking at the survivors while they are not aware of you. The hags teleportation range to the traps is way too far and she can place too many of them. I think something like 7 would be better. AND NO! YOU CANNOT GO AND TELL ME THAT I NEED A FLASHLIGHT TO DESTROY THE TRAPS! YOU CANNOT GO AND SAY ""oh you don't have a flashlight? well too bad The Hag is your killer today."" AND HAVE AN ITEM BE THE COUNTER FOR ITS TRAPS THAT I'M MOST LIKELY NOT GOING TO HAVE! you should be able to AT THE VERY LEAST COVER THE DARN TRIANGLE WITH SOME MUD OR COVER IT SOMEHOW! The doctor is some what debateable too. I mean are you serious? Madness I starts from the verymoment you are even near him? And I think you should be able to snap out of it on Madness II already because in madness III it's too late already.WHAT MADE THE ORIGINAL KILLERS SO GOODThey always had a tradeoff or a counter. The Trapper used traps that he had only 5 of in the entire map and 1 in his hand. So what could you do to counter it. Either snap the traps so they are disabled until the killer arms them again or you could sabotage them so they were rendered useless and they are so well littered around the map so it's hard for the survivors to find them at all. The wraith has a cloack and can't attack or interact while he is in it but you could still see the cloacks shimmer and if he was nearby even hear him. Not just that but you could shine the flashlight anywhere on his body and that would stun him. So even if you didn't have the flashlight it was still nice and balanced. The Nurse GETS STUNNED WHEN SHE TELEPORTS 2 times. Wait... 2 TIMES! So apparently they buffed her because before she could only teleport once and that was enough to stun her. But she can chain 3 teleports so why? They made her easier to play and therefore more powerful. On the original Nurse the survivors were baking on the mistakes or predicting the killers teleports but now it's only true on longer range. 1 wall between you and her? You are done. She was just fine before. Hillbilly is ok maybe he can move too fast while holding his chainsaw charge but he's fine otherwise. And his counter are walls and trees and other objects because if he hits them he has to recover which wastes time. Which means you can play against him by staying in ruins and other structures and in thick forests.REALLY?AND FINALLY PERKS THAT CAN LET YOU SEE THROUGH WALLS? I can take the perk that lets you see the survivors in dying state BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE HEALING IN A CERTAIN RANGE OF YOU IS NOT GOOD! ITS LIKE THE SURVIVORS DONT EVEN HAVE A CHANCE ANYMORE THERES NO ESCAPE! IF YOU HEAL YOU ARE DEAD IF YOU DON'T HEAL YOU ARE DEAD ANYWAYS CAUSE THE KILLER ONLY NEEDS TO HIT YOU ONCE AND YOU ARE DONE THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IF YOU ARE THE LAST ONE ALIVE! *inhale* *exhale* Holy that was a pickle. I could maybe let them slide if they were add ons or offering but as a perk? Never.TO BUY OR NOT TO BUYI would say not right now. The developers are getting money hungry. So they weren't before? NO! When you played the game when it had only 2 or 3 killers. You could enjoy the game very well. And thus you would see what love the developers had for their game. Now I'm not saying that adding DLC killers is a bad thing. They jsut made them too powerful and thus pay2win. The matchmaking sucks too. well kind of. If im rank 18 while a survivor and i get paired with a rank 16 who has all the best perks and they are max level? Whats the point of this? Aren't ranks supposed to show you how good you are at the game when now you look at the scoreboard at the end of the match the dude is ing rank 17 with 4 perks maxed out. It doesn't feel to show your skill level when the killer can just have the best perks and wreck the survivors while the truly low rank survivors don't have jackshit. I still gave my recommendation for it because it is still fun but it has many frustrating moments and it has incredible potential which it was when the game was originally released.Oh and btw. They still haven't fixed the issue with struggling when you are on the hook where it kills you even when you are pressing space or whatever you have binded it to.",Dead by Daylight

You want the relationship to work so you continue even though he's abusive.Jokes aside I ing hate this game. But I love it so. 10/10 would recommend.,Dead by Daylight
2016-10-22,0,0,142,False,Recommended,So far so good. Sometimes the game randomly crashes but so far its only been twice that it had happen. Good jumpscares sometimes especially if it's your first time playing. Its fun to play with your friends around watching. Concept of the game is pretty straightforward as a survivor there are objectives needed to be done while at the same time the monster dudes come after you preventing you from doing so. Overall I'd recommend this game for friends. For the price of the quality of the game i think its well worth the 20$ spent.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-23,0,0,19,False,Recommended,I have played this game quite a bit and all the people that say the game doesn't work makes me wonder if they verified their files because yes one of my friends did have problems but once they verified the files it worked fine. Love the mechanic of the game as they work the way they are supposed to people don't realize that camping is kind of required or it would be too easy for survivors to win. Don't like the self healing? Get the perk that allows you to see where survivors that are healing. There is a counter to every part that feels overpowered which seperates this game from a bunch of other games already. Yes matchmaking is a little annoying but it takes about 10 seconds stop thinking that there will at some point be no problems. Humans are flawed and can't make anything perfect deal with it. This game is amazing and is definitely closer to being perfect than a lot of other games that are considered amazing because you actually have to think.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-20,0,0,114,False,Recommended,Ok so I play this game almost every day and I love it but always when I am the killer ofc It's the map with multiple busses around the map at the generators and a big building i the middle where there's around 8 windows and every survivor is spawning at a generator they really need to fix some of those maps. It's getting really boring when the survivors can just camp outside of a window the whole match. If they could put less windows or something that would be much better. i'm really getting frustrated with all these busses and buildings with a lot of windows. So for people that hate campers shouldn't buy this game but it's fun but very frustrating sometimes when you get so much windows and you don't have a chance to kill anyone. This review may seem to not recommend this game. It's just that I had so say this because I got very frustrated at this and I'm warning people about the game being very frustrating sometimes.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-29,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,Very fun even in the current stage. Can't wait for Group matchmaking instead of only private lobbies. 8/10. I have purchased 2 additonal copies for friends.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-21,0,0,335,False,Recommended,"Bought this game after being reccomended it by a friend. No regrets.Dead by daylight is a game that pits four vunerable teen charaters against one powerful threat whom they must escape from in one of the various procedurally generated maps without being sacrificed on one of the Hooks scattered across the map to the mysterious insect like creature known only as ""The entity"".When you boot up the game for the first time I can pratically confirm you will have encountered one of the games negative spots...The matchmaking. No kidding almost 75 percent of the time you will be forced to quite literally mash the join game button and when you host as killer depending on your luck it can take forever.Once you find yourself in a full lobby you'll be introduced to either your fellow Survivors or victims. If you're on their side don't expect much to show up in the text box other than people testing the ping of the killer...Speaking of which the survivors really don't have much contact. The best they can do is use ""Codes"" through movements and hope others know them. This is one of the main reasons it's better to have one or two friends to play with if you're going to buy this game.In game your goal as survivors is to either boot up 5 of 7 Generators without being killed by the Killer and escape with the doors or fix two wait for everyone other than yourself to die and slip into the maps hidden hatch. You do this as one of 4 survivors each one with their own unique perks and skills.However as killer (Like I've mentioned) you must prevent this and sacrifce/kill as many of the Vunerable Teens as you can before they make their escape. You can do this with one of three killers all with their own unique abilities cons and pros to go with them.Considering the killer requires only a measly two hits to effectively ""Down"" a survivor and become able to hook him you'll mainly want to hide from the killer at all costs. Which is emphasized by the camera perspectives. While our helpless survivors have a third person easy to peer around obstacles and walls which you may be hidden behind the killer has a first person view which considerably makes his hunts more difficult as he checks spot after spot for any sign of survivors that may be lurking nearby.But if the killer feels like it at any time he may simply leave the game granting the other players no bloodpoints (which will be expanded on later). This is simply dissapointing on both the communities and developers behalf considering they added penalties for survivors quitting (But admittedly this was more of a problem. Only really scummy killers quit at the end of the game afterall).Now what you may be asking yourself ""What are those bloodpoints you spoke of?""Well allow me to elaborate. Each charater (Whether brutal killer or Fearful teen) has a randomly generated ""Bloodweb"". You advance through each level of the web by collecting all the items in it using the ""Bloodpoints"". The bloodweb supplies perks too which can be used to hone in on or add additional skills to a charater. Unfortunately These perks can be a bit OP which is unfair considering that whilst a killer might have about 4 brilliant perks and be at max level a new player might not have any to counter this leaving them even more helpless than before.Speaking of unfair The survivors have a few tricks up their sleeves. For example they're far far more agile than the killer. Not in raw speed but they can vault windows topple obstacles and more to stop the killer in his tracks as they fdash into the distance. There is one trick some call ""Infinite dukes"". These ""Infinite dukes"" Do what they say on the cover. They make the survivor almost impossible to catch. And these are littered about the game which may cause you to rip out even more hair than you did while trying to get into a game if you play the killer.So as this review is already streching itself thin...I'll just finish it here. This game whilst it could do with a few patches here and there and a bit of polish is overall a good buy. Maybe not 15 pounds but 11 is good for it. Maybe grab it on sale if you're not too eager about picking it up.",Dead by Daylight

2017-09-27,0,0,834,False,Recommended,"Dead By Daylight is by no means a perfect game but regardless I still enjoy it enough to come back to it when major content patches come up and always enjoy it.The game has been around for 2 years as of writing this and my experiences playing overall are enjoyable. Sure you have campers trolls and just generally toxic people trying to purposely ruin the experience for others but that's never the majority of any game's fanbase. I find a lot of my teammates to be perfectly reasonable a majority of the time maybe not the best or the most altruistic but they're not trying to purposely ruin my experience they just want to play and win like I do and maybe for them being less risky is the way to do that.Saying that it doesn't mean it doesn't get frustrating after being left on the hook to die for 3 games in a row after being found within a minute into the game. That's why playing with friends is a lot more enjoyable for people when playing survivor though the same can't be said when you're playing killer going against a team of 4 coordinated people. Having friends sharing information 24/7 and being able to avoid you like you don't even exist is also extremely frustrating. Despite all of this though I still enjoy the game a lot when playing alone and even more so when with friends. I'm probably with a minority on this but despite the hours I've poured into this game and devotion I have to come back whenever something major has come I still just think of it as a game something to come to for fun and entertainment. A lot of the reviews I see trashing the game or the devs because of campers or toxic people etc etc make me doubt my love for the game but then I remember that the majority of their reasons don't ruin my experience. The devs for a long time were a small team with restrictions and deadlines to meet by Starbreeze not being able to be open with the community or have enough resources to fix everything the community wanted. Now that they're on their own and have grown their team in the most recent DLC Patch Curtain Call BeHaviour was able to patch a lot of bugs and try to tweak things to make the community happy and themselves too. As much as this is a game for the people it's still a product of Behaviour and they have a vision for the game as much as we do and they do their best to find a happy median for everyone. They want their game to be ""fixed"" and as good as it can be as much as we do but that takes time experience and talent not just money.Just keep in mind this is a game not an E sport or your lively hood. Play the game for fun like you would with other games. Yeah winning is a lot more fun than losing or dying for 5 games in a row but coming at the game with a more light hearted approach to how you play makes it a lot less frustrating and irritating. Then even if you're still getting upset just take a break for a day no point in making yourself upset with something that should make your day more fun. The best way to get the fixes and content we want isn't by yelling at the devs and leaving negative reviews saying the game is broken and there's campers 24/7. Positive reinforcement is a lot more effective than calling out someone's mistakes and problems constantly.TL DR Game isn't perfect but it's just a game. Try to play for fun and take breaks when frustrated. Devs want the game to be good just like we do. I'm recommending this game to the people who aren't easily frustrated by a few bad matches and understand the devs are people and want Dead By Daylight to be an amazing game like we do and understand the way other people play doesn't define that the game is bad just because people play it badly.This is my view and my review of the game your comments trying to sway me to make this more negative or not recommend it won't change your comment may have a point but it doesn't mean I have any less fun playing the game because of it.Numerical Rating 8/10",Dead by Daylight

2018-06-14,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a lot of fun... under the right conditions. If you're playing with a person or 2 or 3 than it can be a blast. But by yourself not all that great. And it can take FOREVER to find a match especially if you're the killer. I tried to be the killer and waited for someone to join my game. I waited 5 minutes before turning on a 40 minute show and checking in occasionally and after the episode I'm still waiting. I mean come on. But if you're the guy trying to escape it only takes a little while to find a game. Usually 2 or 3 minutes. Once in game it's pretty nice. Good graphics good gameplay and overall pretty fun and it gets more and more fun the longer you play. It's really hard to say whether I should give a positive or negative rating. The game itself is fantastic and good to play with at least one friend but the waiting is almost unbearable and it really isn't much fun alone.I honestly wouldn't buy this game for more than $10 maybe $15. I'll give it a 2.5 out of 5 with a positive rating for the sake of Behavior Digital but you guys can decide.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-13,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,Been a while since i reviewed this game and i thought i would redo the review. I do not recommend this game at all.. Seriously dont .. Playing as the killer you will lose EVERY time .. unless your against people too scared to play or just new players to the game. 99% of the time you will be trolled and taunted. The killer is at an extreme disadvantage comapred to the survivors. I got so tired of being trolled in my last game i just stood there and what happened next just made me feel ashamed to be a gamer. The survivors just stood in front of me and just teabagged the air and taunted. The game is heavily unbalanced and just not fun to play.

I admit to using team mates as bait while doing objectives but in the long run thats what works imo.Anyways its a little bumby yet I've encountered people stuck in walls and stuff but its still early access and i cant wait until the final result is up.I recommend this game.

Might want to change that if you haven't already.Good thing about this is though that I only have to make this mistake once.

2018-10-05,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,Intressting game and concept but VERY POOR execution.this pile of garbage game has good times and bad but the bad outnumber them by an insane margin...Way to easy for killers. Way to hard for survivors. THE ONLY time you can expect to win in this game is when you are up against a completely new player or someone who is legitimately mentally handicapped if you expect to win against plyers of your own level this game got it covered for you to make it unfair and turning it in the killers favor.Cons First of all Peer to Peer in a competetive multiplayer game in this day and age? REALLY?? developers seems to be immune to information and dont realize what happend to For Honor....Laggy MM simply because of Peer to Peer you can get matched with ppl from ALL over the world which in this case is horribly bad. (for those who dont know what the Peer to Peer system is i recommend you google it)its not a system we gamers should have to endure IN ANY game let alone in a competetive one.Unbalanced matchmaking and get matched with ppl who are leagues ahead of you both in experiance and perks...perks.... yes perks this sh*t show i have no idea of where to start...Unbalanced fu*king perks the more you play the more perks and perk slots you unlock that might sound good and yes it kinda is exept when you are the one matched with a completely decked out killer or in my case are a new player with absolutely nothing so expect a fun time and by fun i mean you are gonna get killed the first 30 seconds of the game for many games to come.so all in all its a really sh*tty game where the dev s smoked some illegal sh*t when they came up with this ideawhat i cant understand is how ppl can praise this game (youtubers/twitch streamers) and how it can be so popular is beyond me.the devs probably dont care for their game any more but i know they can make it great if they triedif they made it like dota for instance where ALL charcters have a set amount of perks form the start it would be alot more easy to balance.would i Recommend this game? Well thats hard its a nice game AND HAS potential but not in its current state noi really wished steam wouldnt have just a 2 hour playtime for refund it needs to be extended otherwise we get things like this consumers shouldnt pay for devs shiity decisions.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-29,0,0,126,False,Recommended,Friendly killers are actually pretty common (at least for me) They guide you through the match finding generators and chests and once its time to escape they just... stand there. Sad and alone. It makes me want to stay behind and be their sacrifice but they won't hit you. You can point to a hook and run in circles for eternity but they will just stand there maybe an occasional bell will sound a little rev of the chainsaw to tell you to run save yourself. It's sad because in escaping you're leaving them to an existence of solitude. No matter how clean their meat cleaver bonesaw or cattle hammer is they won't dirty it with your blood. Because you've become their friend. And true friends don't hurt friends. 10/10 best game about friendship 2016,Dead by Daylight

Hope to see the improvement of the game itself asap.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-28,0,0,24,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight is a really fun game if you dont care about your ranking.What i find annoying is that you are almost guaranteed a lost in a point of your rank when one survivor or even two at time leave the game.Also it is very annoying when you play killer and the survivors keep jumping thru 2 windows next to each other.YOU CAN NEVER GET TO THE SURVIVOR LIKE TIS Also this game is very hard for survivors due to lack of communication.Correct me if im wrong but there doesnt seem to be a chat or voice communication in this game.hope creators will consider this review and change it.And it would be great if you could have a counter measure for killers as i found many last survivors trying to hide and not fix any generators to escape.I have had multiple games where i have to hunt for the survivor for 20+min which gets really tiresome and boring.I would say if you just want to play this for leisure then get it but otherwise if you are looking for a game that you want to hardcore play for hours and hours everyday i dont really recommend it,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-28,0,0,303,False,Recommended,This review is on DbD.1.01(not a native speaker pls take that into account)I would like to give you some insight about the two edges of the same sword Dead by Daylight is...+++ The TONS of FUNIf you have 4 or more friends to play with this game delivers fun for hours even days. You'll laugh alot and you'll complain alot about your friends leading the killer directly on your trail leaving you hanging from the tip of a hook at the end of the day. At the same time you get kind of happy seeing the killer chasing down one of your friends for it means you can have your time with the generator. You will percieve your own heartbeat as the killer roams your area sometimes just inches away form your characters model without seeing you as long as you don't move. You will curse yourself for running away and give in your position when the killer is heading your way without having you actually spotted at the beginning. This game is a lot of fun if you and your friend can set up some simple rules no hard hook camping no window hopping... the bad part is... those rules are ignored online. Lame online gamplayAll the fun you have with your friends vanishes into the mists of point farming when playing this game online. People are less than seldom interested in helping you from a hook or quit the game as soon as they are hooked themselves sometimes even before they actually hit the ground from the second hit the killer needs to ground them. But who can be mad at them?If you got hooked killer is more than likely staying at your hook and watching you die even though the others will get some generators done in this time because your death equals points for him. Playing this game online is the TRUE HORROR you will experience... For it is ALL about points and keeping items addons and perks on both sides. Conclusion If you have friends to play and skype with this game is a must have and will keep you entertained for quite a while.If you don't have enough friends (...poor little thing you are...) don't by the game unless issues are fixed.Note There are quite some mechanical problems in the game. Namely weird engine behavior and display issues. Mostly they are harmless and can be ignored for the fun having with your friends.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-28,0,0,339,False,Recommended,Amazing experience!If you want to experience how being Jason or the teens feel in Friday the 13th then this game is for you!Both sides are fun to play and offer a different challenge.As a survivor you can feel the tension as the killer is close to you your heartbeat start to race up while hoping that he won't spot you in the grass. The best way to described this feeling is you in Outlast or Alien Isolation.The tricky part is trying to find your teammates and work together.Will you continue to repair the generator at the expense of your teammate life?Do you stay if someone blow a fuse?Do I rush for the exit or I try to help the others so I can net more blood points?Theses are the questions you will have to answer countless time in the gameAs for being the killer the biggest rush is when you do find a Survivor (it's not that easy) and you start giving chase.As a killer you will have to chose between 3 style of play.The Trapper who can be at 2 places at the same time via bear trap.The Wraith who can become invisible.And the Chainsaw guy who... Wield a chainsaw.Expect to rely on sounds and instinct to find your prey.What's really great about this game is the fact that since every characters in a match is played by a human the challenge will be different every time.Will the killer patrol each generator or try to cut pathways.Will he be a good hunter or bad one?Will your teammates try to help or play solo?For the asking price and knowing the support Payday is getting your money is well invested in this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,0,0,786,False,Recommended,This game is not perfect by any means but it can be a lot of fun if you are willing to look past the flaws. Surviving can be a very intense experience although the gameplay itself is a little plain as it is really easy to give your position away to the killer and you have to remember that you are hiding from a real person. Killing is concerningly fun as there is this primal joy that you feel when you start chasing people around with a chainsaw. Imagine any slasher movie killer and think from the mindset of a deranged psychopathic killer and you will have a blast while also being concerned for your own humanity.All of the Killers have their own unique ability such as going invisible teleporting or running really really fast with a chainsaw that can 1HKO. It sounds overpowered but they all have a weakness that can be exploited by the survivors to help them get away so you have to learn the correct time to use them. The Survivors and the Killers also have their own unique perks that can be unlocked through a random skill progression system. The perks give you all sorts of abilities that help emphasize different ways of playing.The bad part of the game is that the gameplay itself is REALLY simple so it can have it's dull moments. The real fun of the game is hunting down survivors or trying to not get killed. The game is also very glitchy although it has slowly gotten better with time and lots of patches. The game did not initially come with some very key features like key rebinding and friend matchmaking but those are all in now so don't believe the other reviews that say that they aren't there although it is in in a very basic form at the moment. There are a lot of matchmaking issues but they are being fixed and it used to be so much worse.The game is not perfect but if you are patient with it and want to enjoy a unique type of fun that you don't get to experience in other games too often then I would highly recommend trying this out. It's only $20 which isn't much for games these days and it is constantly growing and evolving.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-29,0,0,228,False,Recommended,"Disclaimer Not going to be pretty after my previous match but will be semi fair. Gonna be honest previous match with the killer has shown me that people leaving right when they get caught or right before dying sucks ****. This game has so many amazing moments and in my opinion this game has one of the best ""Chase"" mechanics. Yet they repeatedly fall short due to the survivors ability to undermine all your efforts by ""juking"" you by using infinite loops that take advantage of the killers inability to get through objects at any speed faster than turtles doing it. At this point you are stuck in a strugle of the HARDEST game of stareing. You begin to wonder who is going to go which way. It doesn't matter even if you did. The outcome is always the same. Ends up wasting all of your time. The best part of this whole thing is... that when you finally catch them. they decide to deny you the honor of the kill. You surprisingly get a CONSOLATION prize at the end if enough people leave in stupid ways. Two left my previous game which probably stole 500 1750 (+ xp boosts) from me by the cowardice of the whole situation. I fairly caught you after you destroyed my psyche and you ******* leave???

Then once that happens you have to deal with the plathora of bugs glitches exploits. Do the devs do anything abouit them?? no absollutely not. Do not bother with this one guys you will just regret it dearly.,Dead by Daylight
2017-03-01,0,0,318,False,Recommended,This game has a great premise. The asymmetrical style is great. Most games I play 1 or 2 people end up making it out so I think the devs finally got a balance thats acceptable if not perfect. When you first play the game it's a little spooky but that quickly wheres off and it becomes more a game of cat and mouse than anything. It's the most fun horror game I've played personally. I even think it's better than the Friday the 13th game coming out. Well at least it could be. While I do overall reccomend the game you need to be warned about a few things. The game was known when it launched for the crazy amount of bugs in it. While there's been an improvement there is still an unacceptable amount of crashing. The other bad thing is the devs are a little too lazy/greedy. Ther's no reason to not have like 99% of the bugs fixed especially with the number of copies the game has sold. I get when a relatively indie team creates a game it won't be perfect but when it takes off you should really fix it up. Well they didn't and while there is still a decent amount of players there would have been a lot more if they had. Also some of the DLC/updates the team does seem to be only to get the game on the front page of steam instead of doing actual work.All complaints aside I love the game. The loot and leveling system alone are really interesting. I just wanted to put a review out that showcased both sides. If you get the game it's going to frustrate you sometimes with bugs but I think it's worth it. You mileage may vary,Dead by Daylight
2017-03-01,0,0,1633,False,Recommended,it's so good i play every day. i like the survivor because it's so challenging when you play against good people I I u,Dead by Daylight
2017-03-01,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,These developers pretty much gave a big you to anyone with a widescreen or multi monitor setup making it impossible to play the game why the does it not support sitting it to one screen i have tried multiple times i mean There used to be a fix but they went and ed it up like the biggest bunch of monkey s youll ever see the game is great but the developers are a bunch of es so i recccomend the game for anyone who has a single 4 3 or 16 3 setup but dont buy it at full price these monkey s will you over.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-18,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,Developers are clueless,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-04,0,0,696,False,Not Recommended,The game is really fun to play in the first 10 hours or so since you will be screaming and laughing. However the game is full of bugs and glitches and the developers fail to promptly fix any of the issues resulting in people leaving and the game dying. The game might be worth buying when its on sale but not at full price. Even then you might encounter bugs and problems with the game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,173,False,Recommended,Would be more fun if people didnt DC and screw you out of your bloodpoints and your level ups. Thats my only main issue it. Even when they DC they dont lose anything i know i DC'd once out of rage but now knowing it messes up people who want to level up. Thats the only thing that needs to be fixed other than that its awesome,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-30,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,This game isn't in Early Access? Well it's pretty bad for $18. I would want a refund actually not only do you have to deal with the killer you have to deal with the massive lag spikes and the bugs where you get grabbed even when killer is far away? Or you escape when you didn't actually open the door yet. Please get this game re worked.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-23,0,0,43,False,Recommended,People talk me left and right when I kill them for playing the game. People talk me cause I try to save them from the meat hook but it's being camped by the murderer so I can't. People talk me because there team couldn't save them from the hook and now it's my fault even though im the murderer... but in all the community is terrible but the game is so much fun until you get a team who doesn't even think about trying to save you. They will run by you to get the generator but after you save anybody you're pretty much on your own cause the majority of people you save aren't going to try and save you back,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-23,0,0,81,False,Recommended,This game is absolutely incredible. Yes it has a few bugs here and there the matchmaking can be slow at times and it can be frustrating to get used to. HOWEVER the devs for this game are awesome at what they do! They listen and respond to any and all player feedback and will often patch bugs brought up by the community within a day or 2 of the glitches being reported. It's a game heavily based on senses skill and techniques that make escaping/sacrificing other players feel super rewarding.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-06,0,0,65,False,Recommended,"UPDATED REVIEW FROM NEGATIVE &gt POSITIVEPROS They now appear to have fixed the dreaded ""lobby simulator"" which mainly sparked my negative review the game now also runs very smoothly on my PC when before it was at about 25fps.CONS Matchmaking non existent. Always matched with much lower ranks.SUMMARY DBD has always been a very fun addictive game with tons of potential but too many bugs made it unbearable the major ones have now been fixed there are still some flaws but they are minor and not game breaking and the Devs seem to be pro actively fixing these now too.I highly recommend it for the price.",Dead by Daylight
2016-08-23,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Sat with 4 friends trying to Que into a Survive with friends game for 35 minutes. Didn't get a single game. Games great when you actually get to play it.,Dead by Daylight
