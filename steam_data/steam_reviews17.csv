2015-06-10,0,0,205,False,Recommended,Шикарная игра...Сколько мы её ждяли и вот она.Вышла.Причём релиз стабильной версии.Игра запустится у многих даже если не соответствует минимальным параметрам.(Я из таких людей )) и могу сказать что игра работает нормально на стандартных настройках правда иногда бывают притормаживания при быстрых поездках на транспорте что несомнено ухудшает впечатления от гонок но это и понятно на слабом компе стоило рискнуть попробовать и могу сказать что в онлайн режиме зависну на долго да и сюжетка очень интересная и реиграбельна)И после всего этого бреда могу сказать только это Купите это же GTA V!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-07,0,0,552,False,Recommended,Despite all the ing and whining from the usual Generation Entitlement crowd I'm loving this game. Yes there are hackers but if they turn up you can just change sessions it's not the end of the world. A few tweaks to heist lobbies to prevent the entire group collapsing when one of the randoms inevitably leaves would be nice. Aside from that I've been playing this across Xbox and PC for hundreds of hours and am still hooked. Great multiplayer co op!,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-01,0,0,443,False,Recommended,I would only recommend this game if you have the minimum hardware requirements my PC has an intel core i3 2350M and a Nvidia GT 520MX and it has severe rendering issues. If I were to be traveling at high speeds on the ground or in the air it would glitch out quite a bit. Mind you I have the resolution at native which is 1366x768. GTA (at native res) all the VRAM I have (with only 1 GB). But with all that I only get 30 FPS when you think about it from a minimalistic point of view it's better than decent it's good,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-08,0,0,190,False,Recommended,GTA V is an open world sandbox game with a decent story mode but a multiplayer experience that is a bit iffy.Story Mode/Singleplayer has a great story with the 3 protagonists you can play as and is moddable with third party programs such as OpenIV a modding tool which allows people to create player models vehicles and several other additions. Singleplayer alone is a good reason to get this game.Online is just a mess that makes you unsure if you either love it or hate it. Reasons to love it would be that it's one of the best ways to play a sandbox game with friends plus it has quite a few good gamemodes like deathmatches races or jobs which are all enjoyable. Reasons to hate it is that it's VERY grindy to get everything you want like supercars weapons owned property literal fighter jets which are all above GTA$1 000 000. Because it's so grindy players are encouraged to buy Shark Cards with actual money for in game money. Around $55 in real money is $8 000 000 in GTA money which is just SO f**king greedy for Rockstar to do. Sure you can get some sort of business to gain money but even that is slow boring and still grindy. Though if you do want lots of money fast doing heists when you're lv12 and have a high class apartment is the way to go (Alternatively a challenge called 'Criminal Mastermind' rewards you with $10 million IF you play all the heists with the same people and DON'T DIE AT ALL).Overall Singleplayer is great Online is a mess you decide if you want this. I'm outt of here.,Grand Theft Auto V

TakeTwo has ruined online lately. Please remember this isn't Rockstar's fault this it Take Two Interactive's fault. They are greedy and are trying to milk as much money out of you as possible. Rediculous. Don't buy if you are going to play multiplayer which is the only updated portion so much so that spawning in items from newer DLCs automatically deletes the cars.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-18,0,0,343,False,Recommended,I really recommend this game for those people that like free roaming games such like gta 4 and stuff.if you played this game on console. i thought that some missions on console are not the same as the pc. or it could be that i dont remember the missions on console or it could be that i forgot how the missions are and i was thinking that the missions were defferent. My thoughts on Gta ONLINE are different then the story mode because i dont think that you have a big chance if you dont spend irl money on the game. because either you get killed by a high level player or you get killed my a low level player that has added alot of money into the game and killes you alot.

2018-06-23,0,0,371,False,Recommended,GTA V is an immensely entertaining game with a very large play area and a great deal to do. Single player wise the story isn't as good as GTA IV in my opinion but it still fun once you get past the first few grind missions and Trevor's character is always quite entertaining. I will say that once the story is done it almost seems like there isn't that much to do but one can still easily put in 20 30 hours into single player. Multiplayer is where the GTA series shines in my opinion and 5 can be quite fun with friends but suffers from a few issues. First connecting to multiplayer services can be painfully slow. Several minutes waits are not uncommon. In addition the multiplayer mission content could be improved and they have been very slow to release additional content that isn't blatent money grabs. Despite these issues once you load in the multiplayer is quite entertaining as you can always find silly things to do with friends. So long as you don't pour additional money into the game you should definitely get your money's worth from it and have a good time.TLDR Solid entry not as good as 4 and could be improved but worth getting,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-02,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun however you have to play for at least 3 hrs before you are able to save the game. The game has many glitches to where you will not be able to switch characters. This game is not with the $60 you are going to spend on it. I would not recommend this to any of my friends. At most the game is worth about $20. Also many people are having problems with moding the game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-07,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is the worst game I have ever got on steam it crashes after every mission or during without being able to save your progress making you have to redo entier missions three or four times the loading screen takes ages after rebooting it and it gets longer with each reboot. Sometimes your characters get black lines across their faces and bodies in online and storymode. Recently I came into an issue that GTA V worth 40 doesnt even work as when playing I dont seem to be controlling the character and he just stands there with the only button that works is the esc key then once in the menu of the game all my keys and my mouse work but when I want to play the game it doesnt work. I would rather spend money on any other game as a game full of bugs and crashes is not worth 40. Steam isnt even helpful with the issue as I've spent 1 hour trying to go on steam forums and trying to report the bugs and it just redirects me and tells me stuff like 'reboot your computer' I have about 4 times and I've rebooted steam but it doesnt work so dont ever buy this game on PC as it is one of the worst games ever on PC.P.S Also I bought this game for the mods and now you cannot mod this game so do not buy.,Grand Theft Auto V

The subsequent minutes long loading times are also a massive pain in the proverbial but GTA Online could have been an amazing idea if only Take 2/Rockstar let us hold our own private sessions so then we didn't have to deal with the rampent hacking.Also removing the main modding tool for your game via a DMCA no less!! is just PR suicide and I'm glad it's showing in the ratings maybe then blinded companies will see what happens if you attack a fan base that has supported your games for over 10 years will bring to their game!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-17,0,0,53,False,Recommended,i dont play this game much on pc so i have no idea. my experience so far with pc GTA is this login play for a while. having an alright time. get given a 10mil by hackers ( this is my first time playing GTA ever ). i thought getting 10mil off the bat was great. i later found out that thats how hackers get people banned by doing that because it looks suspicious af. so i got worried that i was going to get banned or whatever and didnt. so i started GTA out with 10mil and spent it all on cars like an idiot because. i didnt know what to do. GTAV on pc is much crazier than on console so if your going to play on pc dont invest to much time into your character because youll probably have to restart because you were caught ( cheating ),Grand Theft Auto V

My engine was stopping constantly but I kept flying until it completely died. Then I jumped with the parachute. They killed me. I respawned and got the supplies back blew one chopper up with my rocket launcher but it was my only missle. The other one I had to shoot down.

2017-09-16,0,0,130,False,Recommended,Solid game even today. Got it last month and damn is it fun to ride around in a car. Yep that's basically why I got so many hours. Not the story mode cause I didn't feel like playing the story mode and... Let's just say I'm glad the internet exists.In any case its really fun. Now I shouldn't say to much since I have put some money into the game cause the online mode is admittedly pretty without friends or friendly players (good luck). But with the great white shark card its pretty easy to earn money once you put like 15 dollars into the game you can buy a company and do some deliveries. If you do have friends you can do some missions to get you started! Honestly its heavily pay 2 play. But I like to call it pay 2 have fun.Once you got some money maybe a company and a house/apartment you're set for screwing around pretty much. But time is money and if you aren't a heavy pay2play its gonna cost you A LOT of time! In fact I think you could spend 100 hours doing the hardest mission and completing them but still dont have enough money to start screwing around.TL DR Online is the real reason to play (unless you like being alone..) and while it can be pay 2 play it is fun with friends. I would recommend to those who is ready to play this game for hours. Not a unhealthy amount of time but time is needed for this game if you're not pay 2 play.Here's how I rate the major parts of the game.Graphics 10/10 (The graphics are too good that even with a GTX 1070 I cant go to the highest without lag T)Controls 8/10 (Sometimes I am annoyed at the different interact keys and how some things wont work some times)Story 3/10 (Didn't actually play it but from what I have heard it wasnt all that great to begin with)Player base activity 9/10 (if you try hard enough you can find a empty session)Personal enjoyment 8/10 (Good graphics wonky controls crap story and a hacking player base but a active one none the less),Grand Theft Auto V

Probably the reason being a majority of the game is spent driving and doing so with a keyboard is a horrible chore. That and there are tons of shops around the city only a minute fraction can you go in and rob which is bothersome since finding these rob able locations is tedious as they are among all the other ""24hr open"" shops which aren't robbable. Then there were various specific annoyances. Like in failing to land a plane I have to spend another 3 minutes flying to the same landing area in the mission only to see the plane blow up on what appeared to be an invisible wall as I was landing. And just as I was putting the armored police truck in the garage a mission starts and the truck vanishes.

2016-09-15,0,0,621,False,Recommended,Very late and unnecessary review but I've been too engrossed playing it. If I could only have one game on my PC PS3 and PS4 it would be this by a mile. It's a combination of an excellent driving game FPS RPG and strategy game all in one and it does each of these genres so well. The open world aspect and the realism is awesome. All the attention to detail is much appreciated. I believe it was 6 years in the making since GTA IV was released and I'm glad Rockstar gave it the time it deserved to perfect as much as possible. Total landmark in gaming history much like Battlefield 1942 was (for me at least) many years before. This is a must have but I'm sure anyone who plays computer games and likes any of the genres I mentioned has already got it anyway. Masterpiece!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-15,0,0,232,False,Recommended,Not so friendly to my laptop with AMD APU and AMD discrete graphics. A problem occurs when GTAV detects my VRAM i.e. only 768Mb of the APU can be detected while 2Gb of the discrete graphics disappears. I have tried 5 different versions of AMD drivers but the problem is always there. Activating CrossFire just doubles needed VRAM &amp available VRAM simultaneously.However this game's optimization is good so that with the problem above it can still reach 18FPS on average. Good enough for A10 5750M APU with Radeon HD8670M+HD8650G graphics on laptop.As to the gameplay interesting things are everywhere and I am satisfied.updated at 2016/11/24,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-01,0,0,246,False,Not Recommended,I was put off of buying GTA 5 by the setting in San Andreas.Southern California. Big cities and deserts. The two kinds of places I can stand the least.I was put off of buying GTA 5 by the entirely unlikeable protagonists. A gangbanger and a hillbilly no one I could even remotely relate to. The third one well let's call him good enough. But then again the game doesn't allow you to play as one out of the three characters as much as it forces you to.I went to create my own character then but sure enough the game won't let me play her offline outside of director mode. I'd put it like this The game bethesda izes the GTA series in all the wrong ways. It keeps bothering me with its goddamn story and narrative that I could not care any less about.Well I knew that all before. I've bought it now at a discount to see if I manage to ignore the setting and the idiots you play somehow. It doesn't work. You keep getting into your OWN car and there's always that stupid rap crap on the radio even though I've switched the thing off some twenty times before. Driving and especially collision physics are a huge step backward from GTA 4 as well. Outside of missions etc. the game can be quite fun it's wonderful to look at especially at down and during rain and thunderstorms. But that doesn't make up for all that I've stated above.

2017-09-07,0,0,168,False,Recommended,"It's a toxic game. Lol BUT! it is the first game of its' kind where being toxic can be fun. This isn't League of Legends. There isn't a moderating bot that's watching your mouth and banning people for ""not giving them a good time"". Rockstar and ESRB make it clear ""not rated based on online play"". Which means GTA V Online is the wild west. If you get angry at someone spawn in a tank or a Hydra and gun them down. No ""Report"" buttons or anything like that. Join a lobby call someone a ing on all chat tilt them and then make people bond together over the fact that you were brutually bullying someone. Lmfao. I like seeing people come together to hate me on this game. Just yesterday I made 5 or 6 random people all come together to kill me 20+ times and they formed a group. I'm pretty sure they all added each other as friends just to hate me. Awwwie. How cute. I love it when a community comes together....But there are some flaws.Super Pay to win. Unless you were part of that wave before Take Two interactive came into the picture and became the Anti Hack police then the game is not worth investing in at all.Find a modder get $1 000 000 000 in online cash if you can and live out your days on this game holding it all in your wallet and not in your bank account so the dev team doesn't perma ban you. I doubt there are any modders left though keeping up on GTA V's news Take Two interactive shut down a modding site and issued a ""cease and desist"" order. Super fagboy gayness. Greedy money mongrils this dev team. Like $800 000 000 in REAL money isn't enough. If you are too shy in the GTA world to ask around like that then take a look at what the new DLC looks like by watching that Drill Seargant Guy on facebook who can do Family Guy and Kendrick Lamar impersonations or VanossGaming. It's a decent game to play. Just don't let your life become playing it every day taking life lessons from it and dropping off the face of the planet over how much ya care over your rank and GTA wallet.

The map is also huge qith side missions driving contests Clubs ) and places to custimize your car. The idea i didn't get is the fact that you can't store high end cars that you may find acroos GTA's vast world in Online. Online is basically the same as the story mode just with your own character and you can play with your friend or other random people. Theor are also heists in the game which you can play with ypur friends or not. PLaying all the heists with the same people give loads of money in the end. Overall this game is really good as i've haven't run into issues asides the long load times.NOTE THIS IS MY FIRST GTA GAME SO MY OPINIONS MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE LIKE THE CAN'T STAORE HIGH END CARS I STATED ),Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-29,0,0,247,False,Recommended,TL DR edition. Single player is memorable and really fun the online is a catastrophe. Connection issues hackers players that will stalk and murder you continuously etc etc etc. Grand Theft Auto speaks for itself. Each new installment gets better and better. GTAV is no exception it is definitely a great time especially the single plyaer campaign. That's where the compliments end for this game.The big new thing with GTA V is the official online mode. Allowing you to play with friends and randoms from all over the globe. This was a huge step up from the previous installments but unfortunately the online is far from perfect.I have so many issues with the online I'm not sure if I can list them all. Lets start with the load time. I have the gamne installed on a solid state drive and it still takes a bit to load the Rockstar Social club the game then get into the online find a server and get me into it and load in. And that's if I can stay connected. My friends and I have so much trouble trying to stay IN them game we spend more time loading in then playing and this is especially infuriating during a heist. If one player leaves during a heist then the heist is over the progress you made is gone and the money you spent is gone. I have no issues in multiplayer games a hiccup here and there perhaps but no major issues except GTA V Online. Sometimes if you're disconnected the game will have to load up the single player and plop you down in there wasting more time for you to have to load back into the online mode and pray you can stay in.Some of the jobs and modes can be quite fun (again if you can stay connected) but getting to them requires going to the main menu and selecting Online Jobs Rockstar Created etc etc etc. It seems lazily thrown on in my opinion. You know in Team Fortress 2 for example all the online modes and game types are easily listed out. You can get to a certain server certain mode etc with a few clicks and its quite easy to navigate. Out of all of my friends I'm the only one who took the time to learn GTA V's online navigation. It's not the simplest but it does I suppose. Oh and if you want to play your online character in your own server? Oh what a nightmare THAT is to load up.But why would you? IT'S ONLINE. If you die it costs money. If you blow up certain cars it costs money. Lose your wanted level call in a vehicle? Money money money. You can get money with jobs and missions (again if you can stay connected long enough) but with paying for all of that your cars guns ammo armor upgrades etc... you won't have much cash. And of course being online means other players targetting and killing you for.... no reason. So if you want a relaxing fly around or just to drive and pick up a friend is potentially a stalker coming after and killing you.. over.. and over... and over... and over.I know what you're thinking... Just kill them. One time I did. I was so fed up that I hid and waited. The player rounded the corner in his car I threw a sticky bomb and detonated it killing him and his vehicle instantly. And just as instantly 20 000 was taken from my bank acocunt to pay for his car... Wow... Thanks. And the way it works is when you die you spawn near by... So within seconds he was back on top of me trying to murder me. It's a disaster. You can become invincible by paying money and having to keep doing it every 15 minutes.... But that's not very fun now is it? And when you finally find a good server or a server with your friends and you start to unwind you'll be kicked out and sent to single player.Overall the single player is quite fun and another great addition to the franchise but the online is just a disaster. Connection issues navigation nightmares (some invites are sent in Rockstar Club some are sent via the phone both forcing you to stop and become a target while you accept an invite). The online needs refinement and then it needs more refinement on top of that. Gang attacks at 2 of the three air strips? Come on. If I want my plane I want my plane I don't want to go murdering NPC's wait for the congrats screen to come up how many i killed the headshots etc. Just give me the plane so I can go do what I want. It seems I'm more fighting and struggling to make the game do what I want rather than doing what I want and having fun.OH.... AND THE LAST THING. If I make a lobby for a race heist whatever THEN KEEP ME THE DAMN HOST. It's INFURIATING to be racing having full control over what cars can be used how many laps etc and then suddenly you're in a lobby for a regular mission and you lost host privileges. HOW DID I END UP I THAT MODE?! Why did I somehow lose the host position!? Infuriating to say the least.I would still recommend it for the single player but the online? Naw... Maybe the next installment will fix the issues the many many issues. Until then steer clear and play single player where you'll more than likely get kicked and forced into anyhow.,Grand Theft Auto V

However even though I do meet the requirements I still get popping textures (A LOT!!!) and delayed dialogue as if it needs to catch up.Still I will not fault the game on that. THIS is still an amazing game a good time waster and a fun way to play with friends and let off some steam! Want a good sandbox game where you can do a lot? Get this game.... DO IT!!! And..... keep away from hackers... set up your own server and play with only friends if need be for online!Also has a rather decent story for singleplayer. Hate Trevor at first then sympethize with him later and understand him as well as for Michael and Franklin....

I'm just saying I literally feeling like i am doing the dishes instead of paying for dinner when i am grinding on this game. Not to mention out of every 60 minutes i believe 40 of that is loading or waiting for lobbies to fill up. The funnest part of this is freemode which is a remnant of what real death matches in gta 4 used to be which they have effectivly killed. Because there are no pickups in free mode you have to grind to get money for your weapons. Of course you could just pay clash of the cla... i mean rockstar.,Grand Theft Auto V

The one thing I find dissapointing is how little attention they give the multiplayer missions like survival and Last Team Standing and everyone wants a taste of the new gamemodes but there is so many game modes now its hard to keep track.I am also a big fan of the story mode so seeing the fact that the story is so short and easy to get through really defeats the purpose of the GTA franchise please consider making a storymode DLC.Over all its a really great game and the amount of new stuff they are giving to us GTA fans is astonishing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-01,0,0,479,False,Recommended,Very great. I have owned this game on PS3 &amp PS4 and recently just bought for PC because many of my friends have the game only for PC. When I got the game it took about all night to download with an Intel i7 gtx 970 and 8 gb of ram. Worth the wait totally just skipped story because I have already done it 2 times and went straight to online. Online can be laggy but thats not really anything Rockstar can do about it depending on players ping. Been playing for about 5 days now and haven't seen hackers which is fantastic but I know the time will have to come. I reccomend this game for anybody looking for endless fun.(P.S Endless fun meaning Rockstar coming out with new dlc pretty much every season D),Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-01,0,0,356,False,Recommended,This is honestly one of the best SinglePlayer games i has ever played. The story is very deep and you get involved in whats happening and you care about the main characters. The missions are amazing that include a lot of variety and you never end up bored. Tons of side missions to do you can own properties and do jobs for companies you own buy cars and airplanes to use and much more. You can also do recreational activities such as tennis and golf which you can do with friends and family members. The free mode alone in this game is a ton of fun and when you finish everything in the game their is still a ton to do in free mode. Other than free mode the main story is amazing. The massive amount of variety in missions is incredible and never stops to amaze me throughout playing the game. This PC port is incredible having almost no issues and running very smoothly. The Online part of GTA Online is fun except for the hackers. Don't buy this game for the online if you dont have friends to play with. If you play online you want to play in a private lobby with friends since if you dont you will be in a lobby with a hacker most likely and would get banned for being in a lobby with one. Despite that the amount of content in online is amazing with Missions Races Heists. and even more with more coming out about every month.

2015-06-08,0,0,636,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto Online has been one of my favorite games with Rockstar's common free DLC and great support and community of the game. I pre orderded it on PC and PS3.

Cheaters and Modders.The current state of GTA Online is broken. Just about every lobby is filled with hackers and modders. Finding randoms to befriend and have fun with is just about impossible now.The only way I can truly enjoy this game is if I host my one invite only session or I could wait untill mods from private sessions or deticated servers are released if they actually are in the making.I would say get this game but wait untill some more news is released by Rockstar.(It may say I have low hours in this game but that is becuase this is a different account I have over 100 hours in online #nolyf),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,1279,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto Online is an absolute tragedy.Back in 2015 when I bought it on Steam a player would do fun things with people (racing missions pvp etc) get funbucks for their time and blow it on stupid tat to play around with. I personally loved heists. I learned them all inside and out pointed out the most fun bits and trouble spots to help newbies built a huge pile of money and a huge friends list of heisters. I bought a speed boat. Why? So I could carry it through town with a helicopter of course.Then the new ""content"" started. A player now had to spend funbucks to play the content. Wanna play the black market? Better have a few million sitting around for offices warehouses vehicles and inventory. What you get return is the chance to provide some Russian tween with freemode pvp content. Wanna race? Better have BEST NEW CAR or don't bother. Don't get attached either since the next one will be out next week. Wanna heist? you T2 doesn't make money from pve. Who ever heard of creating a content pack and selling it to customers want it? That's madness! Just buy Shark Cards from the cash shop when you need funbucks!The effect on the community which was already a semi dry spot under a bridge where the world gathered to huff drain cleaner turned into a demilitarized zone. Everyone not in your crew was the enemy and had to be driven (votekicked) from the session. Better yet tweak your firewall settings so only people from your friends list can join. It's not like that sweet sweet Shark Card money is going to pay for servers so why the hell not exploit that peer to peer architecture?I finally uninstalled GTA5 when some new gunrunner update came out. It involves armored vehicles and heavy weapons. It's all over my head. I can still make three fools a half million funbucks richer in an hour but nobody cares about that anymore. And now I hear Take Two is threatening lawsuits against modders trying to bring back some actual fun into their game. I'm not a drug kingpin underworld CEO or the head of a private army. I'm just a bank robber looking at middle age. And if there's one thing that GTA5 in 2017 has NOTHING to do with it's older guys robbing banks.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-25,0,0,58,False,Recommended,First of all this game barely opens on my crappy integrated graphics. Props to rockstar for releasing a game in 2015 that can open on Intel HD 2000 and run at 8fps tho the optimization on this one is insane and pretty much any discrete video card will run the damn game. I did play previous versions of the game tho The online is absolutely revolutionary and the story mode is awesome if you're a more completionist type of gamer but if you're more like me you'll think it's more on the average side. The online is best enjoyed with friends tho because posibilites are endless but the best parts of the online can only be enjoyed with friends. Be prepared to spend loads of hours (or real money) if you want the best cars tho nowadays the game is filled with new stuff to buy and it will take some time to buy the stuff you want...The game is gorgeous graphically but it runs on a potato thanks to the god tier port.Definitely worth a buy. Especially when you can get it quite cheap with a $1 250 000 online shark card for prettty much no extra cost. (Yes that's the only reason I got it for PC I'll get a GPU someday tho)9.4/10 Online is the most fun online experience on any open world game but the story is a bit lacking and the single player is best enjoyed by completionists.,Grand Theft Auto V

You'll never have the same old boring content everytime you fire up Steam and log into Rockstar Games Social Club to play the gameThe Graphical aspect of the game is also Stunning. for a 5 year old game.

2017-06-18,0,0,518,False,Not Recommended,"It seems that all the money Rockstar makes barely makes it back into the game the loading screens are terrible take forever to join a session loading for the first time exiting a heist coming from the single player everything takes a lot of loading i call it ""The Loading Simulator 20XX"".Aside from the loading the actual game is really fun with friends different game modes challenges jobs you can do in the freeroaming mode it has a lot of things to do and buy.In the multiplayer exists two problems The modders and the people with a stupid amount of money (real money and in game money).The modders give themselves superpowers vehicles in game money and many other things to have fun at the expense of other people usually when my friends and i join a session we look for modders if there are any we get out or ask them to drop money. In general very annoying OP and not regulated (thank the devs for that).The people with a stupid amount of money I understand that Rockstar has to make a living but the prices of everything is quite extreme you have to use real money to buy in game money or use 20 30 hours doing heists playing different game modes doing jobs of any sort to get the millions you need for your expensiver supercar.And this brings me to another point the game is really broken in terms of balance between players the people trying to make money are usually harrased by people with real money (hence in game money) and modders with their overpowered vehicles and you can't do anything because they have money which makes next to impossible to archive anything in freeroam mode when you are trying to do jobs There is the passive mode which is nice when you just want to drive or whatever but if you want to make money you are forced to have passive mode off.TL DRBroken as but fun as hell when you get your game to work and wait for the loading simulator to finish simulating (and wait for your friends to also finish the simulation).I want to say i recomend it and i kinda do but i will keep it as an official no.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,722,False,Not Recommended,Have almost 550 game hours. After a year break from playing I have returned to the world of Los Santos in this may. I have found many new and interesting stuff there since I have missed quite a few major updates. I have established my MC business as well as CEO business. I play almost always as solo player but I had a tons of fun again even in public lobbies. Playing heists with some random guys roaming the streats with new car meeting people sme of which become my friends. I had some great expectations from comming Gunrunning DLC since the MC and CEO business turns out to be pure pointless grind. The Gunrunning DLC killed the game altogether. The Online part of GTA V is now pure pay to win 3rd grade mobile app. Do not buy this until you have lots of friends to play with and are willing to spend enormous time grinding and turning something that supposed to be fun to depresive work. Or you are willing to pay lost of real money for shark cards or you are willing to risk ban for modding your account with money. The GTA V Online is almost unplayable in public lobbies due to OP Gunrunning stuff. Lots of bored players have all the new weapons and needlessly killing random players in public due to pure boredom. Boredom is the word that describes the GTA V Online the most. Why to grind to have lots of new stuff that you can use only to kill randoms at public lobby ? Instad of bringing the most anticipated DLC and its posibilities to have more dificult heists more intense and more lengthy heists this time with more people per team Rockstar brings us new lame posibility for grinding and trying to force people to buy shark card to just survive in public lobby.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-30,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Okay so... this game is alright. There's some ups and downs and I'll be specific about them.Racing is tight fun and awesome. It can be competitive it can be like a Mario Kart race. By far the best thing about this game.Deathmatches are fun. They too are well balanced and a blast to play.Riding around doing missions with friends is a hoot but playing missions alone sucks.The campaign is fun the first time around but there's no reason to return to it after you beat it.The idle is the real problem with the game. Just walking on the street when you get gunned down by some kid who's killing everyone. So you turn on Passive Mode. Now not only can you not rob stores or fight back against cops if you hit something but people can still blow up your car or run you over with theirs. And you can't shoot them back. It was an interesting idea but it doesn't work too well. If you're not playing in a friend/crew only server you'll pay for it.Buying new weapons and vehicles varies too. Some stuff is really really cool and working for my Turismo R was a rewarding turnaround. Some stuff sucks to save for though. Tanks and most air vehicles are crazy expensive and require a crazy amount of grinding by which time they've probably added another vehicle or gun that would be more worth paying for. I get that the 30s car is supposed to be a Luxury thing but if it's outperformed by a common street car and other players will just blow it up anyway what's the point?The game is one of the best things to play with friends and crewing up was actually a highlight of a life I would call rich in experience. But if you don't have any friends who own the game you're going to suffer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-19,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,Had GTAV on the xbone and loved it. Got rid of the xbone and recently tried to play this again but it sadly ended up with my refunding of the game. I'll break it down Game content itself is great. Story is funny and serious at times I think the variation of protagonists is well thought out and overall I really enjoyed it. However that wasn't on PC. On PC I never got a chance to play due to more than a few major bugs with this port. I've heard others having the same issues as I did with the Social Club bug but the fixes never helped and I usually expect AAA games to at least function after download. I'm sure there are ways to get around most of the bugs you might encounter but having played GTAV before I didn't feel like dealing with it. If you choose to buy this I hope it runs great for you and you never encounter any issues like I did. I know plenty of people who play with only minor issues (which are to be expected these days). However given the sorry state of my copy I cannot recommend this game until it can function to a decent degree without a great deal of effort on the buyer's part.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-25,0,0,1260,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar has followed the same idea that most other game makers are following which is creating a game based on greed. do not mod in this game in single player or multiplayer as they will ban you.... the only thing they mainly are worried about here is getting the 60 dollars for the game and then selling these shark cards. Rockstar took the mission payouts and cut them by half every new in game content they release becomes more and more expensive showing the only thing rockstar really wants to do in this game is get money from your pocket to theirs. This is my first rockstar game purchased and will be my last as i was intending on buying the othet gta's but after watching first hand how rockstar conducts business I will not support this company....,Grand Theft Auto V

If you not sure your computer wont run it DONT buy it because you will be annoyed. I am currently waiting for a refund which i hope i get because its pointless having a 40 game sitting there. when you buy it aswell you have to wait about 8 9 hours for it to download.

2017-06-08,0,0,692,False,Recommended,This game is pretty great I have played through the entire campaign and I can say it is one of the best I have ever played the story and intertwining plot lines mesh together greatly Great singleplayer experience although the multiplayer is kind of grindy having to get cash for the new dlcs is a chore hopefully the new gunrunning dlc will make it more fun to make money but I dont know that yet. The players you will run into in multiplayer are often cancerous although you can run into good people through heists,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-16,0,0,576,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V's Single player campaign was extreamly fun but its not what this review is about. its about the broken mess of a multiplayer. But wait you might be asking. I gave it a positive review what gives?Everything is expensive they want you to buy shark cards the start of your multiplayer career is slow and tedious. But that doesnt mean there isnt anything good. If you have friends the Hiests are a ton of fun the game modes are fun and once you get going there is nothing more fun than hunting down a group of people who tried to attack you for your supplies (long story) and taking them down over and over again with just you and one friend of yours. Yes Hacking is rampant and if Rockstar is doing anything about it its not working. Rockstar Support is also some of the worse support groups I have ever encountered running you in circles until you give up or they just tell you the game is working as intended but get past all this crap and the game is actually a lot of fun. There are also ways to get solo lobbys both private and public that are just an internet search away if you dont want to deal with hackers.,Grand Theft Auto V

Most games die out after about a year after they have been released but i feel that gta is still going strong. The MP alone is worth the $60 price tag. With RS adding new content every couple of months. Just getting on for 1/2 hour and just driving around is still very so much fun. The world is alive with all kinds of awesome things to do. The bilboards and ads on the radio along with the stuff on the t.v.(I know watching tv in a viedo game lol) are just funny to see/hear as you are exploring this massive world. The story is also lots of fun with 3 amzing main charaters!

2018-08-07,0,0,303,False,Recommended,I highly recommended this game to anyone who wants to play a open world type game that has a optional story. There is the story mode in Single player with so many things to do in Los Santos. There is also GTA Online. GTA Online has its own sort of feel to it. It is great if your looking for Multiplayer Realism (in some aspects) and Crime. With its new DLCs being put out once a month or so it just g to more and more exciting. And in single player (NOT GTA ONLINE) you have the ability to mod the game. This means you can replace the vehicles in the game with real life vehicles different mods that change th game and allow you to do certain things. And even mods that completely flips the game and allows you to be a Law Enforcement Officer.,Grand Theft Auto V

Also have a bunker for weapon &amp vehicle upgrades have a hanger for aircraft storage. Find a way for PUBLIC SOLO SESSION if you want to get the full amount and possibly with friends. For CEO get a special cargo storage (can get costly on getting the cargo) &amp get an Import/Export Car Garage (if you are doing it solo expect NPC's to come after you &amp potential loss of $$$$). Again find a way for PUBLIC SOLO SESSION if you want to get the full amount and possibly with friends. Bunker is good for weapon &amp vehicle upgrades but it won't be profitable as expected it's a passive way for research &amp production (somewhat similar to MC but with research). I recommend to get the weaponized Tampa &amp MOC truck. The facility is good for doomsday heist don't get the orbital cannon and living quarters that is not good investment. The Hanger is good but it can be a headache to get the product back to the hanger. But good for aircraft storage that is all. Recommend that you should get the weaponized Tampa &amp have it upgraded (VIA bunker) helicopter (get the Akula &amp Buzzard) &amp possibly the Delorian (if you have watched 'Back To The Furutre' Franchise).Cons Modders (they can get you banned for ""cash drop"" find another session if the word modder comes up in the chat potential product loss in public sessions from tryhards loss of revenue in import/export in solo public session (always a headache. play with friends to get the most outcome. expensive property vehicles aircraft upgrade (for weapons vehicles bunkers MC lockups hanger &amp facility) painful grinds that would ruin your experince if you don't have friends to help you out. Be careful that the research in the bunker will be costly you have a choice to spend time for research or spend $9 mill (more or less ingame currency) to complete the research stuff PLEASE DO NOT USE SHARK CARDS IF YOU ABSOLUTLY HAVE TO!!!!

2018-09-12,0,0,162,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto games.. Games we all love and enjoy.Rockstar did a pretty good job on Grand Theft Auto V. First of to start with the basics game has pretty good graphics good controls user friendly interaction menus and a bunch more good stuff.For the singleplayer For the story I would give 8/10. It's pretty good but Rockstar could've done a lot better. I like that in Grand Theft Auto V Rockstar included changing between characters (Franklin Michael and Trevor). It really makes the game stand out more from other Grand Theft Auto games. About the map it's a bit disapointing at first when you hear that there is only one city as there were like 2 3 cities in other Grand Theft Auto games but when you start exploring around you actually realize that the map is gigantic and there are a lot of cool places that you can visit. So it's a cool change for cities but also not disapointing. One thing that I dislike is at the end of the game (spoiler alert) you have to kill at least one of the three characters. Some players like playing with all the characters and I think there should be an option where you can either choose to kill one of them or let them all live. Singleplayer heists they are pretty cool cool adition to the game based on the story. I dislike that you can only do a hesit once and you can't do more heists when you finish the story. Also on every heist there are 2 options on how to do the heist. You can only choose one and if you want to see the other one you can't do it unless you load a new game or a previous save before the heist.Enought talking about singleplayer let's go into Grant Theft Auto V Online now.For the Online First of all there are a lot more of clothes and masks than singleplayer so you can customize your character literlly how ever you like. There are a crap load of missions including 6 Heists which are really fun especially if you play with friends. A lot of other events such as Races or Deathmatch events.. ect ect. Earning money is a bit hard well not hard but it takes a lot of time if you want to get a lot of money without purchasing and Shark Cards which for me it makes the game more fun because you get to play it for a really long time and you still can achieve more stuff. If you just buy all the best items in the game what else are you gonna do. Cool additions in the Online are that you can buy a Nightclub start a Motorcycle Club choose a viraity of different appartments to live in. Also I like that you purchase vehicles through the internet using your phone. There are a lot of vehicles such as Bikes Cars Trucks Hesit Vehicles Planes Boats Cool vehicles for fun and much more. Ofcourse it has to have some downsides.. The online mode takes a bunch of minutes to load in and if you go to a public lobby not all the time but most of the times you will encounter modders which will instantly kill you and they won't let you to play the game basiclly.My Oppinion 1. Overalll the singleplayer is worth buying the game for you won't regret it.2. If you are buying for online I suggest that you find some friends to play with so it will be more fun either way it is fun but still better with friends.Final Conclusion Buy the game it's worth it according to me.,Grand Theft Auto V

Graphics 10/10 One of the most realistic looking games I've every played sadly the graphics are limited by my computer. Performance (GTX 970 i5 6600K) 7/10 I can play at a mix between high and very high above that the FPS start to drop.I wouln't recommend buying this game with a low end PC as you need quite a strong one to run this game somewhat smoothly. price/performance ratio 8/10 I'd recommend waiting for a sale although I think it's quite a nice game.A rare thing these days is the introduction of free (and pretty big) DLCs.New cars racing modes outfits and so much more all for free.

2015-05-11,0,0,286,False,Recommended,"101 hours and counting....I have no doubt this will be my game with the most played hours. I have played through the campaign twice now first on PS3 and now on PC and I still love it. The story is not liked by everyone many just prefer kicking about online shooting people which I certainly enjoy. But I do believe the story is something to be enjoyed on it's own merits the way it works can all be read on the store page so I won't list all of the features but it really is enjoyable and has lots of hours in it. When you're done with the campaign you can move on to GTA online which has a good progression system of it's own and is absolutely packed with content. The best of which in my opinon are the heists where you can spend hours upon hours with random people completing setups for heists and then finally pulling them off. It's a nice feeling and great fun albeit on caveat is the fact that you will spend a LOT of time waiting for people to join if you are playing with randoms only. I have managed to do it though and made some friends along the way to complete future heists with. If you're like me and played GTA SA throughout your childhood this is your dream game and will live up to all the nostalgia of driving around in this expansive ""living"" world doing random things all the time.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,GTA has great mods in singleplayer but multiplayer well this is a Microtransaction HELLHOLE Do not buy this game even if it's just for the single player becuase it's ed. The Reason it's ed is alll the DLC they add allllll the new cars they add are not added to the single player. This is Because all they are trying to do is get people off the singleplayer which everyone has already payed 60 for and onto the multiplayer where they can charge people more money on GTA dollars. There is basically no way of making enough money to buy all of these cars without paying for them and if you have you literally won't care about the single player because there is no content. But this is where MODS... Come in. Mods... Are free. This makes take2 sad. Because all they wan't is more ing microtransactions so they are killing the modding scene which is basically the biggest reason anyone bought it on PC. It's not as if take2 don't have enough money we have already had to buy the game 3 times for either PS3 PS4 or Xbox 360 and Xbox One and now on PC. The reason they are killing mods is because they have made it ILLEGAL. Nice Real Nice. Open IV have a statement to read about how they were ED by take2 sorry excuse my language i meant to say Takemoney http //openiv.com/?p 1324If you have read this and disagree feel free to spend hundreds apon hundreds of your REAL MONEY on something you have already bought and why not go yourself while you are there.If you agree feel free to say you found this helpful!If you are takemoney just stop before you kill all mods on all games which will KILL ALL GAMES ON PC you !P.S.

Play heists with friends and save up any profits.I strongly recommend getting this if many of your friends have it or want to get it soon because all you need to do to have fun with your friends is to annoy them and it'll very quickly turn to mayhem.,Grand Theft Auto V

The list goes on and on about bugs and wonky controls and animations but what i want to talk about is the sole money making structure of the game. The game is suppose to be a grind fest and i get that but not like this. they shove the shark cards in your face and for a 100 dollars what do you get? 8 million dollars. you might think holy crap i am rich in the game! ha no you are not rich. the cars and planes cost sooo much money and you earn very very little in the game. buying one car with the shark car and all the upgrades for it will pretty much spend it all which is stupid you paid 40 more dollars than the actual game itself to get ingame money that will go away in seconds. that is not fair to the players at least make the 100 shark card 100 million make it worth it. The heist's in the game are fun but the pay out for some of these missions is down right stupid. ive been told but dude we get 400k thats a lot of money nope that is not a lot of money in this game its like hey i got 40 bucks in my pocket yay. Rockstar needs to rebalance the game interms of things being so expensive. i love grinding games but this is just stupid.,Grand Theft Auto V

The recent updates added more stuff to play with but the downside to this is that they keep getting more expensive even though earning money hasn't changed. Wanna buy the newest car? Better grind for days.When you're alone this isn't really fun to do when your with friends it gets a lot easier.I'm from the old PS3 days and I'm still waiting for that Casino and Singleplayer expansion.

2018-03-19,0,0,279,False,Recommended,"My Opinion with this game (others might think Different Just saying.)Pros Still one of the best Graphic even after years of release on Console nor PC*My my Even after these years of AAA games released This game is still on Top. Good Optimization*Well you can even play this game with 2GB of ram and 512mb Graphics card ( Cuz i saw my friend playing it on their old laptop and it run just fine some lag tho but playable) Still many Players in GTA online After 3 years of Release on PC Which is Good*I'm suprised even after years of release There are still a lot of player playing this game. I bought This game While it 50% off so It's worth it50% happened On Steam Sale Back in 2016 I think But I just Bought this recently So if you want to get the cheap one Probably you have to wait until steam sale comes. Relax After these years They'll put the Discount Above 40% . Fun Game to play With friends aside doing mission* I'm not Gonna lie I did Spent half of my Current Gameplay just Doing something Stupid with my friends Aside doing any mission in GTA online.Cons You may Run The game on ultra in single player with 60fps++*but in Multiplayer I suggest you change it little bit down well because it's onlineand it requires more than your system to play on Online Seriously believe me. Long Joining Session On online mode. *I have to say that this is the most anoying thing in this game it took me about 5 10 minutesbefore I can jump into online and everytime i want to do a heist I have to wait some other loading screen for like 3 minutes Each . Some ""Random"" Players*Imagine when you have your own business and suddenly you got blown up by random player. Microtransaction* R* really make something that didn't hit some player's Wallet. but for me They did why ? because If you want to unlock Something on This game especially for big Heist or any DLC updates. You have to Grind.I mean yes. Grinding like A LOT or you can just buy Shark Card Start From 10$ to 30$ (I forgot )to get Those Big Heist and others to unlocked Dont get me wrong . It's a good way to Do a microtansaction. tho I'm notType of that guy who can just buy anything.Overall 8 /10I recommend you if you want to buy this game you might wanna invite your friends to play with you",Grand Theft Auto V

UGH.But really story mode is pretty good includes heists and quite a good veriety of missions. Many cars and weapons good voice actors nice cutscenes and fluid animations. Its GTA V afterall.The multiplayer on the other hand is a bit of a thorn in a great experience. As others have pointed out Sharkcards are shortcuts for hours of grrinding many things are overpriced and finances are an issue. Also even though my first few sentences were a pure joke some people experience big lag spikes and stutters. Driving is impossible with fps jumping from 1 10 (20 max) and teleports. I havent personally experienced these issues but 2 people I know have them. Maybe laptops just got the end of the deal here.

2016-08-28,0,0,286,False,Recommended,I bought GTAV and couldn't stop playing (in free roam). Then I went to missions completing till a 56% and something of the game's story because it's true free raoam is always catching. Doing your way not the game's way that must be the axiom for any open world game and certainly it's somehow what modders are doing by adding missions maps and similar type of mods which expand the game possibilities therefore its realism and fun.Said that I created a badass but he sounds like a boy when he talks. I created a dirt mafia character with Michael but the guy play tennis and does yoga instead of mafia stuff. Trevor fits in his character the guy is crazy even if dressing him like a naive he's always Trevor somehow he has a little of naive but that's him! xDSo the game is amazing it ensure tons of hours (in this moment is paused in the background) of a very dramatic realism and intense emotions. The game's story is a bit confusing the cellphone is almost useless Michael has boring side activies and frankly he looks like taken from some bad comedy a totally boring character when he could be a dirt mafia corrupted FBI cop or something in those noir lines. It's supposed to be an ERSB M game not something for above 14 years old. Yeah the game is very violent (as I play it at the least) but missions and characters could be something really mafia/gang style.So honestly I find much more funnier and mafia like playing with the market and commiting different types of crimes with different approachs to all the companies and markets found in the game. So like for example I find more funnier planning an attack to a Bean Machine Restaurant than saving the daughter of Michael from a yatch because doing the first thing needs you to explore the map get info from the advertisements on the streets radio and what people say then go to the stock market do your move find guns (first thing you have to do in the game) then go and plan your attack.Sometimes the place is empty but I kick the eCola Machine like a punk. If the place is filled with people I can approach with a sniper with a supressor or by car silently parking it there and blowing it from a long distance with all the clients of Bean Machine D The final picture is lot of corpses all around the place blood spilled all around furniture destroyed... just like any good massacre.Of course if I want to destroy that beer pisswater I invest in Car Insurance and Logger first. Attacking clucking Bell is something amazing because you have to go to their installations and kill all its personel and trucks.I think at this point you can imagine the big world you can do by yourself in GTAV but's quite limited but the possibility to do your own is priceless.I would love for example the possibility to be a pimp earning money from the s in game or the opposite a pimp killer o a killer so whatever thing you chose triggers and unlocks almost enldess and realizable possibilities with tons of impromptu gang/mafia wars because all factions wants to rule the city just like you or you probably want to be a hero? or a dirty hero? You wanna help and deffend people or kill 'em all? traffiquing weapons people drugs organs whatever or challenging in random street races bidding your car selling stealling cars or recovering the ones which where stolen? Build your own territory as you grow earn the hate of other gangs deal your own business and rule Los Santos as you wish.But no this is a closed game inside an open world. Very funny you will spend lots of hours and yes GTAV is billions of years light beyod watch dogs.,Grand Theft Auto V

The single player stuff was great and the characters were spot on yet it falls short because I could only enjoy the singleplayer content I wouldn't pick this game up anymore due to the online community being very small its not worth the time to invest money or play anymore wait for another game unless you have friends to play with.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-16,0,0,155,False,Not Recommended,From what I experienced in the short time of 8.6 hours the game looks stunning! The new features such as first person ADS and the graphics are boast worthy. Before I get into my review I would like to list of my current PC specsGraphics card GEFORCE GTX 760Processor Intel Core I5 4670K CPU 3.40GHzInstalled Memory(RAM) 16.0GBSystem Type Windows 8 64 bitComputer name Jeff PC(I know how much RAM I came here with so don't even try and download any of mine..)The reason I am rating this game/review as a negative review is because The game is simply not ready. When first booting up GTA 5 Online the loading screens seem to take almost double the time it takes to load in on my 360. When Online does load up most of the map is invisible. It does load but it's slow. Highways roads overpasses buildings and railways just disappear if you go too fast in a vehicle. I was in first person and looked at how fast my car was going and it seems that anything faster than 60MPH(which is 1/3 of the top speed of exotic cars) makes the game start to disappear. I am unable to find anyone in any Online sessions. I have tried Rockstars troubleshoot without success. Rockstar suggests that I change my aiming type as people who use free aim are pooled with people who also selected free aim and people who choose assisted aim are pooled with assisted aim players. They suggest tweeking with those settings which I have without success.In conclusion I would rate the game 9/10 IF it were working correctly and IF Rockstar came through on everything that has been promised. This game has been delayed two years. Multiplayer is kill. Map loading is kill. Loading screens are kill. For now i'll give it a 2/10.Examples of things that are not kill would be Updated facial graphics of the protagonist you play as Online/Offline. They did a outstanding job of making my female character look delicious. Vehicles look slick. The dashboards are unique in every car and actually fuction properly. The faster you go the higher the needle climbs on the speedometer. The Climate/Weather in this game feels more real compared to 360 version. When it rains it really rains. Pools of water accumulate on the streets which makes for wet feet. This makes me wet just thinking about it. The ADS/Ironsights is a welcomed change. Guns feel the same as before but now you have options. I like the new gun animations for reloading.Thanks for reading my experience with GTA 5 for PC. I've explored vast amounts of Rockstar support articles with no known fixes of my issues i've stated. Or if there has been fixes they did not work clearly. If anyone has any suggestions or comments on fixes or how I can improve my grammer let me know. I welcome you grammer nazi's and trolls.I will re evaluate in two weeks.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-28,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,Grand theft loading screen 5 loading screen universe edition.This is a great game it is fun to play with friends lots of content mostly very well made but I just can't giver it a good review overall.Virtually everthing you do other than goofing around in your current session triggers a loading screen. Some of the loading screens literally have their own little loading screen before the real loading screen loads. Generally whenever I play I spend 5 minutes loading in 2 4 more minutes loading into a session with a friend then 2 5 more minutes loading into a mission if we're doing that.When playing alone it's much the same except once in the main game I spend 2 4 minutes loading a mission 1 minute unloading the mission when the host quits a few times etc.The point is THERE ARE A WHOLE ON OF LOADING SCREENS.Some of them may be to an extent unavoidable trade offs but they are none the less extremely unpleasant and more than a few are made much worse by bad UI design that puts the loading screens prior to any action you take that might fail (like matchmaking) often resulting in being kicked back to another loading screen before you can go back to the first loading screen to try loading again.To add insult to injury the game is chalk full of unskippable cutscenes that can't be avoided through any means at all no skipping no Alt F4 (you go right back to the cut scene!) no quitting the game normally etc. Some of which are ok but a lot of them are very boring and extremely long. Don't even get me started on the 10 minute intro to the god knows how long awful tutorial for multi player that can't be escaped if you mistakenly select it except by sitting out the 10 minutes of cinematic followed by some options 2 more minutes of cinematic and finally the option to quit and delete that character. Nevermind the fact that you also have to play a tutorial in the god damn storyline to get to the multiplayer more cutscenes there too never you worry.tl dr holy have I got the game for you loading/cutscene/thumbtwiddling lovers!All that said it's still fun just bring a hobbie to the table maybe some cards knitting chess whatever to do while you wait for every single action.Ps. If you don't have an above recommended CPU/HDD you should probably just give up.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-14,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game if you want to play with friends. The multiplayer support in this game is some of the worst I've ever experienced. The single player support is fine but you might as well buy a different GTA title for that experience.Multiplayer Issues The load times are ridiculously long for online mode especially when logging in. It will take a couple minutes to load into the online world every time you start the game. You can't join missions as a group. You can only join missions with friends from an invite or by starting a mission simultaneously and hoping you don't join different lobbies. If anybody leaves a mission then you will fail it and have to spend at least a minute driving back to mission start location. Online missions requires 2 or 4 players. You will occasionally need to split up if you have more than one friend. A team can only have on death per checkpoint. Expect to restart at checkpoints often because you die in a few hits and there's very little passive healing. AFK players can prevent you from continuing the mission.,Grand Theft Auto V

All the while there are hackers running around giving away millions rendering anyone who purchased a shark card an idiot. The story mode is superb.

2017-07-07,0,0,607,False,Recommended,GTAV is an amazing free world game. You can do anything from driving cars to commiting many felonies and getting away with them. In this game there isn't much consequence for crime. The story mode has a great plot and a touchy ending. The online mode is even better for doing whatever you want. Drink with your friends claim bounties arm wrestle do what ever you'd like. This is my favorite open world game and I would recommend it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-15,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,Grand Auto ImpoundI've been playing these games since the first one 20 years ago. And I remember the furore that surrounded the game when it launched and the attempts to get it banned. Ironic really the game was actually pretty tame compared to what they release today. I played right up to Vice City which was the high water mark for me but couldn't get into the later games when I rented them so haven't purchased one since Vice City. Sadly not a lot seems to have changed with these games. Pros The graphics do look good in places but still a little too cartoony. There's a wide rage of vehicles and motorcycles. It is still fun just to go on the run and try and loose the police. Some of the missions are fun and the game is still fun to play most of the time. The characters are good especially Trevor. The side games are good especially darts (but only from 301?) The storyline is pretty good but very predictable. The heist missions are good but there aren't many of them. The map is huge and just being able to drive around without restrictions was awesome. Cons The graphics have been updated but everything manages to look the same from the Interface to the fonts. It just looks cartoony and dated. Glitches and Bugs there are loads. Sometimes missions don't start unless they are triggered a specific way. One meant that I had to drive miles get out of the car and then walk miles otherwise the mission would not start. The DRM or whatever you want to call it is very annoying. To play the game you have to sign up for a Rockstar Social Club account even if you're only playing single player. The problem is this runs all the time in the background and when this has problems and it often does it ruins your game. Streets don't load (see screenshots) no cars no buildings and no map. At first I thought that I was running out of RAM or something. So I restarted the PC and loaded the game up again same problem. Went offline problem went away. This happens a lot. If you're playing single player you'd do better playing offline but even then the Social Club is still running. Cars are a waste of time. Seriously you can buy and mod cars but it is totally pointless. If you use them on a mission you lose them (pretty much every mission involves driving somewhere to start it and then getting into another vehicle which means you lose yours). You then have to travel to the impound and collect your car using a disposable car (otherwise you have to go fetch that one too). Sometimes your car is in the impound sometimes not. If not it is lost forever. I have lost so many cars this way. So now I end up keeping my expensive modded cars in the garage unused and drive around in the default car. Cars don't follow you or return to base. As mention above if you get out of your car and get into another vehicle you have to go to the impound to retrieve it. Why on earth the car just isn't transported to your house or the garage (like the default car) is beyond me and I can't help but think it is padding. You spend most of your time in the game driving to impound lot and back again as there is only two slots at the impound yard. Cars and vehicles aren't transferable between characters. If you go to the other characters house you find it locked and all vehicles gone. Stuck in the desert and want to borrow a chopper from another character to get home? Tough it is only there for one character. Yet inexplicably one of my character's vehicles is now in the possession of another character (it was at the impound lot for him not the owner) and there is no way of giving it back! There are simply no choices save for right at the end. The game is very linear. Why aren't there choices like in other games like Mass Effect Elder Scrolls Witcher etc? It isn't 1997 any more. It has a decent storyline at least in places but there is no way to influence it. Missions simply fail unless you do them the way you are meant to. This gets pretty boring pretty fast. The gameplay is pretty repetitive. Drive to mission start mission. Shoot all red dots. No don't get inventive shoot all the red dots the right way or you fail. The weapons are pretty dull the missions are fairly dull (some are OK and some are good) and the side missions are pretty poor (and just repeat). The AI is awful. I don't remember it being this bad in the games from 10 years ago or in Mafia but cars inexplicably drive into walls. Pedestrians and drivers call you a maniac and run away from you for driving perfectly normally. The city just doesn't seem real. Ten years ago you'd have a glitch or quirk in Vice City where if you turned your back on a street and then turned back facing it again all the cars pedestrians etc would change. Unbelievably that still happens! You only have enough money to buy the boats helicopters and planes right at the end of the game when there is no reason to do so. Re playability is pretty low. ConclusionIf you've played previous games you've seen it all before from the missions the gameplay to the glitches and bugs. There's nothing new here and after completing the game I stopped playing. I really can't see myself playing again. I did try playing online once I think maybe twice but it was more of the same but not as good and so I stopped. All in all a decent game but there is little to nothing new here. I certainly won't be buying the next one and may wait another ten years before dipping my toe into the franchise again. If you haven't played a GTA game before then it is certainly worth getting this one if you have wait till it is pretty cheap.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 905977132http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 905976944http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 905976256,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-14,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"With rumors that the next GTA will be unavailable until 2020 you have plenty of time to pick this game up if you haven't already.I puchased this game on PC and Xbox One when it came out due to my friends being split between worlds and not once have I questioned my purchase(s).We all know the GTA story and we all know what we are getting ourselves into when we start up a Rockstar game but I can't repeat myself enough about how enjoyable this one really is.I have nothing major to complain about other than the customization for characters is in depth yet somehow it still sucks... I feel like Rockstar is always trying to be unique in which they are successful at but sometimes just doing the normal customization with a zillion options is all people really want. I'm not a fan of this copy and paste heritage thing they have going on with no real options besides hair and makeup.Plenty of positives though!! The online community is very active. The devs are also always creating updates and free stuff. YES FREE!! Unlike a lot of other games where you pay for all of the ""dlc"" Rockstar just kind of gives it to you and sends you an email letting you know that something new was added to the game. They aren't small things either. They add entire scenarios vehicles heists motorcycle crews and plenty more. The graphics are stunning for being 2 years old and aren't very GPU needy. I run it on 2 computers. One with a R9 390x and one with a R7 and between the almost 5 year gap in my cards there is only a huge difference when running it on the higher settings. The 390x can run on max just fine but the R7 struggles higher than default ""high"" settings. Also let's just be real here...

I went ahead and changed the controls so that the mouse controls the pitch and stuff for the planes and helicopters. Also I turned the sensitivity for the mouse during flight way down...just gives it an easier feel I think.Murdered A Hooker With A Hatchet 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

I was cautious before preordering it but i only preordered it because the recommended specs were very very reasonable. right after launch they did change the recommended processor from a Q6600 to a higher end i5 however. The game and story itself is amazing but the consant stuttering annoyances really make me feel crummy when im trying to get immersed into the game. honestly they should have made the system requirements way higher to be honest with people but hey i know its a jumbled mess with people with worse rigs that can atleast keep a constant 60.

2015-08-12,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V's story is as great as it was on consoles. Unfortunately GTA V Online has been overrun be hackers. Ever since I started playing GTA Online almost every server I've joined I've either been showered with money I'd like to have earned myself or I've been killed repeatedly by a hacker. The hackers or ""modders"" as they've gone to calling themselves have made scripts to make players in their session explode at will and have pretty much made the online mode unplayable.To anyone who sees this review please know what you're spending your hard earned money on. As of right now GTA Online is broken and has been overrun by hackers. I hope Rockstar is working on a solution because this might just be the end of GTA Online on PC. Right now I'd strongly recommend potential Steam users from buying this until Rockstar has addressed the hackers and the state of GTA Online.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-08-12,0,0,967,False,Not Recommended,While the game is entertaining and sometimes exciting GTA Online and Story Mode have a long list problem that would just give me numerous painful headaches. 1. For some reason GTA Online would just randomly time out. Normally this wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that its f#cking takes a long time to go back to Story Mode and to try and go back to GTA Online. 2. Whether I'm in Story Mode or GTA Online my screen would just would have the worst lag spikes ever when I'm driving. At first the screen wouldn't lag very much but after an hour or two I lose to ability to even control my car because of how horrible the lag spikes are. Also I've noticed that others that experience these form lag spikes from reading numerous GTA Forums. So Rockstar just do us all a f cking favor and fix this sh t because its annoying. 3. The method the Heists were created was not the best way at all. First of all the way a player is put in a session would be useless if a player can't communicate with another player because they speak different languages. I swear its annoying when I'm trying to tell a player what to do and I figure out they speak a different language. I think the best solution is to sort players in a session with similar languages. Second of all if a player fails his objective or decides to quit a heist the session automatically ends and all other players have no choice but to go to Freemode. If I was in the group of people that GTA Online for PC I would recommend that they should do what Payday 2 did and let the player choose whatever heist that is available. 4. The amount of s in GTA Online is so high that I don't even think I can count that high. The sad thing is that the amount of body armor and snacks wouldn't help you against a hardcore as they mow you down like f#cking road kill. The smartest thing to fix this situation is to make body armor and snacks give you more health and to make them automatically equipable rather than manually. 5. The amount of hackers and modders in GTA Online is so high that I don't think that Rockstar care about them anymore. Rockstar promised that they wouldn't punish every modder but I have yet see any form of righteous justice towards modders since almost every question I see in the Comment Notifications are about people associating with modders but not actually being modders which isn't righteous justice. My point is that every GTA series in the future will be worth unplayable until countless changes are to be made.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you have friends to play with.

2017-08-18,0,0,1335,False,Recommended,Having put over 700 hours into this game (the vast majority of which has been online) I feel safe leaving a review.First off this game despite being a few years old is still one of the most visually stunning games in my library. If you have a GPU capable of putting everything to max settings then you will be as floored as I was about how majestic the game looks. I never thought I'd be taken by textures but holy They look almost real at max settings.Regarding Online what other reviews say is true it's very grindy almost in a Pay 2 Win sense. The best vehicles and weapons are expensive but are still very achievable if you are willing to put in the hours. More often that not however I am able to complete missions Online with little to no opposition from other players. For the most part other players are trying to make money same as me. And if someone is griefing you? One can always find a new server. That said getting bombed to oblivion by a on a flying motorcycle can be annoying... at least until you get one of your own or one of the several Anti Air options available and then blast the f***er out of the sky.Plus if you just want to drive around and enjoy the view you can always enable passive mode and watch the chaos unfold right in front of you.Oh and since the whole R* vs Mods debacle I have seen very very few modders online. And even then they aren't messing with people nearly as often. In the old days it wasn't uncommon to log into a populated server and find modders spamming UFOs onto the streets or griefing for the hell of it. Nowadays any modder that pulls that kinda stunt usually disappears pretty quick either by getting kicked or in a vain attempt to escape the consequences. That said the Online environment is a lot more friendly than it used to be.I've actually seen an influx of new players recently a great sign IMO. People are still willing to pay $60 because it is still a fantastic game (whining teens aside).,Grand Theft Auto V

I purchased GTAV from Steam so I could play on my PC that I am so much more comfortable using. I am almost 60 years old and I have never held a Playstation controler and it is very painful for my hands. Not to mention the challenge of learning the hows and whats of a forieng device! STEAM has been awesome and I was extremely pleased because I am Retired Disabled Veteran with a limited fixed income so I was very happy when I saw that GTAV was finally out for PC and on sale to enjoy on the STEAM Platform by STEAM and for use In STEAM using my PC. Well it does not work on my PC. My PC cant haldle it so I hope to be able to get a fresh new one someday. I explained to STEAM Support my situation and asked for help to get it to work or if not could I have credit to find another game or a refund? They said NO WAY! And that I have been playing the game for 100+ hours! I explaind that I have been playing but only on my PS4 and its a completely different full version that I paid for but my STEAM copy of the game I bought from STEAM wont install on my PC. I asked that they simply look at my account where it clearly shows that the copy of the game I purchased on STEAM has never EVER opened..

2015-04-28,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,SP review It's got some good things in it but with all the issues at launch and even two weeks later it's better to wait till they get it stabilized.On the fun factor it was fun but it felt a little empty. There are numerous locations that you have no reason to visit because no missions take you there and there's no activities or anything to do.Flying is trash because even with a skill level of 100 you're constantly being hit with absurd and unreal amounts of turbulence.The sheer amount of waves everywhere means you'll be in the air half the time while using any watercraft which makes it a to control.FPS mode is a blast but the pathetic FOV slider makes driving in FPS an absolute pain.Your characters change clothes and their hair styles if you don't switch back to them constantly which makes customization a pain. Your clothing inventory does not allow you to save an outfit you've mixed and matched so every time a character decides to change their clothes you have to go back home and put on your preferred clothing again. Often you'll find your character has thrown on some sunglasses which dims everything if you're in FPS mode and can't be disabled until you go home and remove the glasses.Controls are restrictive if using a controller as all the profiles are pretty much the same and not very customizable.There is some fun to be had but factoring in major launch issues control issues stability issues and everything else I just can't recommend it until the price drops and they fix the damn game.,Grand Theft Auto V

There is an obvious solution to fighting hackers ruining the online economy of GTA remove the online economy. Make the game a sandbox and free for all and let this game run its course.

2015-06-21,0,0,110,False,Recommended,First of all let me say that GTA V is one heck of a port on PC.It makes GTA IV look like garbage atleast for what it was during the first few days during launch.Secondly I'd like to point out that the PC version of GTA V is most definitly a considerably huge upgrade over the Xbox one/ PS4 version. The story is quite excellent actually some people might say GTA IV story was better. Which might be the case but I personally think GTA V has a pretty good story by itself. The ability to switch between the 3 characters in game is pretty sweet. I personally hope they might consdier building upon this for future games but we'll see. Gorgeous open world you can see they put quite some extra work into the PC version it was worth every penny to me. Unless you're a heavy completionist reloading save after save to get every nick and dime out of the first playthrough this game will offer countless hours of replay value.One of the things that I though personally could've been done better was You can literally go through the entire game without upgrading anything at all. It felt like it was kind of obsolete even bothering upgrading the weapons or cars at all. Some of the side missions started to feel a bit generic after a while while it took a heck of a time before that happened it could use some work as well.I'd personally give the game a 9 / 10 and it's a must buy for any GTA fan out there.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-22,0,0,244,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V is an absolutely fun game where unlike the previous Grand Theft Auto games everything about it screams of satirical elements. Out of the three (not counting MP) characters you can play Franklin an ex gangbanger and Michael a heister who faked his own death want out of their previous lives yet keep getting sucked back into them one way or another. The third one Trevor is a psychopath through and through and wants to free one of his and Michael's former crewmates from prison as well as run an industry based on illegal weapons and other substances.It's been a while since I last played the story though so let's focus on the better half of the game.Online.The biggest differences between SP and MP besides the obvious multiplayer element are as follows 1) In single player when you shoot the legs of an enemy they lay on the ground shooting you if you don't finish them off. In multiplayer they decide to say f*** bullet wounds that would normally cripple me I'm getting back up and running for cover.2) Multiplayer has the ability to buy your own properties.3) The not so obvious repercussions with a moddable game and multiplayer Script kiddies. Some of them present interesting challenges such as filling a downtown street with UFOs and a legion of rocket slinging Lesters others will ruin servers and oftentimes the game itself for everyone playing with them. As it seems so far Rockstar has been doing nothing to cull this issue as of yet ever since they rescinded their modding ban and it has gotten out of control.Other than those differences here's pro cons. Everyone likes those.PROS +Great graphics*+Benchmark tests+Shooting and hitboxes work well together+Bipolar community+Driving works great+Wanted system works great+Balance between pay to win and effort to win online.*With one small issueCONS Graphics are built for 4K resolutions anything smaller will randomly see odd shapes on surfaces every so often like Michael's house's doorway. GTA Online has an aforementioned ""hacker"" problem Bipolar communityUNDECIDED/EQUAL Very strange TV shows in game. Most radio stations are rap or some sort of techno/dubstep stations. There's 1 rock station 1 pop and 1 country. The rest is rap or techno/dubstep. REDICULOUSLY stupid NPCs. I can't tell you how many times I've fired a gun and seen civilians run into freaking out high speed roads like dodos of a cliff... And not to mention driving NPCs are even more of a pain especially if traffic is enabled during a race. These sheeple doo make fun memories though.All in all it is a great game but with a few minor issues.And to all of the bad reviews based on a raise in price for a sale The game itself is not on sale but the bundles are for the price of the game. GTAV is a big game that recently came out for PC you will not get your 25 50% off on it. You're all lucky that it is on sale the way it is.",Grand Theft Auto V

We finally got what we wanted too bad it wasn't done right. Yes you can do multiplayer and have a ton of fun if you do a private game with a friend but I recommend staying off the public servers with a lot of people. No I'm not salty because my super expensive car got destroyed that's a part of the game. I did find it rather annoying that if you attack another player in the game you are charge a lot of money for it. You can assign bounties but the player that collects the bounty is charged for having killed the player with the bounty and usually charged and insane amount for insurance for having blown up their vehicle in the process. It's a flawed system that forces you to run usually boring missions to grind for cash just to have fun in PVP around San Andres. Remove the fines for doing PVP and it would be great fun.I'm not going to recommend this game simply because the big feature of the game the multiplayer isn't all that good. If you really enjoyed playing the other games then get this just for the single player mode alone. Was good fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-28,0,0,51,False,Recommended,Offline game is very very good.Online is ing Terrible. Typical Online session 5 6 minutes to get into the game from the desktop 60 seconds of wandering around trying to find something interesting to do then while you're looking at your phone some high ranked driving a custom Pagani murders you in a drive by and taunts in the chat. Respawn in the same area and get killed by the same before you can get off the street. Repeat until rage quit.If you do actually get into some activity the load times are awful. I just spent 30 minutes in the game only 7 of which were actually playing! 7 damn minutes! There are 3 or 4 different screens to go through before starting each race event or job each of which has to load in and then you have to wait for everyone to ready up at EACH screen. Even quitting a race or job takes forever because you basically can't. You are stuck in the activity until its finished then you have to select 'return to free mode' and then wait AGAIN for everyone else to decide what they're going to do. ARGHHHHHHH!By all means play the single player. It is very good. Just set your expectations VERY low for the online.,Grand Theft Auto V

The first person mode adds even more in depth gameplay to it. The only problem with this is the abundance of hackers in gta online. they spawn in people on your back they can give you free money which seems like a good thing but it can get you banned so if you see it dont take it. The mods made by the community are good as well look around on the internet for some of those. I have transferred my account over from xbox and it is very simple to do if you have played this on console. you just have to do the prologue. It has violence and vulgar language etc in it but if i had to give this a rating i would give it a 8/10. the only negatives are hackers and the language and violence. But if you are 17 or older there is nothing wrong with those two things well there shouldnt be. Must Buy game 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Free roam with friends can be just as fun as playing missions gained via cell phone calls death match modes found in various areas of the map or custom user created race tracks throughout the world. There's an impressive amount of customization options for your character vehicles and apartments. With regular updates Rockstar is doing a great job of keeping the Online portion active and evolving not to mention the impressive video editor helpful for YouTube creators. With or without friends this is definitely an experience you have to try.,Grand Theft Auto V

The main thing is that you have to but money!!!Without having any money to spend you end up wanting to hack the game which results in a game ban which is exactly what I did!So unless you wanna spends hundreds of dollars or end up doing missions for your whole life this game is bad for the poor.Not recommended!

2015-04-25,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Pros Graphics Gameplay mechanics Lots of little things to doCons Story line is weak. Basicly if you have watched any great crime movie or tv show then this game won't surprise you. Characters are boring and nonmemorable (depends on your tastes). Remember CJ? OG Loc? Big Smoke? Tenpenny? Now those were memorable characters. I could not connect or sympathize to any of the main or side characters at all. It just felt like watchin a freakin soap opera of WHO GIVES A . Heists (main focus of the game) are boring and unsatisfying but this just depends on your personal tastes. I had more fun recruiting gang members and doing drive bys in SA. Overall this game was disappoiting. Maybe my expectations were too high maybe I'm still hung up on the nostalgic greatness of San Andreas maybe I expected this to be better than SA but whatever the reason...this game aint for me.

GTA V is a good game.Has a decent but not a great story.Singeplayer is very fun although online isn't as fun as it seems.The crappy money block is terrible.I literally can't even go do a decent heist without an 11 year old saying that i am the noob or give me all the money or im leaving the heist.Pathetic.Once i even asked a person if he knows how to do a mission.No response.Ends up failing miserably and leaves heist.And then matchmaking doesn't get you any players at all.So you are left with the missions that give you small amounts of cash.Which gives barely any money.Like the store you rob gives u 2k right?And when i went to the hat shop i saw that one of the hats costed 25K.WTF.IS THIS SOME SORT OF JOKE??!?!?!?!

2015-04-14,0,0,538,False,Recommended,Having put 150 hours into the 360 version of this game I can say this is a vast improvement. Not only visually but in the playstyle as well. I see that a lot of people are having issues with the game and all I can say is that I haven't had any issues and I'm running on 8 gb of RAM and a 750 TI 2GB SC. Getting a solid 60 frames on some mid range settings. The technical issues are a big problem but will surely be fixed within a week of release. Rockstar isn't known for their stelar releases but they usually fix them pretty quick. To those coming from console versions you will notice better graphics provided you have a capable PC. To those who have never played the game oh boy are you in for a treat with this one. This is simply a game you must own regardless on what platform you play it on. The constant online updates that the devs give adds a nice flare to an already mouthwatering and addictive multiplayer. I give this a 9/10 only off by 1 point because of current technical issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-19,0,0,95,False,Recommended,I love GTA. I've played through almost all of them since 3 and gone back to play them again in most cases. V was a breath of fresh air after the grittiness and focus on story over mechanics from IV. Having 3 characters work together through the campaign keeps things interesting and makes for a varied experience as you play through. I think most people think of themselves as a Michael but in reality play like Trevor. Trevor is the epitome of the GTA type player. He says what he thinks he'll kill you for looking at him funny and he has no moral bones in his entire body.The online is great for passing time. You can log in and actually earn some money doing races/missions/heists. Or you can just drive around stealing cars and shooting at people. The one warning I'd give for anyone playing this game. Don't waste your money on the shark cards. Yes it'll get you into end game online content instantly without the grind. But there are so many hackers in this game it's always a 50/50 risk when you log in online you might get blown up from across the map banned or repeatedly shot and blown up for no reason whatsoever. It doesn't take away from the fun of playing GTA. But it does make you regret spending real cash.Also the load time for online is ridiculous. Sometimes you'll sit there for 5 10 min before even getting in game. Once you do though... I've probably spent 20 hours just trying to break into the secret military base and steal a Jet. Something that is infinitely easier once you can buy a hangar for your smuggling operations in the base. But it's still a great feeling to break into the base steal a jet and fly around shooting things and launching missiles. This game could have been even better but it's still pretty amazingly fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,185,False,Recommended,Having external accounts to link is a pain in the and should not be approved by steam. Story wise game seems interesting. Scripted events make your life harder instead of easier is pretty stupid. There are memorable worth while story missions that will certainly make you smile but theyre not without their glitches and prepare for tons of stupid to kill you.Single player good but has its glitches had some crashing issues too. Its a very beautiful game landscape wise combat is a bit lack luster as it is mostly hide behind something peak out kill a guy hide again rinse until all are dead. They did go a good job on some missions with limited guards and very hand holding linear kill this guy now move sort of play. Like any GTA most people I think play for the story and this one so far has made me smile and was pretty good. For 60 dollars the game is far better than most of the crap out there.Multiplayer is total aids gta online is absolutely worthless and stupid. Loading screens are up more than the game. Its awful single player is worth it but sadly gta online was a flop. Used to be great but now not so much.Crashes I have had numerous random crashes usually during loads one of which green screened me and forced a hard restart. It might be bugs not really sure whats causing all of the weird things but beyond these unusual crashes/freezes the game seems pretty well optimized.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,219,False,Not Recommended,"Im going to be very clear because i dont want to lie to myself. I have never once bought a gta game with the intent of playing the story. I know crazy right?The thing about gta back in the day was that it had a special unique style of gameplay with an openworld that was truley a sandbox. My favorite gta is GTAIV. The city felt alive and the amount of interaction the player had with the world was some of my most cherished and well regaurded moments of my gaming history........AND THIS GAME THREW IT ALL OUT THE ING WINDOW!Gtav does not deserve the title of ""sandbox game."" More like bare bones by the books nonsense that has been done better by other companys and previous installments. Like seriously what the hell happend? If you compare the sandbox openworld content of gta4 and 5 you reveal how pityful and laughable 5 is. Npcs have 2 personallitys traits run away and fight back. The cops are completly stupid in how they persue and engage the target gunplay is arguably worse and the reactions to being shot are non existant. The parkour system was taking out so for all i care the city could be as beautiful as it wants but it adds nothing to gameplay. Gta4's new york felt like a real place with places and setpieces that added to gameplay. In gtav it all seems unnesasary and forced. The subway was a part of new york that had people and cops but everyplace underground in los santos makes the cops scratch their damn heads. There is nothing to do! any semblence of a interesting locations are reserved for the singeplayer and almost all the buildings are completly unaccesable in multiplayer.Ok so we established the open world in general is vastly inferior to gta4 right?So what about the multiplayer? they advertised it as the best fuggin thing ever made. it will blow your socks off.... no... its stupid.... I firmly believe there is nothing redeeming about gta online besides the fact you can play with friends.If you enjoy pvp gamemodes and lackluster racing that is better in other titles try the multiplayer!If you are one of those loser kids that gets beaten by dad so the only way to get revenge on the world is by killing random players WITH XP LOCKED AND MONEY LOCKED GUNS. play the multiplayer!IF YOU WANA BUY A IN IN GAME VEHICLE THAT WITH MICROTRANSACTIONS COSTS MORE THAN THE ING GAME HOLY GUACOMOLY YOU GOT URSELF A DEAL LADIES AND GENTS. NOT TO MENTION THE CONTENT THEY PUMP OUT FOR MULTIPLAYER IS JUST CARS AND FREE MODE PVP AND THE FREE MODE GETS WORSE WITH EACH UPDATE I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY.This game is just sickening to think about how the mighty have fallen to such lows.....................but hey i heard the singeplayer story is good so theres that",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-01,0,0,339,False,Recommended,"Before i get to anything....To all the negative reviewers saying that modding the game gets you banned. Let me just say Rockstar IS NOT responsible for all the bad luck that has been thrown on you for Installing mods. Mods means modifying the game. Which also means the game is no longer vanilla. You have changed the coding of the game. This is why you should wait before installing any mods early in the game. all games are meant to be played the way it is even with its own cheats implemented in the game. not add new ones which would possibly break the game. Now that i made myself clear back to the Positive review of this game*not that good of a reviewer btw just a disclaimer* c Grand Theft Auto V Single player is just amazing. PC Capabilities of holding these massive graphics made the game so beautiful. The 3 characters each with their own unique traits and backstories brings you closer to wanting to know the character. Especially Franklin because ****spoiler alert*** he will be the one that makes the final decision. And finally. the Heist Missions in the game are so well done. The performance the crew does depends on the person you hire for the job. Whether he is good or not will impact the heist.GTA Online.Been Playing online for a bit. and tbh there are its quirkyness in here. For example when you try to join a job and it dosent let you Getting out of the job takes a very long time. This is pretty painful for us because apparently when a ""session is full"" you will have to go to another session to play something else and not the session you are playing in now.the Heists in GTAO are very well done still. Requiring full teamwork with your friends with each of them set with their own role in the heist. Customization is much better than Last Gen and you are able to fine tune your characters more. Even tho you still have to choose your heritage. Customization for females however. Certain hats seem like that they are too big to fit on the females head and looks like its floating instead. Hopefully Rockstar will retweak this.Well i try to do the best i can to get you guys to buy this game. Tho if you want to mod the game i wouldnt recommend doing that so early.",Grand Theft Auto V

You can drive cars fly planes shoot a random person on the street and can become a CEO or/and Motercycle crew. There is just so much you can do!

Variety of characters great story line just a lot of fun!Online. I don't understand why everyone thinks its P2W everyone wants the game to be easy and for them to get all the perks and all the additional vehicles and such from minimum game time.If it was this easy then every player would have everything and it would be absolute madness nothing would be special. It should be an achievement if you manage to save up enough money for something mad saying this i've only put in 20 hours on this version but have earnt &gt GTA$ 700 000 half my time has been spent roaming around too. (I have played a lot of bunker series which is 2x $ &amp XP though to be fair)The developers have been constantly updating this game with free DLC since it has been released no other game does this! Each dlc has brought so much extra to the game.In regards to hackers I havn't run into one yet so this every single server has a hacker bs is a lie peeps are just butthurt. I'm sure i'll be annoyed when it happens but EVERY SINGLE GAME HAS HACKERS.The ammount of negative reviews on steam just because of hackers is ing ridiculous cheats and hacks evolve all the time to avoid anti cheat.

2017-12-28,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,It's a pretty good Single Player experience but Online play is an utter disappointment and the primary reason I won't be buying RDR2. The microtransactions are virtually mandatory unless you're willing to hack or grind for hundreds of hours. Finding a solid group to do heists with is virtually impossible. The PVP is the biggest joke I've ever seen I don't know anyone who has ever had an enjoyable experience playing it. The racing is KINDA fun but it's often ruined by lag and connection issues.Rockstar really just went full moneygrub on this one they realized they could charge for in game currency so they took advantage of it as much as possible. The amount of money required to buy in game vehicles is comical. For a regular person not willing to spend money on this dumb garbage I'd honestly recommend just hacking. You're probably not going to get caught unless you're blatant and you'll save yourself hundreds of hours of grinding. In exchange you'll probably only have fun for about 10 20 hours with your newfound wealth which just shows you how it wasn't worth it at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-29,0,0,2914,False,Recommended,These days people blame EA for lootboxes and microtransactions on the other hand GTA is a pinnacle of it!. Aside from what the game actually is (which is truly awesome including both single and multiplayer) the huge cost of buying equipment and business is the ultimate downside of this game. Unfortunately the cost of shark cards is more than double the cost of entire game right now which is quite embarassing tbh. Rockstar could have been manage this by significantly reducing the price of old dlc items so that the newcomers and regular players could get some benefit out of it but that never seem to happen.Even if you are considering to buy it right now you may get it at the discounted price but do keep this in your mind that GTA online is gonna take a lot of grinding.PS I wont be bias towards the game because of microtransactions.There is still a lot in this game which you could play and enjoy without even buying every single dlc item.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's worth playing but don't really see the need for a replay.GTA Online There's a significent hacker/cheater presence I've been robbed from all my in game money once due to a hacker emptying my in game bank account. No idea how this process works but there it is. Also GTA Online does update regulary with new content but the problem is that everytime something new comes the old doesn't become better so in the end you have a lot of small extensions instead of a few large pieces of content. They could just choose to expand on what they have for instance the CEO business and lately the Doomsday Heist update why can't it simply be an extension of the Bunker? Or the casino and real estate updates that may happen in the future be an extension of the Executives and Other Criminals? It makes sense to me to go to my office and do administration and the regular odd job to keep business flowing.Well if you wanna have fun in GTA Online play with at least one friend not with random players. Because most fun content are for 2+ players. Often the content is too difficult for random players and they keep messing up the mission with futile attempts. But for all the bad points GTA Online has some good points too and is semi soloable for those who just want to play in the GTA V world with Online content but not be disturbed by random players or hackers. With some firewall settings you can prevent other people from being in the same server as you. Useful for vehicle outsourcing without getting your prize vehicle get blown to bits by some triggerhappy player in a Hydra.As a conclusion I'd say it's worth buying should be in any true gamer's arsenal in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,This game is good. However I will not recomend it for you. There is usually two reasons people buy their games on PC it is your main platform and/or you like modding. Rockstar or Take Two has quite litteraly broken modding on PC which makes the PC version viable only if you have not played the game before. Seing GTA V sold 80 000 000 copies there is a big chance you got a copy of the game on some console be it PS3 PS4 or any of the Xboxes. Hence there is no point to buying the game for PC. I really hope Rockstar can see that modders are not the same as hackers and unban OpevIV. I hope Rockstar gets scared and supports mods in a better way in the future. Maybe they will allow Online moding not the kind that gives you infinite ranks and money but the kind that gives you a different experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

There are many aspects that will make u regret it real fast not to mention heists take some time to complete even with the fastest premade group and 1 person can just dc and ruin it all in the middle or end of it all in all its got a solid campaign single player and the pvp aspect of the game is neat although money is an issue in this game and if u dont ''pay to win'' or better yet ''pay to shine'' then ur probably end up doing heists which gets us back to the start.If u can get this game from any LEGAL source like or somin for 25 bucks then its a good purcahse for anything more then that i wouldnt recommend it imo its one of the games its creator should straight up come out and apologize for the trillion bugs that ruined it!(x rebirth lords of fallen kinda game),Grand Theft Auto V

What I think of GTA V is that the single player was fun and I lovr the fact that you control 3 different characters but for me personally I would make the game a bit longer and give more freedom to when it come to planning a heist. I am currently busy playing GTA V Online. I am only about 2 weeks busy online now and one of the firts things I picked up that I would have added toe the online version is that you have the ability toe do a atm transfer of money from your bank account to one of your friends of crew members. I would also loved if you had the ability to buy vehicles and clothing that you can give to your friends and crew or even just for thr people helping you run your businesses. For me personally I love GTA V Online a lot and would like to invite everyone to join us online.Best wishes to allG Man signing off,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-06,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,A great game and very much improved from the original game on the Last generation consoles. The story mode is content filled and the introduction of First Person and improved graphics is always a plus. Story mode remains mostly the same since the release and though it is very enjoyable and worth the price GTA Online is where it's at. Recieving new and content filled updates ( if you're willing to get the money to enjoy it ).However it's plagued by modders and it simply ruins your gameplay. The only times you will wanna play is if you have friends and you play on an invite only session. To join a public server is the same as asking to get banned. As many other reviewers have written you may join a game suddenly and a modder simply spawn in money for you. Rockstar's system detects this and will ban you. I've been banned twice for joining a public server and at your third strike I am at risk of being banned for 30 years. The point being at this current state of the game you will never want to go online in a public server. Inconclusion unless you have friends you'll have to risk getting banned constantly ( and eventually permanently ) to even hopefully get the enjoyment out of the Online portion of the game you are missing out on a huge part of what this game offers. Even though I love this game at it's current state I would not recommend it for any buyers unless they simply want the singleplayer option.,Grand Theft Auto V

Unless this is somehow overturned such hostile actions towards fair use and freedom can only compel me to give this game a negative review to show my dissatisfaction with the publisher. Rockstar could make this right I'm sure.See comment ""Rockstar has rescinded the Cease and Desist letter to the OpenIV crew and OpenIV is back.

It is just pure gaming fun distilled to 1000% proof! The way you switch between three very different characters keeps it interesting and at times hilarious (Trevor!) and the whole place just feels so alive like no game ive seen even down to getting flipped off by npc drivers when you prang their car! There is so much depth to the game the random people you come across asking for help and starting a mini mission and your options as to wether to help or.. well.. no no spoilers here ) The vehicles and their upgrades the sports the heists!! the stock market the properties and businesses available to buy and run the friends and families of each character and of course what would GTA be without the strippers and ladies of the night! I was a HUGE fan of GTA vice city and that game took the franchise to another level for me. Although I've loved all the subsequent GTA's to some degree i think this is the first time rockstar have really topped vice city with style. (plz plz plz do a vice city remake with the gta v engine though!!!) To me this is what gaming is about being dropped into another living breathing world where you can do whatever you want. Drive carefully and wait for the green light... or get out and waste everyone in sight (except the puppydogs ofc!) with sniper rifle/sawn off shotgun/stinger missiles or knuckle dusters and try to outrun the law on land sea and air! oh.. and now and then actually play the amazing storyline out...

2015-12-15,0,0,5082,False,Not Recommended,Used to be a good game back when it came out. Now GTAV has been forgotten and GTAOnline has been utterly ruined by R*. Get it if you like paying sh*t tons of money (irl) to get anything cool in game cause it's all stupidly over priced or if you like spending every waking second grinding. Graphics are pretty unimpressive now too honestly. Glitches and Bugs and R* doesn't care at all all they care about is selling Shark Cards. GTAOnline should have literally been a new an improved version of the old SA MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) not a half as*ed 'pay to win' turd sh*t out by a company who's glory days have long since passed. One Lowrider cost me 4Mil$ an it wasn't even fully customized luckily I didn't waste 49.99$ on that sh*t (thanks to modders dropping money lol). Get it if you have money to waste. If not download it for free online and play Story Mode once then delete it cause the replay value is pretty low nowadays. Sad that this game was murdered it could have been so great. Should have saved my 60$ for Just Cause 3...or anything else.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-24,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,This is the game that could have been and it'll always remain like that until R* and/or Taken decide to open up custom servers. Until then the game will be limited by the poor choices the dev and publisher made.What I liked Optimized game. this game runs smoothly on a 4y/o PC (Phenom 2 x6 8GB RAM R9 270X) when this game released for PC and it ran above 40FPS. Lots of things to do with friends. Just whatch N&amp B's videos in YouTube to get a glimpse of that. The editor. You can now make your own machinima! The story. It's amazing it's deep and gets to you in a deep level and takes you on a long trip. The added features. The weapon roundel/selector tool the first person view these really change how the gameplay flows.What I didn't like GTA ONLINE The grindfest. The online mode is fun the first few times you try the same missions but when you really want to get something new (like a car a condo etc) the missions become repetitive because they deliver so little money each time you'll have to repeat them 8+ times to get something good. GTA ONLINE you stole it... But not quite. Luxury cars you stole you don't get to keep them their excuse (a fair one) is that they have a tracking device and that's why you can't own it unless you purchase it. Which brings you back to previous point. SHARKCARDS the greed. So if you don't want to spend days or weeks grinding for that awesome sports car or condo you have the choice to spend real money to get it faster. It's not my thing but be my guest. Aggresive citizens. Remember how in GTA IV the citizens didn't start a gift just for looking at them? How cars stopped when you were in the middle of the road? This is LS baby Lossantonios have no time for your bullpoop. Also cops shoot you if you stay near them long enough. Non enterable buildings. It's 2017 (I know it was released earlier) and seriously... We can't have enterable buildings on free roam mode?! GTA IV HAD THEM!!! C'mon R*! GTA ONLINE THE PARTY POOPERS. You want to rule your own server? For some reason you want to challenge your friends in a chicken race? You want to shoot cars out of your gun? Too bad R* doesn't like any of that. No private/rental servers No mods no workshop only the poop they want you to have.So yeah for those and many more reasons GTA V will remain as the game that it could be. Think of the GTA version of PokemonGO. My tip buy it on sale and play the story it's still worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now there's one thing I have to say if you can't afford a good PC that can at least run this game it will be useless to you unless you watch some video to teach you how to make your FPS better which I don't recommend because the whole part of the game is it's beautiful graphics. It makes the gameplay a whole new experience. There's more than sitting around and trying to level up there's racing to gain money missions from the storyline or multiplayer and more! Some write reviews about modders in the multiplayer but really if you see one and despise them leave the session join a new one to enjoy Grand Theft Auto 5! If that doesn't work go make yourself a private session for your friends and enjoy hanging out without stupid people online that ruin the fun. Pros Amazing Graphics! Good Gameplay Good Storyline Helpful Community (Depends on your session) Controller Compatibility (I don't use one) Cons Needs A Good Computer Modders (I already gave you the solution to that) Nothing Else I Guess...I would give this game a solid 9/10 all games has its flaws but there's always a method to get around them.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,0,0,311,False,Not Recommended,"If you compare GTA San Andreas with GTA V you will notice that the older one had much more enjoyable content and is a way better game than any sequels (other than the fact that is is heavily outdated).Now with GTA V/Online you have a washed out story a horribly empty map with only 1/3 of San Andreas and a ed up Multiplayer that purely relies on the few people that actually do spend money on ""micro"" transactions because Pay to win OBVIOUSLY makes a great game.You will have to spend months on repetitive grinding on the already repetitive content to actually achieve or buy something and when it comes to the world itself... its just stupid... the world of GTA SA was interesting believable immersive and you could do so much fun things. Pumping yourself up betting on horse races spending time in casinos shooting up burger shops cheating (oh man i loved the cheat codes) flying jetpacks having girlfriends and maaany many more. And if you got bored the modding community got your back.With GTA V you will experience a useless 60+ Gb download no fun cheats in the singleplayer but a lot of cheaters in the multiplayer (except yourself) stupid childish humor and unimmersive content repetitive ""missions"" a bad story no modding support a worse than usual MMO feeling without sense and while Rockstar s its own game with stupid 7 year old content WE as players arent allowed to.GTA is/was fun because YOU and ONLY YOU were the thing interrupting this living breathing world. Something that tries to be something and you just come up with a rocket launcher and up. A world that becomes your personal playground a world in which you can rob people and literally destroy their lives. With GTA V Rockstar is robbing you destroying your life/experience.Nowadays you will be left alone with an empty singleplayer and a terrifying Multiplayer which is not worth a single penny because it only tries to keep up the playtime while ripping you off with microtransactions. In this case the playerbase becomes Rockstars playground. While your actions are prohibited (cheating/modding) and other actions simply can't be achieved without money (yes ACTUAL money) Rockstar is focusing on stupid things for stupid people. Rockstar does literally NOT listen a single tiny bit to the actual community. Otherwise we would have a lot more secrets/mysteries in the World a Jetpack more buildings to go into more places to go (like the restaurants in SA) more stuff to do more cities more features a good mod support fun cheats better gameplay cheaper and immersive content and an overall enjoyable experience instead of this... well... THIS!I regret buying this game so much. All the fun multiplayer stuff you see on Youtube only works if you have a lot of friends that follow your ideas but a game shouldnt rely on people with money and friends to be fun. (Also It attracts people with no money and no friends which will be let down.) And when it comes to the singleplayer... you can watch a simple story walkthrough and get the FULL experience because it has nothing else to offer.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-26,0,0,77,False,Recommended,I can't say much more about this game that has not already been said. This review is only on the story mode and not at all about the online mode. Fun Addictive and the most important of them all is funny. It seemed the more and more I played the game i noticied that the devlopers put a joke in every second of gameplay that they could. I really enjoyed that! I loved how there was so much to do on the side with all the fun short side quest random encounters and customization of weapons and cars that I got lost for hours not doing the main missions. I felt that a lot of work was put in to the characters and the back story's they had. I loved how every time the game got serious there was a joke thrown in to lighten up the mood and kept it ridiculous. I really did not encounter many bugs the game has been out for awhile so it is pretty polished and the first person mode is amazing and very fun! My only gripe about this game is that when you start the story mode it really forces a lot of the side quest on you and would somewtimes just automatically start them. This made them seem more like a chore because I was being forced to do them at that time. However in the developers defence they did make the side missions pretty weird and fun so....ya. The story was rich with vibrant characters and this game is definetly worth as buy if you got some moving room in your wallet and definitly if its on sale. As you drive throught the city of los santos I can assure you that you can not be bored with all the content that the developers have given us. Thanks for reading!

Story Board Mode 6/10. You're either are too busy reading which buttons to press or addressing issues which quickly become mechanical. Fun stuff like pressing the right key to breathe correctly while doing yoga to driving and escaping cops. It's hard to figure out if you've missed stuff or not. Did I complete it? Do I have to do the real stupid stuff? Yoga? Really? Are you kidding? Who came up with this?On line You can play with friends. +1. New player experience. 10/10. As you start off with nothing you will be blown up repetitively by cheaters. Or two players will just blow you up non stop as you re spawn. If you're not with friends it's quite boring and many of the boring tasks require two or more people. This on line play is so pathetically bad and full of jerks that overall I'm going to give it the overall score of 0/10.OVERALL 5/10. It would quickly drop had I paid any more. The storyboard mode was worth that. And on top of it the money paid hopefully keeps these cesspool on line servers open. They are doing a great public service in containing many of the toxic jerks that might end up playing other on line games you could enjoy.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-09,0,0,518,False,Not Recommended,"OK so I have a good enough amount of hours on this game to know that it changed to science fiction it is an endless grind show unless of course you buy in game money worth another 60 euro game you will spend most of the time grinding and buying stuff to ease your grind with. Lets say you buy a nightclub all cool you need to do some missions for it the usuall grind its ok right? NO cos the game keeps encouraging other players to kill you and you bet people do that not cos of the money but cos its an option and they want to show off their 5 milion OP helicopters and similar. The time you dont spend grinding you will spend on the varius loading screens at least 25% of my time spent in game is actually just loading also the servers are badly maintained often crashes bugs and glitches occur which will waste even more of your time. Also you need NASAs computer to run on 60 FPS but that is personal prefrence. So did I have fun with all the time spent in this game? No untill my friends bought it to which leads me to one more thing it is practicly impossible to efficiently do missions with random players it does not have voice chat if you dont have at least one friend that owns or will own this game then buying it is pointless. The time I spent with my friends was still a grind show but we had fun moments and the game was 60 euros so we didnt have a choice but to squezze all the fun out of it we could. Buy it if you like or have money but know that if you want to see all the ""cool"" stuff that they add (I have to say they do it regularly and that is nice) you can just go on youtube.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-03,0,0,173,False,Recommended,Definitely a very fun game the single player is still great fun even after so many years. Multiple characters gives you multiple viewpoints of the story which helps reduce the repetitiveness you see in most long single player games. The heists are a great fun setting up for and even more fun executing. There are ways to exploit the game and make unlimited money but in offline after having beaten the story mode it doesn't really matter all that much.Online however is a grind. There's a lot of fun in driving around with friends getting into fights with cops and maybe even other players doing missions and heists but it takes a good while to earn money. A very long while. You have to have made around 3 000 000 dollars in in game money to even get to the point where you can start making money back and by that point you're already a bunch of hours into the game. Speaking as a returning player from PS4 I have no energy or motivation to complete the grinds of this online mode again after already having done them on the console.Despite that big issue the game really is excellent and has aged terrificly. Rockstar continues to support the online mode for free with a bunch of new crazy vehicles and weapons new properties to buy new missions and so on. Buying this game for the single player experience especially with the modding capabilities of a PC version is definitely worth the buy.I would rate the whole package an 8/10 definitely worth the price and a most buy for GTA veterans.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,158,False,Recommended,"Note for 4/15 regarding current state of game (Game still has issues for a lot of people I would wait until these issues have been sorted out before buying)*REVIEW*So I am no GTA fan boy or even Rockstar games and to be honest I didn't think I would care for this game so much.I bought to play with a friend online and figured. Why not game probably OK and has a lot of things to do from what I see.Well after playing for a few hours I was pretty hooked. There's a lot to do Now I do imagine I will get bored little later once it gets very competitive. But I think I will get my monies worth till then. However My friend was unable to launch the game as of yet he is experiencing a lot of issues where currently they have not found a workaround from what I can see. So that is kind of lame.I do recommend this game though however I would be skeptical about buying at the moment. If you have a friend that has the game and you are sure you are going to buy it if it works. Create new user meeting workaround standards have GTA5 on external and put in steamapp/common folder (reason 60gig install). Delete temp steam data (google search on how to restore backup games to library). Then test launch on your computer and see if its a fixable work around or un fixable. Either that or wait till fix notes appear. PROS +Good optimized graphics+4K possibility+smooth frame rate+excellent voice acting+First person mode *for a excellent immersion experience*+Third person mode +fun offline and online game play elements+Many many actives+Singing in the shower+Own your own place and garage with perks.+Funny shows to watch on TV+Mouse steering option+Lots of music/radio station content+Customer music library if desired+Online progression+Tesla car clone. ""The D's clone"" +Land vehicles (cycles motorcycles trucks haulers cars SUV's tanks APC Monster trucks)+Aerodynamic Vehicles (jets heli's assorted planes)+Sea vehicles (jetskis assorted boats)+Submersed vehicles (subs/scuba)+Many weapons!*NEGS* Game currently has lot of launch/running issues for bout 20% of who bought the game. Very big install long loading times (unless very good internet / high end gaming comp) Possible time out issues at any time. If session is lost to MP loads single player instead of going back to main menu (may be a option for this) Can encounter some serious laggers who are playing then troll you. Sometimes difficult to get groups for certain events. Can encounter griefers but not as bad as APB for anyone who knows about that... First person car mirrors don't work right. (very low rez reflection and only shows environment) Cars can have that touchy turn and accelerate on keyboards (either no throttle or full throttle... or full steering a direction) Would hope for a little more immersion. Such as blinkers and a throttle/gas control option. Mouse steering can be really touching/ difficult to use as a primary method. All females are transvestites I suppose... Strippers don't strip.. Specially when invited to apartment. Some features missing for good immersion/ ease of use (cant remember the main one that slipped my mind) Conclusion if the game works. Worth it still. However would invest into controller for driving races/flying on MP. (not sure if you can switch back and forth actively have not tested) 9/10",Grand Theft Auto V

The fact I can get banned for using mods in single player for a game I paid $60 (again) for this game even though I had it on Xbox and bought it again. The ""freedom"" Rockstar once gave to the players with the GTA series is taken away from the community. It used to be easy to make money online when it originally came out on consoles but now they reduced payment you get from doing in missions online in half and even less money the 2nd time to replay a mission. Emblems were once custom to make online due to a site glitch but I was going to get banned as well as everyone who did the glitch to have custom pictures if that isn't corporate dictatorship I don't know what is.

So far I am having a blast. The performance is great even on my sub par Computer. It even manages to look good on lowest settings (which are called 'normal' instead of 'low' or some such thing nice touch!). It's the first full priced game I have bought in a long time and I am pretty sure I won't regret it.Full recommendation for fans of the genre!There are a few glitches like Massive FPS drop now and again for a second or four but it's manageable and it never happened in a mission so far.

2015-04-14,0,0,221,False,Recommended,This game is great. The game was amazing for X360/PS3then it moved to the next gen consoles whoch only improved it more by adding first person and little gameplay changes. Now it's out for PC and the game is outstanding. The gameplay controls well with a keyboard and mouse but if you don't like keyboard and mouse this offers full controller support. The game is improved massively just by adding better graphics and 60 FPS. This version also has everything the X360/PS3/XBONE/PS4 had and more. You also get bonuses if you are coming back from the console versions. This game has been so improved I can't cover everything.List Pros 1. Keyboard and mouse feels fluid2. Full controller support3. Graphics are nice4. Community is much better5. Gameplay is improvedCons 1. Needs optimisation 2. Lags for no reason at points (I.E. In garage in online and in the desert)3.

The story mode is so fun so rich with character and main story but also has a bunch of fun side missions to complete if you ever want to take a break from the main story. The online is not a gamemode I explore too often but from around the 10 hours I have spent in GTA 5 online it has been an absolute BLAST to play. So many different modes to play with other enthusiatic fans of the GTA series. Contrary to what some other people have said you wont get banned for ""no reason"" and not once have I came across a cheater.Short Answer This game ing rocks.",Grand Theft Auto V

Not realizing that their fan base will leave and it ruins the credibility for RockStar. It requires so many hours played to grind money in GTA Online. People played GTA recently for the mods because they were great mods. A SMALL percentage modded on GTA Online. Maybe they need to not make everything ridiculously expensive on GTA Online or make making money easier. Great game that turned to garbage and is only enjoyable in Single Player.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'd say get it on sale since well it seems to be on actual sale now. instead of the summer sale lol. I'd say it's not worth the hefty price tag of 60$ maybe 40$.

2016-02-17,0,0,249,False,Recommended,SinglePlayer Stories really nice nice to play from 3 different characters that all have different perspectives on everything. Once you beat the story there are a few thigns that you can do after that but to be honest I got kinda bored on it and moved onto multiplayer. TL DR if you only want it for the story it's worth it.MultiPlayer Kinda a mixed bag. Like anything best with friends so get a few buddies or make some friends on the Community Hub and you'll have a great time playing the missions and heists or just goofing off in online multiplayer sessions. Without friends though it may be a bit harder to have fun as when I'm alone I often just wander around until someone with an armored tank and a much higher level comes along and continuously blows me up for no reason. And if that's not annoying enough you will occasionally run across a hacker. Now since the last update I heard they vamped their anti cheat so I haven't noticed that many running around or at least they haven't been ruining my fun in any way which is ok so long as they're not being major $$holes. Overall with a few friends you'll have a good time with this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Mind this game is five years old if R* really cared they would've fixed all these issues already.A gamebreaking bug or constant crashes? Let it be. Someone dropping money to circumvent the grind wall? Call the national guard and put this man before a firing squad.Singleplayer is good however taking into account that Online is the more active part of the game this is just not worth your money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-03,0,0,329,False,Recommended,I've put around 600 hours into this with PC/PS3. Overall the game is great. Gameplay is spot on vehicles are somewhat diverse and fun to drive. After a while each weapon seems like a carbon copy of others within its class. The character switching is there but you'll find yourself prioritizing one over the others. However the story falls flat in comparison to past Rock* titles with Franklin being some black sheep. After the story the enviroment basically dies. From there you can pick up on the cluster known as GTA Online.Avoid GTA Online unless you want a massive grind.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-18,0,0,1468,False,Recommended,"Initially I was really unhappy with Rockstar over this game.. the performance of it was terrible but that's changed for the good a fair bit since those dark days. (not that it's amazingly better now but it is definitely good enough I can start recommending it to other people).THE GOOD * Open World Heaps to do (more on this later)* Interactive and enguaging city (you feel like another citizen and people respond to your actions in a ""normal"" way.. except police who replaced their stock of handcuffs with 9mm ammo.. least their prison is fairly empty p)* Single Player is lots of fun and provides enough mini games that you could technically enjoy it for a VERY long time before getting bored.. some mini games feel formulated ""Talk to NPC kill target get paid"" whilst others are very much unique to this.* Multiplayer is really starting to come into its stride now where players can headline their own faction within the city as a VIP. Players can own a large variety of awesome properties including a customisable Yacht!* There are plenty of missions a player can do in GTA Online (GTA O) which will not require them to enter a special context menu and load up a private mini session which means NO MORE LOADING SCREENS if you prefer to enjoy the in session ones.* Mouse and Keyboard input has been improved significantly to the point where you can actually play this game competitively .. it really does feel more like playing Battlefield inside a huge city at times with all the cover tactics etc. 3rd person takes away from this a little but also is nice that players have options.. your play style won't feel limited by input variety and camera options )I could go on there are tons more good but that'll do for now the rest would just be more details on specific things such as exploring and finding cool hide out areas etc. THE BAD * There are still some memory issues when running this game from non SSD harddrives where you get loading FPS lock ups and the progressive downward spiral of memory leaking that eventually (day or 2 of off and on gaming) will require a computer restart. But ... you should probably be restarting your pc around that often normally if you want to maintain healthy levels of updates and a nice clean cache etc.* There are still a fair few missions that take place within these Mini Sessions (a session inside a session). These Private Session missions impose loading screens and also have Minimum/maximum player requirements.. trying to get 4 players to do the same heist as you and not leave mid way through because of something as fickle such as .."" you didn't let me drive so i'm out"". which means you have 3/4 of the required players and the mission auto fails.They need to get rid of minimum and maximum player requirements for heists and missions if they want people to even consider doing them as a way to earn cash because it's sooo painful having missions auto fail due to a poor connection on one of the squad members or them just having a hissy fit.. or worse trolls that join and then leave right before the objective completes.* GTA Online (GTA O) is not hosted by Rockstar they use P2P technology so you might actually wind up the host of your GTA O session lol.. lag can be a problem at times due to this when you get guys from Russia joining an Aussie hosted server with a few Americans in there.* There is no way to store weapons in your apartments so when you buy any weapons .. you are stuck with them for life in GTA O which means that after some time playing.. testing out new arrivals .. you start to carry the entire stock of Ammunation in your back pocket.. which is fine until you get a guy who is attacking from a long range and you're on the wrong assault rifle so you have to toggle through till you reach the one that has good long range etc.It would be good if they let you select what weapons to carry and what to keep in your apartment.* Unable to buy and sell on the Stock Market at the moment (I believe this is meant to be coming to GTA O along with Casinos)* GTA O appears to encourage the purchase of Shark Cards for in game cash so players can avoid the painful Heists which were meant to be the big way to earn cash in game. If you don't have 3 friends willing to do heists with you .. prepare for a world of pain because trying to get 3 randoms to stay who can actually play.. and speak the same language .. it's rare. NEUTRAL POINTS TO NOTE * As mentioned the game tries to direct players into buying Shark Cards for real money to gain GTA O currency without working for it. Hackers also have a habbit of joining sessions and dropping money bags on your head which provide in game currency without working for it. Since both achieve the same goal and Rockstar are comfortable with handing out In Game Cash that requires no mission completion or skill work to obtain it in game.. I see no difference to hackers doing something that has the same end result.Rockstar are not taking money from Shark Cards and using it to provide Dedicated Hosting they are not fully addressing all of the Memory Leak issues that have been with the game since launch on PC they are not porting the game over to MAC for those unfortunate few who own a macintosh (may you rest in peace) but heck they deserve to at least play the game too right... owning a MAC should be punishment enough. Rockstar are still focussing a lot on trying to find new money sinkholes in game so players with cash run out and have to start buying Shark Cards.. that's the only motivation for new and hyper expensive things like the Yachts but I can't fault them there.. and the content is nice.. IF you can afford it.The Heists and other negative points I listed are indicators that this is a game where you shouldn't be buying Shark Cards to support the continuation of previously listed negative points.* Hackers.. well yeah sooo the Hacker Giveth and the Hacker Taketh away... Not all hackers are friendly and give you all guns raining money on you and inventing new gamemodes such as Armageddon (we had a hacker shooting jumbo jets from a minnigun over the city and we had to try survive .. it was so much fun) You do get a few who will attach a UFO to your head Mass Kill the entire Session using different players to commit the act on their behalf forcibly.. it will say that PLAYER X (coul be you) killed.. and then the entire session list rolls up the screen. Newer players then think YOU are the hacker. until it says they killed everyone too at which point it becomes obvious you will not know who the hacker is.I say hackers are neutral because yeah there is good .. heaps of good .. but there is the bad were you get some who want to ruin the fun and troll. The worst hackers are the ones who hack HP etc and pretend that they're just too good until they Face Tank Rockets (plural) and you call them on their $#!t... haven't seen too many like that recently though which is nice )* Voice Chat It's great when you want to chat with other players in your faction/friends list etc.. but the default setting is Everyone soooo lot of nooobs talking over public channel .. can get pretty uncomfortable at times or just plain annoying.. luckily you can mute individual players if you so desire.. or you can switch your Chat mode from Everyone to another more suitable setting... it just takes knowing how.well that's a fairly good coverage of main points good bad and neutral so hopefully that helps explain why I think the game is worth buying now.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-09,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Ok let's just start with a note this game is rubbish on PC not that the game is bad that it takes a loooooong time to load. Now that's out of the way GTA V is a great game now really that note earlier was a little true but bear with me it was the same on the PS3 and Xbox 360 so I shouldn't be complaining. I bought this when it was $19 at a sale and I was stoked since I never owned the game before I installed it and I had a blast! But rewind before the first mission I was sitting in my office chair in my room for about let's say 12 minutes when I was about to call quits the game loaded. And lo behold the greatest game I ever played on Steam (aside from CoD Black Ops 3) Side note GTA V was the first game I played for over 10 hours straight yeah I have no damn life.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-01,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,The story mode is okay though pretty boring with stale and generic characters. But by far the worst part about the game is online. If you're lucky enough to get a server without a modder ruining everything it's still incredibly irritating. the entire online mode is pay to win or pay to have fun. Every server is dominated by people that spent there own money for the fake in game money. If you try to play this game without buying shark cards than you are in for a terrible experience. You'd have to grind for hours to even afford a crappy car as everything in game is insanely expensive. Then anything you try to do on a server with more than ten people with be near impossible because players show up on the flying missile shooting cars that they paid real money for and just blow you up. If you are willing to pay over 15 20 extra dollars plus the games base cost then you are probably going to have a good time. But if not than definetly do not get this game the story mode and online are not worth it at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

Dodging a melee attack? sometimes just won't go through sometimes because the input dropped sometimes because they didn't program a dodge animation for that attack so you take unavoidable damage. And even when you do dodge and it does the animation you'll still be hit for no reason sometimes. Not to mention small frustrations like being forced to reload before you switch to a sidearm which defeats the purpose of why you switched to it.If you wanna play the game get a console version its been clear from the start Rockstar doesn't much care for PC,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,"The single player campaign is quite a fresh approach with you playing as three main characters.Story 4/5It's the cliche one last job story line of one man's mid life crisis.Design 5/5Vehicles clothes npcs and most of all world design. All of these things on such a massive scale really shows us why ""triple A"" open world games are only produced by massive studios. It is something people will use as a reference for years to come.Mechanics 4/5Weapons are satisfying to use and vehicles are nice to operate. The most infuriating thing is just the sluggish character movements during combat. However overall it is quite refined.Online servers 0/5Servers are p2p. Yes. Hosted by one of the idiots in the session. Yes. ing so many latency problems caused by bad connections. Widespread hacking with no effective anti cheat in place because original game doesn't have one and obviously server side anti cheat can't be implemented.Oh and this is what causes the endless cloud simulator situations. Complete and utter garbage network connections to the host.Online gameplay 1/5Grindfest. Heists and set ups will wipe constantly because of some ing idiot dying for the nth time in a row or some leaves. This prevents you from getting any cash at all to get to the better cash farming methods which then prevents you from really enjoying the unlockable content.You could waste hours of your life grinding or just pay some guy 2 usd to get a billion in game cash.Overall 3/5TL DR The entire game is propped up on an amazing single player experience. If you have 3 other friends that want to play online as much as you do this game becomes a 5/5 for you.I will not recommend this game because rockstar and take2 are Shark cards are priced at insane rates and heist payouts are really low because they want to sell them. Not to mention the vehicles are damn expensive too all because they want people to buy shark cards.Suing openinv doesn't really help either.They never ing learn.",Grand Theft Auto V

I love it there are some things that should be better.like for new pleyers it is kinda hard to earn money but it comes along.. i would like to see some vip missins for somebody who is lvl 10 or something. like a drugdealer that has to sell drugs and when he does he gets allot of heat from cops or something.but anyways the online mode is great and after the latest DLC it is freaking exelent!four out of five star there. only four becouse it is kinda hard earning mooney!,Grand Theft Auto V

The single player story line was fun although it's short ended and the map is not as huge as GTA San Andreas. The GTA Online experience is also fun to play playing Heist with friends with all the laughter etc.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-05,0,0,392,False,Recommended,The game itself is alot of fun especially with friends. I definetly recommend getting it if you have a friend to play it with. One downfall I will say is the community but I ignore it you can't really do too much about it. But if you have iron skin then you'll be fine. But it is an awesome game there is so much variety and so much to do from racing to just shooting everything! xD It's worth the money in my opinion for sure!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,Not recommended. GTA V was a good story great voice acting and solid gameplay and progression. GTA Online throws most of that out. EXTREMELY biased towards selling Shark Cards with microtransactions to the point where they diminished mission and job rewards if you happen to beat it any amount of time under 15 minutes. Yes the faster you manage to beat a mission the less you get paid. And you get constant un ignorable phone calls for million dollar warehouses and bunkers that you can't afford and emails about said items.Outside of that newer players have to rely exclusively on the generocity and skill of other players in order to earn any reliable money. Selling cars and holding up stores gives you minimal money. Heists can be failed by a single player messing up one aspect of the mission or dying. Working for CEO's and MC owners could result in NO PAYMENT WHATSOEVER and you have no way of knowing until after you complete the work for them. And all of this is while you're dodging players flying around on missle equipped rocket bikes in near indestructible APC's or gunships while their icons are hidden from the map so you have no idea where they are or when you'll die to the next rocket attack.This game has turned into nothing but a cold cash grab at the expense of anyone who wants to enjoy the game but doesn't have the expendable cash to throw at Rockstar for doing nothing other than rigging the system in this way.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-27,0,0,35,False,Recommended,"(single player only review haven't touched Online yet)I can say it was worth waiting for a sub 20 sale. GTAV is a really good game from almost every aspect. This is the most polished a streamlined GTA ever well this shouldn't be a surprise because it's also the newest one so have to be up to the current AAA game standards. It's also well optimized running perfectly on my PC (i7 7700 GTX 1070). I had to disable the RivaTuner overlay because it crashed the Social Club but whatever that should be our smallest problem!I will honestly recommend it to everyone to play it you won't regret it. There is an incredible amount of content apart from the main story line and w/o even touching the Online mode.Last but not least two things I didn't like that much or more like two things why I think San Andreas is still a better game than this. First of all there is no progression at all. Like almost from the beginning you have everything. House cars weapons etc. There is no incentive to do side quests for money to get that something you really want. San Andreas and even Vice City solved this much better. The other thing is the 3 character setup. Hard to talk about it w/o spoilers but I've felt like the game is about one guy and his relationship with everyone else (including one of the guys from the remaining two) and the last guy is ""just there"". Ok he is more than that but obviously less flashed out there is less story about him and his past the world around him etc. In the end it's not bad but I think having one main protagonist is much better for a game like this.Can't wait for the next GTA game. Until then?... Just relaxin'https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 1hdAAZzgCuk",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-17,0,0,348,False,Recommended,I'll just give this game a regular pros n cons review.PROS Be a criminal from the comfort of your PC and without really getting arrested! Story is fun and interesting though once you finish all the missions there's nothing to do really... except GTA online but we'll talk about that later. Cars. Cars! It's always fun to drive your chromed Zentorno on the highway flipping the finger to everyone you overtake. I'm pretty sure I've spent atleast 10% of my time in this game in a car. Very well developed characters each one is interesting in it's own way. Missions are very diverse though most of them involve harming people it isn't like some games where every mission is Go Here Shoot Everything Win. Missions are mostly all unique and have their own objectives. Devs commonly push out small content updates. And they don't charge for them it's like getting free DLC.NEUTRAL Weapons. You have access to a vast arsenal of something over 20 or 30 weapons which you can modify to make cooler looking and perform better. That might sound fun but you'll have no reason to use most of them. Why use an average silenced pistol or sniper when you can just slap a silencer extended clip grip and scope on a Carbine and still wreck anyone at any distance with a short burst of bullets? And why do that when you can just rev your minigun and clear 15 police officers 4 of their cars and 2 choppers in the span of a minute? Most of the game you'll just be using the same 4 or 5 guns and nothing else. Also there isn't a point in ammo when you can just waste a few thousand dollars to have enough bullets for each weapon to supply an entire army regiment. Freeroam. For a reason it just feels... empty. Yes there's all those cars. Yes there's pedestrians walking on the streets or hanging around. Yes you'll occasionally see a police chase that isn't protagonizing you for once. But really the game doesn't try too hard to convince you that these aren't AI. It's oftenly boring.CONS Online. 2 things One it's a grindfest. If I wanted to grind missions several times to level up get more cash and finally be able to afford a shiny new car I'd go and play an RPG like Skyrim or something. Second hackers. They shouldn't even be called hackers since they just download a little script to get a mod menu to annoy people the vermin are usually Russians that enjoy ruining the game for some reason or spoiled 12 year olds that have no sense of reward or patience in order to get past level 10 and at the same time like to feel superior to everyone else by exploding them. Story mode replayability. The first time you finish the story is a magical experience the next time just feels like a chore.Overall even with it's small flaws this game is amazing. Buy it you're buying a piece of history,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-27,0,0,257,False,Not Recommended,Don't get me wrong this game can be fun Fun when there isn't a person flying around in an oppressor mkII and armed with a thermal scoped explosive rounded sniper. PVP in this game has gone down the drain it isn't fun anymore unbalanced as vehicles make trolling and griefing such an ease. Well why don't you go passive mode you say? These trolls have probably equipped themselves with mods and now look THEY are throwing cars at you or blowing and caging you like colombus caged up them people down south and then somehow dropping you money so you get banned the next day. People may say to leave the lobby But can you really? Yes you can but who wants to wait another 5 minutes in a loading screen of death just to find another lobby with another hacker / griefer / troller? Why just not play the game at all? Not to mention the crap anti cheat that will ban you instead of the modders dropping you the $$$. Sounds fun right? if you're here for the offline mode and you don't wanna partake in online knock urself out otherwise I can't really recommend it since out of my 250 ish hours about 45 hours have been full of monkeys griefing in some sort of way either it be a flying car or a flying motorcycle or just god mode cheaters in general and some 30 hours of my gameplay where just loading screens ...

Everyone is flying around on goddamn jet bikes and rocket proof flying vehicles batmobiles and all that other I however like the cars with turrets and stuff that are less OP. Everything is so expensive the only way to get all that stuff is from modded drops which in my opinion are still insanely frequent. If you play for a day you will definitely encounter a modder. If you do not wish to get modded money and want to do biker/business stuff (which is the best way to play the game) it will be you with your regular cars and weapons against an array of goddamn instakill missileproof tanks and armored choppers. basically making you get blown up anytime you try to do anything.I wish they stayed more simple and did not put all that crazy because with the modders its just you against a bunch of cheating OP s.Story mode is still golden and amazing Gta Online is now kinda cancer.would still recommend . wish i could review online seperately because it went to i used to be able to pull up on people and kill the entire lobby with my submachine gun,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA5 Story Mode Story mode has an in depth storyline with highly likeable protagonists although not long the game offers a different approach to missions than most games... Story mode will leave you begging for more and wanting to uncover the protagonists backstories.GTA Online GTA Online is one of the most enjoyable multiplayer based games but can often leave saying ""What is next? And that displays the amount of content there is to explore in this game. Also to mention that Rockstar still updates it as of early 2019.Some cons and major annoyances must also be taken into account. This game is really grindy grindy as in you need to make money to buy assests businesses etc. There is a lot of griefers that there is no way of enforcing.

2018-12-06,0,0,313,False,Not Recommended,After playing for gta online for more than 250 hours I can say that it was a huge waste of time. I can't believe a huge game like gta online would have so many modders that just want to ruin your game. They will chain kill you they will trap you in a cage and etc. Worst of all is the fact that you have to grind so hard to get a single thing in this game but modders get billions of gta dollars by just clicking a button. Grinding is not a problem for me but it becomes a problem when I know some people dont have to go through it. Rockstar seems to not care about modders at all. I added a level 8000 that i knew was a modder to my friends list. He accepted it and after 2 months he is still not banned. He has been playing the game for more than 6 months and rockstar did nothing. He had about 5 billion dollars by just clicking a button. If you want to buy gta only buy it for the single player and if you really want to play gta online the only fun thing are adversary modes and races.

2017-10-01,0,0,140,False,Recommended,So I got this game on Xbox 360 for the Christmas that it came out played through the campaign then played the online (Which at the time was amazing although became stagnant after a year or so) with my mates did all the DNS glitches got everything had a lot of fun till the Xbox one version came out I went out and bought that was not disappointed got me back into GTA played through the campaign again and played the online for a further year or two then once again it got boring. Now its been nearly a year since i last played. Was scrolling through steam and found the game on steam and despite having the boxes for ther game on both xbox one and 360 a few feet away bought it again. And now i'm playing the campaign and online again. So I bought the game 3 times played the campaign 4 times and on my third online character the only game to have ever done this to me and i imagine the only one that will ever do this to me. Honestly if it wasn't for the lack of singleplayer DLC and the micro transactions and how the general in game purchasing is structurred to force you to buy a shark card this game would be perfect. Annoyingly the online community is just full of who blow up your car for no reason etc. but i guess this is online gaming and i do it to....... Overall great game.

Rockstar will not do anything about the hackers that plague the servers it is impossible to go it alone and other players are ridiculously unreliable and pointlessly aggressive murdering you just for kicks. (Because why not? The only reward for *not* murdering everybody is $2 000 for about 4 hours of game time.)The kicker is that the game will actively and maliciously work against you. The final straw for me was trying to solo a sell mission making airdrops in a plane with no weapons. The game spawned an attack helicopter on me for no reason and with no way to fight back. I was blown up along with $300 000 worth of stock which I would've had to grind for at least 2 hours to replace. (And $300 000 is a pittance compared to the insane pricing on businesses you buy for the opportunity *to spend even more money on them*.)

2015-04-30,0,0,41,False,Not Recommended,Amazing game. If you liked any of the other titles in the series you'll love this as well. The story is a bit cliche which pours over into the missions which are repetitive and lackluster on their own. But the graphics and sheer amount of content in the game more than makes up for it. Runs great on ultra settings on my G1 gaming gtx 970 i7 4.0 ghz 16 gb of RAM. There is a bit of a memory leak (see forums) and some nasty bugs doing the story missions (character switch/freezes). But the game is awesome and you won't be disappointed. 9/10 (missions get redundant)UPDATE Rockstar is banning people for modding their single player game.,Grand Theft Auto V

What's gotten into you guys?Downvoting a game as a form of protest is quite debatable itself but downvoting all of the other games as well is straight out stupid (no offense intended).With that being said don't let yourself be fooled this game is quite fun itself. It can give you some good time with both single player and multiplayer (this one turns out to be rather funny if you've got friends to play with).Sure mods had been declared as illegal and that was a dumb move but now that they made up for it this game definitely deserves a second chance.A well deserved second chance imo,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-25,0,0,67,False,Recommended,"Alright I wont speak about the Story Line cause I didn't play it for awhile. My review will mostly be based on the Xbox One version considering when I play on PC I just play modded Solo (With LSPDFR etc).I have played GTA V since the first day of it's release which was on Xbox 360. In the first days you couldn't play the Online mode. When it opened it was totally crazy very hard to find a non full server. When you found one it was pretty cool. Seemed like real life had struggle to get money for an appartment most of players had only a garage for a car etc. After that the first glitches arrived. Mostly the Sell and Respawn your car one. Most of players used it to get more money but it was still cool. ""Cheaters"" only used that to get a better appartment or a better car. Even if they were rich they had a low level. And then the lobby cheat arrived. Guys with Billions of Dollars buying tanks biggest appartments yachts best cars helis etc. They literally had everything. When you join a server you just get rekt by everyone. There is guys with flying bikes who can shoot you with rockets. (This is not a glitch the bike is really apart of the game) And some good things like guys shooting you with a Big Helicopter that will take you 10 15 RPG Rockets to destroy. I'm Level 60 and got some good like a Tank and still I get ed by the whole map with their flying bikes and 2050 Tanks.This is honnestly the biggest problem of the game.

They are constantly releasing new content and vehicles (normally a good thing). But they make them prohibitively expensive so that due to the low amount of money you can make through playing the only realistic way to get the newer stuff is to buy it with real money. And I am talking in the hundreds of dollars. Add this to the fact that at any time your account could get banned with no warning or explanation just because some hacker came into your session and did something to/with your character.So... fun gameplay ruined by heavy price gouging and a near requirement to spend a lot of real money to get in game vehicles,Grand Theft Auto V

The mechanics are spot on and the visuals are beautiful.The world is vibrant and active. The sandbox map is massive with tons to explore.I wish more buildings could be entered however. When you start to realize most of them are just empty set dressing the world seems more hollow and artifical breaking immersion.The main characters can be quite unlikable at times. Franklin the well meaning but ultimately stupid thug lite.Michael the self absorbed WASP who moans about his life while sitting in his mansion.Trevor the ""LOL SO RANDUMB"" 4.chan washout psychopath wanna be that only appeals to kids under the age of twelve. Less of a character and more of a walking cringe factory.Seriously I like the game but hate having to play these three. I wish there were better choices.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-06,0,0,346,False,Not Recommended,It's a great game and really addicting but there are some things that are bad about this game.The singleplay (although i haven't played it on pc yet) is still.. the same? No DLC nothing. It's basically abandoned.A singleplayer dlc like a new mission or something would be great! But really the core of GTA 5 is the online mode.I LOVE the online mode cool cars fun missions heists all kinds of stuff! But... everything is SO EXPENSIVE! You have to either buy sharkcards get a modder to give you money (not recommended) or grind for days to get a cool car or bike like the opressor! That is really the main thing i dislike about online everything else is pretty great!If you are willing to spend alot of time or money on a game sure go ahead buy this game.But if you are impatient (like me) don't buy this game.Also way to many modders which make this game unplayable. You sometimes get lucky and find a modder free lobby.I would rate this game a terrible 3/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-03,0,0,531,False,Recommended,I think this game its a great game with friends to play but allone its not that great tbh. If you play with friends you always have a backup and you guys can do stuff online and you have great fun all the time. You need to grind or cheat to get stuff like cars and jets . So this is a friend based game and needs to be played with friends. If you dont have friends you need to wait for hours and hours long (I have spend over 40 hours just waiting for people to join my lobbys or people who are loading in) if you have friends with good internet then its no problem of course. There are many missions and even more mini games to play. You will never be done with all missions and minigames unless you no live it for 500 hours but i think you want to make fun to instead of only missions right?,Grand Theft Auto V

The multiplayer is not that great. Fun with friends but even then most of the fun stuff is very expensive so you have to use microtransactions. That is but whatever. Some items in single player could be obtained by either mods or by buying them in multiplayer. But now mods the only reason some people bought this game on PC for the 2 or 3 time is gone you have to either grind missions with friends in multiplayer or spend your cash.

Everyday I take some time to myself to thank for introducing this game into my life. With GTA V comes a greater experience than ever previously understood within the series and holy bejesus IT'S SO MUCH FUN!! The times have changed and Los Santos is ripe for the taking. It is time for us to take notice of the fact that we can accomplish a lot with a smile and in Los Santos you can accomplish a lot more with a smile and a gun. The world is yours. Players get to involve themselves with the underground and get to expeience what it would be like to start and build up their own criminal empire and the action leads to a non stop flow of dopamine and serotonin goodness and delight. It is by far the most fun you're gonna have apart from getting to sleep with two or three of your high school crushes... at once! It's a ing maginificent game I you not.

2018-11-24,0,0,152,False,Recommended,The game has a great world and charcters. However the multiplayer or Grand Theft Auto Online I found somewhat lacking control wise on mouse and keyboard (strange default mapping inaccuracies etc.). The real problem lies within the players movement as online carries over the same movement from the story which fails when it comes to competitve on foot online games. The Expansions that they release have been fun so far keeping players coming back and still having fun. The main pull for this game has got to be the vehicle gameplay. The racing games are very fun to play as well as challenging. It is arguably the best part of the game. I'd hate to end on a sorrow note but there is two extreme downsides to the game. One is the cash gap. Without a leveling system to unlock things cash becomes top priority. This a huge blackade for newcomers due to how it even more enforces their microtransaction cash grab. The solution to this however is even worse. In order to get the most fun out of the game hacking money in is regular occurence. I do not blame the hackers though due to Rockstars pay to win format I believe they are justified in their actions. Overall I would give the game an 8/10 million dollars that were to difficult to get.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's a ing rip off and the whole online mode is filled with either cheaters or people (whales as we call them) who pour so much money into shark cards they own all the Op in the game. Not to mention screaming little kids connection issues and much more. This game had a good start in the beginning ( talking about the online mode). If you play privatly with friends it is fun and goofy at times. If its on a sale around 15 dollars go get it obviously. But if you are thinking of online mode.

2017-06-15,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,"Take Two and Rockstar have ruined their community For 10 years I've been an avid supporter of Rockstar and Take Two products overall I've played almost every GTA game Red Dead Redemption you name it i've played it. Never have I seen this stupid ing t. you Take Two you've ruined what left there was to ruin.For backstory Take Two has sent out a cease and desist letter to OpenIV GTA's largest single player modding platform. Seriously everything runs through here. This scares me MAJORLY because who knows... What if they take down FiveM next? They've also now taken away money from LEGITIMATE PLAYERS for ""being modders""...I've spent over 1000hrs combined in this game from PS3 to Xbox One to PC. No more will that happen.The online was already cancerous with overpriced in game items in online lack of online to singleplayer content and overall garbage business practices since the game released in 2013 but this is taking it WAY too far. This is straight up thievery and multiple other reviewers have proof. you Take Two I'd suggest every single one of you who have bought the game to boycott it and for those who haven't to hold off on the purchase at least until they get their together.Take Two is performing to the community the equivalent of having a beautiful baby nurturing it for 2 3 years and then ing drowning it in a lake because it's ""causing them too much trouble"". ""They don't want to take care of it"". off.Sincerely a mother ing off fan. . UPDATE 6/25/17 R* has sent out a newsletter basically saying ""we ed up"". However someone on Reddit who is an actual lawyer debunked their jargin and basically summed up all those complex words to ""we aren't doing and we can still remove mods if we want lolololol"". Still boycotting Rockstar Take Two until we get official confirmation that they'll back off and quit ing over their fans. OpenIV's site is back but nothing is still available for installation yet and the Liberty City converter has been canceled to my knowledge. UPDATE 9/3/17 So the dust has settled and OpenIV is back. My recommendation will stay at a negative and it's purely because of R*'s business practices. They're getting WAY too greedy about the Online portion of their game and as a result are ruining what little fan base they still had. The Bikers' update is a less effective version of the Finance &amp Felony update. The Import/Export is an add on to Finance &amp Felony with just different ways to make money and break your keyboard. The Gunrunning update is literally a reskin of Biker update but with some new polish. It also pays cash so bunkers are useless. The Smuggling update is a reskin of the Import/Export update an expansion to the Gunrunning update and once again pays less. UPDATE 9/10/17 Aaaaaand Rockstar has done it again. Multiple legitimate players have had their hard earned in game cash stripped from them. Thousands of hours were lost because of the at Rockstar. I'm not ever buying a Take Two product again and you should do the same. This is straight up thievery no exaggeration. They. Are. Stealing. From. Their. Fans.In conclusion Buy for Singleplayer Don't buy for Online.Buy it for the modding communityand for FiveM not because ofR*'s terrible business decisions.It'd be a lot less complicated to just not buy it at all though. Actually just don't buy anything with the label ""Rockstar"".",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-11,0,0,209,False,Recommended,"There is no better storymode in any game. Online is pretty awesome at first but the grind itself is medium heavy. Add to it the fact that there is no light killing. If you try to pvp between mission cooldowns (which are absurdly pointless as far as i can tell) you'll respawn right next to them or they'll respawn right next to you and it'll take much more time than you wanted it to. This is a vehicle sandbox first and foremost but they're trying to make it an rpg. Even working the highest paying solo profession (CEO possible 75 80k every 40 mins) you wont be able to afford the cool stuff for a fairly laborous grind mixed with loading screens that take a good chunk of your experience hackers that pop in and make you swap servers and endure another (5 10 min) loading screen and causing you to abandon your current mission that you just spent 35 mins on and now have to abandon your meager reward. Weird NPC's that yell ""You're boring!"" and ""You're not creative!"" which isnt so much a problem as just strange. It can work on low end systems with still very good graphics but all in all I havent gotten much enjoyment or fulfillment for my time. I give the thumbs up to those who havent played yet. I think you'll enjoy the entire story and a good start into online at least. And that to me is worth buying a game. However if you're buying for online alone I would say that the work and wait isnt worth the next vehicle.",Grand Theft Auto V

It's got great graphics story mode is always fun and playing online is great when you've got a couple friends you can do anything with. While it's a great game such a well known game attracts a lot of people and unfortunatly most sessions I've joined have had at least one modder in them. Not all modders are pschotic killers or random banners some actually mod to get rid of the modders who do but it's still a bit of a pain to be flying down a busy road and sudenly be ejected from your car. If you're thinking about getting it I'd suggest it (although sales happen often so you may want to wait)... but if you're going to play online make sure you find a few people who are reliable friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-07,0,0,125,False,Recommended,The story is amazing and the story version of the game is fantastic. Aside from a couple of incredibly painful missions with no connection to the narritive (Yoga why?) The story was incredible.The online version isn't worth playing. At all. For any reason. It seems like anyone can take control of the menu (since almost every game I've joined has immediately gone into a loading screen) and they can trap you in very long games which aren't explained in any way you just kinda have to hope they're easy to figure out or that you're on a team with someone who has done it before. There are way too many missions which 'seem' available yet are actually just places where you can 'start' an event. Having these out in the world probably seemed like a good idea but in practise a menu would be much simpler for those have more functionality be faster take up less loading time etc etc. The UI takes ages to load and doesn't feel intuitive to use there are lots of random keys across the keyboard that control these features. The 4 or 5 different mission types aren't exciting they're all the same damn thing in different places whoopy de do da. Its laggy as hell players constantly glitch out and reappear bullets dont hit their mark explosives dont go off missiles and RPG's swerve or vanish for no reason.When you do finally find something that looks semi decent or something that you can do solo without waiting for players you can't communicate with (can't get any kind of voice cumminication to work just fragments of audio playing randomely) It feels much harder than it needs to be. I did a mission about a dozen times before I came to accept that there was simply no way to succeed without playing with others why was solo play even a damn option if it makes completeing the mission impossible?If you accidentally sign up for something you don't want to do you get punished for it. You either have to complete the 'job' whatever it is or bail and get called a 'bad sport' or something which gives you some kind of stigma in game. This wouldn't be so bad if the UI was in any way user friendly which it isn't. The way the game loads you into a 'free roam mode' then after you select any mission it holds you in some extra menu you can't seem to access any other way is extremely annoying. It takes a very long time to load anything you have to pay close attention to the bottom right corner of the screen because sometimes it loads a window with only a couple of seconds to make a selection sometimes it gives you 2 minutes and there seems to be absolutely no indidcation which mission will have which delay before starting.Completely dissapointed with the online experience. If the main story missions hadn't given me 30 40 hours of amazng gameplay (which they did nothing to complain about with the campaign) I'd want a refund and I probably wouldn't be buying anymore Rockstar games. So many things need to be either completely reworked for the Online game to be considered an actually game. ATM it's just crappy free roam version of the story without the story coupled with some really annoying menu's and sloooow load times.I really wish I could make two reviews here one for the online experience and one for the story. One was amazing and one was completely worthless.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-09-13,0,0,74,False,Recommended,Вы готовы встретиться с ГТА? Тогда Вас ожидают постоянные перестрелки уникальные погони с применением самых разных крутых тачек а главное это полное беззаконие которое царит везде на всех улицах. Твоя роль проста придётся быть гражданином не имеющим совести которому можно делать всё ведь нарушение любых законов здесь приветствуется. Тем самым будет идти постепенное погружение в преступный мир. Но игровой процесс не прост как может показаться от начала игры. Особенно интересна и сложна последняя версия ГТА 5.В новейшей версии этой игры придётся выполнять квесты справляться с угнанными автомобилями а главное постоянно думать как укрыться от представителей полиции. Кроме обычных версий легковых моделей можно будет угнать большую фуру моторную лодку и вертолёт! Можно будет развлечься с помощью захвата полицейской или машины скорой помощи чтобы ощутить вкус роли полицейского или работникам медицинской службы. Уже нравится? Начали думать а когда же появится эта новая часть об этом можно узнать на Нашем сайте. Здесь же Вы можете узнать где и собственно как её скачивать а также и новые системные требования для ГТА 5.Игра не будет скучной так как разработчики создают соответствующее музыкальное сопровождение которое создано под стиль города и текущей ситуации Вашего персонажа. Отличный плюс игры представлен её озвучиванием которое улучшает общее качество игры. Этот плюс игры появляется только в её третьей части. А до этого внедрения использовали текстовые описания выводимые на экран. В новой версии GTA V предлагается реалистичная отработка всех элементов каждая мелочь удивляет уровнем отработки. Созданы общие текстуры города можно видеть живую атмосферу в виде свободных передвижений других персонажей которые как бы живут своей жизнью и занимаются своими делами. Такой стиль игры позволит Тебе полностью погрузиться в атмосферу этого придуманного города где Тебе даётся шанс создания карьеры в среде криминального мира который впоследствии не захочется покидать.Собственно и главная задача на основе сценария этой игры ГТА 5 строится на цели постепенного продвижения и задуманного карьерного роста от обычного бандита с улиц до местного главаря. Для продвижения предлагаются различные квесты но помимо этого допустимо свободное исследования этого мира. Город предлагает наличие заведений которые можно посещать. Спортзал поможет в повышении физических характеристик а в баре можно будет как бы расслабится.Под каждую из игр GTA 5 создавали уникальный город. Иногда предлагали реальные города типа Лос Анджелеса Лондона а также и Манчестера но были и вымышленные. Вымышленная версия города Вайс Сити создаётся на основе города Майами а версия Сан Фиерро была создана с применением основы от города Сан Франциско. Собственно были и прочие города. Каждый из предложенных проектов получает свой уникальный индивидуальный сценарий на основе отлично проработанной сюжетной линии. За счёт всех этих качеств и качественной работы команды делающей игры из серии GTA пять они смогли достичь таких показателей успешности и признания. Теперь игры из серии ГТА 5 известны во всём мире и уже мало кто не пробовал играть в них.Интересно то что в ГТА 5 создатели предусмотрели возможность игры на основе телефона или планшета. Дата появления игры на ПК ещё не открыта но данная игра уже появилась для Xbox и также Sony Playstation 4. Собственно на Нашем сайте уже есть прохождение пятой части этой игры grand theft auto 5 а также и всевозможные читы к ней. Желаем Вам поскорее окунутся в мир преступности этой игры чтобы получить возможность собственного видения управления предложенным городом.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-29,0,0,592,False,Recommended,Everyone in the reviews section are pis'd off over the hack protection in GTA Online and give negative reviews. I mean yeah even I'd be angry if they ban the victim from Online permanently but that being said I didn't understand why no one recommends the game for the story mode.First of all I agree that the price is rather high... which is the reason I bought the game when it was on sale at 50% off (give or take a few %). For the sale price the game was well worth the cost. I absolutely enjoyed the story mode and if you're a perfectionist kind of guy you can get a lot of hours from this game.On a side note the graphics optimization is AMAZING. Sleeping Dogs (not Definitive Edition) lags at medium settings on my PC but this game works without any lag at all. If you have an NVidia GeForce GPU I recommend you download the GeForce Experience to optimize the graphics settings for the game for maximum FPS.GTA Online is something fun as well. Though it depends on your attitude with regards to online games in general. One of the hardest things to do in online is to go for a slow relaxing stroll without getting killed. Passive mode helps but it restricts many things. But you'll get used to it eventually. However Online is quite a bit of a grind. The process is literally do something get money spend money do something again because you don't have enough money to even spend it properly get more money finally spend it and then realize you don't have enough to use it on something actually nice and end up spending it on something ugly.Overall I'd say the game is well worth it. You can squeeze hundreds of hours from the game until (if you don't) you get banned anyway so I'd say it's worth it. If it's on sale then even better.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is perhaps one of the best single player experiences of all time. The only thing that ruins that is microtransactions in the multiplayer. This means that the single player is unquestionably lessened by the lack of essential components of the GTA experience. Some people added some of this content to the single player through mods. In order to combat this horrible threat that is stopping Take Two interactive from nickel and diming every customer they have sent a cease and desist to the creators of the Open IV mod framework the basis of nearly every GTA mod. Modding has always been an important thing for the GTA series and this move by Take Two not only destroys many innovative and creative mods for GTA V which in no way infringe on multiplayer content but also effectively destroys the GTA IV modding scene as well due to all Open IV content being included under the cease and desist. Effectively a good game that was already ruined by multiplayer exclusive content has just signed it's own death sentence by destroying a key part of the single player replayability and arguably the only reason people who own the console versions would ever buy the PC version. If this behavior is indicative of future actions by Take Two I worry for the future of Kerbal Space Program.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-28,0,0,410,False,Recommended,GTA V I could still remember the teaser about this game during the later years of GTA IV. It was so beautiful I was worried if my measly GTX 670 could play it. But GTA V runs smoothly with decent settings on my card and I'm nearly finished with the game. It was a great adventure and I'm already looking forward to the next one. Hopefully I can finally upgrade my rig so that I can replay this game again on Ultra and to be ready for the next one. Oh Rockstar please tell us there's a next one!But before all that I'd be spending time playing GTA Online. I've heard multiple horror stories about hackers but I think Rockstar is doing all they can to sort the problem out and leave legit players to enjoy the game.I recommend this game to everyone that enjoys mayhem especially if you enjoy it's predecessors. It has a pretty mediocre storyline length but with all the extra activities to do in the game you won't feel that at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-19,0,0,431,False,Recommended,"Over 200 Hours in this game and I havent wrote a review already!Well then I shall do it todayGTA V(Grand Theft Auto V) is an open world game that takes place in the fictional city of Los Santos(Based off of Los Angeles) and San Andreas(California) and claims to be on the West Coast of the United States even though its an island(You can find that out on some radio stations where they mention ""West Coast is the Best Coast"")Story Mode Is it even worth it? Shall I even start this?Well before we start yes I have completed the story so I did not spoil anything for myself!Anyways It starts off in North Yankton with Michael and Trevor robbing a bank and then Michael fakes his death then it starts getting repetitive after that.Why I say its repetitive is because here is how the story works ProlougeFranklin MissionMichael MissionHeistTrevor MissionHeistRandom MissionHeistAnother Random MissionHeistYou Guessed ItHeistGranted Again""BIG"" HeistWhat ever ending you chooseThe story is a little of the same which could sound bad to you but I really like the way it is played!What I mean by that is when you play Story Mode missions it feels like a movie to you and a plus to that is Los Santos and San Andreas(Mostly Los Santos) is heavily based off of its real counter parts.What I don't like about the story is that Michael and Trevor ALWAYS ARGUE together and Franklin has to ALWAYS break them up and I find that really annoying. You'll see what I mean when you play the game.I also think they tried too hard on making a short story on Franklin before the heist missions take place.Lets keep it short Franklin wants to get out of the Hood Life &lt They already did that with CJ from GTA San Andreas(Another Great Game BTW) but with Franklin it only lasts like two missions unlike CJ where you go small than go big!Thats another think I like/hate about Story ModeDepending on the Player you ethier want everything to be easy or you want to feel like you've done something in your life while getting a BIG reward at the same time.Me? Well I could really care less since I just like to enjoy a nice story/gaming experience so its your personal preference!Freeroam(Both GTAV/GTAOnline) There are a bunch of things that you can do during freemode but ill list some that could be fun and the most common Cop chases on the Highways(Probably best to do it on the I 2 or Los Santos Freeway since that leads to the desert)Doing the Skyfall cheat(Single Player Only)Getting together with friends(Online)There are endless possibilities but do what you want!Conclusion If you want a good online gaming experience with friends then get this gameIf you want a good modding experience with nice cars get this gameIf you want a ok racing experience packed with others than this is a recommendationIf you want to play a game with action movie like content than get this gameIf you want to make animated movies this game makes that easyIf you want to like to drive cars around get this gameif your like nice cars in general get this gameIf you want a story where you go big get GTA San AndreasIf you want a diverse gmod online experience get GTA San AndreasIf you want to cheat and use hacks online get MinecraftIf you want to play as a black man and get arested at the beginning of the game and eat fried chicken to heal yourself get GTA San AndreasIn the end its up to you!",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-14,0,0,230,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is still a really good game but it's online component is absolutely ruined by and insane grind and microtransactions. This whole review I'm only going to talk about GTAO so take note of that.GTA Online is a really good idea that works pretty well for the most part and gets content constantly so where does it fall apart? It's a utterly massive grind at this point. When the game was first released there wasn't much to do or buy and with a good amount of play time you'd be able to buy anything you wanted. Slowly more content started getting released and all that content came with new vehicles that had huge price tags. More and more vehicles were over the $1 Million mark which took a decent amount of playing to earn. The problem is that Heists still paid the same and they don't pay well in the current GTAO ""economy.""In order to make larger sums of money you have to invest in expensive buildings and their payout is slow and tedious though more than what Heists will give you in the same amount of time. You can also upgrade these buildings to net you more profit but the prices on the upgrades will cost you several times more than the initial investment on the property. It's absurd.It's great that Rockstar keeps adding content but most of it is entirely inaccessible to new players and the stuff that is (missions and new Heists) get really boring after a couple times. For instance the newest hottest car is the versatile ""Deluxo"" which is modelled after the Delorian from Back to the Future with the ability to fly and shoot missiles it's a really cool piece of kit. The problem is that the pricetag at over $3 million unless you've been grinding since the beginning or buy Shark Cards and new player won't be enjoying it for a long time. That doesn't even include it's ridiculously priced upgrades.Now we move to the Shark Cards Rockstar's bread and butter. The reason everything is so overpriced is because they want you to buy their Shark Cards to skip most of the grind and get in game money via microtransactions. It's a disgusting business practice but here we are. The Shark Cards also aren't even worth the money $20 will net you $1.250 Million in game so if you want that Deluxo and you don't have much? I'll cost you over $40. $40 real world dollars for a SINGLE vehicle without any upgrades. The sad part is that it's working as Rockstar's revenue is mostly powered by these Shark Card purchases.My complaints also extend into normal gameplay XP it trickle fed and a lot of clothes upgrades and items are barred behind your player level and you won't get to access everything in the game until you hit 120. At 145 hours of gameplay (all in multiplayer mind you) I'm in the mid 60s because gaining XP is a slow process.There you have it the base game is really fun but Rockstar ruined what this game had going for it. Earning money is a super tedious process because they want you to just buy it. I wouldn't mind if earning money was faster and more enjoyable (seriously doing the same Heists and missions over and over is incredibly boring) or that if you just got money from messing around with your friends and blowing stuff up in the freeroam (which is the only reason I keep playing) but that'll net you absolutely nothing. If you just want to mess around with friends it's a blast but just don't look at the cool weapons and vehicles that you could be enjoying unless you like blowing a lot of money.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-13,0,0,67,False,Recommended,I absolutely love this game. It has everything I want in a GTA and more with the ability to add mods specificlly LSPDFR.Everything about this game is superb in everyway. The story is excellent. The graphics are fantastic as is the sound. The detail in the world is amazing. I've probably spent more time just walking around looking at the world and how it interacts with everything in it. It's amazing.However I will never buy another title from Rockstar. Their obsessive DRM infested minds are soon going to ruin their future titles. It's disappointing that I require internet to reapitidly activate a product which has already been activated with proof of purchase.When a video gaming company DEMANDS their customers to connect to an internet connection to reapitidly activate an already activated and purchased product just to play a singleplayer game you've gone too far.I still recommend the game though.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-28,0,0,1166,False,Recommended,Great game ... I wish it didn't have all the modders/hackers I mean it is really bad with godmoders and people with unlimited cash and constant kill griefing taking over most servers... But when you play with a clean server you can really have fun in this game... However Rockstar needs to polish their servers by quit dropping players and making it nearly impossible to play with a larger group of friends do to time outs and server lag from modders. They really need to implement clean server admins that watch for Hacking activity and fowl play.. I hate to say it cause i like to freedom to play and say what I want but in terms of cheating I wish people would stop.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-26,0,0,81,False,Recommended,I'm giving this a good review only based on the Single Player portion of the game which is absolutely awesome.If you played other GTA games you already know what it is about and I won't have to go into details it just does all of the things from the previous game just better.If you haven't played other GTA games? What rock have you been hiding under?HoweverThe online part of the game is a mess you can buy your way to victory plenty of white knights will say you can't but.. you can.it is ruined by flying bikes that can shoot rockets and oneshot nearly anything while having flares to avoid rockets from rocket launchers or other planes.IMO only get this game if you are interrested in the single player part.,Grand Theft Auto V

You'll get ramdomly ban if you picked up modder's money. At least 75% of the time there is modder in the lobby. Loading time on multi players are horrible. Takes at least 5 min to get in and more if you're trying to play heist racing game or ects... Items costs way too much. Without shark card you won't be able to get multiple super cars in GTA online. I mean you can do it. But it's a grind. A very long grind with some tricks. GTA online it's pretty much cash grab for Rockstar/Take Two. They made sh*t tons money already with GTA V. Why not improve the experience of the game with that money???PS. Single Player Liked it a lot. It way more enjoyable experience than multi players.

NO JOYSITCK SUPPORT!!!!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!? Did some research and there is no joystick support at this time. I only bought this game on PC to expand my expierience with it and have more fun... I would like to use my wheels and stick periphials to enchance the gaming epeierince. I like to get into my game and enjoy some illusion for a while having to use the damn controller as best flying and driving option when I have things MUCH better suited really takes it away.

2019-01-02,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,If you are looking for building an empire online good luck. You can't turn off PvP in the open story online mode. Not if you want to be a CEO or owner of property. However if you liked getting killed repeatedly by the children in this game then go right ahead and go get killed over and over.If you are looking for a solo story game then maybe you'll like it. The missions are tricky sometimes and might take 2 6 tries. The controls... don't get me started. Each button on the controller is mapped to two different things. Have fun with that. It's okay for very casual playing but the controls seem overly complicated. Rockstar look into have a button open a menu of choices.Overall the story line in single player is pretty good. I don't mind a swear word every sentence. Not sure how they don't get in trouble with the thousands of times saying the N word. Anyways the story is good idea is good no open game play if you don't like getting ganked.,Grand Theft Auto V

The online aspect of this game is a breaht of fresh air as it allows u to race and have fun with your friends in an open world it also allows u to live a lavish lifestyle whilst having fun.

2019-01-03,0,0,100,False,Recommended,"Sonic 3D Blast also known as Sonic 3D Flickies' Island in Europe is isometric take on a mix of Sonic platforming serving as a spinoff to the franchise and Flicky collecting'n'leading hot action. It was developed by Travellers Tales and Sonic Team former doing main programmer job while latter came with game design ideas and some more. Well they did want Sonic 3 to be isometric to begin with. Also riding on whole pre rendered trend that went hip with Donkey Kong Country. Published by Sega in 1996 in the West only. 32 Megabit ROM the biggest that Sega Genesis can see at a single time.There also were Saturn and PC versions made near the end of development of this supposed Genesis swan song replacing the cancelled Sonic X Treme. Saturn had improved graphics redbook soundtrack different actual 3D special stages analog input. It's technically the best version. PC version was similar but lacked few graphics and had 2D parody of special stages yet had autosave feature.Sonic Blast on Game Gear is a different game despite fitting in marketing wise.The game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.I don't usually talk about mods but Director's Cut exists and it was made by game's main programmer so it's sorta semi official. None the less back to what Sega gives us there.Now technical part about Sega's emulation here The Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for ""Sega Mega Drive &amp Genesis Classics"" game that should appear in your library.It has Bedroom HUB which is the one with many features yet lags for many and Simply Launcher which lacks Workshop and Online but at least it works just fine for everybody.However Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time!Emulation itself mostly sound isn't that good but it does it's job. Also yes emulator supports quick saves.As alternative you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in ""uncompressed ROMs"" folder that program itself doesn't use just change file extension to "".bin"" or so. The file for this one being ""SONIC3D_UE.68K"".I also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. You can find it here on store page or go to ""manuals"" folder of game root and open ""S3DB_MG_EFIGS_US.pdf"".Robotnik has discovered that Flickies on Flickies's Island can actually travel between dimensions by using huge rings. So he trapped them all in Badnik robots to search for Chaos Emeralds. These robots aren't any different no dimension travel there. Sonic is back here and ready to save em all while his two gang members chill around.The core gameplay keeps the Sonic formula going. You can run around and you can jump. Seeing how it's isometric it has a separate button that you can roll with. Or spindash if standing still. You still defeating enemies by either jumping or rolling. Albeit using slopes by rolling doesn't play a big role here at all these are weak slopes. The controls have some inertia to it pleasently. Too bad Sonic can't immediately turn 180 degrees around he does a small circle. Still uses rings health system where as long as you have any rings you will survive a hit but then you have to recover all the scattered rings.It's a rather forgiving pleasant take on isometric style. You can run in all 8 directions. It hides nothing important behind walls. There are shadows for everything. The floor always has checkered tiles so you can measure borders are clearly defined. While Sonic is a bit too fast the game doesn't require much precision platforming. Well there are few but you can cheese most of them by using nearby spring pad or so. The levels are varied as well some having sorta puzzle elements. Spinning pads are great on the second zone.Protip You can break ice spikes in Diamond Dust by rolling into them.Powerups are back through breakable monitors. Invincibility extra life speed up so on. By the way Sonic icons that aren't in monitors aren't extra lives by medals. Collect 10 of them and you will get a continue. There are shields each giving you extra hit against normal stuff. Blue one is immune electricity red shields protects from fire golden one gives you active ability where you do Protip Get a red shield in a Volcano Valley or die.Each zone has two acts along with a boss one. The first two acts are divided into two three stages. And in each stage you have to save five flickies. That means there are only five badniks in a stage and most of them are static non threats. Not too exciting. At least game somewhat makes up with stage hazards. But the game is still too easy. Then you break those robots and have to grab birds. This is where Flicky inspiration comes in. The birds will follow you in a line and they can be broken off with projectiles after which they scatter around. It worked in Flicky which was a tight 2D game where you constantly get chased by cats you would die if they touch you and simply scatted lines of flickies if they touch those. With risk reward applied as you got score by bringing in bigger lines and that would lead to getting extra lives in a tough game. Here? Not a tight design it's just there. Projectiles may throw birds off but that just happens not something you pay attention to. Collecting birds over lava is pain. There is too much space nothing chasing you. Yea. It's just there just making you spend a bit more time in levels and thus isn't exciting.There is usual optional quest for 7 Chaos Emeralds. Actually they look like Halls candies which would explain why Sonic can't turn into Super Sonic. Super makes games too easy anyway. You do get an extra final boss and good ending however that's good. To get an emerald you must find Tails or Knuckles first just chilling. Both of them appear in each act hiding or appearing somewhere in previous stage once you progress feel free to backtrack. Last appearing in Volcano Valley. It does mean you can get two emeralds per act one from each. You get extra life on repeat. Just give these fams 50 rings. Though they will take and store any amount so don't bump into them.After that you get into a special stage. You run over bridge collect rings and avoid bombs. It looks incredibly smooth the best on Mega Drive. Albeit gameplay is a bit plain and is too easy. Still fun.There are usual bosses. Robotnik every time. Most often you just wait for him to get down and hit him then avoid his stuff repeat. Varied health. Not bad but not too cool.Protip For Volcano Valley boss instead of trying to get into pipes first you should curve your jump off side floor to hit Robotnik then you will be bounced backward onto pipes.Not much options. Just sound test and controls. Bare minimum!As for graphics. Well. They tried to do DKC thing with prerendered sprites because it was still cool albeit 1996 was somewhat late. Which isn't the smartest thing to do on Genesis as compared to SNES it has low amount of colors. Still devs deserve some love for managing to create smooth vibrant world. And fitting intro FMV into Genesis cartridge is just awesome. Too bad that ending is just a bunch of images with text.Music is great too. Chiptune goodness the best from few composers on the project.Overall eh. Mixing Flicky and Sonic is a nice idea as evidenced by game like Wiz'n'Liz albeit that one was only somewhat Flicky. But this isometric execution of it is weak. I still wouldn't call it a bad game. Pick only if you want some chill isometric platformer.",Grand Theft Auto V

Ok rockstar provide me with a tardis to go back and take these vids and I will gladly do it I have played a fair bit since then and my garages have changed around (I was about to give up on support making any contact it was all wishful thinking anyway on my part).This game could have been so much better than it is its just a 60fps port with some graphic tweaks and some new glitches.,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't buy money boosters etc. You can earn a lot early on just get to level 15 to kick off joining the motorcycle club I haven't come across 'hackers' yet maybe im too new but I have definitely found those people that harrass you till you leave the server. It's difficult to make friends with people that launch RPG's from their hover bikes at you. Car insurance is a must. hahah.i pirated this game years ago and it was time to support the Rockstart team. Thanks. It's a wonderfully immersive escape from reality game. Even single player.My top tip for quickest load into Online. Load into Single PLayer and then go online from the in game menu. Not the menu screen when you start the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-06,0,0,43,False,Recommended,I am late to the party but I finally got a GPU in my PC allowing me to play all these games from the past couple of years that have caught my interest. GTA V being one of them it has not disappointed so far! I have played about 10 hours and it is just incredible. The last GTA experience I had was Vice City (which was excellent for its time imo) but there is just no comparison. The huge open world of GTA V the freedom and different choices to make along with excellent voice overs and story make this game a must play. After I complete the story mode I will be interested in checking out online. So far so good though! Next up is Witcher 3!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-28,0,0,149,False,Recommended,"Rockstar Games presents G R A N D T H E F T A U T O VI bought total of 3 same games. One for PS3 when game first came out and later one for PC and I thought it would activate on my steam but nope. Turns out for Rockstar Social Club... So I bought this here on steam. 270+ dollars worth of these games and you know what? It's worth every penny of it. Back in 2013 when GTA V first released that was a mistake. WHY ON SEPTEMBER?? Back to school that's why. So when I bought that game I used to spend all the night playing on it and used to fake sick on school to play it. I used to work at a printing workshop and I made myself a huge poster of GTA V cover on my room and it's still there. Its story is glorious. There are some people whining SA is better they're total dumbasses. But to me compared to SA the only thing I loved about SA that did better than V is one thing The locations. There are no dams or those arches or even Las Venturas. That was a perfect opportunity to do it to make the game feel more like the real world and perfect photography and gameplay. PROS It's on Steam now! I never thought Rockstar gave a crap on Steam but thank God the game is on steam. It's impossible I didn't believe it.On PC!! Yup I'd rather have GTA on PC rather than Red Dead series. It's so much better and so SO much beautiful.One of the best written storyline gamesFirst person view!!! Finally I can replay the game in first person!Dynamic loading technology. Holy This is one of the most best video game tech I have ever seen in my existence. For example. During the game it has slightly no loading. Like when you're on a mission and go there and head there. The animations play without loading at all. Or loading screens. Holy crap.Well chosen musics / SoundtracksGood multiplayer &amp co op. Multiplayer was added from an update within a month since the game's release and it came out with the boom. I forgive them for not adding a heist stated from the online trailer it was added a year later. And many things like shark cards and grind... I don't really play much online but do replayed lots and lots of storymode multiple times.Very well optimized. This game can even run on old computers! WTFFFFF... Seriously no matter what Rockstar do I will still support them until the end. I never knew this is possible. The game looks graphically stunning and is extremely well optimized. Unlike IV. That damn game is about 10+ years old and run by today's most powerful video cards and cpus and the game still runs like poop even with the new update.ENHANCED EDITION!! It's soo much better than previous versions (consoles)InteractionsComedy. I spent many time ing around with the protagonists' life and family and they have really funny dialogues. The radio too and the shows.""Web sites""Customization. For the first time Rockstar finally added costumization for guns and for cars after years. The last time they had a game with car costumization was 2004's GTA San Andreas. No wonder why didn't they add it on IV.Support &amp updatesBad assery / Memorable scenesMods!DLCs are all free expect microtransactionsCONS Death of legendary OG characters (etc Johnny)Franklin is a lame character. I loved T and M but to be honest Franklin is boring. He doesn't like fun no personality and is too serious. Michael and Trevor does everything for him and at the end he betrayed one of them optionally at the end. (no point off taken)No offline mode. WTF WHY NOT!? NOT EVERYONE HAVE INTERNET GOD DAMNIT!The cops make the game unplayable.No huge dams! and beautiful arches. Why! The dams that look gigantic and have lights on them is really beautiful. They dont' have them. And the natural arches... damn.The cars in the game are a joke. I hate the models of it. Look at any other games like Watch Dogs they're so much better.No Las Venturas.. casinos..No weight or muscle features from GTA SA so when they added 3 unique characters it means they'll sacrifice your costumization. Because these 3 characters change their clothes for example all the time. Your character in Online does but... it's online.Every single GTAO characters look exactly the same. The same body weight the same head the same.. everything. It's just the skin color and hair features... Why? Maintenance. EVERY single time I start play online IT ALWAYS ends with maintenance error within a day. First mission. Yeah sure busting out doing heist is fun but when you do it for the 10000th time you're ing done. There's no way to skip this.9.5/10Literally one of the most popular most favorite game and the third the best selling game of all time.I can only hope Rockstar make another good GTA game soon. And get released on PC WITH the release. otherwise I'll be mad (",Grand Theft Auto V

Upon downloading the 62GB game I get about 10 minutes into the prologue and it crashes. At first I thought it was the graphics I was running the game at so I toned down the settings a tad get back into prologue CRASH. I then spend the next hour and a half researching why this POS game wont work. Tried MULTIPLE things to make the crashes and fail loads stop NOTHING WORKED. I thought to myself well maybe I can get a refund atleast since I only played about maybe 3 hours at that point? Sent a refund request. DENIED. Now I'm stuck with a game that crashes every in 10 20 mins and I'm also out 35 dollars. I do NOT recommend this game at all.

2017-03-17,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,After nagging my parents for weeks to let me buy this game despite the matrue themes of it (I was 14 at the time) they finally let me buy Grand Theft Auto V in May of 2014. After I first installed the game on my Xbox 360 me and my friends played the Online Mode for the rest of the day. I was absolutely entrigued by how innovative it was for the time it came out. Mass multiplayer huge open world gameplay etc. By the end of summer 2014 I had clocked in an unhealthy 350 HOURS into the online mode. It was ridiculous looking back on it now but at the time it was the most fun I've had in a long time. It was so insane and breathtakingly fun that I was unable to put it down and I had the best time with my friends in jobs and in open play. It was and still is the best game I have ever played barnone.When I got the PC version just last year I was ready to enjoy the new features of next gen and improved graphics compared to the Xbox 360. I clocked in about 50 hours or so in the last year that I've had it. And I can tell you it is not worth the $60. Unless you have never played this game before or you are brand new to the open world game I just don't see the reason why you would really need it. If you've already played it on prior consoles like I have (not the next gen consoles) there really isn't a point in buying the game. Not too much has been added to it that really imporved it that much. The only thing that I would argue is worth it is the Heists but that's only fun for about three hours until you quit because no one wants to join the lobby. The players are still d*ckweeds the community is still trash and Rockstar hasn't done much to fix annoying things like this. As far as I know the issue where people are being banned for absolutely no reason at all is still present which has been an issue since this game was released for the PC in 2015. Rockstar hasn't fixed this issue in TWO YEARS! There is no excuse for ignorance over issues like that. Another thing that has upset me is that Rockstar continues to implement extremely expensive items like $10 million yachts and planes. Are you serious? I know that they are luxury items but unless you either play the missions for YEARS or spend $500 on Shark Cards you will never be able to afford an item like that. I've put in about 400 total hours or so and I have amounted about $4 million. 2/5 off of even a decent yacht. It's absolutely ridiculous. I have not had enough experience in the campaign mode to recommend it to you. I really didn't want to play it as the Online was too much fun to quit. As far as I have heard it is quite a bit of fun but most people who buy the game immediatley play the Online once done with the campaign. Now as I mentioned before this game is fantastic for people who haven't played it before but for anyone looking for an upgrade from Xbox 360 or PS4 they should sadly avoid it. It is sad to say but it is too disappointing to buy. There is no reason to buy this game unless you want to experience it for the first time.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-10-21,0,0,313,False,Not Recommended,"So yeah I've got about 300+ hours in GTA V. About 10 15 hours of it I want to say was put into the Campaign on my PS3 then my PC. I loved the Online in this game when I could play it That didn't really last all that long though when I started up the connection was poor like real poor That got fixed somewhat at some point even with decent internet. Not that I really complained as I had substandard internet then.The Story itself is fun even if it is horridly underwhelming with the lack of content put into the Singleplayer once they worked out they could milk us for all our worth with Shark Cards online Many things in the story were essentially left open only like 5 Heists tops be the end to ""Level up"" our crews in the game.The Online community at best was trash You can't explore the map or do things like armored trucks without at least 8 people on a server Same with all of the other random events unless you can get a server of friends together you're not gonna get to do much short of mill around doing the jobs that pay about $0*0 Things in the game are expensive as hell that need you to get a Party of 4 people together so you can do the Heists YOU NEED Friends to play this game for anything fun.The variety of vehicles is great as I said BUT Again you cant get all the features in the Singleplayer experience Something I got relegated to after a Permanent Ban I know how I got the Ban Not going to argue it because the games really not worth the effort anymore I have no friends to play it and the community still has a tonne of hackers that can strip you of your weapons for being a big enough problem for them after they come at you in a car they also have the means to mass flag you for a Nice and quick ban. Are all the people who get banned guilty? Not really is the game worth getting unbanned on? hell no.I just pray Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't as Cancer as this ended up being.Rating Literally don't buy this game if you don't own it it's not worth it./10 Vindictator1972",Grand Theft Auto V

And also when you mod the game and they add an update for it you cant refuse the update because they want to outdate the mod you have installed soo you cant play with the mod untill the mod is updated. And this game will crash if it has one problem it also fills up a lot of space on your storage each mesh and texture file is about 1 000 000 in size. Its also has some of the most repetitive gameplay I have ever seen its kill this kill that open this blow up that find this move that sure it has an ok story but the gameplay itself is almost too boring. And in the online if your making money the AI will get a higher accuracy and does more damage in heist if your gonna complete it fast some times a random ped will go faster and kill you on the road.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,61,False,Recommended,There are a few problems to be Ironed out. I'd prefer to be able to save at any point in the game but waddya gonna do? Graphics are better than just acceptable They are EXCELLENT! I'm getting 60fps using both of my GTX650TI SLI. It see's all 4096mb of VRAM and the game is using about 3gb total. The cards are running about 80 85C and both fans are HOWLING. I just realize I've been playing this game for about 9 hours today. Not sorry I spent the money!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-10,0,0,277,False,Recommended,The game needs no review by now... All I can say is Rockstar did it well! I'm not even a little bit sorry of the 60 I payed for it. The action the driving the humor and the world and all the live tha comes with it... All the explorations... al the little touches like wet clothes... All the interesting and beautifull locations... The World is actually bigger than I expacted at first... At 62 hours spent in game I havent even tried out the Movie editor and I spent maybe 1h in online... I think there has not yet been a game with such great price/content ratio... no monthly fees no t micro transactions... Just good old GTA )Oh another thing that amazed me... I was expecting for the game to be well optimized since I read that this is taken care of by the same team that did it in Max Payne 3. But to have most of the stuff on High Very High some on Ultra even and still run the game on 1080p with no problems on my 5 years old PC (I5 750 8GB DDR3 1333 HD7870)! The only the investment that I did on my PC since 2009 was 1 year ago with getting a HD7870 for 90 and additional 4GB DDR3 1333 for 30... I'm still blown away sometimes how beautifull it can look and that this is running smoothly on my PC ) Just for comparasement Sleeping dogs for example looked worse the world was smaller and alot more boring and for sure it did not felt so real the gameplay got repetitive really quick I had to run that game on Mendium and not even sure if I was able to run it normally on 1080p.GTAV is a game that belongs into every gamers library. 9/10 at minimum!,Grand Theft Auto V

If you're playing online it is recommended that you have some friends to help you out. Story mode (Or Singleplayer) is nice and always will be and can be modded but if you want to play online you need to remove all mods.It might get boring after a bit of online tho. It's a constant grind for money which isnt really easy to get if you dont know what you're doing.Additional Note Opressor Mk.2 was a mistake.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-17,0,0,622,False,Recommended,Although playing online can be a pain either just full of russians screaming down their mic or you get in with hackers but however when you get in a decent session it is a really great time. Money making can be difficult so you may have to grind some missions or heists. Now you could buy shark cards for real money or just find a hacker that gives out money not saying the second one won't get you banned. Rockstar did just add a transaction tracker that stops you picking up money off the floor after you have picked up a lot. They may be able to take that money back or even ban you for having modded in money.Single player however is a lot of fun i haven't completed it on PC but i did on the xbox 360 so the improvements in graphics and the abilitiy of first person will improve the experience. The story of all 3 characters are different as you know there is Michael Trevor and Franklin. My favourite is the loonatic Trevor the first time you get to play as him after the prologue you realise that he is a total nutter. Even getting the game for story will give you many hours of play time. Yes they did say they were going to release some story DLC but the demand is more in GTAOnline so thats where they have spent their time. This game deffinetly deserves 10/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

To me it meant being somebody in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies. They weren't like anybody else. I mean they did whatever they wanted. They double parked in front of a hydrant and nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer when they played cards all night nobody ever called the cops.""GTA V allows me to be my own gangster amass wealth and influence for myself GTA Online has to get my first bit of this review I think it's awesome I have enjoyed all the content thus far the only reason I would want to pester Rockstar for more heists is because of how much I enjoy the ones they have given me.The whole online atmosphere though the ability to foster your own style of criminal enterpriser is flat out fun.The story holy crap have I enjoyed the story Michael Franklin and Trevor all have elements of what I've loved from the past GTA's and I don't think I've enjoyed a story line like this from GTA since the first chapter of GTA III. The story kept me wanting more and after playing with the classic gangster the gangsta and the hill billy wrecking ball ( I say that lovingly) It really helped me mold my own style when I persued my own efforts in GTA online.These guys had me literally laughing out loud had me playing continuously for hours because I wanted to see what came next all the cut scenes are good and the in game dialouge from the characters kept me chuckling and attentive. Attention to detail for this game +++++I dont know I feel like im blathering a bit really at this point I want to go play more. This game is easily worth $60. Thank you Rockstar.",Grand Theft Auto V

The story line was enjoyable and I felt the characters had good development and twists. My rating 8.5/10 Great! If a few bugs are fixed I'll upgrade the rating. The loading is terrible though and I would hope that they fix the black screen of waiting forever at the end of heists allow you to pickup new members or finish the heist with less as it's terrible considering the loading involved in heists and people leaving all the time!The online community is mostly pretty awesome! There is a troll here or there but in general I find it to be a great community with one major exemption to it God mode script kiddies they aren't about all the time but they can really ruin a good server or ruin fights for people by making it impossible to win. Other than that and the loading time/being able to pick up new members when one drops from heists and a few other little things are a tad annoying but usually I'm having too much fun to care!

I say this as a player who OWNS all that novelity t and who has never been through ""video game financial hardships"" I hop on each update blow another 40 million on all there is and play with it for a few hours until I see what a in joke this game as become for the average player who grinds countless hours for only a few moments of fun in the new specialized vehicle.Rockstar has changed. GTA V has been the most successful title they have ever launched and it's ruined them. The they've done to Online isn't even the worst of it. Since the beginning of the Online money Cow Singleplayer has been excluded from patches updates DLC.Now they want to further penalize and destroy the modding community that helped the issues they never cared to fix. By banning players with edited files and just now by legally strong arming the mod devs in attempt to kill their community.Rockstar is anti consumer and anti creative freedom. I hate to not recommend what was once the best game I've ever experienced but rockstar has become a souless bastard of a company. do not support them with shark cards. PC is riddled with script kiddies who drop insane money anyway #GTAGIVERS. Rockstar doesn't care about that though.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-13,0,0,189,False,Recommended,Starting off Campaign 8/10. This campaign is clearly one of the best I have ever played although i stopped playing it around 8 hours in. Charismatic characters fresh fun mission etc.Online I believe this is where the core experience of the game is. Buying cars houses boats partaking in heists doing car stealing missions and further more all are extremely fun and make you feel like a total badass. There are also races but i dont do those much although they are pretty fun. 9.5/10Verdict 9/10 GTA V is a must buy for any gamer who likes guns cars or just feeling like a badass.Side note Don't get disturbed by those saying they were banned for no reason. They either willing picked up cash from a modder or they are a modder which is cheating. I personally haven't done those and im still playing the game having a blast.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-04,0,0,1086,False,Not Recommended,"When this game came out it wasn't the best with the physics and irritating unrealisticness. But at least in the beginning it was still playable.Now? You can't go into Online without being griefed the whole time you play by people in vehicles that literally anyone with no skill can use. Flying motorcycles with rockets that can't be shot down even with aimbot practically invincible tanks that reload in less than 5 seconds jets that swoop in from above you where you can't aim sniper rifles that can kill you from miles away with explosive rounds and the list goes on. If you couldn't already tell by my hours on this game I have played this more than any game in my life besides Halo 1 2 Reach and Gmod. Car Customization The variety of cars and customization is great but the ""upgrades"" are absolutely . For the offroad vehicles you can only LOWER them not lift them. The Sultan RS (which can be upgraded to have a full rally body kit) has maybe 4 inches of clearance WITH STOCK SUSPENSION. You can install turbos on cars that already have twin turbos according to the badging. Supercharged cars have no difference in engine sound from a naturally aspirated car with the same base engine sound. You can put lowrider rims with white walls on armored trucks and supercars completely ruining the look of half the cars in Online since there are so many kids that throw them on thinking they look nice for whatever reason. Lowriders Update You wouldn't believe how hyped I was when I first heard they were releasing one for this game. One of my dream cars is a '69 El Camino lowrider. When they added lowriders to the game I was extremely disappointed. You can't 3 wheel (one of the most common things people do with lowriders ) you can't use the hydraulics without it scratching your whole bumper when it doesn't touch anything but the underbody when you land you can't remotely control the hydraulics which pretty much ruins lowrider competitions you can't keep them in one position when you get out of the car and you can't change the travel for when you hop. Economy Rockstar why the would you make a 1980's M3 (which costs no more than 50k IRL) $800 000? Maybe like that is the reason everyone is modding and doing money drops. If you want to overcharge people for everything then no one is going to want to waste their time grinding for something that isn't worth hours of grinding your off. Rockstar keeps adding new buildings/buisnesses that get you the exact same amount of money. You can't run all of them at once because you would have to constantly refill the 10 buildings non stop. They keep making new special vehicles but you know what the only way get them is? Buying the new buisness they included in the update. Conclusion There is plenty of other illogical BS they ruined this game with that I could've talked about but this review would take up more space than the game's store page. I just hope to god Rockstar doesn't ruin GTA VI by doing the same they did with GTA V. The cons of this game outweigh the pros. If you asked me back when this game came out before they ruined online I would be telling you this is the best game that ever existed.GTA VI has so much potential. Don't ruin it Rockstar.",Grand Theft Auto V

Singleplayer is great as per usual with Rockstar's games characters are unique and memorable missions are consistently great with some being a little boring early on (Franklin's missions for Simmeon). The port is also pretty good as I get 45 50 and even 60 fps at times with a Nvidia Gtx 650. This game is definetily worth the purchase for anyone looking to have a good time.

2015-04-13,0,0,85,False,Not Recommended,"Update With the threat to legal action to users doing nothing illegal this has put the final nail in the coffin for GTAV for me.I highly recommend against buying this game.First they don't do about hackers stealing money and will ban you if hackers give you money. Now they make modding ""illegal"" or at least threaten legal action to it's users. I am hoping that Steam takes action like they did with other games which has threatened legal action against it's users and removes the game from the Steam store. Original review The graphics are nice and the gameplay is pretty good but multiplayer is riddled with people constantly using hacks Rockstar fails to implement a working anti cheat so multiplayer is mostly ""Get tons of money that will be removed later"" or ""Lose tons of money that might not be added back later"" or get killed a lot. Users randomly disconnect from the lobby due to it being ""peer to peer"" so instead of doing the reliable thing and hosting servers they leech off clients that can send untrusted packets to each other and the master cloud server which goes down often.Along with that the game slugs down often and crashes(By crashes I mean hangs the entire computer) at least 3 times within 5 hours in both multiplayer and single player yet Rockstar wants people to pay for ""Sharkcards""(In game instant currency).Unlike other games in the Grand Theft Auto series you can't just store any old car in your garage especially police cars utility vehicles and a wide variety of vehicles. If you are lucky you can ""Buy"" these cars with in game currency.However the support on their site is friendly/helpful and the overall visuals/story is great but the game needs some serious work before it can get my recommend.I will continue to play the game but only because I already have it. I will not be buying sharkcards at least until they fix most of the issues.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-02,0,0,453,False,Recommended,So I bought this game during the winter sale and like many other mainly single player games I own I assumed that I would play for a couple hours and then put the game down because I didn't want to grind my way through the story. Tomb Raider was different. This campaign is one of the most exciting campaigns I have played in years and that puts this game on my all time favorites list with great games like Star Wars Battlefront (2004) and Halo Reach. I could not put this game down. Around every corner there is something to fine. Unfortunately I grinded the games story and managed to complete the story with an overall game completion of 68% but there is no doubt in my mind that I will not play this game again soon. I played the game on the hardest dificulty and although I died a couple times seven times to be exact The game was so much fun that I didn't care about me dying when I got rushed by 20 autoaiming enemies. Overall I love this game. I found everything about it great the story the graphics and gameplay. It isn't often that I find a game like this where I want to come back and keep playing day after day and not put it down at all. This game is amazing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,940,False,Recommended,So many people complaining about this game and it's community. Single player is great so let's put that aside. Online however is where the negative reviews come from. I understand the issues people have with the grinding and the cheaters but understand that rock star doesn't give a . Plain and simple. They make money on dlcs by making things so expensive to the point where the grind to get what you want is impossible. What I'm saying is that's how they are making money at this point so they don't care if people are complaining because for every one person that complains 10 thousand buy shark cards. As for the cheater situation tough Hate to break it to you but gta online runs a p2p connection. In other words it is literally impossible for them to stop cheaters. To even attempt to stop the cheaters they would have to rework the entire thing shut down online revamp the code open dedicated servers and basically spend a load of money. Needless to say that's just not even a realistic possibility. Point being if you buy this game to play online find good protection mods and money mods or you honestly just wasted your money on this and guaranteed will have a bad time.,Grand Theft Auto V

Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero.

2018-07-07,0,0,114,False,Recommended,I haven't touched this game in years but decided to write a short review anyway. Singleplayer is a great. I enjoyed nearly every minute. Multiplayer is also a good time. I've not logged in over a year so not sure if I'm one that suffered from the ban craze thats going on. The only reason that I'm writing the review at this time is I don't believe it deserves the 'mixed' rating it currently shows. If you are playing single player it is a 100% recommendation if you play multiplayer however beware of all of the account bans that seem to be flooding the reviews and forums and be catious about investing to much time into a game that may kick you and wipe your account for no reason.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game is obviously the same but PC has better damage and a first person mode among the much better graphics. The first person is a HUGE part of the game. Every car interior is different the lights on the dash function small dings when you open the door everything is detailed.

The singleplayer was both funny and exciting in more than a few parts and will give you at least a few fun hours. Even after completeing the main story the game itself still feels worth playingNow onto online. Yes there are hackers. No they will never be gone. That being said there are multiple ways to play without them having the ability to affect you. You can create an instance where you personally have the power to choose to play solo with selected people be it friends or crew members.I think fairly highly of the entire singleplayer campaign but that being said i absolutely think they could put more work into the online missions and heists. They are uninspired and just flat out boring only worth doing for the money no other reason.7/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-01,0,0,222,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V offers a amazing single player experience with the first Grand Theft Auto storyline I have actually ever completed having played all the other games. The story of this game is great a real 10/10 experience. Although the online portion of the game can come a bit troublesome I have found my hours in the online servers to be fun and quite enjoyable. I do not think Rockstar bans users for no reason like you may have seen in some reviews although online hackers do worry me.Pros Great story and gameplay. Has yet to lack content. Multiplayer is a enjoyable GTA experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-25,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,Review from a PVE player.DONT BUY it if you like PVE gameplay you either get killed by players alot so you cant make any money without being in a sort of PVP mode or if you finnally can play in peace you need other players to help you with dropping off your hard earned cocaine and if you start that mission the whole server is being alerted that you are doing a drop and everyone gets in their tanks and gunships to kill you.Also NPC s are all well trained snipers even the ones with just a sidearm/handgun from miles away.Selling cars you can only sell 1 car every 45 min and you normally only get around 3.5k a car with a max of 5k sometimes.Community the community can be good at sometimes and helpfull (if you can find a nice crew to help you) but most of the time its toxic as hell especially those hacking russians.So if you like the previous GTA series and like PVE and dont like PVP then dont waste your money and time with this game.So MY verdict is 3/10ps. Rockstar is all out to sell those shark cash cards so everything is expensive and you dont get much money at all ingame all this to increase the chance you buy those cards so in my opinion this game is P2W Cash cow all the way.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-20,0,0,221,False,Recommended,If you want to play GTA V for its single player only then I totally recommend picking this up however if you are buying it for GTA Online its a different story. If you really want to play and enjoy GTA online just be sure that you wouldn't mind doing an endless grind for GTA money or spending real cash for shark cards.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-03-13,0,0,69,False,Recommended,I don't know what I can say about GTA V that most people already said It's a great game that has one of the best open worlds I've ever seen filled with completely crazy characters. The vehicles all feel really realistic and I think the physics also look quite realistic. The story is great and there is loads of side missions that also have amazing characters. When it comes to GTA Online I am not so sure. For anything cool added in to GTA Online you'll either have to grind for weeks if not months or pay real money. Still there is some fun to be had in GTA Online if you drive around San Andreas with a few friends and do the stuff you might do alone in Singleplayer.In conclusion I would definitely recommend GTA V but think you should reconsider buying it for GTA Online.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-11-11,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,"This version of GTA V is borderline unplayable for me. I already owned and beat it on PS3 saw it was on sale for $20 on steam so though I would give it another go. Played a hour or so of single player. Camera keep shifting to NPC characters during missions and I would lose control of my playable character forcing me to fail or restart the mission. This happened several times. Ok bad start mabye try some GTA online. Played two missions and now stuck in an infinite loading screen! Maybe its my computer ""ASUS ROG Laptop I7 cpu 8gb ram and 2gb nvidia GPU"" but it happens on low med and max settings.

The only thing that kept this beaten horse alive was the modding community as with all games. Unfortunately since it's been proven as a fact that kids will buy any stupid thing Rockstar throws at them for money that needs to be either glitched cheated or bought ingame one will often come across ludicrous people with overpowered items.Most of multiplayer experience is a cloud simulator or cheaters blowing you up even if you disabled pvp. Heists are so incredibly unforgiving that they are not even fun to play public. And once someone fail they leave and you're back to watching clouds. Same with every single mission in the entire game.

2017-06-06,0,0,127,False,Recommended,Yes it's a great f***ing game we all know that.GTA Online though while fun for the first 20 50 hours incredibly boring and annoying with all the loading screens and clunky interfaces it has. I mean why the hell does it take 5 minutes to find a single deathmatch game? AND when you get in a game you'll find you got matched up with like 2 or 3 players. Ridiculous. Loading screens upon loading screens. Oh did I mention if the game fails to find a match for you it will RELOAD the entire free roam thing? I had times where the game just completely hung up on the sky view thing.Rockstar needs to completely revamp the whole thing. If I want to just play a quick deathmatch or mission or whatever anything that's not free roam let me choose that BEFORE the game loads!Yes get this game you won't regret buying it because what is there is great I just want to point out these annoyances with Online you should beware.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-11,0,0,140,False,Recommended,For me this gets a 7/10 for all next gen platforms. The reason im not giving the PC a higher rating is because I have a stupid bug when I launch the game. For some reason the launcher doesn't want to launch as the Social Club startup seems to go on infinetly (I even let it go all night...go ahead and guess what happened). I had to make a new Windows user in order to be able to play it and Rockstar still hasn't fixed this yet. Ranting aside this game is such a step up from GTA IV especially the driving. GTA IV's driving felt like you were constantly on an ice rink. The first person works phenomenally and the graphics from last gen to next gen are so much better though I don't like how on PC you have a limit on how good your graphics can be based on how many gigs your GPU has. The new adversary modes in Online are very addictive and fun to play and the free DLCs add a lot of good stuff to the game. All in all definitely get this game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-19,0,0,299,False,Recommended,This isn't what it was on 360. This is art in games. I hope your system can handle its demanding load (giggity). It puts mine through the wringers but it gets done.Now closer to 60 hrs in I've found my niche. I was able to download my previous Rock Star Social Club profile that I had used on XBOX 360. I jumped back in where I'd left off with my luxury apartment in the sky a garage full of wild and exotic vehicles to choose from and the added bonus of the $1 300 000 I received for having pre ordered the game.It surprises me that the game received a solid 80% approval rating on Steam but then it's been in my experience that some of the best games ever flew or even drove in under the radar.There is no online experience more fun to me than being in a lobby full of gamers using mics or better yet friends with mics. This is the pinnacle.If you liked the PAYDAY series then online heists should be to your liking. Everybody has their role to play in online heists. Crowd control safe cracking even a getaway driver. Each heist proves that the strongest player is four players working together harmoniously and RSSC rewards this by giving you huge XP and cash bonuses for working together closely and as a team.If you're the sort of gamer who likes racing games GTA V Online hosts races with up to 16 players in any number of environments. Breakneck down a busy street full of traffic in exotics? It's got it. Mudders buggies trucks and dirt bikes for an off road rally race? It's got it. Feel like piloting one of the many planes and helicopters the game has to offer and doing a point to point around the skies of the Los Santos? No problem. It's got it.Stand offs? It's got it. Submarine exploration? You guessed it. Can my avatar smoke marijuana and then hallucinate the appearance of aliens and clown? You bet your you can. How about a rousing game of golf? Billiards? Bowling? Yoga? Arm wrestling? Yes yes yes yes and yes.So if you've got the ability to do anything you'd like to occupy your time alongside your friends why wouldn't you enjoy playing this game?I can't fathom a reason.,Grand Theft Auto V

Just a bit of advice for the multiplayer is everyone has their own beliefs about whats ""right"" and ""wrong"" if you want to have fun just stick to what you want to do and don't let anyone say ""your playing GTA wrong"". So if you have the 20 bucks to spare (its always on sale for around that amount) I'd pick it up (its a pain to install you'll probably leave it to download overnight).

Worth the price If u have some spare money left Not recommended You could also just burn your money Bugs Never heard of Minor bugs Can get annoying ARK Survival Evolved The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsActual review Ok so I have yet to play story mode to completion so this is mostly a review on GTA Online. This game is fun especially with your friends. My big issues with it are the modders the loading times and the grind. You can't pick which server you go on and I'd say you have a 60% chance of running into modders who 95% of the time are just out to ruin the game for everybody else. With Rockstar cracking down on these guys you dont wanna be anywhere near them when they get banned or you could be banned too. But here's the thing entering/exiting Online servers takes an age to do. The loading times are ridiculous. I can literally go and prepare dinner in the time it takes for me to join a server. I'd say 1/4 of your time in this game will just be looking at loading screens. My other problem is the grind. You need to keep playing jobs to earn ridiculous amounts of money before being able to buy the fun stuff. This put newer players at a huge disadvantage especially when you take into account that a large portion of the community doesn't know how to treat other human beings. Honestly I would recommend this game but not for its listed price. Get it on sale if you value your money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Have rockstar constantly take sums out of your bank accounts because some random modder decided todrop some of those sweet bags on your head that you didnt ask for...(49 mil legit gone) in the end of it all your only playing to kill friends and for the enjoyment of spending your invaluble time grinding for a virtual car that can easily be taken away from you D anything else your wasteing your time...even though I have over 600h invested into this sharkcard discounted money barage of a game thats beside the point. I like it because me and my friends have something else to turn to in case we don't find a game in the next hour or so so try it but buy it when it's on sale or you will be wasteiing your money it goes on sale often though. Have fun don't be the guy ruining it for others though no body likes that guy.P.S. Tutorials help.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-02,0,0,76,False,Recommended,GTA 5 has a very long single player campaign which i really liked. The only sad thing is that we didn't get any DLC for it and i guess its understable coz they are making way more money with the multiplayer. I just wish we could see more of Trevor in a single player DLC. Nonetheless there is a lot of fun to be had with the multiplayer i never fell into the microtransaction trap and i think you all shouldnt as well. This kind of ruins the experience and makes companies like Rockstar dive more into this micro transaction then give us a nice single player DLC. 8/10 (1 point loss because no DLC),Grand Theft Auto V

The online mode is pay to have fun halve of the time the severs kicks every one out and the mission are not properly done. My outfits keep getting removed over and over again while more and more modders appear. Rock star keeps adding more and more exspensive cars that are completely overpowered and every single player wants to kill you as soon as you leave ur house. just resently they added a new game breaking bike called the oppresser that every troll uses and doing mission where picking up packetages is to hard to do with oppressers taking the package and flying away. Devs patch glitches that are not harmfull for the game like getting cool outfits that are in game but not able to buy. Every DLC is not free becuse you have to grind for for days to be able to buy just some of the new cars. Devs never add anything new to older DLCs so once out they don't get anything new and become completely pointless becuse the next DLC has something that makes the first DLC point less. Missions are in bad locations most of the time. things in the game cost more then the actual game. I whish I never bought this game and its a big wast of money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Freeroam is great robbing convenience stores with your mate as the getaway driver is amazing or destroying cop cars in a technical with air support from an attack helicopter. Then there's the jobs races are hilarious especially if you all suck and crash often and the missions are good fun especially if you bring a long a turreted Pegasus vehicle with you.If you want to min/max or buy everything or be the highest level sure I could see how this game could get tiring and grindy but if you just want to screw around and shoot your friends or the cops this game is the best out there and I haven't seen a co op open world game that is more in depth or fun than this. Forget public servers if you're afraid of hackers or getting banned you miss out on some features sure but then nobody bothers you when you set up that 43 bus jump that you've always dreamed of doing.The game is fun the community is questionable but the random things that you can think up in this game and execute make it incredible and very memorable.

2018-11-02,0,0,119,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V so many things to do/experience... First off you do not have to play the other GTA games before playing this one although I have played every GTA game in order it may help with some references in the game if you are really following the story (Which you should because its amazing.) This game takes place in San Andreas which is split into two different counties Los Santos and Blaine County which is a huge map which sets you up for various things to do whether is be shopping drinking smoking racing anything you can think of you can probs do in GTA 5. So if you are thinking of buying GTA 5 DO IT!!!!!! The story is great very fun and extensive story mode which takes over 40 hours to complete. I haven't really touched GTA Online in a while heard great things though except for all the modders on PC if you really wanna play some Online head on console.If you have already played GTA 5 or want to play other GTA Games I can highly recommend the following1. GTA San Andreas (Use the enhanced graphics mod this will make the game look very good... This game takes place in San Andreas.)2. GTA Vice City (A classic first GTA I ever purchased and played and one of my favorites. Very fun and interesting storyline that takes place in Miami)3. GTA 4 (Great game highly suggest getting the story mode DLC after beating the game. This one takes place in NYC aka Liberty city.),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-13,0,0,803,False,Recommended,I don't know been playing this game for 800+ hours and I still cannot come up with a proper review.. (Let's talk about the story mode) If you play the game casually you won't really find any bugs but as you try to look closely or try to mess with it bugs do pop up nothing much serious that might harm your gameplay tho.The story has no proper base and is actually quite boring for my taste.The ending looks lazy like Rockstar just wanted to end the game anyway possible by dumping EX_MACHINA choices on the player. (Where did the time go where the game world is first and we were just playing a part in it?) Now it seems we are controlling the game world.GTA 5 (offline) is a respectable game and looks modern clearly there has been some research done. The game is playable and is quite enjoyable..(Now let's talk about GTA online)husshh hushh husshh..... Where should I even start it's utter garbage with way more *BUGS!!* then it needs to. ROCKSTAR should fix their damn game first then adding more DLC content.Though content wise there is a lot most things are quite buggy especially HIEST AND DOOMSDAY. (which are the vital parts for a GTAO player)Rockstar with it's cash cow strategy won't let you take a rest. YOU JUST NEED TO GRIND&lt GRIND&lt GRIND! I won't complain much about the grinding fact as for now most online game are built this way so that players will stick their for longer. If you have this part is actually fun but if you are alone AND a loner. You don't have much chance here. Seriously get with someone this game is not meant for loners. I would recommend this game because it's actually quite better than their old titles and is actually proper hardware supported. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK D,Grand Theft Auto V

Then when I get a PC I buy the game again luckily it was on sale on a different site as we know Rockstar has no generousity and also has no department which deals with actual enquires.I bought the PC verison to play LSPDFR which to me is better than all Rockstars online rubbish where it started good then turned into Saints Row t. Never been online on PC as there are lots of reviews telling of people giving you money to get you banned or Rockstar thinks your a cheat because you grinded away a bit too much.

2018-02-12,0,0,68,False,Recommended,It finally happened. I beat a GTA game. I've been playing this franchise including the handheld versions since GTA1 on PS1 and none of these titles have been able to hold my interest long enough to complete one. GTA5 did. I chalk it up to 3 factors It embraced it's insanity with the storyline (mainly with Trevor).They put out a pretty good PC port.They gave you a wide variety of tasks to do. More than escort and kill.But then there's the online mode. Rockstar seemingly jealous that the genius modders beat them to the punch way back with GTA San Andreas Rockstar decides to try their best. While I'm only rank 15 right now and expect to play for a while longer this mode....is a complete cluster . Its a mess. It's a bucket of random ideas they just threw at the wall and left it to the players to decide what sticks. The netcode and matchmaking is god awful. Hackers are everywhere forcing you to matchmake into new sessions. Performance randomly drops to 20fps. I am matched with non USA players 90% of the time who can only type in moonspeak. The community is toxic to all new players and will do everything they can to grief you into giving up and uninstalling. Be prepared to just get stuck in locations where you cant do anything but be instantly killed a hundred times until they grow tired. And if you try to crew up for missions just assume everyone you're co oping with has literally never intereracted with a video game before and they were born with only one arm.I'm just shocked this is the portion of the game that has been printing money for Rockstar for years and allowed them to not put out an actual video game in all this time. If you have at least 3 very reliable friends who intent to play with you on the same schedule for the long term then GTAOnline is a safe bet for you. Otherwise holy hell be warned....,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-11,0,0,112,False,Recommended,GTA 5 PC ReviewAlso available on Xbox One PS4 Xbox 360 and PS3The long wait has been worth it. If you re a PC gamer who s spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest GTA then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. Sure the Xbox One and PS4 versions were amazing delivering GTA 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects (see our full review below) but the PC version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the PC s strengths. In doing so it adds a few more metres to one of gaming s towering achievements.Having covered the game twice already we won t go too far into the detail of what makes GTA 5 so good. Partly it s a question of experience. With four previous 3D GTAs under its belt plus Red Dead Redemption Bully and assorted DLC packs Rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems and GTA 5 has the best driving the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series.It s also a question of structure. Dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from Michael s ageing career criminal saga to Franklin s ambitious hoodlum story to Trevor s crazed amoral brand of mayhem where the dumb cathartic slapstick violence we all deep down love GTA for finds its natural home. With repeated play it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with Rockstar s savage satirical take on the Californian dream.And the budget definitely helps. The more time you put into GTA 5 the more you come to appreciate what a large and intensely detailed creation Los Santos is and just how much is packed into the surrounding Blaine County. That s because Rockstar had the ambition and the money to put in all the golf and tennis mini games all the stunt challenges all the bizarre side missions and all the weird hidden stuff that probably 90% of players will never see. The amazing thing about GTA 5 is that you can spend hour after hour playing it yet still be struck by all the stuff you haven t done yet. No other open world feels this coherent. No other open world has so much to do.TrustedReviews Awards 2015 Winners announcedSo what does playing on PC bring to the experience? Well for a start there s the most visually impressive and immersive version yet. Those lucky enough to have a 1440p or 4K monitor and the rig to run it will have ample cause for amazement and the rest of us who have to struggle along at 1080p won t go short. GTA 5 PC benefits from the new lighting model post processing effects day to night cycle and added vegetation of the next gen console versions but also additional levels for textures shader effects reflections and shadow detail that affect everything from the way characters faces look close up to depth of field effects water and grass.It s open to a huge amount of tinkering but then it needs to be. Basic gaming systems like a budget Core i3 with an old GTX 660 will struggle to run GTA 5 at a decent frame rate unless you reduce the resolution and start pulling settings down from high. Our test system with a Core i5 and a Radeon R9 285 still wouldn t run smoothly with settings above high at 1080p.What s more GTA 5 is really tough on video memory. Try to set Texture Quality to High with a 2GB graphics card and you ll be warned that you re exceeding the limits. Ignore the warnings and you may be gobsmacked by the detail on skin background textures and particularly clothing but the frame rate will stutter all the time. It might just about be bearable when you re walking around but get in a car and try a driving heavy mission and you re in for a nasty shock.GTA 5 scales up beautifully if you re rocking a Core i7/GTX 970 or Radeon R9 290 but if you have a lesser system then you re going to have to make some compromises. It s also worth noting that we ve experienced the odd collision detection bug and some weird texture drop outs occasionally affecting whole scenes at a time. It s early days with early GPU drivers though so we suspect these issues will be nailed down with time.Beyond this we get support for mouse and keyboard gameplay a definite plus if you play in first person view and some new options for background music. Not only is there a new radio station to listen to The Lab FM but a rather ingenious way of adding custom soundtracks to the game. Drag your own music files into a subfolder called User Music and they ll play through a new Self Radio station while you re in the game. It s a shame that Rockstar didn t make this a little more obvious or accessible but playing GTA 5 with your own background tunes is a blast.GTA Online comes bundled in of course bringing Rockstar s online multiplayer crime sim to the PC for the first time. It s due a reappraisal now that the new Heist missions have been dropped in but it s still a slightly odd combination of open world exploration and ad hoc PvP larceny and murder (all good) and more straightforward shooter and racer events which don t really play to GTA s strengths. It s fun but not Battlefield Hardline.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-06,0,0,347,False,Recommended,This game has the potential to be GREAT. The downside is they just gave up on story. The characters get better the more you use them in heists but there aren't many heists you can do. I'd of liked them to add more heists to the story mode of the game or more end game content rather than replaying the story mode over and over again. The online community is very obnoxious. Seems like some really unsavory people play this game. Also the game gets really repetitive in the online content. Because you have to grind up your rank and your stats. I'd like for them to add more ways to level up your characters strength. Like a gym option like they had in GTA SA,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,475,False,Recommended,"I wouldn't recommend it for GTA Online. But singleplayer is where the game shines and one might call it the greatest game of all time. The amount of detail in this game is simply incredible. The story is generic and predictable but still a lot of fun and the character writing is a benchmark in gaming in my opinion. Almost all characters deliver perfectly and their actors did an incredible job. Trevor might be one of the most interesting video game characters in recent years. The improvement over older GTA titles is apparent. There are 0 loading screens in the game (singleplayer) which makes you feel much more connected to the world than in previous games where each mission had a loading screen.The graphics and attention to detail are outstanding. The game has a level of polish and optimization I haven't seen in any other game before. I reccomend watching a 5 part series on youtube called ""GTA V Attention to Detail"" which illustrates a lot the smaller details most people don't notice or mention anywhere. It's like as if Rockstar really have thought about everything. Even tiny details nobody would have cared about like flip flop shoes actually do their flip flop. Different shows produce a different sound when walking. The amount of detail put into the game is unrivaled and it makes the world so believable. There isn't as much detail put into GTA Online though. Many things are missing due optimization to make the game run fluid in online. No animals in online much less traffic and pedestrians some scenery items in the world are completely missing as well no random encounters and your online persona is basically a mute not producing a single sound not even when falling or being hit. The rich and detailed world loses a lot of its flair in GTA Online not just due to all the missing details but also because of plenty of loading screens. Anytime you want to do missions or participate in races or whatever you are welcomed by a long loading screen. When the mission is finished you are welcomed by another long loading screen to connect you to an open world lobby.",Grand Theft Auto V

I had no money left but suddenly it increased to $ 119k and it kept falling off from my head. I immediately leave the session as I thought it was hacker who did this to me. Please remove the money from my account. I DID NOT use any hack tools.

The Online is ok with many missions to do but without the activities such as gambling etc. in San Andreas you just cant have as much fun as you perhaps would have hoped.There is still a good amount of depth and enjoyment to be found in the game perhaps next time around they will finally beat GTA San Andreas still well worth every penny spent.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-30,0,0,134,False,Recommended,GTA V is the greatest game to have ever been created in the history of video games. That's not opinion. It's fact.*Edit* I'll go back to my original thumbs up review. You guys need to allow mods. I don't even use them but I respect them.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-10-05,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,Its a good game single player wise. But I cannot recommend it. They require you to log in to play in single player.... I deleted an email since i never used it but apparently i was dumb and used it for the social club. Now i cant even play a game I spent 60 bucks on. Cool glade we need to log into to social club to play offline. Real nice desicion by the CO probably gets them a lot more money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-09,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Overall I really enjoyed the whole experience that GTA V offers. It feels like you are in a huge open city and the world is your oyster.Yea there are things I can complain about. There are definitely a good number of immersion killers particularly the repetitive feeling of the heat level works. But I think I can forgive most of that for the fun story the utter scale and detail of the world and the great gameplay. It's a little derivative for sure and the story isn't mindblowing by any stretch but it is just such a blast to play that I find it hard to criticize it. Bravo to the devs for pulling off something with the sheer magnitude of this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-27,0,0,736,False,Recommended,"People who downvote this game do it because GTA Online can be a cancer fest. And downvoting a game for it's BONUS Online feature is ridiculous. GTAV basegame is AMAZING and no one can argue that it's so much fun to play from start to finish and well worth the money so the game is an immediate thumbs up.I won't go into detail why so many out there thumb this game down because they keep getting wrecked in Online FREE MODE. The Free Mode is cancer and here's the kicker you never have to even be there. SO downvoting the game not only for the Online bonus mode but for the free mode mode within that bonus ONline mode is a move. Waaaah!!! Waaaahhh!! Rockstar made a awesome game but the ONline Free Mode is out of control! Waaaahhh Waaaahh!! Get real you little .99.99999999999% of the downvotes is because of the Online issues these mongoloids out there that thumbs this game down are so utterly piece of snowflakey entitled they don't even think of giving Rockstar props for making one of the best open world sandbox games in recent history.Alright so Online. I have sunk maybe 500+ hours into Online mode myself and I've barely touched Free Mode maybe 40 minutes in total. So over 400 hours I'm only a litlte over rank 100. I've never done a single heist neither except for the ""tutorial"" one. Nope not one. So what do I do? What makes GTA Online so great? Well creatively you can make your own movies which is ing awesome! You can race play golf play tennis do missions join events you name it.I just find it hilarious that ANYONE can give this game thumbs down based exclusively on their own butthurt little feelings because Online Free Mode is cancer. Online Free Mode is the public lobby sessions btw it's not even 20% of the online content yet here some of you are downvoting GTAV?

2018-01-10,0,0,312,False,Recommended,Recently gta 5 had a mix reviews between good and bad.This is because most poeple now play gta online witch has the most toxic players you will find such as harasser cheaters and hackers if not those there are curtain mission that you want to do witch will require 4 players that is call heist/setup wicth is a very rewarding mission you will find in online and if any players fail to do there job or die to much (depans on difficulty the host chooses) you all will lose regardless if your doing great.thats is were I find most poeple were so angry about due to there random partners are hard to listen what your saying or ingoring you during a heist.I personally have encounter these type of players so MANY times and i even lost my temper.The wrost that they can do is to 'LEAVE' during playing heist/setup resulting a complete watse of time because you gain no reward after all those time you been trying with those players over and over again.Aside from the online gta 5 story mode still give you great time play and give you great story with 3 different charaters on there criminal life.So here i what think about the game.The story mode curtainly will worth your money and time and add additions with mods the community create for the game will give more fun if your only here for singleplayerThe Online will depand.If you dont mind getting bad partners or poeple bothering you or getting ram over with a tank etc most of the time.Then i say these you if worth your money. if you do mind getting bother or dont like working with terrible players most of the time but you still want to play the online i recommand you find a friend who owns gta 5 to play with you or try make friend in the game (im actually not so sure about the second recommendation to be honest),Grand Theft Auto V
2015-10-20,0,0,617,False,Recommended,So it's about time I write a review about Grand theft Auto V.I didn't have high expectations about the optimization of the game but I was blown away since day one.I had GTX 970 &amp i5 3570 and I could run the game on almost max settings above 60 FPS.But that's not what all this review is all about I spent over 333 hours played Grand Theft Auto V very littoe of it went into singleplayer (I've finished singleplayer and not playing it anymore)I am mostly playing multiplayer and it's been a blast playing it buying apartments cars planes and much more!Rockstar regularly updates the game &amp adds DLC that are completely free. (Casino I am waiting for you)There is not much else to say about it. 10/10 would spend another 333 hours (HL3 Confirmed),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-22,0,0,340,False,Recommended,Product received for free. There are times when I look at Los Santos and think 'why would you even think to build that?' This is appropriately a thought that I often have about Los Angeles. In GTA 5's case the tone is different baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled y'know despair. Rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit. I look at it and I wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so. I marvel at the care evident in San Andreas' gorgeous sunsets in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world in the artfully chosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience. Everything about Los Santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years. The abiding irony of Grand Theft Auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in Los Santos hates it there.This is the most beautiful expansive and generous GTA game and also by some distance the nastiest and most nihilistic. Rockstar went through a phase in Bully Grand Theft Auto IV and the sadly console bound Red Dead Redemption of framing their protagonists as anti heroes. GTA 4's Niko Bellic did some terrible things but he had a downtrodden charm that helped you like him as you piloted him through the underworld. He was surrounded by people who were larger than life but ultimately beneath the surface people. Among those people were some of Rockstar's better female characters Kate McReary Mallorie Bardas The Lost and Damned's Ash Butler.Grand Theft Auto 5 does away with all of that deliberately but to its detriment. Its trio of protagonists occupy a city full of vapid two dimensional caricatures and they flirt with that boundary themselves. Michael is a middle aged former bankrobber unhappily married and on the edge of a breakdown. Franklin is a young hood purportedly principled but willing to do almost anything for money. Trevor is a desert dwelling meth dealing psychopath with a homebrew morality that sits uneasily alongside his capacity for violent cruelty and sexual aggression. The campaign explores their relationship through a series of heists and misadventures as they clash with every L.A. stereotype you might imagine the bored Beverly Hills housewife the corrupt fed the bottom rung fraudster the smug technology exec and so on.Against this backdrop it's only Michael Franklin and Trevor that appear to have any kind of internal life. I get the impression that this is deliberate part of the game's relentless skewering of southern California and indicative of Rockstar's waning interest in romantic anti heroes. Trevor's introduction in particular amounts to a particularly explicit ' you' to the characters and themes of Grand Theft Auto IV. GTA 5 is heartless in that way and as a result I found the narrative difficult to care about. It is ambitious well performed and the production values are extraordinary but it is also derivative and brutishly adolescent set in a world where the line between criminality and the rule of law is blurry but where it is always hilarious that somebody might be gay.It's an R rated episode of The A Team where the 'A' stands for ' '. The campaign's best moments come when your cigar chomping master strategist insane former military pilot and talented driver come together and when you're given the power to choose how to use each of them. These heists are set piece missions where you pick an approach and perform set up tasks in the open world before setting out on the job itself. In the best of them which occur later in the campaign it really does evoke the satisfaction of having a plan come together. Perhaps you position Trevor on the high ground with a rocket launcher Michael on foot with a stealth approach and Franklin in an armoured ram raider. With a button press you can flick between the three dynamically orchestrating a crime caper on your own terms.It is also in these moments that Rockstar's most ambitious storytelling takes place. Your choice of character crew and even certain in game actions have subtle effects on the dialogue. In an early heist a crewmember dropped part of the score but as Franklin I was able to retrieve it a side objective that I'd set for myself but that was subsequently reflected in a later conversation between him and Michael. This is another example of Rockstar's extraordinary attention to detail and if the rest of the campaign respected your agency in this way it might overcome its weaker moments.As it is this is a very long game with a lot of filler. There's much driving from A to B a lot of conversations in cars a lot of gunfights with hordes of goons who show up just to run into your gunsights over and over. It's far richer in set piece moments than its predecessor drug trips aerial heists dramatic chases and many of these look incredible even if they're light on actual interaction. In the best examples you soak in the atmosphere and happily ignore the fact that you're only really being asked to follow the on screen instructions. In the worst examples insta fail stealth sequences sniper missions and so on it's harder to ignore the shackles that are placed on the player in order to preserve the game's cinematic look and feel.I spent a lot of my time with the campaign frustrated along these lines bored of the same mission templates that I've been playing through since GTA III and making the most of the scant opportunities to play my own way like Franklin's refreshingly open assassination missions. Then inevitably I'd be doing one of those rote activities a heavily scripted freeway chase perhaps when the magic of that extraordinary world would creep up on me again. It'd hit me I'm doing 150 km/h along the Pacific Coast Highway at sunset. The rock station is playing 30 Days In The Hole by Humble Pie. It feels incredible a collision of pop culture atmosphere music and play that is unique to GTA.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-30,0,0,566,False,Recommended,What can I say about this game that other people haven't said already?It is aboslutely one of the best and most detailed games on the market today. I have had my fair share of single player and multi player gameplay and I can say for sure that you won't really have much fun in online unless you have a few friends to rope in to help out.The story is silly but funny. The characters seem to be well established and somewhat likeable. The world feels almost real with all the tiny details that Rockstar have added into the game.The online is 100% a grind fest and that is what it was designed to be. The only real way to be good quickly is to spend the money and buy in game currency. It isn't half as fun as the single player which is basically designed as a free for all paradise. I have major issue with the large amount of hackers in the online. They have always been present in the online but especially so on the PC version. One of my friends actually had money hacked into his account and got banned for about 24 hours before someone looked into it. The hackers are only sorted out when they hack money in which is what loses Rockstar money but ones who get 0.0002 second runs on races are just making the game less fun for others.Overall solid and well made game with a massive modding community but it falls down quite a bit when it comes to the multi player side of things.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-09,0,0,314,False,Recommended,Singleplayer This game has one of the greatest single player stories i've ever played. It is not as long as some of the previous games which really dragged on for me but it is a good lenght and there a barley any boring missions. The characters are great especially Micheal. Trevor is straight crasy and Franklin is cool. I love how you get to control 3 different characters and the have their own stories and supporting characters. The heist are great driving is great the combat is great the missions are fast paced and it is truly a great story. 9/10.Multiplayer GTA Online is very fun to play with a group of friends. It is good that Rockstar is consistantly updating the game and adding lots of missions and things to do. The heists MC and CEO work and Doomsday missions are mostly really good and the small little things you can do are awesome. The main problem I have is that you need to grind this game alot to be able to buy most of the things you need. Online is a great concept and Rockstar has almost nailed it. 7.5/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

Unfortunately online has become overrun with hackers that will likely get YOU banned for not even doing anything. On the other hand if you can avoid said people the online mode is very addicting and you will CONSTANTLY have FREE updates thrown in your face despite how old the game is already. When the game came out Rockstar agreed that they would give free updates to the game but would have ""Shark Cards"" in game which you can buy for in game money. They've stayed true to their word leaving GTA online a very addicting and exciting game to play.On the single player side absolutely no complaints.

2018-01-11,0,0,1030,False,Recommended,Hi It feels hard to write a review for such a large game !Offline story It's great you need to really get into the world story and characters of GTA. I didn't do it at first because I wasn't thrilled to be a bad guy but it eventually sinked in and now I regret to not have payed attention to all the details you see when playing the story. I think the game is really worth it just with the story.Online mode I am new to online gaming in fact GTA is the first time I stay online for so long.PRO Lots of content vehicules missions assets you will have fun trying them.Even if you don't have the money to buy them you can use them in differents mission that provide the best place to try them (unless you really like to kill helpless random player).You can join crew in advanced missions even if you are low level.You still level your character and see it going stronger and accessing more stuff.Did I say a lot of content ? )CONS Lots of cheaters/modders/hackers I guess it's hard to remove them all and I don't have experience with other games. It feels like they are pretty free from getting banned.I would love to be able to do everything in private sessions but some missions/jobs requires you to be in public sessions.It won't be long before you explode or be turned into a christmas tree for no reasons.Of course missions with small number of player is less risky to turn into a hackfest.Monetization I understand Rockstar needs money to keep making stuff (that is free btw)but content seems a bit overpriced. It feels hard to save just to buy a simple weaponized chopper. I think missions should get you a little more money.What is making the matter worse is character calling you every minutes to ask you to buy this facility or this operation center and it feels like you are swamped in disguised ads to buy stuff with real money. And of course you can't turn these calls off. Check how many forum threads there is on that.Overall I'd say try to have fun in missions with trusted people and don't try to own lots of vehicules or assets.Because if you get into this you either grind money all of the time or purchase (with real money) shark cards to have money in game.I understand that players who bought shark cards keeps Rockstar making free DLC so I thanks them but we should make sure they don't overprofits from this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-20,0,0,277,False,Recommended,The only thing I can say to describe my experience with this game is this Playing Frogger at 5 in the morning in a four lane freeway as a block headed man in a blue suit with an orange bowtie with my friend who looks like an old Eminem.Frogger somehow leads into every car on the highway exploding.All this exploding leading to the whole server getting kicked except for my friend and I.My lungs dying from laughter and me waking my roommate in real life.This game is fun however I rarely ever play it without friends. It can be fun without them (like in the campaign for example) but playing with your friends in Online is an experience that not many games can match. It seems as though many people though have been getting screwed over by Rockstar without so much as a simple explanation. So should I recommend this game?I enjoy it but I know that people who put in a lot of time and effort just to get it wiped for no reason would think differently. I am just a simple casual.Overall I do recommend the game. Campaign is fun. Online is a blast however do not get too attached to your Online account because Rockstar likes to ban people for no reason and gives no mercy on the matter.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-14,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,I apologise but I DO NOT recommend you to buy this game due to several reasons 1. Online play demands frequent purchases of shark cards. Prices of stuff are way extreme and your cash drains fast. My Megalodon which added up to 12 Million dollars ended up draining fast down to 2 Million. They do this on purpose so you continuosly buy cards stealing your IRL money.2. Jobs Online Some missions are tough to complete alone. The Nightclub setup where you have to bring in the equipment truck (steal it from a festival) requires you to go far out in the desert and take the long route back in under an exagerated 4 minute timer driving a very slow truck...Really?! 4 mins for a distance of more then 10km away!!!3. Erratic AI behaviour You fix your car AI drivers destroy it for you again.4. Possibility of griefers online that ruin your game experience and destroy your cargo and supplies....and one last thing. There is no GTA VI yet! Don't go to clickbait Youtube videos!Thanks Kindest Regards Retired Los Santos Gangster,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-03,0,0,122,False,Recommended,"Would recommend the game for the game itself because I think it's awesome.However I think I am not alone when I say the greatest plus of the PC version could have been the moddability. Well that's down the drain as I saw in other people's reviews. Now I just don't dare to download a single mod because who knows I might want to play GTA Online. Actually I did play got killed by some a hole quick then switched to passive mode (which will disable any physical interactions between players also you can't use your weapons on the 'big' map) and enjoyed a few mission. Hey there are missions that can be played alone! You'll get whacked a few times by the tougher than in single player enemies but using cover and bringing extra body armors (when you are high level enough to have more than one) can do the trick. I'm level 16 just by doing missions alone. But I'm off the track here. What I wanted to say Would not recommend for actively discouraging the use of mods even in single player. That's why I'm giving a thumbs down should R* change their policy on this I'd change the rating to thumbs up. Here's hoping.***After thinking it over and seeing (have not tried out though) that mods in SP seem to not interfere with GTAO I'm changing the final verdict to thumbs up even if I lose the rating of this review.

2015-05-09,0,0,315,False,Recommended,The game is amazingly fun don't get me wrong. I had LOADS of fun online however with the latest patch they fudged up. Basically they don't want you modding their game. Online OR SINGLE PLAYER cheating or (what I did) using a harmless pov mod or player model changer will get you the ban hammer.So until they get their crap together and stop this autobanning crap (They say they aren't but its 100% obvious they are and they don't even bother looking into any reports or activity. You have ANY mod on multiplayer or single player you're banned.) DO NO BUY THIS GAME (YET)!*EDIT*The game is a lot better now and has been for quite some time. You'll still see modders and you'll often hear in chat people asking said modders for money (DON'T TAKE IT!) Though unlikely it's possible to get banned from taking the money even if you're not the one modding. Plus it's not hard to make money in the game what with the new VIP/Bodyguard jobs and the heists you could do. Every now and then you'll see a modder who uses mods to win fights (mad cuz bad) but it's rare ish. I love this game and would gladly reccomend it to anyone!

Ive owned this game on my ps3 and ps4 and ive had easily over 1000 hours on it. On the console its an amazing experience and you can overall have a great time. But then it comes to the PC version of the game. You can have just as much as fun on singleplayer as you would on the ps3/ ps4. You could even do more awesome things that would potentially set you hardrive on fire by dowloading over the top mods that will give you tons of fun for many hours. The singleplayer is unlike any other (which is a good thing). But then you hop into the land of 7 year olds that think they are the and 35 year old hackers and modders known as the wonderful world of Grand Theft Auto Online. Listen. If you want to buy this $60 game just for specificaly playing online get it on a console. The moment you step into the world you are placed in a lobby filled with about 10 hackers and modders that will do anything to ruin your day just so they can get a quick evil feel of satisfaction. If you want to do anything on online i strongly reccomend to find a group of nice people and make a ""invite only session"". Once you do this you can have just as much fun and you would on the consoles. The only downside of this is that you wont be able to do any CEO missions or any thing of that sort.

2018-07-20,0,0,629,False,Not Recommended,Pretty fun game I have almost 600 hours on it and I'll probably have much more over time. However I wouldn't recommend this game because of how much it pushes for you to buy Shark Cards in Online over priced microtransactions that provide you with in game currency. This wouldn't be a problem if you didn't mind constantly and I mean CONSTANTLY grinding to buy the things you can use in freemode. Hell you have to grind just to buy things you use to grind even more. At one point I caved in and bought a shark card because grinding in this game is awful and I just wanted to get this one vehicle. I wouldn't make that mistake again because it only further encourages Rockstar to add microtransactions to future games. Story mode doesn't have that great of a story and you can't do much so if that's what you want I'd buy IV San Andreas or Vice City instead. Also if you're wondering what grinding entails it means doing the same heists over and over (they get boring after playing through them a few times) doing missions and races that pay and doing freemode missions for your business MC or soon enough nightclub that pay pretty well but are so horribly boring and leave you at the mercy of griefers.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game is way more fun when you can buy every vehicle gun etc. At the start I found this game really boring because all I did was grind missions for money. After I got money I had a really fun time with this game. Me and my friends just mess around in special vehicles and have a good time. If you want to have some fun with friends you need to grind missions or find other ways to get money. I would definitely not buy this game full price I do not think it is worth the 60$.

2018-02-14,0,0,231,False,Recommended,(im just an 80 hours player so this review might be bad) many reviewers that i've seen saying that this game is so bad that its just a waste of money for buying it if u you wanna go online mode. well i just can agree to disagree on that. first of all the modders problem. well... i cant say much since i havent been encountering them that much. i agree that modders are a bunch of z and rockstar kinda did next to nothing on them. but hey in this online mode you kinda doing heist with the player NOT AGAINST THEM and for the doomsday one just make an empty session if you dont wanna get disturbed. you dont know how? LEARN IT for crying out loud. adversary/race thingy? its not a consequnces once you quit the job if you encounter a hacker so why whinning about it just find a new one(oh right it took almost forever i agree with you on that). even if u lose u still got a little bit of money and rp so what? second thing is the micro transactions. this is the thing that made me wanna write reviews so bad. all i can say is FIND AN EXPERIENCED RICH FRIENDS. yeah cuz once you do its so easy to make money from it. export import and ceo jobs heist finale shares theres so much option once u got FRIENDS. so you kinda dont need that shark cards t anyway i know i dont. cant make friends? whats the point of online game then? making foe? all i can say is you dont have to agree with my point since im only been in this game for 80 hours or so but yeah just take my point for thoughts. thats all i can say and oh... offline mode.. what are you complaining about that anyway..TLDR FIND FRIENDS its an online game after all. ignore that Shark Cards bullcrap and modders ers ur good to go,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-10,0,0,249,False,Not Recommended,EDIT 2018 15 aug Game is still garbage so I wanted to make another video WASTED 3 hours on updating stuff cuz it no longer worked just to find out that the part where my previous video ended now those cocstars have blocked custom camera in replays (no it's not cuz of 1st person view look it up on google it's cuz those donkis added some easter egg near the military base and they dont want people using replay to find it so they block the camera editor).... just came back here to edit my review and say STILL NOT RECOMMENDED. Game is not worth those headaches and annoyances they throw towards their PAYING CUSTOMERS.EDIT After reading up on the news that cocstar has made mods illegal (actually it was take two who owns the rights to gta 5 but who cares... same thing) i no longer recommend this game. ONLY REASON I still have this game installed is because of mods. Anyone reading this look it up on google. They have taken legal action to get rid of the mods.I no longer support cocstar games i won't ever buy their games again. I'll just torrent them if i really want to try them but won't give them another penny. those wipes don't deserve anything. They deserve to go bankrupt.Look back into GTA 3 Vice City and San Andreas those games are STILL alive thanks to mods why ldo they want to kill their games?I hope this review makes lot of people think hard before giving them any more money. DO NOT buy their crap ever again just abondon them. there will always be other games to play or just torrent.GTA without mods not worth it.EDIT 2 after the petition going their way the developers and/or publishers have grinded their teeth and finally through pain and suffering allowed the use of OpenIV again I won't change my opinion what's done that's done. They already did the damage to their company and game and that stain will never go away.I think gta 5 devs / owners are greedy pieces of trash.Here's WHY I have made game hacks myself so i know. I have lot of hacks for GTA 5 online such as god mode flight super speed ..etc they don't care you don't get banned for any of that. you can use super speed in races or god mode in PvP. all good .. but as soon as you change in game money you will get banned. Not only that if a hacker drops a big bag of money on you then YOU will get banned while hacker will be in the clear. They only care if they lose real money ..,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,235,False,Not Recommended,I've been waiting this game for a long time.. since the day one the PS3 and X360 era i've never played this game because i'm sure one day this game will come to PC.and that day finally come.. from performance review to be honest i'm very satisfied with this game it's optimized to run in PC. not like WD lol.but there's only one major issue stuttering but that issue often come out when you're using graphic setting that exceeded limit of your graphic card. i'm using GTX 670 and 8GB Ram and i can run this game in very high setting with MSAA turned off (i know the staircase effect is very imminent lol) it's steady 45 60 but i'll always turn Vsnyc off and i'm getting highest FPS 85. story review it's unique 3 playable main character each have their own mission and part and own uniqueness.. Michael with his charisma and mastermind planning Franklin with his loyalty and spirit and Finally Trevor with his Unpredictable Capabilities. i will not spoil anything about the plot but it's useless i guess you guys already know huh? Gameplay i think this is a very complete open world experience you can use 1st person camera it feels like you're playing far cry game you can customize your car and participate in a street race like in that EA game (you know what) you can run and gun or run and punch every single person in the game you really have access to any place in the game the movement animation is awesome flip flop is really flop lol.. gun play gameplay is very engaging driving mechanic feels simplified not like GTA IV and i like it there's so many things to do like golf tennis shooting range or just driving around. i have no complain about the gameplay. but i'm not to satisfied with the wanted system maybe it's because in gta without cheat you can get bullied by the cop easily and the second thing is there is no 6 star wanted level.. i miss being chased by National Guard.. lol Control i'm using keyboard and mouse and it feels flawless.. every single function is customizable and i'm not having a problem to get to use to.. but sometimes it feels like the mouse responsiveness is not that responsive idk maybe it's just my imagination.. ) Sound it's good but not too awesome.. maybe if the gun sound is more maximized it will be awesome.. the ambience too not too stand out. the voice acting makes the story more interesting like watching a movie. Graphic i think this GTAV PC edition will make WatchDogs Cry lol. but i'm noticing it doesn't matter if you crank up the population density setting the population isn't too improved not so many. but then i never played GTAV on Last gen console before so idk the difference. shadow and AO is look so good the lighting awwww it's ing perfect the glory of GTA V is on the lighting system lol.. the weather effect it's top notch. vehicle damage system is amazing it's a joy to play this game on 1080p 60 fps i'm curious what will be like when play this game on 4k Resolution? ) Online Multiplayer this is the masterpiece of Rockstar the GTAO is the ultimate experience from playing GTA V it's where all the fun are. it's a whole diferrent world in GTAO it's anarchy. but it's fun trust nobody shoot first ask question never kinda thing. the more you have friend that play this game the more you enjoy you play the game. it's just very fun and all the good things are here.. safehouse customization plane tank etc...Overall it satisfied me Long await finally end thank you stuttering problem no 6 star wanted level sound is average good story make me losing my real life make me hard to sleep Online is very very very very engaging and addicting. NOT a waste of money if you haven't own and play this game before GOOD Optimization for PC. Eye Candy Graphic Nice narrative and dialogue the voice acting makes the story more interesting like watching a movie.10/10 for me..thanks R*EDIT NO MODS SUPPORT. USING MOD MAKE YOU GET BANNED.

You might also not find the online mode too fun but if you want to buy GTA V to play storymode it is okay but people might ask ""Why should I buy GTA V to play storymode when I can simply download it for free?"" The answer is simple to support the game you might also change your mind and start playing online.You can meet new friends have fun race challenge and much more you didn't even know about.Grand theft Auto V has a lot what to offer us not considering there are also hidden missions eastereggs hidden places and rooms.I think that for 30 or 60 dollars you can have much more beyond playing the game.Ok now that I've convinced you to buy the game please make sure your computer is capable of running the game enjoy the game and don't cheat.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-09,0,0,169,False,Not Recommended,"Haven't seen any hackers yet other then the people who modded their level to be 6666. I'm on a budget build and I run this like a champ on medium settings too bad the game won't even let me try to run it on ultra. Some people like to just downright troll and ruin heists so watch who you play with. I can surprisingly have Chrome open and the game open at the same time and receive no lag. Don't let the ""random bans"" discourage you from buying. Their not random and only happen when you're actually cheating or when you have a third party game overlay enabled. Discord In Game Overlay MSI Afterburner and any thing that can be considered an overlay will get you banned. I haven't tried modding yet and don't plan on it. If you're new there are plenty of people your level and are just as poor as you. I'm not saying it's a bad game or anything but I would try to buy this on sale if I was you. I just don't feel like it's worth 60$ 35 to 40 dollars should be good. The one thing that annoys me during gameplay however is the HUD all those popup missions and I don't know I just don't like it judge me. Update 10/15/16EVERY I N G HEIST I JOIN I GET KICKED DISCONNECTED OR THE HOST JUST LEAVES. I AM SO TIRED AND I NEED MONEY. HOW THE AM I SUPPOSE TO PLAY THIS GAME IF ALL I CAN DO IS ROB STORES SELL A CAR FOR 8K EVERY HOUR OR SO AND DO S H I T RACES THAT ONLY PAY YOU 1K?!?!?!?! THIS GAME IS A I N G SHAM!!!! I'M NOT BUYING YOUR D A M N SHARK CARDS ROCKSTAR!!!!!!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Update 11/23/16I haven't been banned yet so I think it's okay hackers are pretty common but most of the time they're not bad and give you money and modded vehicles. However don't deposit that money into your bank account because you will be banned for hacking. Keep it on your person and deposit like 10k every time after a heist or something. Also if you experience unexpected crashing make sure to check the chat every once in a while because there are hackers that can instantly crash everyone in the session's game. It's rare and has only happened to me once so far. With all the hate that this game is getting though it is still in the Top 10 on steamcharts sooo yeah... Also if you have a HDD and not a SSD(Digital Drive) the loading times will be absolute cancer (about 3 minutes). But I'm used to it because I played Battlefield 4 and it was even longer. Overall it's fun but don't slap sixty dollars on it unless your well off financial wise I paid sixty dollars because I didn't think it was ever gonna go on sale and at the time I'm making this review it's 50% off FML. Thirty bucks should be a sufficient price for this game. Don't pay for the shark cards unless again your well off. There's a grinding element to it but it doesn't take too long also be sure to play with friends when doing Heists because people are really stupid and will ruin heists therefore wasting your time.

2017-08-13,1,4,611,False,Recommended,"I don't want to recommend this game because Rockstar doesn't actually own Rockstar energy drinks and that makes me sad.That being said this game is a blast. I'm not a big fan of the story mode as I feel like it's the hardest and most ridiculous one to make money in and that money can be easily lost thanks to the stock market glitch in game that sometimes randomly deletes all your stock market shares. I played about 40 45% of the way through the story and only made money off the first heist I did. Not a single one of the other missions I've done have earned me so much as a dime which I found to be incredibly offputting. It's why I eventually stopped playing the story mode without finishing it. The missions were just your standard GTA style ""go steal something or kill some people and get away from the cops in different vehicles"" kind of missions that they've always done and without any sort of payout from it I didn't see the point in continuing to do them. And the only side mission I unlocked that paid money was with Trevor to make either $5K or $7K smuggling guns by car or plane and I couldn't even repeat them as much as I wanted to quickly make cash there was a lengthy waiting period before it would refresh and I could do them again. Given that most properties cost more than a million bucks making $12K every day or so would have been a long tedious grind to buy some decent properties. I find it so much harder to make money in this GTA than it's been in any other perhaps because it's the most restrictive and one of the methods is bugged and can lose all your money if you try it.This brings me to the online aspect of the game. I'm not sure why they gave us GTA Online if they were going to structure the system to actively penalize players who want to PLAY GTA. By that I mean the more crimes you commit (stealing cars shooting people killing people causing mahyem basic GTA fun) the higher your ""mental state"" gets and when it gets too high the other online player get incentives to come and kill you. Yeah that's right if you're just looking to goof around online with your own character and just cause some chaotic fun you'd better either bring 15 friends to fill the session or hope you don't get stuck with players who like killing other players or you're gonna be spending a few hours each session just getting killed again and again every time you get a one star police bounty on you for commiting any crime. And since the game respawns you near where you died the player who just killed you with their armored weaponized vehicle is also nearby and will be there in approx. 10 seconds to kill you again and again until one of you gets bored. Did I also mention that you also get incentivised to do nothing a.k.a. having ""good behavior"" for a certain period of time? That's right you just get cash given to you by the game if you go long enough without breaking the law that's what we all expect from GTA right? Rewarding players who don't break the law? Hahaha right. Also I get that it's the online mode but there doesn't seem to be any solo activities that can be done to earn rep points to rank up and unlock the better guns armor etc. I don't want to have to play/compete with the other players in the session to get RP and rank up. I want the option of course I just don't like being/feeling forced to. Sometimes I just wanna do a mission or 2 on my own if they didn't want to allow us to do our own separate things in the same online world what was the point of adding multiplayer? I'm not forced to stick around the other players so I was expecting to also be able to go off and do a stunt series or any activity on my own.So with all these complaints why do I recommend this game? Simple it does the main thing I wanted out of another GTA let me drive around real fast on motorcycles and murder people. Adding first person makes it so much more fun and engaging. It's such a fun challenge to try and drive 60 100mph through the city or on the highway and try to shoot tires or people at those speeds without wrecking. And GTA Online adds other real people who might come and try to put a stop to my mayhem and murderous rampage. Trying to outrun real players and/or kill them on the run is much more exciting than running from any NPC or AI cops no matter how many there are. The only downside is that the human players usually don't give up once the heat is cleared and it's harder to find motorcycles in GTA Online than in story mode. Not sure WHY that is I just am sure THAT it is.Anyway if you too wanna just drive around and shoot people and practice getting better at both or even just cruise around really fast in different environments I recommend getting this game. I think it's still $60 so just wait for a Steam sale and get it at a discount like everyone else who doesn't already own it then pick it up jump in and try to put a stop to my mayhem if you think you can. Please don't though.",Grand Theft Auto V

Seems like its a problem with both NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards. The problems range from complete inability to run the game to the game crashing 5 minutes. Low frame rates for many people using top of the line hardware. Can't currently run it so I can't recommend. Running nothing but top end hardware in my 2015 Alienware M18.

2015-05-05,0,0,162,False,Recommended,As you might have already heard this brand new 2 year old game is just freakin fantastic!+ Great story (although a bit short if you ask me) with loads of mission variety shooting driving flying diving boating parachuting stealth... you name it GTA V has it. Also there are a ton of cutscenes that have great dialogue writing voice acting and are always entertaining and fun to watch.+ Great main characters never mind what crazy people say Trevor is the man! He's pretty much the only GTA character that acts like a psycho both in cutscenes and in game (you know when you're making him murder innocent people with a rocket launcher as you do). Michael is pretty great too a lot of his missions are wacky in a sitcom/soap opera mashup kinda way. Franklin is a bit too average in my opinion but he has his moments (and a puppy!).+ Amazing graphics never knew 360 and ps3 games looked so damn good. )+ This game is so full of small teeny tiny details. For example when you're playing in third person and you pull out your phone it shows it in the bottom right corner of your screen and while you're navigating the phone menu you can see the tiny phone screen in your character's hand actually displaying the same stuff you see on your bottom right and when your character receives a call and answers it the phone lights up his face as he puts it up to his ear. It's small details like these that make GTA V's version of Los Santos come alive.+ Car sounds! Sit in GTA's version of a Lamborghini or Ferrari switch to first person view and enjoy the engine sounds.+ Danger zone Fortunate Son Danger zone Carry On Wayward Son Danger zone Gimme All Your Lovin' DANGER ZONE!!1!+/ Runs fine on average poor man's gaming hardware 660ti i7 920 3Ghz 8gb of ram can squeeze close to an average of 60 fps with everything turned up to high/very high IF! you turn the grass down to normal. If not lock your fps to 30 turn up the grass and enjoy your ps4 game). That is of course if you don't get struck by the stuttering bug which they may or may not fix who knows... or you know if your game doesn't start (these problems are plaguing a lot of people so keep that in mind before throwing money at rockstar).Online is a thing I'm not a big fan of online games unless they are proper mmo's (this game is not an mmo) but I wouldn't recommend playing GTA online alone (as in with random people) cause it just might bore you to death.It may not really be a perfect game by any standards but it gave me everything I wanted out of it and more. It's just a fantastic open world game and instantly one of my favorite games ever 10/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,"Unlike a lot of my fellow gamers I was lucky enought to access the game without a lot of problems just creating a new session on windows for it to work because of the bug concerning letters used in your windows name.But I still can't really play it. And why is that ? Because as a lot of other gamers I've got terrible stuttering problems.Fact is that when the game is launched it seems to have a memory leak problem for a lot of us that makes your RAM usage build up and up and up...Until it's full and your hard drive has to take up the role of ""Virtual RAM"". So there you are. 100% HDD usage CPU and GPU are just useless cause they're waiting for their partners (RAM and HDD) to do the job. Wich they CAN'T do because the game is metaphorically a boat leaking from all other the place for them and that they have to get the water off to let the CPU and GPU drive the boat as they want. And they can't do that cause the game keep sending damn tsunamis in their faces and don't even give them buckets to throw the water off. Short story The game is a great game. It has a lot of improval other console versions and it is very very enjoyable. BUT as it is today you have 1/2 chance for it NOT to work as it can not even launch or give you this stuttering problem that ruins the game after a couple of minutes. It is then not a lottery ticket worth 60 for me and I totally regret spending that much money for pre load and playing quickly for a game that doesn't seems to be really tested for problems like those ones.Sorry Rockstar.

2016-12-30,1,3,103,False,Not Recommended,Can't recommend this game to anyone. Reason ? Well I'll tell you.Rockstar Customer Support is the worst ever support I have ever encountered. They can't handle the hackers in Online so they make a automatic anti cheat system and guess what... legitimate players get banned for no reason. I was one of those players. I bought GTA V on 25 December 2016 on PC my Christmas present. Due to my bad internet I had to download the for four nights.Logged on Thursday and started Story Mode and played for maybe 5 6 hours. I read and heard rumors that Online is broken and Rockstar bans legit players. At first I was afraid to join because I thought that I would get a perm ban on the moment. My machine is a laptop and yes it's not very good but handles most games on medium low with good fps which is ok for me. GTA V has a giant world and I used my second GPU which is activated with a High Performance setting (You set the game to a High Performance setting and this lets the game to work with the second GPU the more powerful one) and I had average FPS for my laptop 30 40 FPS which I was really happy about. Here comes the big moment. I wanted to see Online and see the new updates. I played the game previously on Xbox 360 and haven't modded the console so I was clean. I transferred my profile to PC so I could continiue my progress. Last time I remember I had a luxury apartment and cars and was level 55 60 I don't remember about the level. When I joined I was level 26 and had a small garage with one bike. I wasn't mad about that so I thought it would be good idea to start with some setups for heists or some survivals to get money. Played a heist setup and my teammates failed maybe 3 4 times because some of them didn't knew to take cover when being shot at. Anyway I joined some other missions. I had some fps drops during the mission so I thought that if I used Razer Cortex a Game Booster which could give you more FPS no modding or cheating my game would gain 5 to +10 fps. It didn't work. I noticed during Story Mode that the game was eating a lot RAM and caused some drops. I have 8 gigs ram and my game uses up to 7 so I had a RAM Optimizer and used it. It helped a little but it didn't last long. I then relogged to Online without the booster I repeat WITHOUT THE BOOSTER and joined a heist setup. We were about the finish the heist setup and boom Rockstar dropped the bomb. I was suspended for 30 days. I was like ''I ing knew it !! I ing knew it...those bastards ban players for no reason.'' I wrote to the Support and told them everything. 1 day later I recieved an answer that my ban won't be removed and yadda yadda yadda I violated the game terms and EULA. What did I violate ffs ??! I played the Online for maybe 1 hour or maybe more and on my first day boom ban. Tell me how did I violate the game terms by using a game optimizer/high performance setting.The High Performance setting is made by the GPU manufacturer to optimize games and give you more FPS. Tell me why would a cheap automatic anti cheat system detect a game optimizer as a hack ?! I also heard that background programs could get you banned. Probably if my Skype was turned on I guess I would have gotten a perm ban. Ok they don't support third party software but how is a game optimizer or a high performance setting considered a hack or modding ?! Oh yeah forgot to mention I didn't modify my game files or downloaded any mods for the Single Player. They even have an ''Appeal ban'' option. They will never appeal your ban even if you got video evidence. I don't see the point why they made this option when they won't do anything. They won't even tell you what was the reason you are banned or what did you use or do to get banned. Will never buy games made by Rockstar again. Reason why I still haven't refunded the game is to see if I will get banned again when my ban expires. Had such high hopes for this game and bought it for the Online and their support is worse than Black Ops 3 on old gen consoles.,Grand Theft Auto V

There were also suggested fixes that were completely unrelated to the issue I was having. It doesn't seem like they look at the actual info sent to them and just suggest random fixes that have ""worked for other players"".

2015-08-06,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,Single player for me personally not worth the price they selling the game for. GTA V single player is really overated. Not saying is bad just saying you should not get it just for the single player for full price. If you however in the market for some GTA online it may be worth getting it. But and A BIG BUT is. U need to make sure u have at least 3 more friend u can play with it. If not GG. Hacker run rampant in server and most players will just kill u on sight. The biggest problem with GTA in general once u done one type of mission or one type of activity u probably wont come back to it. Unless u have friend u can share the experience with and if u come back to it alone will feel like grinding. Difference playing with friend and playing with random people is like day and night. Sure u can have fun with random people sometimes but to get full experience u need friends.Bottom line is Love the game. But Online is must play with friends and single player is not worth the full price.Score 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-24,0,0,140,False,Recommended,"I'll try to ignore the Take2 chaos though because of that this might be the last GTA i buy.It was a good journey seeing that i started playing GTA 1 on my first PC when i was a kid. Single Player V is clearly a masterpiece and there's nobody doing games like this at the level that Rockstar does. They basically build on the same game just adding to it so their decades of experience makes it a loosing battle for new starters like Watchdogs(Driver) and all those cash grabs that don't dedicate their life for making the perfect game in a certain genre.With that said i miss the vibrance of GTA2 with the crazy gangs they had and a certain lore. A remake of that with this new engine would be a crazy hit for them in this age of repackaged classics. It wouldn't work to go goofy with a new story cause that's why Saint's Row exists. Speaking of that the Zaibatsu car in GTAV as an easter egg brought a tear to my eye. Thanks Rockstar for that. Multiplayer oh boy oh boy where do i start with this one. I know many kids love it and take two made sure to mess it up really good cause i guess making billions selling the game is not enough. I won't go too much into this cause as a game developer myself i see the pointless nature of it. I've seen the parasites among us that have no respect for what they do and just want all the money. Not just money.....all of it. Micro transactions in a full priced game like this are just simple as that.Last time i've entered the online feature i waited forever to load. I play most games that launch these days and GTA5 online is by far the slowest affair ever. By the time it loads i'm questioning if i was in the mood to play or not. Los Santos is a shadow of it's single player version with just a handful of cars in variety everything seems baren and it's crazy how an online game can look more deserted and feels more lonely than it's single player story. Except the crazy random explostions from you're generic ""let's create chaos"" kinda player.For me GTA multiplayer was always about the fun of actually having fun in the same city as the campaign but with other players and just roaming around not going into ""paralel universes"" like the missions at the moment are playable. It's a mixed bag. Some are pretty good but the city is now just a hub for those and it's not the actual game. Long discussion but i feel it lost focus.I bored people enough so in short even if i find the single player as a masterpiece the money they make on the Online component and seeing they have another Online focused expansion coming up all i can say to Rockstar is to be careful. I understand Take2 will make a bunch of money for their corporate overlords while they are still alive but in the long run it damages the brand and people won't have the same feeling and aura around GTA. It worked and made billions cause it was a respectful build up to this point. So as long as the next entry will be as solid and will stay on it's feet not rely on online and as long as Red Dead Redemption will be as focused as all products till now i think we're good. There's a bright future ahead.P.S. Rockstar...speaking of Read Dead....us PC gamers literally made you in the 90's. We were the ones that spread the word of GTA. You already have all the money in the world so don't sign some exclusive contract. Just launch the next game on all platforms. We're here we'll support you don't let us down.Thanks.",Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-08,0,0,3796,False,Recommended,Who cares what Take Two or Rockstar are doing. Its still a great game and deserves respect we get FREE content and we don't even need to buy shark cards. Rockstar generously gave us double money event mission AND heists to well prepare ourselves for the update. Its ONE modding tool they took down there are still numerous other software tools to get mods for storymode and more to come I believe since the main one was taken down.

R* seems to just be jacking up the prices so that they can sell their shark cards whenever they release another reskin to the VIP type mission stuff.Grand Theft Auto V is missing a crucial setting that all 3rd person shooters should have and that's the ability to disabled auto center in 3rd person. (For those who don't know what this setting does it moves the camera in the direction your character is facing which practically elimites the ability to strafe while looking at somthing) Yet they put multiple camera settings for their 1st person view (which hardly anyone uses).,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-21,25,91,94,False,Recommended,Unlike the majority of the negative reviewers I bought GTA V not GTA Online. The game GTA V is a lot of fun the world is big and colourful the characters are ok (I really didn't care about any of their lives much) and the story is enough to keep me going. The radio is NOT as good as earlier ones (too much stupid music not enough legitimately funny ads shows etc). the TV was ok in this but kind of...bland. I play GTA for the RPG experience of a deeply satirical and sarcastic world view of the one we live in and this one simply didn't deliver as before.Beautiful graphics fun to play.It's worth the price especially on sale to obtain and enjoy GTA V. I can't review GTA Online because I didn't care about it. I tried it didn't really enjoy the mini games and heists...I think it's made for a niche crowd. Probably the kind who get aggressive over nothing hits on someone's sister (coldly rebuffed which he deals with as an emotionally stunted individual) then demands the blunt hurry up and be passed. This person also vows that people on X Box Live will be dealt with in real life because they don't know him. This person is probably also going to rage at me because I don't know how evil Rockstar is for taking his money by making it hard to free play online but that's because I only gave them enough money to play the game I wanted GTA V.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-15,0,0,610,False,Recommended,I know about the whole Rockstar being greedy AF. They shouldn't have increased the price just before sales. But I am here to talk about the game itself and not about the marketing. The costs only 40$ here in India so I can't feel the pain of others who are paying 70 80$ on this. IMHO It is worth every penny I have paid!! This game can be summed up in one word ADDICTING!! This game has almost everything to offer and after almost 300 hrs of playing this I am still not bored. I am a type of guy who cannot play one single game for more than 3 hrs I get bored easily. But this game is just so well made that I never get bored!! SO much stuff to do online and offline. I haven't finished the story yet but so far it's very interesting. The online has so much stuff to buy and so much to do!! I love everything about it!! Deathmatches Missions Captures and a lot more!! EARN your money and buy your stuff!!Of course this is no way a perfect game there are so many connectivity problems and not to mention the crashes!! The game's well optimised but these crashes and connectivity issues tend to ruin the gameplay experience. NOT TO MENTION THE HACKERS!! Oh GOD they are sooo annoying!! The sessions are full of Hackers who ruin the entire GAME!!But otherwise as far as the game goes It's Amazing!! If you haven't played it on consoles at some point you have to get this game!!

I will start of to say I was hyped about this new ""Saga"" series.I'm no longer hyped and I've lost all faith in upcoming titles.The bugs currently make the game close to unplayable. Ai can't declare war on player as it is now... so if you don't get any allies there's no risk of getting attacked.The Ai will just run into your territory stand next to a settlement for 1 3 turns then run back.Next one has to do with the food. For some reason if I count how much I should get from my building tooltips then go to look how much my buildings actually give me in the overview it's a lot less. So magically dissapearing food. I'm well aquainted with the game and its mechanics so far and believe me when I say I haven't overlooked anything when it comes to the food.Another one would be the combat Ai... Their horse generals always stand back to the right of their army. Don't even run away from charging spear units. So.. instant win against ALL horse generals.That's the three most major bugs I've run into so far.Then we got the problem with the cheating Ai... the amount of food they get from nowhere is HUGE. I thought this system was to cancel out some of the zergfest problems. They still run around with 15 20 stacks when they just got 2 settlements. (Mostly played on HARD)Oh another thing would be desyncs on multiplayer. Not as common as in some previous titles but they are still there.I would not recommend this game unless they fix ALL these things I've stated.

There are no server broswers instead you have to automatically load lobbies so you can load job setups so yo can load missions. Then something disconnects (happens a LOT) and you get the load a new ""world"" so you can load a lew setup so you can load anew lobby. Then this missions takes 4 minutes to complete and you get to spend 10 more minutes loading.This game is not well balanced it is ill conceived the netcode is absolutely horrible (unless you like playing with russians with 400 ping)There is nothing good about it. I can't believe I got fooled into buying it twice (once on PS3 when there was no online and now on PC where online is just bad)Avoid this P.O.S game.The best part about the online experience is discover why videogames have introduced over the last 20 years abstract and advanced concepts such as parties lobbies server browsers and not loading the entire game just to pick a gamemodeSeriously this game sucks. It's amazing that it sucks so much considering the unbelievable amount of work put into it's world. There are so many things to see in Los Santos so many places NPCs. It's a beautiful world but playing in it is an absolute drag. If you want gameplay look elsewhere.The is the most beautiful GTA ever made. It's also the worse.AVOID",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-31,0,0,35,False,Recommended,"After the sheer disappointment that was Grand Theft Auto 4 this game at least in comparison has been a pleasure to say the least.Without even taking into consideration anything else graphically this is a masterpiece. The models are the most impressive I have seen in any game. The urban areas sadly seem dull in most places however the wilderness is truly breathtaking and an absolute pleasure to behold on ultra settings if not lower. I didn't expect to enjoy playing more than one character throughout the story but it worked out very well overall and I actually enjoyed each of the characters personalities. The non playable characters in the game friends family or foe are also memorable and interesting.The main story was great to playthrough but it seemed to abruptly end. The ""Strangers and Freaks"" side missions which are new to the series were unusually not boring which is rare for games in general. I probably won't dabble in the Online mode due to the microtransation insanity that I've seen but overall I can imagine with the map size this game provides it would still be a blast regardless though I can't talk from experience.The PC port is overall stable but the first person mode is subpar as the FoV veicule viewpoint placements and weapon positions are just bad to say the least a shame. The weapons and cars at least feel good to use sadly however controlling aircraft still holds true to being a pain to use. As the game is based in Los Santos I wish it was more architecturally similar to that of how it was in San Andreas plus there's also the obvious fact that it seems the other cities from that game have been retconned for no reason which makes me question what the heck is going on in the overall series now it's just confusing. A bit of a spoiler in the rest of this paragraph you do visit Grove Street in the game and it was overran with Ballas ridiculous what a damn shame not to see at least some references to the events in San Andreas though apparently the story from that game doesn't apply here. Some series consistancy would be nice. Oh and of course no Cluckin Bell interiors? Come on now guys.Considering this game is one of the most successful games ever made you don't need me to tell you it's good. The bad factors of the game are minor at best and they are not worth avoiding such a great game for. It triumphs without mercy over the the prior game but I still don't think it tops San Andreas but perhaps that's just the rose tinted goggles for you.",Grand Theft Auto V

And I must say the game is great! It's becoming one of my most played games on Steam. All the time in the game ive put into online online in the PC version is OK one or two hackers a session can really make a game terrible. But Rockstar has put new bans in place to attemps to cut down on the hackers. There is a lot of things to do in gta online if you are willing to look. Most of the time I am invited to setups for Heists Heists are really rewarding when executed with the right group of people but horrible if one idiot dosent know what he's doing. Singleplayer has just as much things to do with random events murder mysteries Bigfoot Peyote plants and even joining a clut. Performance wise the game is great i have a 750ti and at Nvidia's recommended settings i get 60fps and the game looks great. ONE major complaint is that Rockstar pulled some shady **** at the summer sale to avoid dropping their price something I'd like to see changed at the winter sale.

I have a FX4130 R9270x 8GB of ram and this game runs like a dream with 40fps on very high to ultra!I happen to be the one of the lucky ones to not have ""Gtav.exe has stopped working everytime I launch and i dont expect rockstar to do much since they have such a low priority in PC gaming and have stripped the game of modding (Which was one of the main points of the game) and banning people for using simple FOV mods etc. This game is very well put together with its brilliant and interactive story line and its fun filled random GTA Online.I have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable games to play alone and even better yet with friends with heists freeroam missions races etc.1) IF you are having problems with your game crashing i would reccomend going to www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri and search for gta 5 and run the scan. To run the game all you need really is the minimum checked off and you should be good for normal to high settings with a steady fps.2) IF YOU passed the scan and it still doesnt work try updating drivers for GPU and CPU at the makers website.3) IF that didnt work try making sure you have all of your Microsoft Visual C++'s. (If you dont have all of them game can crash or not even load) To aqquire go to https //support.microsoft.com/en us/kb/2977003.4) Make sure you are administrator or RIGHT click gtav and hit ""Run as administrator""5) Disable antiviruses. I have AVAST Super Anti Spyware Malwarebytes and they do not cause problems. IF you have others i would try disabling them and trying to launch up the game.6) Check for game updates. As you know upon release a update was put out for gta v which fixed a glitch is story mode. To see if their is and update go to Gta v in your library right click and go to updates. Then make sure it says ""Always keep this game up to date and hit ""OK"". 7) Still staying in properties go to ""Local Files"" and click ""View integrity of game cache"".

2015-04-15,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,"From what I experienced in the short time I was actually able to get this game to run(probably around a half hour total) I would rate this game 9/10.Unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run and the few times it did crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen.I have opened a ticket with Rockstar support and tried all of the ""fixes"" they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked.Funny how they delayed the release again and again ""to ensure that the game is as polished as possible and to make certain that both Heists and the GTA Online experience are ready to roll out on day one for PC.""Well guess what Rockstar? The game doesn't even run for a lot of us. I'm sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then I'll be able to forgive you but until then I just want to warn anyone who's thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game won't even run and so I would recommend waiting until Rockstar has fixed this issue.",Grand Theft Auto V

This is all rock stars fault all because they want you to spend hours and hours playing just to earn a couple of thousand dollars and even then I can't buy anything because everything is so expensive.Oh and the shark card s are a complete waste of money because even if you buy a megalodon shark you have to spend 100 dollars and you only get 8 million dollars of in game money which seems like a lot but is really garbage because you could literally spend it all on one item.completely unfair and the scaling of real money vs in game money received is a complete joke.I will never ever play this game again.An absolute disgrace to the gaming industry.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-06,0,0,111,False,Recommended,This may be the longest review I have ever typed out but here goes nothing!Wow where do I even start with this masterpiece of a Grand Theft Auto game.. well for good measure I will break it out in seperate pieces. STORY After just recently completing the story mode for a fourth time (Two times on PS3 once on PS4 and now on PC) and eventually will complete one last time but with the mouse and keyboard. I am just so in love with the storyline for this game it is so well acted and I wouldn't really say well written since this is just a simple plot but still though it's a really awesome storyline for such a quality Grand Theft Auto game. From the main characters to the secondary and minor characters (Haven't met all of them but met a great bunch of them) all of them are just very loveable characters I love all of them but the one that stays in my heart will always be Michael he's now my number two protagonist in GTA number one will be Niko Bellic from IV don't get me wrong but Niko has a much better storyline that's connected to him. I love this storyline so much.. GAMEPLAY Rockstar really changed up the gameplay from GTA IV alot of nice improvements and changes with the First Person perspective added in with the PS4 and Xbone versions at the time it really does bring in the immersive feel of the beautiful map of this game. With them raising the framerate to 60FPS It is so much more smoother and it brings in the immersive feel of the game so much more than it was on the PS3 and the PS4. I really love all of the weapons but I wish to see some more unique weapons aswell such as the Musket and the Rail Gun and a couple more. All of the types of vehicles in this game there's alot of vehicles.. I wish they brought back the PMP 600 from IV.. That car was beast.. Please Rockstar bring it back? &lt 3 GRAPHICS AND PORT The first time I believe I ever talk about how the game looks.. So of course the game looks abso lutely stunning at all angles (I was playing through the game and playing Online on High eventually will be max settings and will beat the story again.. lol) The draw distance is awesome and it feels much more immersive than ever since it's running at 60FPS.. which brings me down to breaking down the port of this magnificent game. Rockstar I was unsure of what you were going to do for this port at first but then since you guys took extra time to polish it and everything of course I got a little impatient but I was trusting you and look at what you did.. You did an outstanding job with bringing this yet I say again masterpiece to PC. Thank you for upgrading to 60FPS since it is necessary for a GTA PC port which helps to bring in the immersion to playing in a GTA game. Of course it's not perfect I tend to have little drops here and there but it's so much more smoother now.. GTA ONLINE I love playing Online so much it is so much more expanded than GTA IV's of course.. I have to admit I was really impatient for waiting for Heists but I got through it When I saw the trailer I was so ready to play Heists. But let's face it Heists are just ONE big thing to do in GTA Online but honestly there are limitless things you can do in GTA Online and now you can record it with the Rockstar Editor! You can make AWESOME movies! If there's nothing to do.. that what are you thinking about then? Hm? You just have to be creative and think of all of the awesome gameplay features the vehicles everything Rockstar has incorporated into this game.. Like I said before.. limitless things you can do!!! CONCLUSION I believe I have covered everything as possible so here is my last and final statement about this game. Rockstar has done an outstanding job with the game by itself incorporated more amazing stuff in their DLCs bringing us unlimited things to do in GTA Online it looks mind blowingly amazing and feels so much better due to a higher framerate Of course look at this review that's alot of words saying that I love this game but I could go on forever and EVER talking about how great this game is.. Only thing I will say of what you should play on to enjoy it the most on is definitely the PC version Rockstar my last words to you is this Thank you so much for treating this masterpiece right on PC and you have stole my heart for making such an incredible Grand Theft Auto game.. I can't wait to see what you establish in GTA VI here's hoping it's in Vice City!RATING 10/10 I would want to go higher.. screw it.. 999 999 999 999 999/10Last words In regardless of how much it is I would reccomend getting it on a sale if you have played it before but if it is going to be your first time playing it it is worth full price (in my opinion) but do what you want you won't be mistaken. Also I have crashed on this game in the beginning but I have found a solution from someone and solved it if you guys are crashing and don't know what to do check if you have a plsapp64.dll in C Windows System32 get rid of it it solved my crashing and it should solve yours.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-17,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,Don't waste your time personally i see this as an overhyped scam before this the only other rockstar game i purchased and played was GTA3 here are my opinions based off of observation and gameplay.1. The Graphics are nice but the damage modeling is old as it looks like it acts like 2. Physics are a sick ing joke All points Bulletin is a MUCH older game and has better physics.3. Character customisation may as well not exhist minimal effort was put into this it has some cool concepts but none of them work characters look largely deformed and clothing options are laughably slim.4. Loading times in this game are ing absurd either on or offline it should't take 2 3 even 4 minutes to get into the game.5. Animations/Character movement feel sluggish and clumsy No the game is not ment to feel like Quake 3 arena but it feel's like i am carrying around a backpack weighing 500lbs all the time.6. This game is NOT imaginative at all there is NOTHING in here that i find to be even remotely fun it's pretty much all just tedious the only thing worth doing are heist's and these are extremely geneic not very well thought out or challenging (( and some are just hard not like challenging hard but simply so badly ing designed some of the simplest task's are like trying to climb mount everest with a broken leg. )) &lt Wouldd you try to climb everest with a broken leg? in all seriousness No.7. Rockstar is behind on the times not only do they not support modding (( which extends the life of the game and could fix alot of the issues it has )) apperantly they have started banning people for running mods on their private instances while i myself have not expierienced this it's just a crap deal.8. This game is incredibly unstable i have recently upgraded my system it's nearly top of the line i dumped alot into this it's been long enough now alot of the optimisation issues should have been fixed Well they arn't Atleast not for PC's i cant speak for the XBone or the playsation but for PC's this game is a $60(( when i bought it )) pile of steaming trash.9. This game has Zero replay value it takes forever to get money to progress((unless you buy shark cards)) but truth be told there isn't much to progress into after a few hours offline and online you have pretty much done it all and we are talking ... maybe.. 5 hours of fresh gameplay after that it's all the same time and time again and quickly begins to feel grindy after about lvl 1510. Don't pvp you actually get punished for it even if you're just defending yoruself. It's bad enough i have now tossed rockstar into the same bin as Electronic arts and will no longer be making any purchases with them i'll spend my time and money elsewhere i havent been this dissopointed in a game for a long time i have seen some dissopointing things in my day but this is just a t mass money maker.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-16,0,0,1543,False,Recommended,i have over 1000 hours in this game and never seem to get tired of it. you can change around alot on what u do from different form of racing to shooting. Til simple made up games in the game or a sandbox of fun in the open world til bikers til ceo missions. Also become alot easier to earn money on bunker cocain lab money laundry. its ofc alot more fun to play with friends. Ideal number 4. but if u play alone its nice and easy to find more people with auto inv. what I do get tired of is if you play in online session and not make your own. Then mostly you will allways end up finding a modder. I have meet many modders in online session and only twice they have not been trying to general ruin the game Mostly they will make themself invincible so not posible to kill back and ofc they will come to you and everyone else to hunt if you try to just avoid it they teleport afther you. or they just make everyone in the world die right afther u spawn with bombs or hunting vehicle. have had a few also drop moeny but that happens wery rare think only 5 timessince they are more careful about that but still anoying since I not want free money. the two times it was fun when was a modder ranomly spawn everyone to the air port and bikes was ready and a race track was made. if people did not want to join they could leave without getting harassed by the modder. second time when random items spawn around in the world they was harmless and looked funny. But beside that the game itself is awesome.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-10-12,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,Let me sum it up they took GTA and turned it to a mobile app. You do missions and don't get paid so you can't spend in game cash on cars and businesses until you pretty much finish the game. If you do get paid it's peanuts and everything costs a sh*tload. Why? To get you to spend some bucks on in game cash (yes that's actually an option I know I was disgusted and ashamed for Rockstar just as much as you were). Everything else isn't an improvement on GTA 4 and unless you play the single player as a very long tutorial for GTA Online (where being a pay2win is allowed because that's what mmos are) you're in for a disappointment (unless you've learnt to love pay2wins in which case my condolences).I know I know it's the new GTA of course you've bought it. Unfortunately so have I. Yes the characters are awesome but this is a game not a film. It's supposed to be fun and rewarding to PLAY. Rockstar used to know this. Oh well.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-21,0,0,89,False,Not Recommended,"Can't recommend this because it is the very first mediocre GTA game in almost every aspect.Only thing that makes it stand out from the series is that off road driving is finally fun and exciting (I.E it isn't an automatic death sentence to your car)When I saw the first trailers for this game I was ecstatic They are gonna combine the fun of San Andreas and the modern grafics of IV.What we ended up getting was a game with cutting edge graphics and little else.First of all the story is our heroes are Old fat man with family problems.Diet CJ with really annoying friends.And Trevor the insane canadian dude who only looks after himself and damns the consequences of his actions (he is also the red line that connects all the other ""characters"" ""story lines"" together).It is really sad when the only interesting character with proper character arc is the dude who that resembles a character from Saints Row Sociopath with questinable ideas of fun (I.E fun to watch horrible to have them as a neighbor).Diet CJ is especially disapointing He starts up as a poor street thug becomes rich criminal and is then sad when his friend Diet Ryder calls him a busta for getting out of the ghetto. At least the Sad fat man had that funny mission where he humiliates Lazlow but only because Trevor told him to do it.There are also ""choices"" one can make during the story but they all happen in places where the only logical option is to KILL EVERYONE. But when Diet Ryder gets into trouble because yet another one of his stupid plans the option ""screw that guy"" is nowhere to be seen.There isn't even any memorable side character besides Lester but he has the unfair advantage of being funny and central to the plot. Mechanics are also lacking.There is no point of doing any of the side activities In previous games you would unlock more gameplay by doing them (I.E getting Car bombs from Patrick or becoming fireproof) but now they are just busy work that adds NOTHING to the game.Buying properties is pointless because they barely make any money and they don't unlock any new gameplay (Like recruiting porn stars to work in your porno studio for high profit in Vice City).Money is a constant problem there is never enough of it. Then again there is very little you can spend it on Weapons are dirt cheap as are the ugly clothes (which have extremely small variety in them) odd haircuts and the booring side activities. Tuning your car is fun but REALLY expencive (Except for Diet CJ for he can buy one Los Santos Customs for him self for free mods for him and ONLY for him). Only way to make money is to fiddle around with the stock market which is brain numbingly boring (Exept when you actively manipulate it with Lester but there's only about 7 times you can do that).Oh there is a huge payday at the end of the game but then there is no point of spending it on anything for the story line is finished.The game also punishes you if you want to bring your own car into a mission instead of the character specific vehicle If you are not inside you car when the mission end it gets towed away and you have to pay to get it back. This makes using any other vehicles besides the chracters own pointless because you will just lose money. Who tougth this would be a good idea.The world around you also feels extremely static For example I never saw a police car just patrolling around like in every othe GTA. they only appeared when I had a wanted level which ruined the already feeble immersion the game had.I could go on and on about how mediocre this game is but I'll just quickly summarize If this game would have been just plain bad I would have liked it more but seeing this othervise functioning game getting half like this for the sake of the pointless multiplayer mode which can't do anything that Saints Row 4 hasn't already done better and bigger.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-01,0,0,109,False,Recommended,"Quite possibly the best game of the decade!SummaryYou start off in the single player ""Story Mode"" by playing one of the 3 main characters Franklin. I won't ruin it but you eventually meet the other two main characters and then you can switch between the 3 of them. There's so much stuff to keep you entertained you won't be pressed to find something that you'll enjoy doing. From playing sports like tennis or golf to completing the story or even heading online to compete in races heists and other activities. There's so much to do in GTA V but the main reason I got GTA and always have in the past is because of the music within the game. It may sound a little cheesey why would you get a game solely based on music alone? Well because they're very good at selecting some of the best tracks and implementing them into their game. I remember purchasing a console a while back just so I could get GTA. I can't remember which console it was but I'm wanting to say it was the PS3 when they had exclusive rights for 1 whole year to GTA. I wanted it so bad that I purchased the console just to get it. Maybe it was the XBOX and San Andreas can't remember exactly.One thing that I myself find entertaining is to watch the T.V. shows and listen to the comercials within GTA V. So many things are funny. Even the radio commecials are worth listening to. They do a very good job of continuity within the game. Some of the commecials advertising things on T.V. and the radio you may see elsewhere plastered on a billboard or hanging on a poster someplace.The graphics are very well made. I think my favorite part of the graphics and environment is the ocean. The waves are so realistic. Also if you dive below the surface you'll find all sorts of goodies. Animal life plants debree and other secrets to be discovered. The environment is great. Even when you are very far away high up in the sky or wherever you are you can still see vehicle headlights off in the distance as well as street lights and buildings. Unlike previous GTAs the vehicles don't disappear on you or reappear from what I can tell. It's all realtime. And you almost wonder how they were able to achieve this and keep the game playable to so many people. GTA V is not nearly as taxing on your comp as most would think they did a very good job of optimizing the game from what I've seen.Another thing that I thought was really surprising is that they actually have another whole story within the multiplayer mode. Of course its more difficult usually unless you have friends that you play with it can sometimes be a pain in the butt. Simply because you have people that will leave if you don't complete the mission or heist for the very first time. It's also difficult to find others to play with sometimes. More people are doing the compitions like races or team based fights rather than missions. I think its because you can make more in game money if you do those within the same amount of time.One more thing that I'd like to mention is the various vehicles that are within GTA V. There are so many different vehicles you can get. From cars to planes ships helicopters and even some that are a little off the wall. It's very enjoyable to try them all.BreakdownCONTENT 10/10There's so much content in GTA V that you won't run out of the fun for a very long time. Also the various things to do in multiplayer mode is a huge plus!ANIMATIONS 10/10The cut scenes and the character switching animations are pretty good. I was hoping to see some more animations to be honest. I also enjoyed how they ran the credits at the end of the game.GRAPHICS/ARTWORK/ILLUSTRATIONS 10/10The graphics are superb. Sometimes they're so nice you just want to sit back and look at the environment. Very good job.GAMEPLAY 10/10The gameplay is second to none. Great interaction with multiple aspects of the game. You can play tennis golf race or do many other things throughout the world. There are all sorts of places to go and things to do.CONTROLS 10/10The controls in GTA V are very straightforward and understandable. You can also quick switch between keyboard and mouse or your controller. Just a neat little addition to the controls.RELIABILITY 8/10While I haven't had many issues with running GTA V there have been some. One in particular prevented me from getting online. I had to do some things to fix it and finally got online again but this is not acceptable especially for a triple A title like this.USER INTERFACE 10/10The user interface is easy to understand and flows with the game well. In single player the game slows down enough for you to switch between the items when you need to. Also the game pauses when you're at the main menu. In multiplayer it is the same interface but without the slowing and pause which is obviously not really possible.MUSIC AND SOUNDS 10/10The music and sounds in GTA V are by far the best job I've ever seen in a video game. The music is by far the best music ever put into a video game. There are also ambient sounds and conversations which will entertain you time and time again.ORIGINALITY/STORY 10/10The story was very good. Of course it was violent at times and could of been better at others but overall it was well rounded and kept you wanting more. The multiplayer aspect of the game is very in depth as well. It's almost as if it's two seperate games in one because the single player and multiplayer have different storylines.COMMUNITY VIBE 10/10People love GTA V and I can see why. It's a very good game all around. From the graphics to the music to the gameplay you really cant go wrong.TOTAL SCORE 98/100ConclusionGrand Theft Auto V is a great video game and may be the best video game of the decade. I remember before I actually bought GTA V I did a little research on the numbers and I think GTA V was #3 on the top grossing video games of all time. Think #1 was Tetris #2 was Minecraft and then GTA V was 3rd. That says a lot especially since its only been out for a short period of time.I really enjoyed playing the single player ""Story Mode"" of GTA V and also the short time I've put online. The only downside that I've found about GTA V is the seperate DRM that is required to play. Also the couple of reliablity issues but after I've fixed them they havent caused me any problems since.If you like good gameplay good music good art a good story and endless things to do I'd say pick up GTA V and have some fun. If not you're probably missing out on a great Game You Absolutely Must Have and that's a shame. GTA V is worth the purchase from everyone if not for the gameplay for the music alone. Just be aware GTA V can be very bloody and violent at times.Good day )",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-11-28,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,Because this game is a two in one I will review it as such especially since I play both GTA V and GTA Online. That means if one fails to meet my expectations I will not recommend it since that's 50/50 right? GTA V is clearly great and is recommended if you're into singleplayer open world games. The story isn't as great as the others though but it's alright. It s fun and that s all that matters. However GTA Online is a whole different story.The best way to put it is as long as I see hackers in my game I will not recommend it. GTA V s high rating is due to its singleplayer but I guarantee people would think differently about its Online version. Both Steam and Rockstar should think about breaking away these two games because it s essentially what they are. Keeping them combined is giving an inaccurate rating. Rockstar needs to know what we really think about the Online version.Back to GTA Online hackers ruin the game entirely. It not only hurts us players who want to play correctly but it also hurts Rockstar's reputation and cash flow. Why would people buy cash when players hack it? They even hack it for others and give them cash without even being asked for it. Progression in this game seems non existent because of hackers making you lose interest in the game very easily. There is nothing to show off nothing making you appear any better to anyone else because most likely everyone got it through the means of hacking. You even go to a deathmatch to show off your shooting skills only to anger a hacker and have him destroy you.You want to report a hacker? Good luck finding out who is hacking because there is nothing telling you who is doing it. But it just gets even better once you do find out who is doing it and submit a report Rockstar seems to threaten you by terminating your account if you re wrong. So whose side are they really on? What is seems to be is that Rockstar has no idea with what they re doing with an online game. There seems to be no hacker prevention because hackers are rampant. I kid you not you will witness one in a very short period of time.Some more few problems with online play is that it s far from userfriendly. You need to go to story mode in order to create an invite only freeroam session. Your gun loadout is also never saved so every startup you need to switch all your guns around all over again. They tell you that you can do this in story mode but why do I need to go to story mode to change something for the online version? Ridiculous. Also the game isn t very fun to play with friends. You do a quick job session with friends and sometimes you get thrown into a job without your friends or some of your friends get left behind seriously? Rockstar please fix and polish your game up before you plan on adding anymore new content. Eliminating hackers should be your top priority,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-20,0,0,30,False,Recommended,At first I thought this was just another GTA. A console port done reasonably well but for all that just a console port.However the more I play the more I like it. No not like it I love it. I am not really all the motivated by the GTA Franchise in the past but I like open world games so they appeal to me on that basis. What has really got me into GTA V is that it is BIG. Not large huge. A really open world which is something I didnt expect from anything that had even sat next to someone that had once looked at someone that once played something on an Xbox. It is massive and open with all sorts of interesting ways to get around.The Graphics.Caveat here. I have unusually powerful machines at my disposal (SLI and TRI SLI Titan X's custom watercooling blah blah blah depending on my latest build.I seek out the most demanding games because I like state of the art. I want to see the potential of today's technology explored and in many respects GTA V Does that. Playing at 2560x1440 and above with all the options enabled these textures look incredible. How many times have I been wizzing along in a car and crashed because I am staring at the city in wonder. This is what I like. Massive open and no compromises on quality. On top of that they are not afraid to have themes which appeal to someone over 14. Not gratuitously nor is it out of place. But it adds something and makes the city feel that little bit more alive. I still have a lot to do in GTA but it is one of those games I know I will be going back to for a long time. The seminal moment of the GTA Series.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-30,0,0,184,False,Recommended,GTAV has been fun and addicting for many of the same reasons previous titles in the franchise have been it's outrageous it's massive and intriguing. However where it falls short is that it is a very shallow and streamlined experience.This GTA map is ridiculously big and full of fun things to do or cool places to explore. Additions like golf and tennis make for games within a game. But by 2013 standards and playing games like Skyrim it falls a little short. The world is closed off and limited in a lot of ways. Like okay I see you golf and tennis but why can't I go to the beach and play volleyball with some ladies or go to the park and play basketball with some of the homeys. It's situations like this that remind you that you aren't quite in an open world environment. Most of the shops and buildings are inaccessible. So you can see a nice coffee shop and it's front door is a wall. You can't go into cool hotels or even go to a mall and then just decide you wanna try robbing as many stores as you can before having to fight off the police. It would also be nice to not see the same skins used so often. The very first fire fight in the game every single enemy looked the same. And I can't count how many times in 2 blocks I see the same fat black lady yapping on her phone. It would have been nice to see some of these features to have a truly immersive and captivating experience. As it is this is GTAIV with more paint better driving less annoying SIMS add ons like making your friends happy and having to meet up with them or relationships deteriorate.Customization is also very limited partly because every character has a unique story you must follow. And you can't veer off of it at all. There is no element of choice at all here in a generation that usually demands one. You can't even change your default car. If you buy a 250k Lambo you'll still have your ugly Dodge Charger spawn at your house. If you place cars you steal or buy into your garage and take them on a mission they may disappear when the mission makes you use another vehicle. In some cases your car appears at the end of the mission but in many cases it does not. And sure you can buy property but you can't buy homes or condos. You can't invite a bunch of girls over for a pool party. You are often left with the feeling of why do I need to work for money when I can't show it off or do much with it anyway. If I want to feel how a Ferrari drives I can just steal it I don't have to save up and buy it. Then what? Where is the thrill of reaping your rewards and living out the life of one of these criminals in full detail.The iPhone app also falls sadly short. The things to do on it are boring and don't affect the game enough. All of that being said this is still a great GTA experience with hours and hours of fun. And GTA online will be lots of fun. But it is disappointing that in 2013 almost 2014 with the technology that is available today and the rich video game history we have companies with great franchises like this aren't pushing the envelope a little harder to make the game innovative and inventive translating into a thoroughly immersive experience for the end user.,Grand Theft Auto V

With or without friends there is so much to do I understand why they haven't announced GTA VI yet. GTA Online is just awesome.Hackers are still a huge problem but you can always report them and change session. The only thing that got worse is community why are there so much chinese? Moreover why aren't there regional servers? If you ignore the bad part of community this game is easily the best online game ever.I was very harsh on my original review I just wanted to hate the game for no reason. But to be honest we don't need GTA VI anytime soon.GTA V 7/10 (You know kinda lame story and still not fun after around 40 hours they don't give a about GTA V anymore)GTA Online 8/10 (Hackers no regional servers REALLY hard to earn cash) ORIGINAL REVIEW (4/6 found helpful)More than 200 hours in Xbox 360 and around 390 hours in PC (according to Social Club)Story Mode is fun before you finish Store Mode and side missions it slowly becomes boring after finishing the missions.The online gameplay is ok but after you're level 100 it slowly becomes boring just like the story mode unless you have less than 2 friends to play with.

2015-04-14,10,45,83,False,Not Recommended,"Another rock solid RockStar release .. requires Social Club to play crashes almost immediately on launch .. yeap .. glad I paid for this Update The launch of this game was appalling huge amounts of different causes for crashes and different bugs causing e.g. incredibly sluggish FPS on default settings. The apparently needed mobile app still doesn't support PC a couple of days after launch.The only official answer I've heard is that if you use anything but a z A Z and 0 9 in your user account name they suggest you create a new user account which is ridiculous in itself. Some of the other causes for crashes have been solved by the community and e.g. on reddit you can find a decent list of suggestions. However there still seem to be a lot of people for whom none of the suggested solutions work.I finally managed to get myself into the game the crashes at launch seemed to have been caused by .. my microphone. Disconnecting my Blue Yeti before launch got the game to launch and I could reconnect it once I was in the menu without it causing the game to crash again.After managing to get into the game the gameplay turned out to be very good much more fun than I hoped for but still leaves room for improvement on the controls side.The controls are incredibly complicated pretty much every key on the keyboard has some function assigned to it and the ""hints"" for using them are briefly flashed at the top left corner the first time you need it thus it's easy to also miss it and get stuck trying to look for what key is for e.g. going into cover.While the game has a lot of promise I cannot with good conscience recommend this to anyone until they fix their .. this might take a month it might never happen.

2015-07-24,0,0,610,False,Not Recommended,Don't buy this game it's not worth it.Story is mediocre and multiplayer is down right unplayable on PC. Loading times are long enough to make yourself a cup of coffee the whole MP system is unnecesary complex and just wastes your time with stupid menu screens awful matchmaking and etc. It says i've played this game for 200 something hours on PC but half of it was looking at the loading screen sitting in lobbys and backing out from one lobby and trying to find another one cause the previous lobby host was a ing moron. Also the game is filled with cheaters and R* completely ruined the performance of this game with the last two updates. The second update was supposed to clean up after what the first one did but it only fixes the performance in freeroam. In heists the game still runs like You get fps drops from 60+ to 20 and what not. Unplayable. Rockstar and it's attempts at stopping modders is just pathetic they can update their code all they want won't change a god damn thing.Oh and for all of this they charge you a full price. I hope the people who are reponsible for GTA Online will never get to make a multiplayer for any game ever again. Clearly they have no common sense and they don't play their own created piece of Online clients.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,1081,False,Not Recommended,I've been playing GTA 5 since 2013 of december. I started playing Online in 2014 on xbox 360. Eventually I made my way to Xbox One. Then PC back in July of 2016. I took a lot of time tons of money to get as far as I wanted too. Playing hours on end. I currently have 1 039.6 hours as of this post was typed. I was banned in June of 2017 for an unknown reason. I'll explain everything that happened. Just to show how stupid rockstars ban system is.I was playing with my friend doing bunker missions in a invite only session. We were doing these missions for hours to gain money because I was saving up for something. I turned off my computer at around 2 A.M because that's usually when I went to bed. I woke up the next day opened up GTA 5 and it tells me I'm banned for 1 month. For what exactly? To this day I don't know. And to be frank I don't think I'll ever know. I got unbanned in July of 2017.In July of 2017 I was an idiot. A complete udder idiot. I didn't understand exactly how the ban system worked and I went ahead and used a ing mod menu in a solo session and only once I opened it up in a session with people and helped this noob out who was getting killed by other high ranks and I gave him weapons. I made a second account on the same social club account that I modded on. I thought MY main account was safe. But because I was an idiot. I didn't know that I had to make a second social club account and then rebuy the game to mod without being banned on my main account. A few hours later. I was banned. Perm banned. It's currently July of 2018. I've been banned for One year. And I'm so regretful for doing that. I had exactly 931 hours of the time of me being banned. I currently have 1039.6 hours as of me typing this. If I didn't get banned for no reason by rockstar in the first place. I know I would of learned and never did that again. I was a rank 133 at the time of my ban. I had so many cars houses bunkers CEO offices planes choppers and a Yacht and so many damn weapons I was so overpowered. And it's all gone.

Sure it can be fun i guess but the fact is that the developers ing write when starting up the game that modding is not allowed. So how can you believe that you can mod the out of the game and not expect repercussions?The online part of the game has been time and time again by people who cheat only to mess around with other players. It makes a game (series) that i have always loved terrible!I really appreciate the work by Rockstar making this game and making all these ""DLC's"" for free!Sure if you don't wan't to work to earn money to buy stuff buy the Shark Cards.Just like in many other games where you can buy weapons to make the game more fun for you.

2018-07-18,1,1,504,False,Recommended,Graphics Soundtrack (Custom user radio)Story Gameplay Overall It's amazing how far Rockstar had made GTA. I remember playing GTA since GTA2. GTA V is unlike it's past release one of the stunning and realistic game. Of course there are few things that defies physics but overall I enjoy playing it cause it allows me to extend my capabilities of not having to think about responsibilities. People may blame GTA as a victim of violence game but I found it enjoyable and the most I could have without having to go through aggressive consequences in real life. GTA online is on the other hand enjoyable unless you know what's going on. I advise you to watch some of the youtube guides before you start playing online cause online is comparatively different from single player. GTA online focuses on teamwork as you need friends to progress faster. You can undoubtedly progress as a single loner in GTA online but it's considerably slower. The single player story involves multiple character that represents stereotypes in America as they or you interact with each character by doing some campaign missions as well as other events. Story doesn't get me going as much but I enjoyed the freedom most of all. I really enjoyed somewhat the realistic aspects of the gameplay although I'd wish the game had more of a stealth AI then it currently does.I definitely recommend giving this game a try as it helped me reduce stress and anxiety.,Grand Theft Auto V

MODDERS Those who always annoy everyone in the server. Out of 10 sessions 9 of them I've spawned into are with a bunch of modders who likes to spawn things onto you such as a ferris wheel. 3. Other players Those who abuse their modding powers. These are the annoying people who constantly kill you for no apparent reason.4. Heists Everytime where I want to finish my Pacific Standard Finale there is always that ONE guy who leaves when the heist is almost finishPros 1.

2016-10-25,1,1,389,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V... Where to begin? There's so much i would want to say about this game Its honestly one of the best games so far ever when it comes to the usage of DLC's comming and a few ones going after a long while. I've played this game since it was released onto the PS3. And even then i had the thought of this game being better than you'd imagine. But.Yes. The story did suck in my opinion the story wasn't as good as you had hoped for it did reveal some cool features in the game and it was pretty neat at the time but playing it again is not recommended it gets really boring i've already had a game that was 100% completed and after starting a new one cause i was bored is not recommended. But dont get me wrong the story is only a small part of what i want to say cause this game had the best ways of adding things smoothly more and more into updates and forexample when they added the heist everyone thought it'd be so awesome and it was yeah but the thought that Rockstar used the hype the game already had into it was actually pretty smart all DLC's were free and just for the ones that already had paid $50. They used the hype in a way the medias would talk more about them and overall its actually quite smart. I'd like to take a moment to endore what this game really is. And i'd like to say that my steam timer is NOT accurate i've played so much more onto the consoles. 10 / 10 overall for me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-25,0,0,73,False,Recommended,So first the positives Story mode is solid aiming is good along with a redone cover system that flows minus a few glitches beautiful graphics good for about 50 60 hours of play offline.The cons once you buy a gun you are stuck with it. Would have been better if they allowed you to take some weapons out of your inventory. online mode is terrible unless you have ADHD..... then it is fun i guess. No direction and it forces you to play with others in order to make money in pre designed missions that are just GTAV versions of team death match and capture the flag with some racing. The missions are fun property the player can buy in story mode and online looks like the devs forgot about it completely then added it in later as a patch for online only.

2016-08-17,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,If you want to drop $60+ on a single player game this is an excellent choice as a multiplayer experience it is beyond trash. Servers are often wiped kicking players from them and throwing into 5 10 minute load screens sync between players is more often than not terrible so driving with other people is an experience for how pathetic it is gamemodes are often advertised for x2 $ and XP yet any mode beyond racing is unbalanced and anything that is pre set team based goes into the advantage of a single team &gt team balancing still doesn't work and results in people playing the same side twice and winning the game making 2 3 times more than everyone else in $. Muting the outragous number of people in the community is a chore in itself as it requires going through multiple menu screens to even mute a single player more often than not it's easier to be verbally abused by an underaged player or the even great majority of bigots who slander others with racial and sexual slurrs.

2016-01-25,0,0,133,False,Not Recommended,Most disappointing game I ever played. I expected it to be a hybrid of GTA IV RDR and Max Payne gameplay wise but we got nothing near that. The world feels so artificial and unalive. NPCS run away and scream for no reason attack you when you are standing a few feet away from them doing nothing their animations are awful and little detail was put into them. NPCS in a game like GTA V should not look like they are from a different gen game. The driving and shooting physics are and unresponsive. AND WHAT THE IS UP WITH EVERY MAIN CHARACTER (besides Franklin and Lamar) HAVING EYES THAT BULDGE OUT OF THEIR HEAD IT LOOKS TERRIBLE. Also the forced microtransactions are the worst. If you want any of the cool new update vehicles and items you'll need a ton of money for them. Overall I would not recommend this game unless it was under 15 dollars which seems very unlikely to happen in the near future or at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

You think i'm making this up? im being 100% serious a game from the 1990's looks better than this on the lowest settings it can runAnd for that and many other stupid idiotic decisions from rockstar i will no longer be giving them another chance on trying to persuade me to buy any of there lazy games again go ahead rockstar prove me wrong improve your port and i will reconsider this review.however for the time being because this game looks like a game that's one of the first 3D games invented it's a full on no for me if you have an APU don't even think of buying this pile of crap.1/10 the 1 is for finally being on PC,Grand Theft Auto V

Before yesterday I didn't ever want to pick this game up again. I just felt that the game got really bland and boring after a while and I just didn't see a reason for me to return since I had done pretty much everything to do. However for some reason when I came back I found this game to be extremely fun. Like I don't know why but I found everything in this game to be way more enjoyable than when I first started playing. Even the campaign was fun to me. As if I haven't said it enough this game is EXTREMELY fun and now more than ever I can fully recommend this game.

I've played this game on 360(bought around 2014) and decided to buy for the PC one (during the last sale.) and i enjoyed most of the time spent. Pros Masterpiece.This game never fails to surprize me.New things keep coming out.Triple the fun when you play with your friends. The new rocket powered car is damn lit.Stunt RacesAwesome vehicles.I dont think community is going down.Cons There will always have that one guy who speaks alien(but i guess it depends on the area where we play..)&gt 65GB of memory. Ofc it depends on your PC and storages. Conclusion One BIG game. Over 65Gb for one single game and definitely not a cheap game for a game released on 2013. But even so its all worth it. Simply amazing.I dont think r* are legitly banning inno. Player But you'll never know. Maybe they kinda mod the game or sth. But check the discussion. There are a lot of players and you'll never be alone(unless you choose to play solo).Rated 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-03,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,The game is really boring really All you do is drive places and then do a mission where you drive somewhere race people or ram cars/escape police. Even the heists are mostly driving.All of that is boring since the driving is way to sensitive.The mission checkpoints are also awfull if you got a car you don't like for a race whoops then you're forced to use that car if you retry the mission. You're also forced to finish the mission even if you know you've failed so you gotta kill yourself to retry quicker. Which is a problem lot's of missions have. They waste your time. I've had a gunshop owner kill me 4 times in a row without reason he just started shooting me glad the 5th time he let me live cause the checkpoint was right in the gunshop If you refuse to retry a mission then the game doesn't let you just start over from the beginning you gotta drive away a certain distance first en then drive back to retry. Wtf is this?! That is awful!So what are the shooting controlls like then?Really bad movement is stiff and the animations take really long characters sometimes just ragdoll randomly and you take damage. The shooting is cover shooting which is lazy and boring sit behind wall find enemy shoot them repeat.Are the missions interesting? NoIs the story interesting? To me it isn't it's just a bank robber who goes back into business which is unoriginall.It's about a guy in the hood which is cringy to me with characters walking up to him trying not to be racist and talking to him in his way I cringe to death.And a bald guy in the desert who shoots rednecks and s. Very interesting (slow clap)The game is filled to the brink with all sorts of mechanics but none of them are any good. They are all boring and/or stupid.Then there's the multiplayer a hacker infested horrible matchmakeing mess. People getting banned for no reason all over the place.Also there's terrible micro transactions in a 30 euro game. (was 60 for a long time)What about modding then? This is a pc gta game right?Modding was banned by take2 you guys!!What if I play this game with my friends on a private server?Well than can at least be fun problem is this game is really expensive.The only option I can think of on if you want chaotic sandbox silly coop with friends without each spending 60 euros on a broken game is Saints Row the third sure the game is smaller and sillier but it's way cheaper. Edit I tried to play this game with friends but the ui is so terrible it took us longer to get on the same server then to realise that it doesn't work with lots of disconnects and overblown ui that we don't know what we can do.Summary this game! Boring single player with bad level design every mechanic is boring/stupid. The multiplayer is mess with hackers bans and horrible matchmaking And the game is really expensive,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't buy this game unless you've got enough time to spend on one game. demanding on older hardware and thus sometimes laggy or not loading everything on time. can't buy online seperately from offline version of the game (I only want to play with friends not alone) consumes about 60 GB of memoryWho I would recommend to buying this game open world and modern gangster fans people with ENOUGH TIME.

Besides the annoying preloading encrypting thing that alot of the negative reviews are talking about it is awesome (Also the encrypting problem is volvo not R* geniuses) Although I love it this game is not for everyone. I will not say go buy it or anything. If you want it buy it if not don't you will miss out on one of the best game in a long time. Like video games as a whole long. Also if you don't buy it it is ok because there are millions of others to play with. Lawl kek.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-22,3,1,178,False,Recommended,"Многие игроки ждали эту игру с нетерпением так как ее дату выхода неоднократно переносили. Вот она вышла и я тоже не исключение поиграл в нее и от игры остались неплохие впечатления. Конечно же у игры есть свои минусы но плюсов намного больше. Игра ""GTA 5"" была разработана студией ""Rockstar North"" а выпущена ""Rockstar Games"" и поразила не мало игроков.О игре рассказывать можно очень много так как она разнообразная. Сюжет у игры очень интересный и развивается по ходу игры рассказывать о нем нет смысла так как играть потом будет не так интересно. Игра представляет собой открытый мир в котором делать можно все что пожелаете. В управление игроку дается три персонажа за каждого из которых можно играть и выбирать в любой момент игры не считая миссий. По ходу прохождения игры в некоторых миссиях нужно будет играть различными персонажами что очень интересно. Например взяли вашего напарника в плен переключились на другого персонажа и легко спасли его. Очень интересно сделали то что когда переключаешь на другого персонажа он не стоит там где вы закончили играть с ним в последний раз а занимается свои каким нибудь делом.У каждого персонажа будут свои определенные миссии которые вы не сможете пройти другим персонажем. Также будут доступны дополнительные миссии которые также очень интересно проходить. По мимо всех миссий в игре можно развивать каждого персонажа например бегать стрелять в тире и многое многое другое. Заняться в игре по мимо основных миссий есть чем.Очень понравился вид от первого лица в перестрелках можно переключаться и получится как будто играешь в шутер. Там уже на любителя.Графика в игре очень красивая и приятная мне понравилась. Присутствует смена дня и ночи очень красочно смотрится закат.Теперь расскажу немного о минусах игры которые мне не понравились. Когда ездишь на машинах как бы думаешь что можно сносить все подряд но нет бывают попадаются столбы которые без проблем сносишь а есть маленькие столбики которые невозможно снести. Вот эти моменты не очень понравились так как иногда в погонях некоторые предметы которые думаешь снесутся без проблем наоборот тормозят тебя.Также очень неудобно это конечно же что нет русской озвучки без нее очень тяжеловато потому что в основном смотришь только ролики а так когда идет бой или едешь на задании читать просто не успеваешь. Пытался пару раз читать но часто врубаешься и вообще получается неразбериха.Несмотря на эти мелкие минусы мне игра сильно понравилась очень веселая задорная и сильно затягивает своим сюжетом. Рекомендую ознакомиться так как игра достойна своего внимания.",Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar is one of the devs out there that can still be counted on The graphics are great especially in first person. The story is very well done and multiplayer is fantastic. Heists missions races TDM parachuting and alot more will keep you busy online. There are a few minor negatives however the occasional crash is annoying lots of idiots online sadly but thats in every game these days. There is a pretty good variety of weapons but a few more could be added (and hopefully will be) and a sort of price inflation system could help with the more OP guns as alot of people just run around with a stinger that locks on.... makes aircraft (especially helicopters) pretty much useless against other players which is really upsetting. In the end I give story mode 9/10 and Multiplayer 9/10 This game is easily worth the money and a must own!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-04,1,1,277,False,Recommended,"I enjoy this video gameA lot of the reasons behind peoples poor reviews are Historical inaccuracies which is stupid... if your gameplay experience is let down because there is a female black nazi soldier in your online multiplayer game maybe a history degree is more your idea of fun... or perhaps dino D Day Poor clientside performance I personally havent had an issue but most people seem to agree that DX12 is the main problem behind this Short campaign its COD what did you expect? get Wolfenstein instead Same old COD I didn't like Infinate Warefare and thought BO3 was okay. This game is different enought to define itself and also differs from the old World at War and Black Ops 1 in more than just graphics. Its taken some of the best aspects from recent COD (weapon loadouts system) and worst aspects (I hate lootcrates...) but the game stands on its own feet. Poor servers this one is a fair reason the game has had some issues with matchmaking and server stability I've haed a couple ""could not connect to server""'s and some elastic banding but I haven't been kicked out of any games.I like this game The online gunplay is enjoyable The divisions system is interesting I feel like prestige finally matters It runs well for me (i7 4770s GTX 960 16GB DDR3) Zombies seems interesting (so far I've played the prologue) Character customization makes me feel like more than a green blur. Call of Duty's formula is always pretty fun The maps this year have been very enjoyable so far The game encourages you to make a loadout around your own playstyle which helps you not to feel like you're being cucked by snipers 24/7Things I dont quite care for Day 1 DLC is scummy... #Free Carantan Lootboxes frustrate me The 'HeadQuarters' Seems to be there for the sake of it and adds nothing to gameplay Lack of modes at launch bring me gun game!Things I'd like to suggest Bring me gun game We've had Normal/Hardcore/Barebones before I'd like mic only lobbies for strategic players? Miss me with that Esports formula tho If you want a historically accurate game read the extended details for places and events in assassins creed 2 through to revelations you party animalI bought this game in fear after Infinate warfare and I have no regretsPS I'm not even very good at the game and I enjoy it KD 0.67I don't think I'm a 'cod kid ' I didnt enjoy Black ops 2 Modern Warfare 1/2/3 or infinate warfareIf you couldn't tell I dont like infinate warfareDon't post bad reviews on a game because your potato PC cant run it shoutout to ObfuscatedJava and his 883 hours in WarThunderThis is a Call of Duty World War 2 review for a friend i don't own the game... you're welcome GTA5 also... stop making cost alot... fix your game &lt 3",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-27,1,1,1163,False,Recommended,"I really wish there was a ""neutral"" option for reviews since there isn't I must vote yes. The PC version is good and fun to play with friends the only bad parts are is that for one you have to be conntected to the internet to sign into social club before it launches GTA 5 even to play single player. I know this is to stop people from pirating the game but it just sucks if I'm somewhere else and have an hour to kill but no internet and can't play GTA 5.The second issue is the online. Don't expect the online to be fun like the PS4 or Xbox One. People use trainers to cheat their money and even just spawn kill players by using an instant kill cheat on all players showing a victim as the killer of all the players in the server. If that's not bad they can set someone on fire and never take it off causing them to burn to death each time they spawn.All in all the game itself is fine just the people with trainers and as stated by others the servers normally just explode on itself and disconnects you from public servers.But the online is fun if you can get three to five friends to play on a private lobby.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-13,0,0,136,False,Recommended,"GTA V is a game I played on both Xbox 360 and on PC. The PC version is so far ahead of the last gen version it's mindblowing considering how GTA V on Xbox 360 was absolutly pushing the systems capabilities to it's max. This is a generation defining game and a definite must play for anyone who enjoys any sort of ""fun"". This is one of the most graphically pleasing games I have ever played even on medium graphics. The story can be a bit Cliche at times and is definetly not a Bioshock Infinite but certainly contains compatant story telling by Rockstae and has a satisfying ending and alot of hilarious moments. The gameplay is just dumb fun it's hard to explain in words you just have to exeperiance the fun of racing through Los Santos in your pimped out Zentorno at 100mph while drunk high and with Cops on your tail beacause you just murdered a NPC that cut you off on the freeway. Audio wise we are lucky that the Rockstar dev team completly re did the radio with alot of newer hits and a Self Radio function to put your music in the game. GTA does also have it's problems with the main one honestly being the time spent on loading screens. I have immensly enjoyed this game and it was certainly worth the wait for the game to grace us with it's presense on PC. Just look at my hours at the time of writing this review i am at about 91.4 hours and I have enjoyed every minute of it including the 10 of those hours I spent on loading screens. This is a truly masterful display by Rockstar that dosn't leave you much to complain about you will definetly get your moneys worth on this purchase. To sum it all up so I can go back to playing GTA is that its an amazing game that you will sink amazing amounts of your life into. Final Verdict 9.1/10",Grand Theft Auto V

Online however has gone down hill since the releasing of these expansions. I had at least $1mill that I had earned myself fairly but someone modded over $30 mill into my account. Obviously was out of my control so Rockstar was like ""Hey we'll take all of that and only give you $70k."" It still pisses me off to this day but I think Rockstar needs to monitor their a little bit better. Other then that though I've played many games with my friends and we always seem to have a blast. Buy it at least for the story mode and hopefully over time Rockstar will fix these stupid modders/hackers.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-08,0,0,110,False,Not Recommended,What can I say? It's GTA. It's one of the major titans of the gaming industry. Anyone who's played any game has heard about GTA. Sadly GTA V is crap. Its Single Player is so boring I never finished it. It's major selling point the online part is ruined. If its not hackers or random acts of killings from rockets and bombs its the disappointing money system that drags it down. Or it might just be the hours upon hours of loading time. You boot up the game and then you have to wait atleast 5 minutes before you can control your character.I've played a bit recently (8.7.17) and I havent come across that many hackers anymore but I did meet a few a couple of days ago. There's still people standing on streetcorners with RPGs shooting at you as soon as you try to drive near them. There's no reason they just shoot you. Instantly. and your car. Now the money system is the most corrupt and iest system I've seen in a game in a while. If you spend about one hour doing a full heist you'll earn something between 150 000 300 000. A reasonably good car costs atleast 500 000. And that's just the base car. Then you want to spruce it up a bit oh wait... you gotta be lvl 100 to access the entire upgrade system. Want that cool purple color? lol! nope. lvl 73 plz. Turbo? lvl 100. Engine lvl 4? lvl 70. And ofc you can buy in game money... at a ridicoulus price. If you want a new and awesome car prepare to spend many many many hours grinding or buy several shark cards. Nope this game is just not worth it. They should have drasticly reduced the LVL lock on car upgrades and either increased the money you recieve for heists and other fun stuff or decreased the costs of everything. And also fixed the 5 hour long loading time. You can't even tab out to watch youtube while waiting for the loadingscreen... the game just pauses then. if you want this game please just wait for it to be on sale so you dont have to spend much to get it. Oh and also it runs on PS4.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-21,0,0,181,False,Recommended,The single player campaign has an excellent storyline with good character development.However the campaign itself is fairly lengthy and you may feel that it drags on at times but overall I was happy with the overall experience.The multiplayer component is also a nice feature where you can do heists play several different mini games or just explore the streets of Los Santos.It can be a bit annoying to find a full lobby for heists though and one person can majorly screw everyone else on the crew so I'd recommend playing with friends instead of randoms.Another issue is that you essentially have to join a new server after every activity (heists racing etc.) which takes an extremely long time to load. You may also be forced to load into a new server if a person leaves halfway through a heist mission. As a result staying on the same public servers may be a bit annoying.Unfortunately I agree with many others that the first person view is completely unusable.Nevertheless I enjoyed my time with this game.TL DR Good single player campaign but netcode for multiplayer isn't that great.Also needs FOV slider.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-13,0,0,1581,False,Recommended,GTAO is one of the least competitive games I've ever invested reasonable time in.Everything is blueshelled to hell. Rockstar seems to release updates with content so expensive you can only get it through either in app purchases or stupid amounts of Heists grinding. With that said there's just something beautiful about this game. Maybe it's the ability to shoot up Groove Street Families from a Green Sabre in glorious HD or maybe it's that hustla dolla dolla bills feeling you can only get while looking at Los Santos from your yacht. I don't know. But I've spent over 500 hours pretty much exclusively in GTAOnline and I don't regret it one bit. While there are alot of annoying things other than that it's just stupid fun.Storymode is definetely worse than the old games like San Andreas yet it's still fine.

2016-12-22,0,0,591,False,Not Recommended,I've played Grand Theft Auto ever since it first came out on Xbox 360 in 2013. I ve also played it for dozens of hours on the Xbox One and I ve played it for 396 hours on the PC. It s safe to say that I enjoy various parts of this game. Unfortunately I will have to write a critical review of the things which I believe would make me not recommend the game in the hopes that Rockstar will listen and improve these things in GTA 6.I will break down this review into segments to make it easier for people to read Story Mode The GTA 5 Story Mode is fun keeps you busy and there are plenty of things for you to do. The storyline is in my opinion not as great as the previous Grand Theft Auto games but nonetheless it s still good. The character switching makes the story a little more fun as it s not just one storyline but it s each person s individual story coming together which I believe makes it more interesting than on the previous games where you just play as Niko for example.During the game there loads of side missions and there are approximately 60ish main missions to do. The missions take some time to do compared to many other games where I can finish it within a day. There are certain things that I believe Rockstar could have done better on which may make you reconsider buying this for the Story Mode. On Red Dead and San Andreas you felt like you had to work your way up to something. Unfortunately on GTA 5 you get everything there is at the last few missions there is not much of a feeling of achieving something. I feel like they could have expanded the menu where it tells you how much Stamina you have gained to way more things I believe that they rushed this part of the game as you seem to unlock pretty much nearly everything at the end of the game. What you unlock at the end isn t that much special either. You unlock the ability to buy garages and businesses that keep a flow of money through but there seems to be nothing else to do after that. Other than earning money to buy cars what exactly can you do with that money? And aren t there are many more fun ways to make money once you ve done all the missions on GTA Single Player? San Andreas had Casinos. Also you would start off skinny and then become muscly at the end. There was a feeling of achieving something and the money that you gained felt more important. I believe this feeling could have been replicated on both GTA Online and Story Mode. Graphics and basic game functionality The Graphical look of this game is incredible and seems to be more compatible with PC than the previous games. Most of the vehicles feel nice to drive in and there are plenty of options for graphical customization. The framerate is also more stable than GTA 4 which for me was terrible on PC. It also doesn t require Windows LIVE which was an abomination to say the least. Rockstar Social Club s drop down menu isn t too bad but I would prefer a proper in game menu to do all those things which make more sense and would be easily integrated but this isn t much of a big deal to many. GTA Online GTA Online to say the least is a complete mess. It feels like Rockstar has turned this game into a cash cow with GTA Online. The thing that made GTA 4 fun was the ability to mess around and do anything you please even modded sessions and you got to admit were pretty good. GTA 4 sort of felt like you were freer in the things that you want to do. I don t believe a game like this should be so strict on what you can and can t do at least without providing alternative options. The good thing about GTA Online is that they keep updating it to give you more things to do. The sad thing is that everything costs so much. It costs 4 million to get the highest Maze Bank but 10 million+ (approximately) to get all the extensions. To many this may not seem much but because the payouts are so small for the missions that you do this is an absolute joke. Many people will not be able to enjoy fully what GTA Online has to offer and if you have daily responsibilities in your life like School or Work you simply will never be able to get all these things unless you spend hundreds of real life money on Shark Cards. Right now GTA Online sort of feels like a money making machine. Grinding to get money for various apartments cars warehouses offices vehicle warehouses cost so much. After you spend loads on the Maze Bank you have to buy a good vehicle warehouse to be able to store vehicles with yet more in game money. These warehouses cost an extra 1.5 2 million+. When you consider that the average payout for a mission is 20 000 how are you supposed to achieve this exactly? This is not easy to earn and anyone who tells you that it is are lying complete fanboys with more money than sense or are stupid or they are all of the above.Even with the hours I ve spent on this game I still don t have that much to show for it. Minus some of the things that I brought with shark cards which was stupid and since then I ve become angrier and fed up with microtransactions. If you grind for as long as I have you simply won t get anything extra. GTA Online Community Now down to the community. The GTA Online Community both on YouTube and on each platform are completely brain dead and are not very friendly people at all. There have always been griefers (if that s the right word) on GTA since GTA 4 but I thought if Rockstar is going to make it stricter online that they d at least utilise the cheater pool like they said they would. Especially when this game involves in game currency and an attempt to seem realistic compared to previous games.The Grand Theft Auto community is probably the stupidest people I have ever witnessed and most of the time when you re playing GTA grinding hard to get some money there is some retard in jet spending hours upon hours blowing up random people who are grinding for a measly 20k. Rockstar doesn't even put them in the cheater pool and sometimes when your car gets blown up you re the one who has to pay for it as Mors Mutual Insurance messes up.Also the GTA community on the Steam forums acts like cultists. They spend more time on the forums celebrating people being banned (even some falsely which by the way that does happen and is possible with Ai technology which Rockstar uses) than actually giving feedback to Rockstar about their game. They are entirely happy to be completely screwed with microtransactions and they deserve it if they can t criticise a company.http //steamcommunity.com/app/271590/discussions/0/133258593402273075/I decided to test this. They fell for the bait. No I haven t been banned or modded achievements. I do not recommend this game if you re looking for something similar to GTA 4 s online mode. I believe what Rockstar should have done is utilise their cheater pool for people who want to mess around blow up people use mods etc. so they have a GTA 4 sort of feel and then used the primary servers for people who want to do earn money work with people etc.I believe this would have levelled the game out and attracted way more people to stay in the game. I don't recommend this game to people who want to play multiplayer which is probably most of you but I do if you want to play singleplayer and singleplayer mods. I hope this review helps you to make a decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,0,0,67,False,Recommended,I was very happy when GTA5 was released on PC. Honestly I had lost all my hopes after a year or so for a PC port. In the end we got it after all.Storywisely the game is focused around 3 people and you can play them all and change between them anytime on the fly. This is quite unique for a open world game of that sort. Also each of the characters is very interesting and charming with additional backstory. Franklin is the typical Carl Johnson. Trevor is the fu**** up crazy hobo redneck kind of guy. And Michael is the lazy and rich family dad. Trever and Michael had a heist backstory where they (or more like Michael only) stole a lot of money. Michael lived a nice life in luxury. Trevor not so much. If it would have been up to Michael he hoped to never meet Trevor again which is also because Trevor believed Michael is dead. Michael had all the money. Michael runs into money problems one day and decides to make another heist to get more money. He meets Franklin which is a total stranger to him until this point and plans with him and another old heist mate a new heist. Well then suddenly Trevor shows up. The rest is for you to find out. All I can say that all have amazingly entertaining quests and the story is crazy as hell.The gameplay is typical for a GTA game. It probably has the biggest amount of content of all the games. Only San Andreas rivals it. You can do all kinds of stuff from walking your dog (even with a smartphone app) to going on a date. At least you don't need to go bowling with Roman anymore. Screw you Roman! One downside is that like pretty much all games of this sort the game is absolutely boring once you did the main story and sidequests. There isn't much to do after it unless you want to meet your friends all the time and do always the same things. Also some of the missions are heavily scripted and leave no real freedom on how to solve them. The flight controls on keyboard and mouse are really terrible. Way too complex couldn't they just take simple controls like in the Just Cause series? With a controller I didn't have many problems. In the end I recommend you to play the game with a controller anyway.The map is pretty much based on San Andreas. Some changes and new places here and there though. Also for the first time you can go fully submerged and explore the depth of the ocean! There is even a quest where you have to collect barels from the ocean. Other environments like the county or forests look absolutely beautiful! The desert is there of course too! Add to this giant lively cities full of citizens. GTA is one of the few games which really manage to create a lively world around you. Most NPCs in such games feel like bots but in GTA they always had the special edge.The graphics and the PC version in general is absolutely top notch! This is the first time where I can really say that Rockstar Games did a good PC version. I was mostly disappointed from the ports of the past. There are even advanced settings to higher the view distance even further. Those settings are only for the absolute highend rigs!GTA5 also comes with a Multiplayer part. I honestly only played it a couple of hours when it came out. What I saw was a MP mostly overrun by trolls hackers and kids. Guess its not avoidable anymore nowadays especially with a game series like GTA. What absolutely killed my fun was getting tons of money from random hackers. I even heard that Rockstar bans people for no reason because of this. Get your sh** together Rockstar! However the MP is pretty good and a lot of fun if you have good friends to play with. Especially the heists are an absolute pinnacle of fun. This moment when some mate fu*** up the heist because he isn't able to press F to exit the motorbike while rushing down a cliff. Sadly the MP also comes with the micro transactions which every dev puts into their games nowadays to make the most of money. It is not that bad with GTA5 though. I can say its pretty acceptable.The game is also moddable but only to some extent like with all GTA games. Also Rockstar doesn't seem to like this in general and there was and still is a lot of controversy about this topic. For some time a primary modding tool was completely banned from being used. From what I am gathering its fine to mod the SP now but not the MP which is totally understandable. Rockstars stance is very anti consumer friendly but honestly I wouldn't expect less from them. Its obvious they mostly care about casual console peasants and not PC gamers. I don't even think that the next Red Dead Redemption will come to PC. Well Rockstars loss but since they only care about money and give a damn about the community. I really dislike them. Not as bad as EA or Activision but still far away from being good.Positive aspects Entertaining story Charming characters Giant world with many interesting places Very good PC port with many graphic settings and good graphics in general Well made weather and day/night system For the first time you can go undersea and explore the ocean floor Entertaining multiplayer with friends No bowling with Roman anymore First person view option! Very good car controls Amazing English localisation Cool radio music Balanced difficultyNeutral aspects Microtransactions which are acceptable and optional but overpriced... I personally think that many of the missions are too heavily scripted no freedom feels like CoD oftenNegative aspects The SP can get quite boring after the main story Multiplayer is overrun by hackers trolls and kids Rockstar has a anti consumer friendly stance and bans people for no reason and has a problem with modding Terrible flight controls with keyboard and mouse took me WAY too long to land the damn chopper in one mission Third party Rockstar Games clubI think that GTA5 is a good game. Hell I paid fullprice for it at launch on PC. I still think it was worth the money and this means something. HOWEVER I think the game is overhyped. Yes it has tons of positive aspects but for someone like me who is less of an casual and wants to have for example more freedom in a game it can be kind of meh just following the map marker to my mission place kill all the hostiles followed by a cutscene and some driving back to another place. Because its mostly always like that. At least the game throws in different gameplay mechanics from time to time such as stealth missions. I personally get bored by casualized gameplay mechanics. Guess I am too old. The story and world alone is worth the money in my book. Especially the characters will forever be memorable for the videogame history. Also the PC version is very well executed. If you have good friends the MP can be a lot of fun. At the same time the MP can be a pain in the *** especially for loners. I often just think that GTA5 lacks a bit of gameplay fun sometimes. I would even go that far and say that certain aspects about other games such as Just Cause or Sleeping Dogs are better. Especially Sleeping Dogs is definitely better for me then GTA5. Maybe not story or persona wisely but the whole package just seems better to me. I definitely have to replay the game once I have some time for it.Rating 8 5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

It solely exists as Rockstars way of creating a more competitive PVP environment that creates more stress by breaking your finger by mashing the keyboard after you've just been absolutely destroyed in an intense one sided PVP fight by a scrub who you find out has another 250% health ontop of his current so it appears he's legit and taking damage.Speaking of PVP the Freeroam PVP has turned into a Homing Rocket fest.You cannot counter a Homing Rocket weaponized vehicle with one of your defence less cars with a sub machine gun efficently and because of this nobody uses anything other than Homing Rocket vehicles.1 hit kills everytime you encounter an enemy is really starting to me off.What ever happened to Guns?

2016-10-27,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,"6/10 Second biggest game letdown to me.I know this game came out a very long time ago but I figured I'd put my two cents in. This game is #2 on my biggest videogame letdown list right behind Fallout 4 for those who care. Now it's not a bad game it's just average. It went backwards on most aspects from GTA 4. A short example of this game is it's called GTA but you have to buy cars pay insurance and buy houses. It's understandable ad comical. My biggest pet peeve is THIS IS NOT RED DEAD REDEMPTION! This game adopted all the aspects of that game to get rid of that iconic GTA feel. From the dumb weapon wheel to the shooting mechanics. For example GTA 4 ""cop killer"" was a classic thing to do with friends in free roam. In GTA 5 you have no health and the cops are Navy SEALs that's not as fun for most people. Also just doing stupid stuffv around the city and living through it with an unreal amount of health is hilarious. This game doesn't have that as much. Along with poor physics not really amazing graphics and a massive map. With 1 major crafted city and other things you'll never go to because everything relevant is in LS. The reason why GTA 4 was so unique is its pure gameplay. People could get bored but always came back to have a good time with friends. It didn't have microtransactions to force you to grind or pay X amount of money to get Y.I like to think they add all these free DLC's to say sorry.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,If you're interested in GTA V only for the singleplayer read some reviews and decide for yourself if you want to buy this game. But if you're like me and mostly interested in playing online with your friends then I have to caution you against buying this game in the state it currently is in. Online is... a frustrating experience to say the least. It's almost impossible to stay in the same game session as your friends and joining the same session as your friend after you've been separated can be a sisyphean task as the game lets you look at the map from above for a few minutes before you get told whether you're getting through or not. If it fails you get the pleasure of spending a few more minutes loading an empty session just for yourself and then you can do the same thing over again. Sometimes the game will even send you back into singleplayer without any explanation.But you don't have to be in the same session to play together you might say. You can join a heist and then invite your friends to join assuming it doesn't fill up before they can get in or the same connection issues that plague the rest of the online experience doesn't pop in like a drunken clown at a birthday party. If you want a game you can play together with your friends online my suggestion to you would be to buy another game or wait until Rockstar fixes the online portions of this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-04,1,3,1,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre ordering games but I made one exception this year for GTA and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch because the game is ridiculously big. I'm running it at 60 90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on ""high"" except for the advanced options which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680 which is a few years old now so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.You can play GTA in first or third person mode and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting swimming walking can also be done in first person so you can just pick what you like the best.If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world but also in certain quests. Michael Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character Niko.GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single player experience but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run but to play free roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12 so that might refresh things even more.I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it at least for the driving. You can enable auto aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit ""Z"" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard mouse and controller so thats really good but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed so I will just see GTA online as a plus.Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends whether your the single or multiplayer guy you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.",Grand Theft Auto V

If you plan on grinding missions for a couple of hours then get ready for lag low payouts and jerk offs who leave half way through. Free roam is just that.. free roam around a city doing.... well nothing really. In my experience you need friends to even have fun in both free roam and contact missions. Yesterday I attempted to do heist set ups with my friend and we kept failing because of the other teams incompetance. Later on while I was on call solo for heists we got to the end of a real heist and someone left. Boom 20 30 minutes gone.the character customization is impressive but the outcome always ends up with everyone looking ""soft"". Not even a leather jacket sunglasses and a beard could possibly make your character look tough. The unapealing amount of people wearing skin tight leopard print jeans is in the thousands as every missions/heist I join or make has at least one of these hipster s. Just wear normal clothes already. Unfortunately even with R*'s big anti cheat thing they've recently implemented I still see hackers often. Yesterday AGAIN I was in my garage where out of nowhere Jesus appears hugging my back. I promptly see its a hacker and brush him off. I hop on my motorcycle where suprisingly Jesus decides to ride and send my motorcycle out of my garage. Good bye Jesus. In that same lobby I saw Jesus dropping money bags. I left as soon as I could. Another funny hacker encounter was when this guy turned into a UFO and afkd in the clothing store so if you walked in you couldnt walk out witohut teleporting into the phantom world.

2015-04-13,4,3,343,False,Recommended,"Once upon a time in a realm called ""the internet"" not so far away yet so secluded there was a mad king. And the mad king used to be a peasant. That is why he's been discriminating any other monarchs and lords who called themselves ""the masterrace"". It's been a while and after a lot of pressure the king announced equality amongst ALL his people. All the peasants who laughed at the masterrace shook in fear hearing that the already superior lords would get the only thing that made them unique. But it was only a tease the masterrace prepearing for a feast got destroyed economically by the king who tricked them into paying for equality but denied them the service afterwards.The masterrace in it's glory wasn't fased though they survived the backstab and continued on living waiting for the promised sweet equality to happen. And then after years of anticipation the mad old king once again promised equality. This time it seemed more reasonable and the mad king even offered a reward for every lord that would support the king's campaign into achieving equality. And so it happened thousands upon thousands of members of the masterrace payed the king. Yet the king who managed to decieve the lords postponed equality once again.The masterrace now furious felt exploited like a cheap . Every lord in ""the steaming lands of a star made out of rock"" prepared for a riot. And after months of preparation days before the attack there it was again. The ultimate tease equality right beneath the masterrace's palm like eve's forbidden fruit. So tempting that riots were called to stop because of the hypnotizing countdown.And there it was. The peasants fear the masterrace's glory. The edict. The only thing that could make countries go to war and declare peace. GTA V the declaration of equality.

2018-02-04,5,8,30,False,Recommended,Let s review Grand Theft Auto V Let s face it this is one of the greatest video game franchise in the world It offers a literal new world of things to do and even if you have beaten the story line trust me it s only the beginning. Pros The game introduces 3 main characters and their story together. Here you are truly greeted with a deep characters development which is a great thing in gaming. You have a huge map and if you would walk from one side to the other you would take maybe a day a real day so make use of the huge arsenal of vehicles the game offers right there for you to take. A large array of missions spread out to all the 3 main characters with each one also offering side quests that make you take a break from the main story but also to have some real fun. After the story you enter the realm of the GTA V online and here is where the world you already knew expands immensely you have to create a new character a personal character and develop it based on your choices. Do jobs race other players this new world is your oyster. And if you just want to kick hookers in the face or just fly around in your private jet you can you have total freedom to do what you want. Many gaming modes from team deathmatchs to survivals from parachuting down a mountain and seeing who s better at it. Races on water land and air or why not all of them in the same race. Raids and the all time favorites Heist where you must plan your heist with your team and execute the stages of it until the ultimate conclusion. A huge gaming community with some offering to help and others not so much but you can always find someone to play with you or to just murder you in plain sight it will be a surprise most of the time. Its open to community built maps so you ll never run out of things to play or do because some gamers also like to build maps for other to enjoy and you ll have fun trying what craziness came from your fellow gamers. Want to run a motorcycle gang? Or buy a Bunker and start your own Gunrunning business hey do you want a Hangar to store your planes and start a smuggling ring? You can. The options are near endless and even you get near that end Rockstar keeps it fresh by introducing something else new and the cycle begins again. Or you can simple jump on your mini sub and explore the ocean and discover some of its secrets or bike to the top of mount Chiliad and maybe spot a wandering UFO. Cons The waiting time in lobby to gather enough players for a game sometimes can take a bit. Final Review GTA V is that special game that almost every gamer must have in their library. Starting in the great and well written storyline to the action packed content in the online mode. You can lose yourself in this game in a good way. And simply have fun. Or just invade a military base and watch for how long can you survive that s always a good challenge. This game deserves a 9 out 10 in my book of reviews and I simply can t wait what Rockstar will introduce next!Enjoy Guys and Girls and if this review helped you in any way please leave me a Thumbs up i would appreciate it immensely.

This is (probably) RockStar's first attempt on making an ONLINE mode with many many players on the same map of course something will go wrong give them a chance Im sure they'll mke it better next time if red dead redemtion 2 gets an online mode too!,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA Online is pretty fun once you get past the confusing UI and the painful lack of a good pathing system. It's just not a good Grand Theft Auto game. The singleplayer is lacking and suffers from being forcefully tossed between perspectives two of which only exist to flesh out the remaining and only remotely interesting one. It's the first Grand Theft Auto game where the online features are better than the singleplayer which might work for some people but I'd prefer it the other way around (read the story is bad in my opinion).I'd give it a mixed review if I could but being forced to decide between recommending it or not I choose not to.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-25,0,0,315,False,Not Recommended,!!!!WARNING BEFORE YOU BUY!!!! READ ALL OF THIS REVIEW!!!This game is loaded with bugs that prevent you from enjoying it. Example The biggest hiest The Pacific Standard where you rob the Union Depository. You go in and once you reach the vault to grab the cash it bugs out and will not allow you to collect the money thus preventing you from even finishing.This on top of lack of players lack of communication and other various bugs ends up being several hours wasted.Contacting customer support is near impossible leaving forum posts is basically pointless. This bug has been around over 3 months and still has not been fixed. There are at least 4 6 more that I know of.Other things are players cheat and mod their games. Basically if someone wanted to and mod they can make you fall through the world dieing over and over until you restart the game. Nothing gets done about this either.Other than that it is a great game love it be warned though you will encounter these issues and trying to get support will fall on deaf ears.,Grand Theft Auto V

The only thing that I dislike is the pricing in online mode. Like come on almost $400 000 dollars into one low rider then you have to spend more upgrading it like a 50 000 dollar turbo. That is my only problem with the game. I love the new Sultan. It is really fast and handles well and the turbo sound is incredible it also feels like a real turbocharged car with turbo lag. It starts off really slow then the turbo spools up and it takes off. Maybe its just my opinion but it sounds looks and feels amazing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,188,False,Recommended,Met a modder in my game gave me in game cash for free Spent it on guns a lot of guns.Soo far there aren't any rude hackers or modders in multiplayer as far as the other reviews says.It's actually nice to have nice modders / hackers who just plays around and have fun modding is just a part of the game and has always been since the older GTA games back in my day people even modded on GTA IV in the playstation 3 version online.And that was fun too ramps everywhere just endless fun After awhile GTA Online gets boring because they're forcing you to do heists and it tends to get really boring and annoying specially when you dont have a group of friends to play with rather than random lobby connectors who will leave randomly mid game for no reason those people are the worst.Another thing i want to mention is the amount of cancerous there is in the GTA ONLINE Community.If you even talk in voice chat in GTA V ONLINE someone whose australian or british will insult you and tell you to shut up while russians will just be friendly to you i met a lot of good russians in GTA Online and i love it Aussies &amp British people are by far the rudest.. they only care about themselves and do not have a self of respect if they were to do this in real life they would have been capped in the butt for being rude as hell.The only downside about GTA Online is the amount of loading time it takes to launch GTA Online They need to make a seperate thing for GTA Online so you can just not have too much loadings and don't force you into Singleplayer i suggest Rockstar to make some sort of lobby system where if you fail to connect online it will send you back to the GTA online lobby instead of singleplayer it will definitely makes things even more easier for everyone.If you want to make GTA Online good and not dead ever Be nice and don't be rude to people.I love russians Makes GTA fun again.P.S If you kill me while i'm in the streets ever relaxing.You will see your precious cars &amp your life blown to pieces because i will be hunting you down the moment you mess with me in my relaxing time in the world of GTA I'm your Assad.I have no Mercy to those who mess with me.Expect Explosions &amp Gas.UPDATE 2017 I don't care about mods or the modders that exists in the game i play GTA V entirely for fun &amp i quite enjoy the vanilla more than the modded versions of the games that exists &amp made by strangers which i rather not have malicious files thats most probably filled with things that could possibly get my private information.To all of you who are crying about the modding getting banned.Grow up there are hundreds of thousands of others who prefer the vanilla more than the modded.I'd say good that they banned mods they should stay offline where they belong.If you want to mod &amp combine the original game with your mods.You might as well just make an entirely new game that's similar to Grand Theft Auto.Then get sued by Rockstar.,Grand Theft Auto V

Yup.Do you randomly get banned for weeks or months at a time? Oh Yes everytime.This game is pretty great it has alot of potential and I am sad I cannot give it a thumbs up. But when they have a clearly flawed automated banning system I cannot support it at all.I have never modded never hacked never been given money never been given anything. So why is it a legitimate player would be banned for cheating/exploits? Because of a clearly flawed banning system in place.Does rockstar tell you why you were banned? Nah bro they got your money.Can a legitimate player appeal a ban? Nah bro they don't care and give you automated responses.Can you get help from public forums? Nah bro they all think your a hacker because Rockstar says so regardless of profile evidence displaying no crimes commited.In the end this is a great game with a garbage flawed banning system that does not work and will ban even legitimate players from playing.If I could I would get a refund because as of now they stole my money.Now I have been Perm banned after deleting the character that they kept banning and starting all over at level 1 they banned me at level 20 just because. I called Rockstar Support where they did nothing at all and were not helpful in the least. They couldn't tell me what I did wrong or how I could fix it.

Didnt care much about the single player.Multiplayer is a loading screen followed by you having to run towards a checkpoint so that a list of mini games pops up.Once the mini games list pops up you wait for 5 minutes for a bunch of noobs to slowly load in then you start shooting people mindlessly and that's it.There is no true role playing component to this game's multiplayer. Also the first person perspective (PC exclusive) is gimmicky. they only changed the camera position but the texture resolution was not improved for that perspective so it really just feels like a community made mod. It is bad.I can say much about the single player because it was too boring for me to even try finishing the first few missions.,Grand Theft Auto V

All the opportunities and stuff you can do makes me want to play this game all the time. Although it is a bit expensive it is worth it. It used to support modding very well so you could make great cinematic videos which you can still do but not as good. The days of modding in GTA is over.

2017-11-26,0,0,445,False,Recommended,After having over 700+ hours in this game on PS3 PS4 and PC I think its finally time to review this game FIrst I would like to say this games gives FREE DLC. While Shark Cards do cost real money your really don't need it. Rockstar constantly provide new jobs races and other different game modes where you can make tons of money. I suggest players invest in the CEO buissness since it has a stable pay grade with almost little effort. Aside from what they provide in game the game itself looks amazing. GTA5's open world is probably the best open word in any game. There is always something to do in online lobbies. From killing other players to participating in certin events the open world never runs out of things to do. In addition to that the graphics arew amazing. Any graphic card above a 780ti the graphics will look amazing. Althought one tip I can give users is that you should get really good RAM for this game. Its a huge game and the game requires lots of memory if you want smooth performance. My build includes a i5 4670k gtx970 8 gigs of RAM. With everything set to stock speeds I can average the game aroundf 50 50 FPS. If you don't want to read all that Im going to just list pros and cons.Pros FREE DLC OPEN WORLD AMAZING GRAPHICS EASY TO RANK UP ONLINE IN GAME MONEY IS EASY TO OBTAIN GAME DOSEN'T REQUIRE A SUPER COMPUTER TO RUNCons HAVING FASTER AND A LARGER AMOUNTS OF RAM IS NEEDED FOR SMOOTHER GAMEPLAY LOADING TIME IS LONG ONCE YOU HIT LEV EL 150+ YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR DLC TO GET NEW THINGS MODDERS CAN RUIN THE ONLINE EXPIRENCE SOMETIMES (although rockstar is good and taking them out),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-03,0,0,142,False,Recommended,Massive improvement over GTA 4 in many respects. There's still plenty of room for improvement however. Likes + Great variety of vehicles including bikes cars armoured vehicles helis and aircraft+ Some of the vehicles sound pretty decent and engine noise is linked directly to RPM rather than being a looping audio effect (SaintsRow3)+ First person driving is really awesome shame you can't change FOV though+ Mouse/Keyboard commands for driving are actually really good and i've not been using my controller at all+ Vehicle handling is much more fun imo than GTA4Dislikes Total lack of crouch button in exchange for horrible cover system still can't go prone Clunky controls Sluggish and unresponsive movement animations which I guess were created like that deliberately for immersion but suck for gameplay Combat is not the greatest enemies take way too much damage including direct headshots they always zerg rush you and they're super accurate even when you or they are moving at high speed Radio stations are absolute trash imo of course subjective but these ones are of very poor quality unless you like pop music. Vice City is vastly superior in this regard. Lack of custom character in single player lack of female character in single player lack of body customization in either single or online mode Police in this game are horrendous there's far too many of them they have infinite spawns including helicopters they zerg rush you like absolute morons and they home in on you when you're hiding yet should have no idea you were there.In summary this is well worth the money at the sale price. Decent story but you're forced to use the characters they designed and are forced to use specific characters to progress the storyline.

I definitely agree that mods are important and shouldnt be shut down in any way but I do have to admit Ive had this game for years and never used any mods. I dont have much total playtime because I also owned it on PS3 before the PS4/Xbone/PC version came out and played the hell out of the story mode already. The story mode seriously is incredible. If there is one gripe I have with this game it is that they pour all their resources into the GTA online(which is no longer an online mode for a GTA game but rather its own entity.) I would love for story DLCs like we got with GTAIV.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-26,0,0,1171,False,Recommended,I can't find enough words to describe this game. I'm just gonna say some quick and simple words to sum it up I have been playing this game since it was released on PS3 in 2013 and switched to PC in early 2016.Until this day I can't get enough of this game. I never get bored when I'm playing it. I always find something interesting to do and sometimes I even discover new things that I never heard about for the past 3 years.Let me talk about each portion of the game seperately Story Mode The story is insanely amazing! I love the gameplay and the way you can interact with people and objects. A huge variety of weapons and I just love each one of them. The graphics the weather bullet impacts explosions shadows water and all visual graphics are beautiful!GTA Online Massive online open world with tons of activities to do. You can play missions heists races deathmatches adversary modes capture and other awesome activities with up to 29 other persons. You can buy a huge variety of vehicles apartments and garages. You can own a yacht. And you can buy yourself an office and determine yourself as a CEO then you can buy and sell cargo and vehicles with the new import/export business. You can also fulfill your lifelong dream of owning a motorcycle club and then you can rule the streets of Los Santos and also own businesses to make even more money and make yourself the boss. You won't get enough of GTA Online as Rockstar always provide the game with new content that makes this game alive for as long as possible. And Rockstar has been giving us updates for the last 3 years which absolutely changed this game entirely.That's all I have to say for now. You just gotta play this game by yourself and see what it has to offer.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's pretty similar to previous games only the world is much much bigger the graphics are nicer and you can now do heists! If you are bored of GTA GTA V will not change your mind. It's basically the same formula. I just enjoy driving around listening to the radio and completing some missions every now and then.

2016-10-02,0,0,527,False,Recommended,"I recommend this game to any PC gamer looking to get their fix on the GTA world in the largest virtual city based on a real life location ever!It's really good besides it's nonstop swearing excessive blood and gore and the urge to kill everything in sight which I think is a compliment. Considering that this is the largest virtual city to date besides No Man's Sky (a game that I've been longing to play) but with that out of the way it's a massive open world game compared to other games out there like Destiny and vice versa but I am no IGN person here... so I will say this in only a few words as possible...""Damn. This is a big game.""There is so much to do you'll never have anything to do afterwards its pretty much only fun on PCs because of modding capabilities... and it's extensive modding community is above average at best but there are some pretty useful mods out there that catch your eye like openCamera (by the same people that made OpenIV the best modding solution out there). And there are also some fun ones like the Nuke mod that really caught my eye as soon as I saw it on the IGN fourms. But modding aside let's wrap up this review shall we...This is a very RAM consuming game it works best on high performance PCs while having a large render distance that's always a good thing.Here are the list of Good things about the game Large open world based title Extensive modding community is above average at best VERY addicting story line. Heists in story mode. Online capabilities.And now the cons Performance consuming at high render distances Ambient Occlusion Texture Quality etc. Gets very boring after a while on consoles or if you don't have good internet and can't download mods. GTA Online gets all updates not story mode. Can't play with mods online you'll get banned if you do.Altogether this review is totally based on experience I didn't want to attempt getting bannedfrom using mods but either way. This has more good than bad but I recommend having a very powerful computer on hand otherwise your in for a bumpy ride.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-30,0,0,177,False,Recommended,You should really buy this one on a sale as this game isnt exactly new any longer although it is a very nice game. So lets start with credibility I've finished the game to see all 3 endings and put 90 hours into multiplayer therefore I think I am reliable enough to review this game with high enough credibility.This game's story mode revolves around action in depth story and large final choices. The timing is perfect and the missions are very organised and constructed keeping the game very nice action packed and entertaining. This game features side quests I completed around half of these and can easily say that they are better and more interactive than a good majority of other in game missions from other games.Since I have spoken about single player features so far I'll go onto multiplayer. Your main focus in multiplayer is making money for more personalization and more fun you can also do more of side missions such as racing. Essentially you are having fun for the sake of getting more fun. Although as you can imagine it can get very grind y and frustrating at times so get a buddy to play with you. This game has also been cleaned of hackers so now no one will be destroying your games.I would move onto the problems of the game although none at all can be found in my game so far. I have a very low end PC and can run this game on 30 fps on the very lowest possible settings and to put that into more of perspective I can run evolve on the lowest settings lowest resolution at about 25 fps. So 30fps is very good on my PC. Definitely buy this game whether for online story or just to mess around.,Grand Theft Auto V

Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS 1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13 oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt flour and cocoa powder stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8"" x 8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled yet delicious mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn t work here since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits Billy",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-14,0,0,8,False,Recommended,This is the best Grand Theft Auto there is. The story is what you come for and is the best story anyone has written for this type of game. The characters are extreamly likeable and Michael is what makes this game. There is stuff to do but not so much and the game gives you free reign right from the start. First person mode makes the game harder and plays sometimes like a FPS which is nice.Alot of cars to drive and planes to fly help you get away from the cops. The poice are handled in a much different way for the first time requireing you to avoid there patrols when you are wanted. There is a stealth aspect and the writing is raunchy and rude and excellent. The best part of the game is the heists which give you multiple ways to do them with multiple characters. The gem heist is still my favorite.Do not buy this if Online is what you want because the community is straight cancer.,Grand Theft Auto V

I also have a gaming computer that isn't too high end I have a GTX 950 and I did not really expect it to run as well it does as I can barely play the Arma II Dayz mod without significant lag.

2016-02-25,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,The fundementals are there for this to be a great installment for GTA. But it falls way short. The story is terrible in single player mode. Seriously I can't shoot the guy who is doing my life? I have to back down from some jerk because he has a buddy with a baseball bat? I get pushed around by corrupt feds and then I have to torture somebody?! The story of this game is just completely awful.Oh well at least I can play multiplayer mode right? Well nope. It's hacked to death. Cheaters pretty much rule the multiplayer mode so you might as well not even bother. This company does not know how to make pc games anymore and I'm done. This game was worth maybe 20 bucks for the time I've gotten out of it. Anyway I'm uninstalling and I doubt I will ever play it again. You suck Rockstar. You really suck!Oh and you rockstar social club. Holy this is the last rockstar game I buy.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar has very specific TOS and if you we're ""randomly"" banned it probably wasn't as random as you think so go ahead and whine away your problems because you aren't as smart as some people. Otherwise the game is quite flawless grinding is not as much a problem as people complain it is so long as you have friends to grind with it's quite fun. Shark Cards is probably the communities most frequently used broken record. Honestly nobody buys Shark Cards except for youtubers to give away (supposedly) to their fans. Onto another broken record modders. They really aren't as prevalent as people say they are as of writing this review I have 800+ hours in the game and I only rarely see modders and when I do see them they usually mind their own business.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-20,0,0,277,False,Recommended,Its a new GTA nuff saidMany argue about DRM multiplayer problems and so on but guess what Those issues where there in the previous title as well.I bought the game for full price which I admit was a bit high but the fact that I spent over 100 hours on this game makes it worth the money. And it seems like Rockstar knows that as it is still sold for full price ever since the release.Much like on other GTA titles you play again as a psychopath who managed to get a gun even after his 3rd police shoot out followed by near death expirience. I guess 'murica yeah. Not only this but it allows you to do this as three different people. Take your pick it's not like you won't kill indicriminately anyways. But would you rather do it with cars guns or just... brutal I guess?So if you need a timout after your 7th hooker followed by golfcart rampage go and visit GTA Online where you can play with others like yourself and kill these guys instead of NPC's. That is if you're not just getting in game by a russian player who afterwards dropped a billion dollar on you and flew away in his sailboat. Believe it or not this happens OFTEN.All in all the game really made the hilarious mess that is GTA IV even better pushing forward technology and marketing.This title deserves everything it gets. Starting fights and get random people arrested is still as much fun as it was 7 years ago (7 YEARS?! I'm getting too old for this sh*t),Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-15,0,0,90,False,Not Recommended,This game is more than a few steps backwards for the franchise. The driving experience GTA 4 was amazing and took seconds to master. In this one your all over the place and the car even slides all on its own. Watch close when you break you'll see it!Also this game simply does not work with certain missions no matter what you do it will not function as they are suppose to and you cannot complete. I'm writing this in August some four months after release and its still not working? What does this say about the developers? They should all be sacked every single one of them. More over they have the edacity to ask for 40 for this crap. That's Amazing!Its not very often that I blame steam for the shody dodgy work of developers but in this case I think that steam should remove this crap from their games listing as not being able to play it mounts to nothing more than fraud!Not to mention all their in game micro transactions for in game money.

If they had of taken that stance since launch i never would have bought GTA V as without mods it's crap and not at all fun.... its a shame after playing thier previous GTA titles to see the franchise sink to this level. The complete stupidity of them banning single player mods ... the only think that made their game fun/playable especially considering they were too lazy/inept to make the game better in the first place and needed modders to fix there game. Without modders the GTA series would not even be remotly as popular as it is. If enough people stop buying games from them they'll have to rethink they way the treat thier customers or go bust.GTA V is a waste of space. the game is without mods and makes you activate it again every second week just to play offline the dumb bastards.,Grand Theft Auto V

The missions are fun and you really won't get bored playing the story mode. You can do anything you ever wanted the game's graphics are great. Great selections of vehicles (cars planes bikes boats) amazing Director mode and cool customizations. Overall the single player experience is GREAT.GTA Online GTA Online is a huge grind. Super cars facilities weaponized vehicles and other cool stuff you might want to have costs an exorbitant amount of money. Getting this money via grinding heists and missions will take a lot of time especially if you don't have any friends to help you. Hackers are also everywhere in this game. They will constantly troll you and have unlimited money. And for some reason these hackers are never caught. Moreover the anti cheat system oftens bans innocent people for no reason at all. Why waste so much time in this game if you can just hack it and gain infinite money and god mode? The Online mode is basically constant grinding and frustration. All the ""new"" updates in GTA Online are designed to milk more money off of the players in an already dying game because they only bring more and more cars and weaponized vehicles that are priced very expensively.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-27,0,0,185,False,Recommended,I definitely am glad that I waited to review this title because had you asked me a year ago or even a few months ago I would have given it flying stars. However the honeymoon period is over folks... And I do have a lot of things that I could say about this title that wouldn't leave the reader too infatuated. However this is not one of those reviews that lumbers on like a yeti on a warm day. Now that being said I would like to tell you that yes this game is probably still worth the $60 that they charge and that I have in fact bought this game three times. Once for 360 once for PC and yet again for XBOX ONE. This game is exciting amusing and rediculous. It is a ton of fun to play with or without friends yes yes I'm sure you've heard this all before. So before I go I would like to tell you the $#!% that I have had to put up with when playing this damn game. #1 The uncertainty of whether or not the servers are up albeit the fact that this was more of an issue in 2013 the issues still persist today.#2 The uncertainty of whether or not Rockstar Social Club is up yup I am currently not able to play this game due to this issue and I have encountered it several times in the past. This one really pisses me off.#3 People are $$holes that's not the game's fault but the game certainly enables them to be terrible if they wish.#4 This game is guaranteed to you off. It will happen whether it be because the game isn't working or because it's inability to work properly in the first place.#5 Do not expect to keep anything you earn in online play.That is my rant enjoy the game because undoubtedly you've already bought it.#6 You can't transfer your multiplayer character to more than two devices... C'mon Rockstar you greedy f# %s...,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-19,0,0,474,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is lacking in a lot of features and rather than improving the game play mechanics of the previous successors they made it worse and more friendly to casuals taking every moment to handhold players rather than having them actually using skills picked up throught the game. I mean I can't tell you how many times I've abused the gun bash attack on other players online and on npcs on single player it can kill them in 1 hit unless they're in a fighting stance with any melee weapon(5 hits but they get stuck in the hit stun animation and can't do jack sh it due to the fact that you can't block at all and can't dodge gun bashing unlike other melee attacks).Melee is literally garbage(can't block attacks only dodge you're character kicks too much fight stances make you like Quasimodo was having an epileptic fit in a bar brawl the animations look like they hired the talentend animators from bad rats even though R* has the shekels for mo cap animations I can go on all day). guns are also horrid since they do jack sh it in damage compared to just smacking them with the gun and lack in a variety of attachments(the ones you do get are flat out upgrades instead of having actual advantages/disadvantages that make the player choose between what he wants for a gun) and the firearm choices themselves are just ether novelty or complete upgrades rather than each weapon feeling unique and having it's own pros/cons. the story is mediocre at best compared to IV(decent good but had it's flaws) the physic's were a set back compared to RDR GTA IV and the ""Max Payne"" game that was just a copypasta of man on fire just with brazil instead of mexico and max payne replacing gorrlia grodd in human clothing. You can't even buy all the online clothes and hairstyles for single player since we'll gotta have the goyim buy sharkcards for virtual items that won't matter in life. Online character creator is joke since saints row did a much better job with that than GTA online(literally a parent system and a box slider that takes an eternity to make you're character look the way you want him too and limited customization on facial features body mass you know the stuff that saints row's 1 4 got right. Because here at rockstar we choose to hire 3rd worlders who don't know about the existance of toliets to make our game features). lack of things to spend you're money on once you've beaten SP since all the extra content is reserved for online only without mods(YOU CAN SPAWN THE EXTRA CONTENT BUT IT DISSAPPEARS AFTER 5 SECONDS SO MUCH FOR BEING PRO MODDING YOU SLIVER TOUNGED LIARS) just so R* can butt/fu/ck you if you got this game for single player(YOU HAVE TO BE ONLINE ALL THE TIME TO HAVE ACCESS TO SINGLE PLAYER OTHERWISE THE GAME WON'T LOAD. AND NO COCKBLOCKING SOCIAL CLUB FROM UR FIREWALL HASN'T WORKED SINCE 72 MINOR PATCHES AGO) also P2P only on the PC FFS(no dedicated servers since being locked in p2p server host in china or eastern europe at over 300 ping is the only way to play the game). TL DR don't buy this game unless you want to mod it and ((((Rockstar)))) swindled the goyim for they're shekels all wile kvetching at modders making they're games 10 times better as if It was the second shoah(V MP). anyways that's my two cents on this brb I gotta take a sh/it. OH YEAH AND ROCKSTAR SAID ""YOU DON'T ANYTHING GOYIM"" TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE OPEN IV FOR IMPROIVNG THEIR SH ITTY GAME R* NUTHUGGERS BLOWN THE FU CK OUT LMAO YOU CAN'T EVEN MOD THIS VILE WRETCH CALLED A GAME ANYMORE SO YOU HAVE TO GIVE EM A BJ FOR SHARKCARDS NOW.EDIT THEY PUT BACK MODDING BUT NO IMPORTING CONTENT(OR REMASTERS AND MP CLIENTS THAT AREN'T SHARKCARD FEST) SINCE YOU'D HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE ONLINE ONLY REMASTERS WITH THOSE SHARK CARDS PROBABLY(BETTING THAT AGREEMENT IS VERY SEMETIC TO THE POINT WHERE MAKING EDITS TO THE GAME'S ANIMATIONS OR CODE COUNTS AGANIST THE NEW POLICY) R* NUTHUGGERS DANCE HARDER THAN VALVES FANBOYS.I'M WAITING FOR THE NUTTHUGGERS TO DANCE EVEN HARDER WHEN I'LL TELL EM' ABOUT ONE OF THE MANY CEASE AND DISSIST'S MODDERS HAVE GOTTEN FOR PUTTING THEIR PASSION INTO THE GAME ONLY TO GET SCREWED BY A BUNCH OF BI POLAR S H IT S THAT ""SUPPORT SINGLE PLAYER MODDING""",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-04,0,0,367,False,Recommended,Rockstar has always been known for it's ingenuity pushing the envelope with its spot on social satire and breaking the mold with its unconventional gameplay. The online version seemingly possesses some mechanics issues which effectively penalize new players for defeating their better equipped opponents. Still the much hyped GTA5 continues Rockstar's tradition of excellence introducing unprecedented new gameplay mechanics which make los santos (rockstar's scarily accurate mock up of modern california) feel like a living breathing world. My father insists that mom is still living and breathing but i can no longer smell her I can always smell her.

2015-05-05,0,0,226,False,Recommended,GTA V like the others gta games it's a great game. Of course it's not a perfect game have some bugs have some thing we want to do and we can't but it's a game not real life...The people are arguing about the 60 dollars they pay and they can't use the game like they want...It's not recommended buy a car and make changes it's not recommended buy something and change like you want. To be perfect the users need to understand the updates are being made the dlc are being set if it's the politic of the company not support mods we need to understand that. Imagine millions of people playing the game and have a system to separate the people using mods in single player or multi player. Imagine what it is having a team doing only that time they spent and they can use that time to make the game better.I agree with the Rockstar politic. Some players know how to use mods but other don't so nobody can use it. Imagine someone create a mod to make some cheat in the multiplayer the fun it will end and it's the rockstar name. Of course i have the opinion maybe they can create some servers only to people want to use mods or cheat but maybe that will happen in the future. Let's wait and see what they are preparing for the futue. Let's play and not arguing let's have fun and not think we are talking about real life...This is a game not a job not your life.

2016-09-13,0,0,1170,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V. A really good game at it's core much akin to it's previous releases. It is however not without its shortcomings as with any game. GTAV comes jampacked with many singleplayer features as well as an extensive story driven campaign centered around 3 morons. The first moron is a dad who sucks at being a dad and is just a mid life crisis. The second moron is a crazy rabid son of a who'd snap your neck over a grain of sand. The last moron is your typical hoodrat wanting to make something more of himself only to be shunned by his 'family'.Singleplayer and Multiplayer both have their own forms of exclusive content. This is my biggest gripe right here. Singleplayer for example gives you access to the Dukes muscle car. Now I don't mean the armored one I mean the regular one. Multiplayer on the other hand doesn't let you have it. On the other hand Multiplayer has Benny's. You can make lowriders and two racecars. Singleplayer doesn't let you do that.Singleplayer is safely moddable but should be backed up before modding. Mods really bring out the glory of this game.Multiplayer is completely off limits to modding you mod you get banned. Simple as that. So if you want to play online you'd best make damn sure you have all of your mods uninstalled.Making money in Singleplayer is easier than getting into bed at night.Making money in Multiplayer is more tedious than getting up in the morning after being stoned all day.GTA Online is a pretty entertaining experience... with friends. In public lobbies it's about the dumbest thing imaginable filled with modders/hackers who enjoy tearing the experience apart for regular players like you or me. The problem? You NEED to go into PUBLIC lobbies for certain DLC content to be playable. This is absolute trash and rockstar should be hung by their balls for it literally. Discouraging private lobbies while allowing the option isn't entertaining. It's annoying.Looking past many flaws however there is an amazing game here both in singleplayer and online. You just have to find and make it for yourself. Don't forget to bring friends because otherwise you'll get bored as with any other game. So basically drive cars shoot people get green spend green repeat.,Grand Theft Auto V

And if i'm faced with the choice of either playing the torture mission or not being able to complete the story then uninstalling the game and writing this review is the result. Cruelty is not satire.

2017-03-22,0,0,77,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA Onine should be two seperate games. The reason being is that Grand Theft Auto 5 has quite frankly one of the best acted best executed storylines I think I have had the pleasure of experiencing in a computer game. It's funny it's entertaining and the single player gameplay is an absolute blast. The driving physics are fun and allow you to enjoy just cruising around the city and getting from point to point is enjoyable. The gun play is superb and the cover system on the whole works very well.Criticisms I would level against the gameplay would be that first person view really isn't for GTA if you ask me. I've tried it quite a few times and I just think third person works soo much better. Flying... seriously I have been in a light aircraft and there is not that much turbulance in a flipping hurricane! Seriously it does ruin the flying aspect a bit. The turbulance mechanic makes no sense it doesn't happen in clouds over hills it's just random and annoying.But to summarise the graphics are superb the sound is superb the music is superb. Hell as far as I am concerned the whole single player experience is superb! It is a must play 9.5/10 experience.GTA Online however. Multiplayer... I've tried it a few times. In honesty it bored me to death. I tried a few modes I can see how heists would be good fun but with random people on the internet the joy gets sucked right out of that experience pretty quick. Also I found that I got money pretty easily had a house and some cars. Then I just felt like there wasn't anywhere to go from there. Not to mention that only took me maybe 5 hours of gameplay? Had no trouble with bans although I was in one game and someone made it rain bycles and then dropped cash on my head so I left.GTA Online I would personally rate as a thoroughly average gaming experience and if you play the single player first you will definitely be dissappointed IMO. That being said the game is fantastic if you ignore GTA O even exists!,Grand Theft Auto V

Such as I already got a perm ban because of these ban waves. People might not belive me but it is true. For GTA V SP I would rate is alot up! The reason is because if you have a stable and really powerful computer of PC you might end up adding mods that have really cool graphics which are really cool and add on cars that I install all of the time. So in my opinion GTA V is 75% good for me and 25% bad. 25% because of online and 75% for SP. In all GTA V is recommended,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-03,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,"Buy game. Go through single player. Can't relate to any of the characters. One is a thug and as stereotypically black as you can get. Another is a complete psychopath. The one I guess you're supposed to relate to is a complete d bag. Everyone in the game is rude to the point you just want to stab a baby. The only time anyone is nice to you is when you return someone's wallet and 90% of the time it's better to just keep it. Even driving around the city other drivers will hit you curse you out and try to kill you. Switching between 3 characters all with their own inventory and cars is a pain in the butt. The most enjoyable thing to do is steal a plane and cruise around at night where it's peaceful and beautiful. Finish story mode. Crap ending. Let's try multiplayer. Die repeatedly to s 100x levels above you with rocket launchers and chainguns. Set yourself in passive mode and then die repeatedly to modders who put campfires on you and throw you in the air so you suicide. Watch as modders duplicate your character 100 times until it crashes the game on you. Wait another 10 minutes to get back in online mode because even installed on two SSDs in RAID0 on a system that can play every game on Ultra the game is so poorly optimized it takes forever to load and connect. Get back online and immediately die due to modders. Have all your ammo and weapons removed and then watch as everyone in the lobby repeatedly explodes. Wait 5 minutes to join a new lobby. Repeat the fun of modders destroying your gameplay and Rockstar not caring. Decide to just join a private invite only lobby and try to join people's heists. A 12 year old throws a fit halfway through the heist because he wanted to be on the Insurgent gun. He leaves. You're kicked from the game and wait 10 minutes to get back into a session. Join another heist and someone gets bored during the opening RP cinematic and you're kicked again and have to wait another 10 minutes. Join another heist and manage to complete it but at the very end you fail for no reason at all and everyone leaves out of frustration. Join a crew in hopes of having better people to play with and realize most of them are trolls. They just run you over with their car and kill you repeatedly and laugh at you. Realize that everyone's bored of the game and just trolling. Need 3 dedicated friends to accomplish anything in the game. Ends with some modder dropping a few million on my head getting me banned 2 weeks for ""cheating"". Would only recommend if you are a complete sadist and prefer it rough without lube when you're abused.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-01,0,0,328,False,Recommended,As a long time fan of the GTA series and owning the entire series the beginning of the story was fun but halfway through changing characters gets a little annoying. Being a bank robber is different than being a gangster or mobster like the others in the series but was a fun change.over all after beating the game twice I have to say the game was fun but I was wanting a bit more with single player dlc. The online portion was similar to the story. At first it was fun but once you get all of the jobs(CEO making fake money making drugs having a MC etc) it literally becomes the same missions over and over again. Not only that but rockstar made it that you get very little money from doing these jobs forcing you to buy shark cards or play the game like world of Warcraft.which at first sounds fun and resonable but in practice becomes boring and a grind fest(since your doing the same missions over and over). Overall I would get it for single player and mods absolutely fun. But I wouldn't get it JUST for the online even with friends too much of a grind without the fun of being a traditional mmo.,Grand Theft Auto V

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar stirring until combined. 3.

Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled yet delicious mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn t jiggle when you remove it from the oven.

2016-05-14,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,Id like to start this revied saying that every other gta iv ever played iv had a blast on. this one on the other hand i think rock star could of done better. pretty much all the missions iv played dont have a pay out. the 3 main heists and the assassination missions are pretty much the only money missions . the most expencive bussness you can get is the golf club which costs around 150 mill. your last heist gets you around 40mil. the only ways to really make money is to nock over armored trucks (around 6k payout) which you almost never find. drive a taxi( which payes out about 200$ a ride) nocking over liquer stores (which payes out about 250$) and the stock market(which seems to crash every time i buy stock) so the only real way to make any cash is to sleep and wait tilll any propertys pay out. online is riddled with hackers and the ai's kill you with 1 hit headshots. every mission is the same thing. drive to location shot a bunch of ai's get away. which you will faill 100 times b4 you finish one.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-19,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is unrefined in terms of gameplay. This means that its boring.Want to get in trouble? Have fun losing hordes of super cops who will most of the time kill you unless you use a cheat code or get lucky with an alley. Sometimes I need to wait for long periods of time in an alley before the cops aren't on alert and then they become alerted again as soon as I leave it.So what do you end up doing most of the time? Trying not to off the cops.Want to get into a gunfight? The mechanics aren't refined and as such have enough annoying bits that should have been worked out that its not fun after a couple of them. Between the shooter and the cop dynamics being poor most missions and gamaeplay aren't worth it.All of the bad boy NPC interaction stuff which is vanilla by today's standards isn't worth the time.I like the vehicle variety. I find that the cars handle differently enough to make driving fun. If you like open world driving this game is good for that. Other than that aspect of the game I can't recommend it. I uninstalled it before long.,Grand Theft Auto V

Awesome game SP was fantastic the level design was amazing and graphics. Voice acting was one of the best out of all the characters I have ever heard. Not sure about mp dont care to play it. Well worth the full price. Only negative to me which is an opinion. playing Trevor. Thank god you only had to play as him a few times. At times hes funny as hell and made me laugh but most of the time he was just plain annoying and I wanted to shoot him. Definatly felt good in the ending which theres 3 different endings you can chose from. Playing as Michael and Franklin however was awesome and had 2 different types of lives to live as. Oh and the major negative if you own a GTX 980 FTW graphics card about once every 2 hrs of playing this game youll get a no signal error to your monitor and only way is to reboot and it comes back on so save your game frequently if you own this card same thing has happened to my friend that has same card and this is the only game it does that too.10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-22,0,0,16,False,Recommended,GTA V as a whole is a great game.For Storymode the storyline in GTA V is one of my favorites in the Grand Theft Auto series I beat the game on Xbox 360 Xbox One and I hope to beat it on PC (and maybe choose different paths). Rockstar nailed it on the head when it came to the characters how the chemistry works between them and how each main character in game is the actual face of the actor in real life.For Online I suggest you download FiveM or GTA Network so that you can play on other servers than on the main Rockstar servers (for the time being). You can you FiveM/GTA Network or you can create a private lobby from the 'Online' tab and just do heist/races in that lobby with your friends. Other than that the base Online game is filled with hackers sadly. For a 3+ year old game you would think they would invest money into making a anti cheat instead of making pointless updates.Warning as of March 2017 you can't transfer your Online character from console to PC or PC to console. So with that being said. You will need to start all over if you planned on merging your PS4/Xbox One character to PC. It's not possible anymore. It's funny how Rockstar can still put GTA V at the $60 price point (not worth it get it on sale (maybe $30)) but yet they can't support a small but great feature.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-12,0,0,149,False,Recommended,Well I don t know what to say really. I m going to recommend it because it can be very fun especially with friends that have the game. Not saying it s boring alone just more fun with friends. Once you buy something feels really good and satisfying. Many features and things to do that you can pretty much stay occupied all the time or just mess around with cops or just go on a massacre. However if you are one of those people that hate grinding do not buy this game because you re going to have to grind a lot in order to buy something because honestly in my opinion I think that the things in this game are expensive and you need to spend lots of time to get something in game which relates to a pay to win style game. If you want money either buy a shark card from the beginning or be prepared to grind your off. Who knows you might even be one of the lucky ones and find yourself a hacker/modder that is generous and he/she will give you some money. Don t do it though you might get banned. ),Grand Theft Auto V

With absolutely stunning visuals smooth driving/gun play with mouse and keyboard along with the community producing mods that will only get better and better with time this is definetly worth a second purchase if you have already played it on console. GTA is one of those titles that you know is going to be good because the developer cares about the title and wants the game to be the best it can be. Despite some short comings with the online multiplayer (slow load times difficulties getting a full party etc.) the game is absolutely fantastic if you have had doubts about jumping in to GTA V don't the game will not dissapoint you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-05,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,This game is cool in theory but overall is annoying af. The controls feel clunky and unrealistic in online and when your online pretty much anyone tries too kill you if you're low level and keep following you for an easy kill. I love pvp in most games but this game is really annoying. the missions are fun as well as the multiplayer games and stuff you can do with friends but overall this game is just really annoying in the online version. Otherwise I'd say story mode is meh really. However the biggest reason I don't like this game is because of how anti modding it is which sucks because mods make PC games really fun by adding to them and removing that kinda kills it for me but I'll still play it with my friends and pissant brother but its more for them than me so yeah....,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-29,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,"Really Rock*?Edit2 Rockstar have now sent a cease and desist letter to the main modding program. It disables itself online it has no effects for hackers it's just for modding SP. They are trying to stop it to drive more people to Online and microtransactions. Their reason was that ""OpenIV allows users to create malicious mods that allowe harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience"". OpenIV does not touch online and immediately disables itself if you try. Why are people still supporting Rockstar?Edit These problems seem to be ocurring less by now but I'm leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of Rockstar. People are being banned for no reason and Rockstar agrees with them yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help. Using Discord Fraps Any third party Framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned and support will not reverse it. Heck if you buy shark cards and they don't work they won't even refund you for that!Do not support awful business practices like this. Their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money.EDIT A lot of people seem to be taking this as ""Waaaah! I got banned!"" so let me clear things up. I have not been banned I uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and I didn't play it much. For those who don't believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned here are a few more reasons why you shouldn't support R*.There is a limitless amount of bugs for Online. Ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once you being booted for no reason connections timing out randomly all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen I have ever seen. Instead of presenting you with a simple ""You have timed out"" the game instead spends much time loading up Single player puts you into the world and *then* gives you an error message with an option to rejoin. Which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are that's a good 2 5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game. It is incredibly easy to fix but rockstar still haven't because they do not care.There is no server browser. This means that with the endless adversary modes they add all are dead within a week. The only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level (which almost never works) and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session. If you are playing free roam would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won't have many players? I thought as much. Thus the modes die off extremely quickly.And finally the Anticheat is still terrible. You can have people flying around the map spawning props locking you in place dropping money bags on everyone (Which in an amusing way can result in *them* getting banned) and just generally causing havoc. Every ""attempt"" Rockstar has made has resulted in false positives and an extremely intolerant system towards modders. You remember how much Rockstar said they ""loved"" the PC Audience and their modders? That's amusing considering they're filling the game with dummy code to confuse them and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near Online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files.In all do not support a developer who does not care about their audience. They release modes (The recent Further adventures in Finance and Felony update is a great case for this) that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money or buy shark cards to make it all easier. Not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort as again they'll be dead within a few weeks.You will be better off supporting another company. Move on.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-09,0,0,85,False,Not Recommended,GTA ONLINE I started playing Grand theft auto on my playstation 3 when the game first game out and it was a fun sandbox to play with friends then i switched to ps4 where a good amount of content was enjoyable but since last year this game has turned from a fun sandbox to EA 2.0. The amount of needs for microtransactions just to play with the new things in a dlc is and you can barely make a profit grinding in this game if you have school/job. Thus many people have gotten smart and bought mod menus and accounts on PC just to enjoy a dlc. The major problem comes with the players who just want to play the game legit because the game gets stale after around 6 hours of grinding just to have enough money to buy a ok car. But then the new dlc makes the game even worse if you start the heist and pay around 300k just to startup the heist and you pay your crew a fare amount of money YOU LOSE MONEY! This game is horrible and to be honest don't buy it if you want to keep your sanity.THE STORY MODE It is a blast to play and one of the best in the Grand Theft Auto Series but honestly no one anymore plays the games single player because all the new stuff is in GTA Online.So i believe we should stop playing the game to standup to rockstar and prove we are strong like what we did to EA with battlefront 2,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-02,0,0,1283,False,Recommended,Rockstar have really f*cked this game up. They haven't added in any content for single player since release 4 years ago. GTA online however... They add the stupidest unbalanced sh*t making the big 16 30 player servers practically unplayable without getting shot with an EXPLOSIVE sniper or a rocket bike or sprayed with the marksman rifle every time you try to have a sniper battle. What annoys me is they don't nerf/patch anything they just add something to counter the weapon in the next DLC making the game worse and worse with every DLC. By the time GTA 6 comes out I bet Online will be completely unplayable full of noobs with their sh*tty explosive snipers. It really bugs me because this game was a masterpiece stunning graphics huge map great story fun missions etc etc but they ruined it by rewarding and encouraging the noobs and making the actual skilled players suffer. There's no point in having skill just buy the ridiculously OP weapons and you can kill ANYONE (In fact the other day i got my handed to me by a LEVEL 50 300 levels lower than me because of all these stupid weapons.Oh and not to mention R* taking all my completely legit money after not playing for 2 months but all my friends who have modded money were fine. R* is milking GTA O dry then you'll have to buy GTA 6 since 5 will be unplayable just so r* can f*ck 6 up and the cycle goes on.This game is still worth buying there is still fun in it but it's sad because it could be so much better if they didn't encourage noobs/grippers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-20,0,0,400,False,Not Recommended,The Singleplayer Is fantastic and everything you would look for to entertain yourself for a long time. The only problem is that the game leaves you in a mind where instead of doing heists and interesting missions you just follow orders from FIB clowns whom you had many MANY chances to just shoot and end it. The Multiplayer This is where the issues lay. Might as well call this loading simulator 2015. The matchmaking is absolutely terrible it takes you 20 seconds to join a match (which is likely empty as well) and then 30 seconds to reload free roam because you are unable to hop from match to match.The community is another issue. Most people are wandering psychopaths just looking to blow your car up for the jollies. When attempting to start a heist setup you usually have to wait 5 minutes minimum for players which tend to be low level mute idiots who CAN'T follow orders CAN'T shoot straight CAN'T not hit the ing rotors on the plane ending the heist CAN'T communicate in the slightest. The only thing they CAN do is die and then ragequit which makes playing heists with friends almost mandatory.To give you a bit of background Last night I spend 8 ing hours looking for decent players who wouldn't die on the Series A Coke setup.This is a personal gripe of mine When you load up the heist lobby why the can't you turn the dubstep off? It's bad enough I have to sit here seeing randoms be mentally disabled when SOMEONE ANYONE finally joins but then I have to listen to (crappily thrown together) dubshit for 8 hours? Rockstar you trying to put me into rage induced acoma?

2017-06-07,0,0,77,False,Recommended,Firstly I'd like to thank PS3 &amp Xbox360 for alpha testing PS4 &amp Xbox One For the Beta well done guys and thank you.Secondly (besides the fact that NEVER HAVE TO GO BOWLING WITH ROMAN again EVER!! )Grand Theft Auto V is an outrageous exhilarating sometimes troubling crime epic that pushes open world game design forward in amazing ways.GTA V remains a benchmark game and its graphicalimprovements are hugely impressive but it's the additionof a first person mode that transforms it into a very different beast.The New additions really add something special to the game the car modding gives a slight NFS feel and the gun mods and skins in addition to the first person touches on a COD/ Battlefield game.My only issue is that Rockstar disregards the non online players i.e no new additions the game is updated but for only online. 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

But now it can get up to 3 million. I have spent real money in game... waste of cash TBH. So in the end I would rate it a 8/10.

2016-07-06,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Coming from GTAIV which I ing hated this was really good. Finished it in about 33 hours and the PC port was fantastic ran butter smooth with max settings. Same old GTA formula which I think I am growing a little bored of. I had some problems with mission objectives before and during missions where I didn t know what the hell I was supposed to do. I feel like this game did not take advantage of the world it s in. So many missed opportunities to make even more kick heists or epic main story missions. I loved the soundtrack not the music but the actual scoring during the missions kicked It had a badass 80s tone similar to Dying Light or Dead Rising 4 loved it. Story was decent even though I felt there were missing cut scenes or lack of explanation in some parts and the 3 main characters were awesome. There is plenty more to do and explore but I doubt I will revisit anytime soon. A lot of people trashed Mafia 2 for its closed open world but to be honest I loved the more tightly focused story and atmosphere since 60 percent of my time playing GTAV was driving from one point to another pointless filler after a while. Like I said I must be getting bored of this formula.It s worth it for a sale price so snag it if your curious.,Grand Theft Auto V

One example of a fun open world game is Ghost Recon Wildlands (if you want a fun open world game I strongly suggest it) of course you could take my words with a grain of salt but with 50 hours of play time I think I have been able to catch on to a few things this game and this company does to it's consumers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-03,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,My computer did not seem to like the game even though I was running with an Intel Core i5 4460 14GB of RAM and a GTX 1050Ti more than enough power to run the game. The game had constant stuttering issues with framedrops no matter what quality settings I chose. VSync on or off did not seem to help the issue. If you're thinking about buying the game ask a friend that has the game to login with their Steam account on your PC first so you can try it out before you waste your money. Not recommended.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-24,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,We did it. After almost 77k signatures and 30k thumbs up Take Two felt the flame and revoked the cease &amp desist. OpenIV is back in development and it will be available for download from the official site soon. Thanks to the supporters for the help and the haters who's comments gave me a good laugh. I will recommend this game to anyone who would like to buy it because of its modding capability which makes it an amazing experience. I'll make this review as recommended once I feel enough people have heard about this. &lt 3I will also be giving away GTAV for the summer sale in my Discord soon so stay tuned for that.https //discord.gg/G5bgPvc ),Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-16,0,0,544,False,Not Recommended,Firstly I love this game because you can drive all over Europe. You have to manage your money and make sure that when you get out a loan from the bank you have enough money to pay it back or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you and they will complete jobs for you but you have to pay them a wage plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills that make them be better at certian things like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do 'Quick Jobs' and these are when the employer provides the truck and you just go where they tell you. This is fun but it starts to get boring only doing short deliverys so you can buy a truck so that you can go further distances and get more money.To conclude I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator or any simulator game should give this game a try because it is a great way to unwind after a long day and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game I happen to disagree.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-25,0,0,150,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is one of those games I feel weird about even after dropping near 200 hours on my original game when I picked it up for the Xbox 360 only to realize I'm a over a year down the road when the PC release game about. Luckily enough Rockstart had the foresight to allow people to fix their deadly error of buying this shiny game on a dying console. So first off that's one huge beautiful point in Rockstar's court so I wouldn't have to grind up my online character again just to get my shiny penthouse that I haven't visited in so long I almost forgot where it was in spite of it being marked on the map.Anyways. GTA V's single player feels like a strong fleshed out GTA game running well in the same vein each of the previous installments have but much more shiny and smooth with so much to do stealing some poor bastards car may actually end up falling off the top ten to do list after a few rounds of golf mucking about on an arcade machine holding up a virtual 7 11 and the now almost absurd amount of other activities which have been added as Rockstar pumps out free content. Problem is none of the free content pours into the single player experience and we're stuck with a vanilla game that hasn't gone anywhere. Not that I miss it much as the online offers far more to do than the single player with something of a reward if not at least a sense that your actually building yourself up for something.But in the single player you will be met with three seperate characters who you will play as who all have their unique abilities which all don't mean much for other than their main special ability so long as your a competent human being capable of understanding basic controls. Which arises my single and only problem in the GTA games. Difficulty curve. Now I'm not saying it's not there but GTA V almost feels like it holds your hand a bit too tight over the course of the single player and never really punishes you if you muck up. Not that this is a bad thing but the sense of risk and reward in single player leaves something to be desired. Otherwise the experience is still exceptional in just about every other way. Beautiful and pretty damned big city to roam about and cry havoc and release the hogs of war. Or dogs. Whichever.As for the online it's essentially the single player experience but partially populated with the stew of the gaming community. Most people are there just to play and have a fun time running people over selling drugs stealing drugs blowing drugs up and just about every other major crime under the sun. Problem is as is the fault with all online games you will consistantly run into people who feel it necessary to cheat in the online. You'll suddenly see another player spawn twenty feet from you blow you up with some kind of Iranian superweapon and you suddenly realize they've Harry Pottered their way across the the entire map and over the course of the next five minutes have killed every single player in the lobby while uttering less than acceptable phrases. Rockstar makes it easy enough to report and kick players problem is I've found a sad amount of people don't even know how to access the player list to report or kick which confuses me but then again I'm the type of nimrod who gladly stares at menus early on for ten minutes to know where everythings at.In the end in this poorly written review Grand Theft Auto V is a remarkable game worth your time and money if you have an immense amount of time to devote to a single game as if you were in some kind of digital monogomy and you accidentally knocked up Grand Theft Auto and it's father is keeping a shotgun pressed firmly against your buttocks until you've ground up enough money to afford a penthouse so you can continue onto bigger and better heists and other various missions.Pros Excellent single player Beautiful graphics Expansive radio selection Fleshed out gameplay Almost MMO like multi player without too many of the typical MMO tropes New content releases regularly giving plenty to do in the onlineCons Huge file size you better make sure you've partitioned some disk space or free some up You'll find a hacker/modder in almost every online lobby Single player doesn't feel like it has much post game content other than typical activitiesI'm sure I could give much better pros and cons but honestly they wouldn't have enough gravity to mention. Well. Maybe. Probably could find more but Grand Theft Auto V is a damn good game and in spite of any other flaws I guarentee you'll have tons of fun with it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-11,0,0,817,False,Not Recommended,This game had so much potential you'll only ever see in the modding communities. The singleplayer story is garbage so I'm not even going to talk about it. Didn't even hold me long enough to finish it and thats coming from someone who's beat San Andreas and GTA 4 on every console and platform there is more than once.So we're talking about the online here. Still garbage. With all the updates they've pumped out its military t simulator everywhere we're talking about Grand theft AUTO. And they skipped right the over it. Pretty much the only vehicle you need is one of the flying bikes cause of how busted their movement is. I'm pretty sure the Oppressor 2.0 speed glitch is still in the game even though they patched out the Deluxo Reverso negative acceleration bug even though it wasn't broken cause you had to do it backwards. I miss the good ol days of blasting the Cucaracha car horn as you flew past a plane at mach speeds and sound very silly because of the Doppler Effect.But the AUTO part the most important part of the entire game the cars. They didn't give a flying about balancing any of the car classes. Theres a sports car thats faster than most of the super cars in the game. Thats ballistically dumb. Every sports car race theres absolutely no way to even compete unless you're in that car with custom vehicles on or off its just busted entirely. Most classes are somewhat like this with only 2 or 3 vehicles being remotely usable in a race with how upgrades work on cars. When you also get into a race if you don't have a custom car you basically lost. I do not know why Rockstar thought putting in a racing option the ability to put custom performance parts on your car and then be able to race other people in cars with no upgrades. Its entirely unbalanced in every sense of the word. Every car in a race should be upgraded automatically to max keeping separate your vanity upgrades as what you get in racing from owning the vehicle.The by far most important part of the game the cars they ed up ENTIRELY to just badger money out of you. And guess what it worked. Rockstar released this game once on consoles in 2013 and then 2 years later released it on PC because they knew that when they did this everyone was going to buy it a second time at full price so they could play it on an actual competent platform. And guess what they're doing with Red Dead Redemption 2?Most of these days lobbies consist of people grinding for cash one level 1 shows up messes with it so they get beaten up and then whine and complain about it. That or you'll get your beat by cheaters using invincibility and then they talk which is hilarious I to this day cant imagine how small their are to cheat in a game so obviously and then lie and brag about it. Something that I always take away from that is how overly ridiculously obsessively sweaty some people are in this game. The new flying bike is fast yes but it cannot for the life of it keep up with someone remotely competent in a good sports car around tight city streets. Most of the time when I hop on its just cruising around dodging death itself and laughing at its face as it whines about needing more vehicles with lock on homing rockets.I recomend looking into FiveM Project Homecoming or GTAWiseGuys' mods if you already own this game as they are some of the most fun and interesting parts of this game that I've played. As a matter of fact I think more people play the modded GTA V Roleplay than they do the online official multiplayer because of how poorly implemented it is and how great and in depth the mods are.TL DR Dont buy. Poor balancing issues bad story horrible online cruel and manipulative marketing strategies and an absolute lack of care for its community. Rockstar purely at its base core of business doesn't care about the consumer only the money that they get shoveled into their pockets from all the blind fan boys that weep whenever Rockstar down their throat with their new lies. Did I mention them trying to take away modded content because they knew mods would be more fun than the game they made themselves?,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-03,0,0,467,False,Not Recommended,Where to start off? So i was really looking forward into this game after playing it for more than 300 hours on my xbox 360. After i seen no more updates were coming into the PS3 and X360 i decided to get it on PC. I cannot say anything bad about the optimization probably the best game out there when we talk about optimization.The game itself is amazing. Amazing details in all the aspects of the game amazing story sound gameplay(even tho gta v isn't trying to be realistic like gta 4) but we are going into the multiplayer part. Boy it's a mess. On the consoles i didn't have any problems because on the consoles you rarely meet any hacker or modder so it was an amazing experience as for multiplayer but on PC it's just bad. You thought that Valve's anti cheat is slow and sometimes useless? Ohh boy you didn't see Rock$tar's. With some luck i didn't get banned because of hackers or modders because they didnt throw money on me or something but they were ruining the game. Killing everybody spawning the most ridiculous and gigantic things and so on. I won't talk about the customer support because it's even more useless than the anti cheat. Also GTA Online became from a while a money maker for R*. The content is free in some way but is overpriced up to hell so you need to buy shark cards (ingame money) to gain those items. At this point R* are worse than EA.And we all know that Rock$tars scammed a lot of people in the Summer Sale of 2015 when they bundeled the game with shark cards so they can raise the price up to 80$/Euros so they can add a 25% of promotion just to sell the game at the normal full price of 60$/euros. Really silly move Rock$tar. Shame on you!At the current state i can recommend the game only for the story mode because it is amazing. But the online component is disease on the PC right now. I would suggest geting the game on consoles (PS4/XBONE) just because you won't get any hackers/modders and if you get you will get them VERY RARELY!EDIT Got banned for absolute no reason and my online account was reseted. Lost more than 400 hours (plus my time on consoles) of gameplay in online and lost an acocunt with lvl 200 and a lot of expensive stuff. Rockstars i just give you 10 out of 10 for banning me one person who did nothing wrong in online but all those cancerous hackers are still out there and you don't give a flying fu ck.

2016-12-24,0,0,266,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V what can you say about it?The single player story is captivating with a lively cast that feel real that make you laugh that make you go WTF!Even if that's the only reason you pick it up it's worth the ride.. There's also side missions and some extra stuff to keep you busy.Multiplayer is another beast in it's own right customizing cars your characters buying homes and even a few more things with the additions of Motorcycle Clubs and Big Businesses.Even if you don't feel like doing all that GTAV and GTA O has to offer you can still run about and destroy the world until you're content.BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!MODS! Yes MODS!While Rockstar may not officially support or endorse their use they're still available for public consumption.This game is worth the retail price of $60USD you'll get what you spent on it very quickly.Be wary of the GTA Online community though..Most people suck and exist solely to ruin everything you've spent your in game cash on and delight in nothing more than watching you fail at everything you do..And some people actually help you teach you or just want to play a game with someone who's not on of the above.Either way..

I think that problems within the community with people like hackers and whatnot causeing confusing within rockstar causing them to accidentally do the wrong thing to the wrong people makes this game sound worse than it is. If none of those problems were a normal occurance then I think this game would have a much higher rating than it does.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-24,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Since I'm very optemistic about this game owning this on PC is now my 4th purchase coming from console (X360/ PS3/ XONE) and now to this. My experience with this game has been really fun so far so very little to complain about. I wished I hadn't missed my opportunity to transfer my progress from the One to PC but unfortunately I did. I'm actually really content in starting over again knowing exactly what to do again and how fast it can be done. Can't speak too much about the bad and the ugly considering I've never been banned or suspended for any reason. I guess me sticking to my roots with playing with friends only despite me being anti social (most of the time players are not so kind so it's every reason I need to avoid them) I'd rather just focus on my own.Coming from console to my PC which is almost 4 years old I'm flabbergasted how well everything performs. Can't quite reach Ultra (2K 4K) settings but I can set it to high and achieve 30 60fps most times. My current specs are as follows Processor AMD A10 Quad Core 3.80GHz (4.20GHz Turbo Core) w/ AMD HD Dual GraphicsRAM 12GBVideo Card Nvidia GTX 750Ti 2GBHDD 1TBI'm really enjoying the smooth game play that is other wise really hard to control on console (not easy to aim and shoot from 1st person in car and on foot) so this is really a treat for me. As for mods I haven't tested it out yet (kind of burned out from doing the story mode twice) I'm kind of terrified my system will crash and burn lmao. Other than what I've already shared I understand why some may not recommend this game but from my sheer enjoyment I'll recommend it to myself lmao!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-16,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,Sadly I am going to give this a negative review. It is so majorly polluted with hackers. They ban some for 2 weeks and a bypass hack comes out along with god mode and no you can't go passive to ignore them. They will still kill you. Single player is great and private lobby also. But if you have nobody else to play with at any given time and try joining others it gets ruined by more hackers. Rockstar needs to fix this crap. Start perma banning idiots.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA online is an awful cashgrab Back when it was released it actually wasnt that bad cars werent that expensive and neither were the places to store your Cars But the longer the game went on the more expensive anything became You have the yachts that are absolutely useless and very expensive and the worst reality to realise is that in gta IV for 40 quid you could get 2 single player DLCs that gave you way over 20 hours of content to play through and in gta V for 40 quid you can get the T20 which is a single car in gta online. The recent updates have only ruined the game when looking at balance the updates are clearly designed to make the overpowered high level players more overpowered content (the explosive sniper shotgun and leaked explosive minigun). How are new players supposed to do anything when some could blow up anything they're driving in within a couple of shots from over a mile away. The best ""recent"" update imo still is the biker update it wasnt that expensive added a lot of fun bikes and gave you a way to make money and was accessible for both low and high level players. Rockstar itself is also a very scummy company when it comes to GTA V apperently Rockstar removes accounts of people that have been inactive for a long time. The microtransactions found in gtao are also awful for about 80 quid you can get 8 million ingame and anyone who has played this knows 8 million is all.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-25,0,0,345,False,Recommended,Despite its predecessor being a port of a console game this game has fared very well. If you don t know yet Grand Theft Auto V is pretty much the best game for any person (with friends) to have fun either online or not. Single player Grand Theft Auto V s single player has its flaws but I still though that it was a lot better than Grand Theft Auto IVs story. Unfortunately Rockstar doesn t update it as much as it does on Online so this game is more centered towards those who enjoy online. Despite that the single player is infinitely fun and definitely a time waster that coupled with mods is an amazing combination. Online Now obviously every online game has its hackers and its cancerous players so playing online with random players is going to be very hard. Seeing as many of the online players are either trollers or 12 year olds it s pretty hard to have any fun or make any friends online. The online portion gives you a lot of opportunity and a lot of jobs to do but then again you must have friends. You could own a company so you could be your very own Fatcat you can also own an MC and be your own president and with that comes many other jobs and missions. Heists are very fun but hard to play with randoms because I m pretty sure there s some quantum physics law that says one of the randoms has to be either or with a bad internet connection because it s absolutely impossible to be stable while on random. It s impossible to play more than one heist even if you re lucky to play one with randoms. So unless you have dedicated friends it ll be very hard for you to enjoy this game. Conclusion Amazing game to play with friends. I recommend this to anyone with some extra cash and a semi beefy computer.P.S. If you re cool you re invited to add me and play if you want!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,88,False,Recommended,This is Rockstar's most ambitious title yet costing hundreds of millions in development and hundreds more in marketing. It delivers solidly on every aspect of it's promise and will go down in history as one of the finest games ever made as every previous edition of GTA has. Again amongst thousands of reviews there's little I can say here but to support and endorse the most positive opinions.The technical performance of this game is excellent.One critical note GTA Online is not compatible with mods and Rockstar have made it difficult to use mods and keep your account they ban anyone who uses any kind of mod from GTAV which is a negative consumer outcome they must address in future.Lack of support for Steam Workshop also makes modding the game difficult not that it even needs it but if you have a great game why not make it better?,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-02,0,0,2437,False,Recommended,This game we've been waiting a very long time but it had its sense. To be objective is not easy because everything has its pros and cons. First write a brief description and then reasons why you should buy the game or not. This game is very carefully created up to the smallest detail. The sophistication of the main menu settings audio graphics controlled the cameras aiming the weapons. The story is fun for dozens of hours. Furthermore are activities such as tennis golf darts racing in cars motorbikes boats collectibles mysteries and their solutions the maintenance of the purchased assets in the operation. People who don't play the game at all thought that I watch the film.Other studios currently look like small children before Mrs. teacher.The online part is huge which has a lifetime into the next part of GTA VI. PROS + Even Map editor worth that money+ Very well optimized game but can't recommend this game if you haven't min 1x 3GB VRAM for High settings+ Support the high resolution but the maximum settings Very High/Ultra 8xMSAA in 4K and +100 frames you will be able to enjoy up to with the next Pascal arch. of Nvidia graphic cards+ Almost perfect graphics their care very well act as cosiness household the architecture of the houses+ Finally the long story and the online part almost endless.+ Rockstar once again with the quality of its mockery of any current and future title and pushes the boundaries of possibility very far+ For your money you are buying a action game racing game flight simulator tennis simulator a golf simulator and a many others+ No DLC in addition to the On line Cash if you like+ I didn't notice any bugsCONS For three weeks I didn't sleep at all Currently the high price but the quality is paid Maybe High hardware requirements for some people because recommended specs are lies Many mysteries around the problem with the BAN system so don't mod the game with any FOV mod menu or another stuff while you playing on line The Difficulty of missions is too easy Cheaters but what could you expect I don't know any game with no cheaters.I wasn't a fan of the series GTA up until this part.I recommend just to buy.

2015-05-14,0,0,280,False,Not Recommended,I REALLY would not recommend this game if you are playing it on a laptop. Unless you are willing to put in copious amounts of time into finding a fix that is temporary I would absolutely advise NOT to buy it. I've had trouble with Rockstar in the past. I spent roughly 5 hours trying to get GTA IV to run and it was so poorly optimized that it barely ran after the hours of trying to fix it. This will most likely be the last time I buy a Rockstar game. They had plenty of time to test their PC products and they still made it extremely tough to run.

Also I could list off a few more downsides to the game like The community of 12 year olds and ugly cancerous ""grown men"" The gap between the poor and the rich the struggle to do something important without some jackass in a Hydra ruining you're efforts and the lack of content other than ""Making money is the real gameplay"" which is a pretty good title ruined by REWARDS AND EVEN IER PRICE TAGS.I actually like the game tbh but the way money works is dragging the poor to hell and driving the rich to hentai haven.

(03/2018)I'll give my opinion...This game is beautiful (Music Graphics Ambient Content...) but there is only one problem.I don't know but when I was playing this game it was impossible to get everything by playing honestly this game.The cars apartments.... were too expensive... For example in other RPG's if you play the game even the most expensive item you will get but in this game this will not happen.That's why many people started to buy modded accounts with more than 1 billion ($$$ LOADSAMONEY $$$) and since rockstar realized this they started banning uncontrollably.I'll give a positive review because I had so much fun playing it even with half of the cars items....Anyway if you want to play honestly be prepared to have a few things or if you want to have 1B+ be prepared for the consequences..,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-27,0,0,1020,False,Recommended,GTA V the single player campaign is great while it lasts. GTA Online is also fun as long as you can deal with the cheaters and modders. I actually just stopped playing for a while out of frustration because there was a point when just about every other populated session I joined had a modder. Taking into account the high stakes risks you take for rewards on delivery missions it is no fun spending time loading your warehouse with $200 000+ worth of goods and starting the delivery mission to sell those goods just to have a hacker blow up your delivery vehicle(s) remotely just for the heck of it. Once I heard of the recent bans I started back playing and can say for the past 2 days maybe 6 hours or so of total play time I haven't come across anyone modding. I'm feeling safe for now. So as far as all of this recent negative backlash goes just keep in mind that at this point I find it unlikely in my opinion that Rockstar made a legitimate mistake. These people didn't get banned for no reason. Sessions are still very well populated. However I do wish Rockstar could be a little more transparent about how their banning system is working and why those people were banned.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-11,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,I had loved this game when I played on console I had for PS3 then followed it by still playing on the Xbox 1 (rip xboxes are gross.) when I had a chacne to buy this game on steam for the summer sale I was very happy and expected to get back what I once felt playing on console and now in better FPS. But when I first launched the game it was in 800 by 600 resolution with a frame cap of 30 (which is weird considering my specs) but I resolved those issues quickly but the largest issue I had was the game being literally unplayable and damaging my computer. I tried to alt tab once (I need to because of how stupidly high the in game senses are do I could change my DPI) but no matter what if I alt tab it wouldnt only crash the game but it would crash my entire computer.

Now I guess GTA just fell short on content but I'm not suprised it's 5 years after the original relase that's a long time to keep a game alive and there are still a lot of people playing and making videon about it on Youtube so if you can get it under 20 bucks I would say give it a go if you never tried it I'm just gonna give it a 10/10 not because it's perfect by any means but because it's got sooo much content to play bring and get in it that you will have a blast!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-02,0,0,103,False,Recommended,I'm Getting mad on bad reviews with low hour count on the game add mine with 2 600 from outside of steam. Anyway the game is great and has been since release something made me drop it for a while but its stil good. The singleplayer is great and the online mode works as you did expect. You will have lots of fun even if you play solo but with friends will make it much better. anyway the value of the ingame currency is low and you need to play alot or know how to earn money without cheating to get what you want anyway. I recommend people to play all the heist cause its an easyway to earn the money you need and by playing the event modes like (deadline) when it were active. Anyway the event modes will grant you twice as much money and rp. GTA Online do have some problems with modders/hackers which ruins the fun in most seasons. +Gameplay+entertaining+early/midgame+fun stuff+low learning curve+multiple modes+No need to buy DLC's or expanstions+Great graphics bad anti cheat system Some what expensive ingame items long time in loading screens somewhat bad optimized in town (often cause of high activity and high graphics)anyway in general its a most buy for the ones who want some fun with friends or solo if you want and it's great untli someone with mods explodes you up to the sky multiple times until you join another season.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-01,0,0,45,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is a really fun experience with tons to do. Story Mode has an amazing thrilling action and comedy filled plot set in a beautiful city. There are lots of characters to interact with and a big city to explore! You can do almsot anything. Rob Banks Steal Cars Kill Peeps. You can even steal aircrafts from the airport. Even though Story Mode is veryfun it doesn't end there. Their is also GTA Online. Online Mode is this huge mode where you are still in the big city of Los Santos but there are tons of players with you. You can do LOTS more in Online. Take place in theft missions with other players rule in deathmatches race cars. And you can even start a business and be a CEO fully dedicated to theft and makin' dem moneyz. But there are some stuff holding Grand Theft Auto 5 back. First the community is the definition of cancer. Hackers are raoming the streets all over the place trolls are getting ready to turn people mad and just straight up annoying people are just being F***ING ANNOYING AS SH**. Sorry if you take those as cuss words. I'm trying my best not to cuss too much. Getting off topic that community has come straight out of HELL. I've heard of bullies and squeakers. I'm starting to believe that their are even real criminals on that game. Oh I'm scared of that. I mean grand Theft Auto 5 is a game about Lying Stealing Killing and much more of that fun stuff but that's the virtual side of it. The community is the real side. Overall it's a really fun game with lots of potential. Also has a pretty good amount of depth. You can never get too much depth in a game. There is a good amount of cutomization in that game. Now I'm that type of guy that LOVES and I mean LOVES customization. I would even have sexual contact with customization. I just LOVE it!!! Now this is less of a complaint and more of a suggestion of some sort but APB Reloaded really makes me wish this game had that same customization. One thing I love about APB Reloaded is the customization. Oh so GOOD! Can't get enough of customization. Bujt Grand Theft Auto seemes like a good game to have a lot more customization. Just my personnal thoughts no hate no hate. Overall it an awesome game that deserves A LOT more love and support. But this is the reason why I wrote this review in the first place. I've seen lots of people with problems with the game. Story Mode not working no triggering of missions and all that. Lots of problems in the game. So here goes nothing. So I made serious progress in Grand Theft Auto 5 in about only a couple of hours and had a blast. I had autosave on and had all those missions saved. I quit Grand Theft Auto 5 to go to bed and the next morning I opened up GTA5 and all of my progress from yersterday was gone. The latest completed mission I had was the Daddy's Little Girl Mission but that was nowhere near yesterday's latest completed mission. I am SO off right now. WTH JUST HAPPENED???? I swear I had autosave on. I did!!! This is not cool and when I hound out that progress was gone I was SO TRIGGERED!!! Whoever is here please give me as much help as you can. I do NOT want to redo that progress. It's just too much. All the blood sweat and tears released to reach that point all wasted. Please help me!!! I still recommend this game IF you don't have the same problem as me. This is just NOT cool!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

The actual missions though get repetitive once you break rank 20 or so and there needs to be more here to keep people playing.

2019-01-11,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,I've waited a long time to try GTA V mainly because I was really disappointed with GTA 4 and I am disappointed again. Considering that GTA V cost like half a billion to make and a huge number of people love the online GTA V I'm shocked by my conclusion.Rockstar have gone back to the old San Andreas RPG style character stat improvement which is a plus in my book and at first I thought I was getting a story driven RPG like experience. The effort Rockstar have put into this is mindblowing with staggering attention to detail. The gameplay sucks in my opinion though. My thoughts over the first few hours were 'The combat is worse than Crackdown and even Saint's Row.''I like the driving especially in this car.''No daughter of mine is telling me what to do...oh WTH mission failed because I have to listen to this spoilt brat.''Why is this mission insisting I drive an ATV when I've got a perfectly good off road car already.''Ha Ha Ha Rockstar is taking the mickey out of Facebook for whoring out folks data.''Wait Rockstar want me to have a data slurping app on my phone just so I can train a dog...Hypocritical or what!.''I had a full arsenal but for this mission I can only use this pea shooter lame.''I am not having fun.''The controller is mapped really unique fashion 'B' for reload I've never come across that before.''I am bored.''I am out.'The story seems strong but it isn't enough to keep me interested when I'm not enjoying the combat at all. That said if you enjoyed GTA 4 then you'll probably enjoy GTA V and I wouldn't fault anyone for that I just got bored of cover based shooting like ten years ago. I've not tried the GTA V online wasn't interested in it anyway.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-25,0,0,873,False,Recommended,It's Grand Theft Auto 5. As a person who has put close to 1300 hours into GTA O (that is adding my online hours from xbox 360 as well) I still recomend this game. The people that you see whining about the ban system are the kind of people who are 12 and get salty when rockstar punishes them for cheating or taking handouts from cheaters (money drops etc.) but if you want to know a quick little secret even though this shouldnt be a secret don't cheat and dont ask for handouts from cheaters. Rockstar's cheat detection isn't perfect but it's better than VAC (CSGO specifically) at a minimum and you can always join a different lobby if someone is being a same goes for if you find yourself in a modded lobby. Primaraly though use common sense and you should be fine.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-03,0,0,809,False,Recommended,The game is 10/10 in my book... but the community gets like 6/10 cuz there are modders everywhere giving money to people... Im here trying to get stuff legit but everyone else are getting modders money... I sometimes just feel like just stopping and get modders money (but I don't want to be banned) everything that involves getting money require either 4 friends that are online and a friendly lobby and like 4 hours of time. If u want to make money not insanly slow. And the game is getting ridiculus cars now. A motorcycle that can fly and shoot rockets a car with a machine gun on top (that the driver can control) and a fkn truck that has 3 or 4 turrets that other players in the back control (explosive bullets ofc) and it has a 1 car garage. no new appartments or features.. this game would get a much higher rating if they just lower the prices on the cars and the good stuff or atleast lower cooldowns and production on the various buisnesses that you can own and manage. But despite all of this I give the game a good rating because its a really great place to find new friends and I think its alot funnier to play with friends cuz u always have something to do and in a good game you should always have something to do. But getting money in the start is slow. some tips ) Get 200k by doing jobs and heistsetups which u can find in the job list in your phone ) buy a HIGH END apartment for 200k Do heists in your heist room in your apartment. (host them) u get paid alot more then Get 1 mil doing heists buy the cheapest office for 1 mil Do vip work and heists and get 1 5mil buy the cheapest VEHICLE werehouse (only sell top range cars) you will know what I mean when you get the werehouse. If you sell 1 top range car u will get 100k Get 200k and buy a mc club clubhouse get 1mil and get a cocain lockup then you should be set... Do alot of car selling ( the best income btw ) buy more lockups (you can only have 1 lockup per product) for extra income.have a nice day ),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-06,0,0,68,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. ShortlySit down as I tell you a story about GTAO my first session.My first session was full of little children hurling playground insults at each other and killing each other. Already in the plane screen there were kids who couldn't even write properly. My ears are still bleeding from their voices. I got caught in the crossfire because I just waltzed through with some stolen car.They had stuff like a gun with explosive bullets a goddamn MINIGUN? RPGs and stuff. This is ridiculous. So this is my first session it's supposed to be a legendary experience.But no it's just children hurling playground insults at each other and running to mommy because other players don't play by THEIR rules. Then they go pick on lowlevel players because mommy was speaking on phone with this mysterious ""Matthew"" even though she's married to Jonathan. Then some guy dressed as a clown came to me and gave me money. I think it's a cheater or something.I ran away someone killed me and someone else came and started killing him and told me to run away. Okay.GTAO is truly a playground full of toxic children.GraphicsThey look good I guess when you don't have CONSTANT STUTTERING and low quality PS1 era textures everywhere.GameplayPlease do not play GTA Online. I looked at the prices for the many cars ingame and they had like way too high prices. I did a google and apparently you don't get much money from like anything. Now Story Mode is a different matter. I googled that thing and it's apparently great and has received praise.UpdatesLook I just googled all of this since I don't want to waste my time with this ""game"".The game is getting updates but I'm not sure about their quality.I'm gonna lean on the Bad Quality side since I hate this game already.CommunityAs described in Shortly GTA Online is a playground full of children hurling insults at each other and picking on each other.The children that've been playing on the playground for longer have better stuff the newcomers are defenseless unless there's a guardian angel guarding people and telling them to run away.This community is awfully and WORRYINGLY toxic. COD is nothing when compared to this ""game"" on the toxicity scale.CheatersIf I ever play this game I am most likely either 1. playing singleplayer or 2. playing casually with a mod menu.Again a quick google resulted in thousands of threads complaining about cheaters.SoundtrackI listened to some of the music and some of it was actually great.GTA V gets a pass on that.In a NutshellThere won't be no nutshell because you shouldn't buy this ""game"" and if I'd make a nutshell of this game I'd go insane! insane laughingRating Final Conclusion0/10. If you buy it buy it only for the singleplayer and even then you should not. Online is a big no no.I've been wanting to play this game for years but now that I finally have played it...it sucks. I never thought I'd say this but CS GO is better than this ""game"".Knowing that there is corporate greed worse than EA makes me want to cancel my 7 day trial to breathe oxygen.GTA V is my eventual descent to insanity.",Grand Theft Auto V

(To put that in perspective all the good cars are over 1 million some as much as 2 million.) so $100 real life dollars for 4 or 5 virtual cars.

2015-04-15,0,0,249,False,Not Recommended,"The most dissapointing game I've ever played. Wow this is ing terrible. Remember when we all thought GTA 4 took itself to seriously? Remember when we thought it's story was overblown it's gameplay was janky it's characters lackluster and it's lack of fun? Well rockstar has done it again. And this time it's WORSE.So let's start with free roam.You can't free roam.Why? here's why. Because the player is weak.In GTA 5 the ammount of bullets it takes to blow out a car's tires is decreased and the duribility of the cars is decreased. It's also harder to obtain cars. So if you like me wanted to walk out side cap some dumb prick steal his ride and go on a 20 minute joyride with sirens and gunshots as your soundtrack you can't because the cops will shoot out your tires and your car will become worthless quite fast.The cops themselves have also had a major ( ) buff increasing their dammage and accuracy. A cop will now be able to headshot you (And it is ALLWAYS a headshot) for an instant kill from any range at any speed within their car. You can be doing 70 on the highway in a stollen NOOSE van and be instantly felled by a default first responderYour player is weak in terms of duribility too. You have half the health you had in GTA 4 which was half that it was in GTA 3... If this keeps up by GTA 6 a fart will kill us. And as mentioned before the cops are DEADLY accurate so you can literally walk outside steal a car and be dead within 6 seconds. I'm serious. Your weapons are largely useless. Ammo is less plentiful has a lower cap is more expensive and your guns are weaker than they used to be... So while that cop will insta kill you you'll be hosing down his cruiser with a machine gun and not score any hits.Also if you decide to go with a motorcycle you will fall off. And once you fall off your character takes about 2 millenia to get up. So you get zerg rushed by 60 cops and killed within 4 seconds.Now for story.The story is... Bad. Trevor is completely unlikeable Franklin is bacically a cardboard cutout and michael while the best of the characters is a sucker of the finest degree. You'll play througout the entire story constantly thinking ""why can't I just ing shoot this guy/why can't I just ing do this job/ why can't my character do anything except swallow police ."" The reason is because rockstar can't ing write well. The story is a complete mess and I will NOT write any further about it because it makes my head hurt...Which isn't even getting into the glitches.In short this game can only be saved by the modding communtiy. The only way which I could EVER reccomend this game is if rockstar were to seriously buff the player put the game on sale and provide regenerating health. Then it would finally become fun.

2015-12-26,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,Doesn't really add anything new to GTA4 other than a different location and characters the actual underlying game engine is arguably worse.You can't set the view distance anymore. (huge plus on GTA4 with a decent PC)Turn around for a moment and everything you've destroyed is gone and fixed back up again.Still doesn't have proper support for add on mods.Police don't care if you blaze past them at 1000mph.My saitek game controller didn't work with it seems to want an xbox controller and you can't really customise the layout.Why are the rockets from the RPG so unrealistically slow.Helicopters are never ending I you not they come in pairs and as soon as you've downed them 2 more come along I must have shot down 50 in a row. I like to cheat offline I'm not much of a online gamer so I can't comment on it's online gameplay but offline I just like to destroy stuff and go on a rampage in general that you can do but the constant helicopters kinda ruins it.You can't get inside many buildings I mean less than in GTA4. Even the hospitals and clucking bells are inaccessible now.In all I'll say this is a lazy console port that should have come a lot sooner.If you haven't bought it yet don't bother get GTA 4 and some of the various mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar NEEDS to do something about the anti cheat because literally EVERY server i join with more than 10 people has atleast a cheater and half the server screaming for free money.The game is awesome and i love. I'd play it all day. But DON'T buy it unless you have friends to play with because everytime you'll join a new sessions there will be atleast 1 cheater spawning things on you. Well unless you like having 10000mil money in the first 10 minutes of the game and have every weapon even those you barely get 10 bullets for in a the singleplayer campaign and you can't even buy it in multiplayer.IF rockstar will solve the cheater issue i'll modify this review.I'd give this game a 9.5/10 for gameplay........and a 1.5/10 for the community which plays this gameOverall review 6/10 (barely reccomendable if you don't have friends to play with very much recommended if you have someone to play with or just want the singleplayer),Grand Theft Auto V

I would buy this game just for the singleplayer. Its a good story has several plot twists great character development.. But the multiplayer has gotten worse. Not enough nice people play this game anymore so now its a lot of overpopulated servers filled with mexicans that try to kill everybody.. Usually they are about rank 300. I got in today and instantly got spawnkilled for about 5 minutes until i was able to escape.. I then got killed more and more so it wasnt fun..

2016-10-09,0,0,886,False,Recommended,The most outrageous game in so many ways! Forget politically correct this game is the exact opposite and if you are a SJW or easily triggered individual I would stay away. GTA5 is equally offensive to races religions ethnicities and most everyone who plays. That is what makes it such a great immensely funny game to play. The game itself is stunning if your PC can handle it. I dare say the world map of SA is the greatest multiplay map ever created. It is so intricate that after 500+ hours I find new places and things everytime I play. The level of detail is truly epic. I cannot even really describe all the stuff you can do. tennis golf darts parachuting bike motorcycle car racing stunts own apartments garages business space airplanes jets helicopters boats jetski's atv's shooting ranges and we are not even discussing missions heists crates resupplys and literally a 100 other activities. Did I mention you can steal cars too? It is a daunting game to learn to play. Just the keymapping for PC players will keep you busy for awhile tweaking and finding your style and needs. I suggest playing the single player mode to get a feel for the game. The voice acting plot and gameplay are the gold standard in RPG 1st/3rd person gaming. This is not some little slap together game. Rockstar had GTA4 to build upon and even it stands the test of time. So if you are not easily offended and want to play arguably the best most famous game franchise in the world you cannnot miss GTA5.,Grand Theft Auto V

When I finally get back online I start doing free roam missions and other things to get cash and level up. I go back on to check out the After Hours DLC two days later (25 July) and a message pops up ""You have been banned from playing GTA Online permenantly please return to Story Mode"".

2017-09-05,0,0,352,False,Recommended,So i've been playing this game for a while now not just 50 hours like it says on my profile i've been playing since the launch on Xbox 360. The game has a great story best one so far if you ask me I have not completed the story on pc barely touched it but I did complete it on Xbox 360 and it was great. On pc there has been some additions I believe like the ability to become an animal by drinking an unknown formula and also some known bugs has been fixed I believe. Aside from the story there's the online mode which allows you to experience Gta 5 with your friends this is not the storymode tho here you are free to take whatever path you desire. When I returned from Xbox 360 to PC rockstar had removed the funtion to sync characters 1 month before I got it for pc so I had to start over in gta online if you are a returning player I advice you to concider if you really want to start over before buying it for pc.Gta online is very pay to win if you ask me but not nearly as pay to win as it used to be back on xbox 360 you earned very small amounts of money so u had no other choice than to pay to win. Example you want a car that costs $2000000 but you only earn $16000 per mission. These days you can either pay or play the game. Example You still want that car that costs $2000000 but now on pc you can do heists (which you could at the end of xbox 360 to but not at the start) and earn up to $300000 per heist but you can also do ceo missions and collect stock up to $1000000 per full stock. Gta online is extremelly fun and I recommend trying it out alot!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-21,0,0,852,False,Not Recommended,"This man speaks the truth XxAarchangeLxXAvatar 0 https //support.rockstargames.com/hc/en us/community/posts/115008468388 GTA V Online Is DEAD GTA V Online Is DEAD.As we all are greatly aware of this game has a bunch of problems. From simple clothing pieces not working to full blown bull crap about the overly armored APC and Homing Launcher being garbage we still expect Rockstar to fix this game. I'm here to outline that this will NOT happen.I'm sure they will do some maintenance to things that are relatively easy for them usually fixing irrelevant issues or blatantly fixing things that we SHOULD be able to do such as wearing a mask with a helmet. But we now live in the time where GTA V as a game has run its course. I'll be outlining reasons why. FUNDING The first thing putting the nails in the coffin for GTA is finding. They have to pay people to fix the issues that arise and this budget is getting smaller every day. Thus only the absolute most game breaking issues and more importantly (to them) any issue where GTA$ is too easy to obtain will be snuffed out. Anything else thats an issue is moot.PRICES/ SHARK CARDS The price for Shark Cards has gone up as Rockstar is seemingly planning to milk its player base for every penny they can until the coffin is buried. As such they have greatly increased the cost of any new items in the game. The new Gun Runners APC costs around $4 000 000 GTA$ the equivalent to literally $80 USD. The conversion rate is $1 USD / 50 000 GTA$. Yes every MC or CEO mission getting you 20 000 GTA$ is Rockstar giving you $0.33 for wasting 15 minuets of your time. We are nothing but stupid cattle to milk to them it seems.HORRIBLE TECH SUPPORT If you have an issue with the game be wary about weather you choose to contact Rockstar. If it is even remotely related to GTA$ they will make sure you don't break even if anything at all. If your car disappears from your garage though it has literally no legit reason to be gone you'll receive HALF of its worth. Because it's not worth their time to see if your telling the truth they assume you're lying and give you what you'd get at LS Customs. If you want an in game purchase refunded no. NO. NEVER. You'll never get it.NOTHING GOOD TO OFFER Every week or two Rockstar will pull some new game mode and some new items out of a hat (full of modes and items already developed long ago stockpiled and released on an as needed basis mind you) and slap it with the ""X2 GTA$ &amp XP"" label. This is only to keep the player base moderately interested. But its always the same. A new car. A couple new cars for two months then maybe a decent wallet sucking update that you need to have or everyone else will roll over you in Freemode. (APCs and explosive rounds anyone?)REFUSING TO LISTEN TO PLAYERS Easily one of the #1 things that makes a good developer is one who can watch some videos and read some forums and say ""Hmm. People would like THIS or they want THAT fixed."" But Rockstar is run my idiots in suits who care about nothing but profit so its ""Here's your deadline to slap something moderately acceptable together to make money off of."" And to hell with effort.RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 The biggest main reason. Not to say the game itself won't be good but it is what is taking most of Rockstar's funding team and interest right now. Within the next year support and updates for GTA V Online will become stagnant and will halt. The game will be placed into an ""As Is"" state for players to play in. But don't worry! Rockstar will still gladly ram their Shark Card ads up your until they shut down the servers upon the release of GTA 6.MODDED ACCOUNTS Because of the terrible declining and inevitable end of Rockstar's support of GTA V Online the Modded Accounts will take over. Find a website pay $20 and get a new PSN With a level 8000 character with 900 000 000 GTA$ to spend that is completely undetectable by the ""top notch well trained"" members of the Rockstar Support Team. I know of several Modded Account users who have been around since the first month of release on PS3 who Rockstar still hasn't banned. But it doesn't end there.HACKERS The hackers are next. The ones who re write the code to give themselves abilities to become God's in GTA V. Most of witch are Trolls who will abuse everyone in a lobby or lure idiots with ""cash drops"" and make them do stupid nonsense only to get blown up and disconnected from the game. Then when a normal player does advance all it takes is to off the wrong Hacker and you get reset to lvl 1. Maybe forever. Go play some GTA 4 on any console if you want to see what this looks like. So there you have it. If you have any issues with GTA V your best bet is to submit it to your nearest toilet then go sit by a window to see if you can catch the flying *** Rockstar sends your way. But don't forget to spend all your GTA$ then grind for hours in X2 GTA$ modes only to get annoyed with wasting your time and either buying a Shark Card or a Modded Account so that you can actually enjoy the game.Or just a thought find a game with a developer who's not an incompetent money vampire.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-11,0,0,600,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto VSo how do i start with this. After playing this game on a Playstation 3 and now PC i can tell it one of the must have games for console and PC players. The game is just wonderful in all sorts of things but my absolute favourite thing about this game is ""GTA Online"" Sure it can be abit grindy getting cash but atleast its fun in the end and if you got friends to play with even better.The CampaignThe campaign is one of the best written campaign in a very long time. You start of in the middle of a heist in a introduction only zone which involved three characters pullling of a heist. Theese are the three main characters you will be able to switch between later in the game.We first got Lamarr which is the more ""hood"" character of the three he lives in a very getto like place and loves sportcars Then we got Michael probably the most normal of the three he has a family of a single wife and two kids. And the third character ""Trevor"" is the most crazy of the three i won't spoil him to much since he is quite the interesting character. I won't tell much more i don't want to spoil this game to much for anyone thinking about picking it up.GTA OnlineThis is quite along thing to write about but i will try to keep it short. So basically when starting of GTA Online you will be granted a character customization menu where you can change gender face hair and starting clothes. Keep in mind to change your appearance only face wise not gender wise it will set you back 100 000 in game dollars. So make your character good. As soon as this is done you will be prompted into a few tutorials about GTA Online. But it is really simple you do jobs such as races or heists to get more money with this money you can then buy lots of things such as but not limited to Clothes Cars Houses Heist Setups Weapons Modify vehicles and much more. But some of theese things such as modifying cars will set you back alot of in game dollars depending on the upgrades. But then the second thing about GTA Online is the level system. After completing a job or an activity in game you will get ""RP"" which is basically XP. With each few levels you will unlock new things for purchase such as weapon skins clothes vehicle modifications and a bunch more.I'll round this review off here hope you found this useful and get this game if you are thinking about it you will not regret it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-04,0,0,470,False,Not Recommended,At first before all these dlc's kept coming out the game was relatively fun. People were usually either friendly or violent and not just a hacker. Then over time More of these little updates came out introducing more content each costing millions more than the last. If you want a good experience playing this game online it's not possible anymore unless you purchase the in game currency for big bucks ( million in game for 100 bucks irl) Which doesn't last long anymore due to the fact rockstar is a money sucking company that only cares about the money they make. If you're looking for single player modding that's one of the only things that is actually bearable in this game now.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,1077,False,Not Recommended,"Do not buy this game. It has reached a point where it just milks more and more money out of you for useless content. well it's useful. but what would you rather have? 40$ in hand or a flying motorbike in gta?Another thing is that Sucks with the game is that both Rockstar and Take 2 (publisher/R* owner) has time and time again been proved to be VERY lazy with content and straight up anti consumer. ""oh you wanted a veichle all along? well have a car with a gun"".Point two of lazyness and anti consumer. Open IV a program that came into existanceat the time of GTA 4 as a tool for modding singleplayer content in GTA 5 it has since been modified to work on GTA 5 and Max Payne 3. Take 2 saw that Open IV which is the primary modding tool of GTA 5 which had been around since GTA 4 were cutting into their profits through making it so people could have more fun in singleplayer mods based in open IV has been publicy promoted by rockstar btw. Take 2 saw that and didn't llike that so they sent a Cease and desist to the devs to kill open IV They argued that open IV could be used to mod multiplayer despite it hindering you from doing so. TLDR Take 2 took down a modding tool which was used be everyone to mod their offline game controversy they let it go.If you just want to play it I'm not going to stop you but GTA5 isn't worth even 30$ anymore you're essentially buying a mobile game (online mode) with plenty of rip off microtransactions which just happens to have a story mode attached. The story mode (offline) is definitely worth something more then a mobile game but the online mode is an endless grind unless you buy a shark (scam) card. seriously 100$ for 8 million in game and you barely get anything for it. If you only want to play the Story mode which I add is really good just pirate it. no extra content has been released for the story mode since the Ill gotten gains update in 2015 so most likely wherever you torrent it you will get the full experience.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-10,0,0,300,False,Recommended,GTA 5 is a game I have to say is the most bought game in the history of me video gaming. I can easily say I bought this game probably 8 times tops. Most was from buying and selling the PS3 version. The PC version is the same as the console versions but a little bit better. My review will be broken into two sections the single player storyline mode and and GTA Online the multiplayer mode that should be the landscape for American open world games like this.Single player story mode It's the same as the console version so I basically didn't bother to play the PC version. The story is decent as you can take the role of 3 different characters and jump into that character at anytime. There are plenty of missions and lot to do and you will enjoy hours trying to complete everything even after the main story ends.GTA Online This mode is in a league of it's own and with some more time and patience GTA Online can be even greater. Once you get your rank up and start completing heists you will have a garage full of luxury cars motorcycles private jets boats and a high end apartment fairly quickly. The thing is once you complete all the heists either in a crew or as the leader the game gets boring fast. I mean sure you got other modes like Deathmatch Survival Races and other missions but it doesn't feel the same after the heists are done and you bought everything you wanted. You can replay heists but I mean who wants to do that? Yeah it gets boring and repetitive after the heists are done because it seems you're not making any progress other then getting RP to rank up. In conclusion for what it's worth it's definitely a game worth investing your money into and Rockstar should definatly give GTA Online an expansion. More heists and better cribs not just high end apartments. Mansions lofts houses and condos would be nice. Also it would be cool if you had the option to decorate your crib instead of having everything pre made by Rockstar. Also having options to invest your money online instead of offline would be cool but I guess GTA 6 will have all that.Overall 8 out of 10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-13,0,0,60,False,Recommended,A fastistic game that is truly the pinnacle acheivement for the GTA franchise! 60 80 hours of gameplay for the single player game at a normal pace.It's sad that the reviews are so mixed right now... The awesomeness of the single player campaign is being clouded by too many people getting all pissy because of the multiplayer issues. From what I read there's lots of issues with cheaters and unfair banning in the multiplayer scene.But you know this is Grand Theft Auto a game that has never been one for being associated as being a multiplayer title. This franchise has always stood out as a fantastic single player experiance and I think that's how you have to go into this game.If you're looking for a multiplayer GTA? Wait for 6 this was their first real attempt at it and they have a lot to learn from it. They've completly nailed single player at this point so the next frontier is really improving their MP campaignBottom line GET THIS GAME! It's totally worth the full retail price considering how amazing the game is and the massive amount of hours of gameplay you can get. But get it for the single player campaign ONLY and consider the MP a bonus for a few hours of extra entertainment when you're done. If you do that you'll be happy with this purchase.,Grand Theft Auto V

Runs well at maximum settings on my 3770k+16gb+GTX670 OC'd. Multiplayer is addictive and very enjoyable with the right people. I've found more fun out of carrying a friend on a BMX on my hydra as far as possible. However I have had repeated issues with singleplayer data glitching and progress being reset in order to allow the game to remember settings. If you're looking for an enjoyable experience in an open world both singleplayer and multiplayer and enjoy grinding for luxuries it would be well worth taking a look at GTA V.,Grand Theft Auto V

This game had the biggest budget of any onther game it has one of the largest dev team has been out for six years and STILL has a lot of flaws. The menu system is horrible you waste a ton of time waiting and there are too much avoidable loading screens (clouds). Chrashes are still frequent too. It is the little things that make this game objectively BAD. examples When one person does chrash playing anything co op all the other players are ed too all progress gets wiped from that mission. When finishing a setup for a heist you cant directly continue (which you'd want ofc) but everyone gets kicked into freeroam (another 2 min loading) the leader has to go back to his apartment and then as icing on the cake you risk not getting a spot in the lobby as a member. There are more examples but ill stop.All of this is stupid and unavoidable and RS has no excuse for any of this or for regular chrashes. And i didnt even talk about how screwed up the economy is.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-28,0,0,514,False,Recommended,So its about the time I give one of the best games of all time (in my opinion) a PROPER review for the game I have the most hours in. It beaten GMod in terms of hours. JeSus christ i have 500+ hours on this game. That's half a thousand hours.I am a level 131 with alot of things. I own every single gun and I own the best cars fully tuned. I own all properties (apart from the yacht). I REALLY enjoy this game.Scroll down for TL DR!Grand Theft Auto V (abreviated as GTA 5) is a game where you're a criminal you have a gun you kill people killing people feels good you rob a store it goes wrong end up at a hospital types of game essentially what I called a open world crime shooter.But this series has always been the grand father of this kind of series so it exels at it making a normally boring situation in real life like driving at slow speeds in heavy trafic funny as hell with funny dialogue from the people in the car and the ads on the radio. And sometimes a random firefight will start out because a random NPC got bored.So lets talk about the driving and I got a slight point to make about the driving.GTA has always had arcady driving but GTA IV (GTA 4) ruined that by making the cars feel heavy which is a nice thing but it seems to have made everyone forget the original driving of GTA. Fast and arcady.So with the arcade mind style the driving is great its not too hard to control but not too easy.However the vehiculs have weight and it still reminds you that a truck isnt gonna turn instantly theres still some bits of realistic driving that rarely kick in but those are usually when you wanna play the game as a normal person not a psycopath that can carry a minigun and a rocket launcher in his backpocket like it was nothing.The shooting is awesome Its like Max Payne 3 but less gory.Also unlike previous GTA games theres this infinite pocket system to re iterate once you buy a gun from the same type (i.e 2 assault rifles) you keep both instead of dropping the one you had. Its a nice touch and allows you to switch playstyles quickly.There's a nice selection of weapons and there are many guns of the same type. If I remember correctly there are (Counting the online only weapons)14 pistols12 SMGS / LMGS8 ARs / Assault Rifles5 Sniper Rifles18 Melee Weapons7 Heavy Weapons7 Explosives Next up the world.In my opinion this IS the best part of Grand Theft Auto exploring the open world.GTA 5 is located in the fictionnal city of Los Santos a parody of Los Angles in the fictionnal state of San Andreas which is the name of a previous GTA game and a parody of California.Now what makes this world so fun to be in is that it feels alive. If you go in the forest you can hear the sound of distant bikes and the sounds of the local wildlife like wolves and deers.Or if your in the city you're gonna hear the noises of the people around you drinking a coffee maybe talking about that one time where they hit a dog or talking to a female hoping they can get in the girls pants but miserably failing.And did I say the world is HUGE? There's a ocean lakes forests a desert villages. a city abandonned buildings etc. A few days ago I even found locations I didn't even know they were there. There's alot of locations that can make a unscripted police chase feel like a scripted police chase (in a good way). When running from the cops there are so many locations to drive through to lose them or places to hide in. Did I mention there's an entire sewer system under Los Santos?And for the last few things for single player there are mods. I don't really know how to mod the game as I think the game is fantastic as it is already but all I know is that you need a program called OpenIV and a thing called scripthook. And pretty sure you gotta backup your files and stuff incase there's an update. If you don't enjoy a broken scripthookAnd now for a part of GTA where some people enjoy like me myths.GTA pleases original bigfoot hunters from the san andreas days but I wont talk much on it.And now for the infamous Online mode.To be honest its not as bad as everyone thinks well in my opinion.You start off as a person who just arrived in Los Santos (your own character mind you but hes silent so....) and talking to Lamar another resident in Los Santos as he picks you up at the airport he gives you a gun and you get the option to do the tutorial or not.From here you make your own story.From being a hobo on the street to being a criminal mastermind owning illegal buisnesses there's alot of stuff to do in GTA Online.And there are where the issues kick in.To do buisnesses and stuff you need money alot of money we're talking about a million dollars here.You need money to stuff.The missions get a little repetive when you done them all.But luckily for you there's heists which were introduced in the Heists DLC where you need money to host them as you need a high end apartment to start one and one apartment like that costs 215000$. Making that kind of money at level 15 will take a while.But another thing ya need money to make money and that money you lose but that lost money makes you profit. Yeah its pretty weird.It's essentially a GTA MMO.But even from that I still enjoy it it still fun. Well I enjoy ALOT. More playtime is in the online mode then in the single player. It's not the single player is bad its great. Its just that I don't enjoy collecting stuff for too long so 100% this game will be pretty hard for me.EDIT I forgot there's 2 challenges that a new player can do to earn 250k each. Again if you really can't do money that well go on the GTA Online discord and go on #lfg pc and look for someone hosting Act 2 of Doomsday.But really you should think of the online as a bonus thing to do you should not buy the game for JUST the online the fun can be endless yes but thats depending on you. Spend your 30$ expecting a great single player with multi player as a side mode not as a thing your forced to do. Think of the online as a bonus game.But depending on your likes Online is fun as hell. about 450 hours of this game is online.TL DR Freaking awesome game online rough around the edges but its still awesome. Buy it for the single player not the online. Think of the online as a bonus game. Just buy it already its 30$ and 15$ on sale Single player 10/10Online 8.7/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Great story in single player and multiplayer has had alot of content that makes it really fun to roam around and buy cars and do heists and such. However with cheaters and modders in multiplayer it were/are (not sure about the recent update) a terrible experience often times but that were relatively rare and even rarer if you play heists more often than roaming around. Their recently update to remove single player modding took a huge backlash I never used single player mods so I dont have any say in that.

2016-07-26,0,0,988,False,Recommended,10/10 BEST GAME BEST GAMEThis is not a game for 12 year olds so parents don't give your child access to your credit card and steam because they'll ruin another community (that is if this one isn't ruined already P)But aside from that this game is pretty fun! Me and my friends play together on online and we recently did some of the heists. In fact We're almost done with completing all of them. Plus Rockstar recently added stunt races so those have been fun as well. Note though that this game isn't for the feint hearted due to mass robberies and murder and manslaughter that happens in the game ) Graphics are pretty legit but you need a good machine to run it at reasonable speed. I have a decent gaming computer (Custom built) and i run it at 30 60 fps. So if you're wanting to run it off your mom's laptop unless she has an alienware or somethin Don't count on playing it at a good speed.All in all this is a pretty fun game that me and my friends like to play a LOTI give this 10 committed in game crimes out of 10.,Grand Theft Auto V

But again its all ruined by either hackers that own everything and are killing without being near you. Hey I like to battle and blow sh*t up like the next person but not at other fun expense. If we are all messing around cool I'm all for it. But to follow you around when you spawn just to blow you up with the newest helicopter.

2018-04-01,0,0,703,False,Recommended,"Gta 5 easily lives up to the franchise's legacy of story rich immersive sandbox single player and improves upon its predecessors in an way we should almost expect from Rockstar forever. I have only two negative things to say. context I played through story on ps4 years ago recently bought for PC 1. I didn't enjoy EVERY mission in the story mode but there was certainly one I can single out for being my least favorite the yoga mission. Yep spoiler no alerts because this mission is painstaking unavoidable and impossible to play with the standard game audio because of the yoga instructor and the frequent robotic new age comments over and over. I ""get it"" but I hate playing it. On the other hand Rockstar gave us mission replay. 2. Online banwaves and cheaters I played for a full 15 hours of GTA Online PC before I was given a 1 month ban for no reason. I'm sure people reading this will say ""cheater deserves ban"" but my suspension was rescinded 4 5 days after submitting a Rockstar Support ticket and the contents of my account were not reset. I am still able to play unhindered by bans at this very moment but I was very frustrated because I witnessed alot of cheaters was killed by them and had large objects like a UFO attached to my player forcing me to relog yet somehow the anti cheat selected me. I am now finding Youtube videos popping up about Massive Banwave that caused similar experiences for many other legitimate players. I did some research during my suspension to try to figure out how I triggered the mindless anti cheat and found that I had services running for many programs which were not allowed along side gta online such as Skype Bandicam TS/Discord etc. I feel like Rockstar has missed the mark with their vague TOS which prohibits ""...anything that interferes with player experience"" which arguably could be any of the content we all enjoy and purchased the game for. I clearly understand the cheating is a problem but GTA Online has been out for years now and its still experiencing technical and support issues not even having allowed more than the original 32 players per lobby. Its not THAT bad you can ""Find New Session"" if your lobby is boring. 3. Months later UPDATE* I am still unbanned and playing GTA online on a near daily basis even after purchasing all of the in game properties I wished to own. There's still cheaters galore just like any other game with an economy or guns ... Still extremely satisfied to own I can't think of a single better all around PC game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,Zero innovation!GTA 5 ... What an awful game it is! The gameplay offers nothing new compared to former GTA titles. You still cannot drive to random houses and be able to enter them. In fact you still aren't able to enter most buildings. You cannot even take NPCs hostage. Most of the gameplay freedom in this so called sandbox game is related to vehicles but we already know all that from former games of the series. Don't expect any new gameplay in this game! A game like for instance Skyrim offers far more freedom.When I played GTA 5 I felt like my IQ is decreasing by one every minute. You start the game playing this black guy and during the first parts of the game you will hear nothing but f*ck motherf*cker n*gger sh*t talk. This gets annoying pretty fast! Not everyone is into this childish adolescent level of dialogue but I'm afraid that is what Rockstar intentionally caters to.The only part that obviously has improved is the graphics. But then again I've seen certainly better graphics in other games and the one in GTA 5 doesn't warrant 60Gb of game data. Talking about the game data volume ... Nearly 60Gb ... Gasp! I wonder what warrants the game needing that much data! It can't be the graphics it can't be the audio either. What is it used for??But my biggest complaint is the lack of gameplay innovation. Looking realistically at it the game offers very few freedom. It wants to be the original crime simulator but you cannot even satisfy your inner sadist and do things like taking hostages raiding family homes torture victims... The game looks tame compared to what my mind can come up with.All you can do is steal cars kill people and cause mayhem until you have a five star wanted rating and the national guard is on your heels. But we had that all already in all the former GTA games. Don't expect anything new here! You will be disappointed!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-27,0,0,607,False,Recommended,GTA 5 is great for single player. The online is horrible unless you do a private session with friends. It is an endless grindfest like everyone says customer support is god awful and modders still exist. Rockstar has finally made the drop money mod disappear but you will still run into people that can blow up a tank with 15 shots from a smg and take no dmg when you shoot them 100 times in the head with the .50 sniper. Luckily I received over 200 million in game currency from modders during the 2 year mod fest that was GTA online and now I don't care about the grind because I have everything I would want to buy. However the game still sucks online because the community just shoots each other and shouts random obscenities all game long. The servers lag horribly at times whole lobbies can drop. But at least you can't get free money to buy things and enjoy the game right? Atleast someone can walk through 5000+ shots from a gatling gun and stab you to death right? Atleast you can buy 8 million in in game funds for $100 right? If you buy a $100 sharkcard for 8 million in game money then you are mentally disabled. If you play this game online long enough you will feel mentally disabled. If you were responsible for the creation of GTA online you are probably mentally disabled. 10/10 online says the newly mentally disabled.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-13,0,0,381,False,Recommended,Great game and has given me many hours of entertainment. However GTA Online is becoming boring. Everything you buy costs millions of ingame dollars and to get this you have to grind ingame for many hours. Or you buy shark cards like Rockstar wants. They are no longer trying to make the game good and are now just trying to make more and more money. If they implemented a faster way for players to make money ingame then the game might just be fun again. The bunker air shipment etc. aren't helping players efficiently make money. These strategies almost never help at all because of hackers or normal players who want to ruin your experience by destroying your shipments. As a whole there is no good way to buy new things in this game anymore. However if you don't mind the hours on top of hours of grinding to buy one thing then the game is great.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-13,0,0,94,False,Recommended,"So i read alot of the reviews for this game. I mainly played on the Xbox 360 and ran into my fair share of modders on that console. Converting over to the PC there is ALOT more modders but with that said 8 out of the 10 modders i have met have been friendly and non toxic at all. The others that i have met will simply kill everyone in the lobby and either leave or do it until you leave so sure you will have a few toxic ones here and there.As far as the game itself it is a solid game. The online portion of it is very interesting and there is never a lack of things to do. With all the DLC you will have ""dailies"" that will keep you busy resupplying your bunker and other factories and on top of that selling supplies to get money..Doing heists and other missions are another story you will waste alot of time finding a good group of players that will either not dive head first into a fire fight and instantly get killed or just leave before the missions starts. With heists i would strongly recommend finding a group to play with instead of doing randoms. All in all i love this game there is so much to do and if you feel like flying a attack helicopter and blowing up just about anything then you will have loads of fun. One last thing money....it is hard to grind for if you dont have a entire day to dedicate or a great group of people that wont leave mid heist on you...missions need to give more cash as well as other minor tasks need to give more cash just my opinion but as a player that solos it is hard to get any kind of money that will give the ability to buy cars houses etc without purchasing the GTA shark cards.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-04,0,0,113,False,Recommended,I would generally recommend this game but with reservation. As such I will start with the cons.Cons Storybook approach means players control characters but only superficially which means lame choices are forced on players and naturally I use the word choice quite liberally as there aren't any. Books are better for stories because you aren't forced to act out the ridiculous choices of others but maybe that's just me. I want more option to change the story and there isn't any.Helicopters have WAY to much wobble.Cars steer from the center and worse they are too light by far. Even the incredibly slow garbage truck bounces around like it's made of tin foil.Not keyboard friendly in general. This reduces functionality beyond the above issues.Vehicles are tethered. Enter a street race as a simple way to see this and don't boost. You do well the others accelerate phenominally. You do poorly they slow down.Related but seperate from the above the AI(not every single one but a steady small stream) actively antagonize you. It's a little to transparent that cars swerve into you and obstruct you for no better reason than because you are there. A simple example of this is where a reg citizen blocks you and drives slowly. The second you pass they speed up. Crash and they gas into you. They speed change to be in the intersection when you will arrive as well. There is plenty more but you get the idea and it is easy enough to compensate but it is transparent and annoying.Pros The story line is fairly entertaining.The controls are good enough to enjoy the game.It remains relatively true to the franchise. Summary It could be a lot better but frankly the gaming industry has forgotten games are for fun first and profit second. If the competition were where it could be this would not be recommended but compared to what IS available it is.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,194,False,Recommended,San Andreas is back in this fantastic installment to the Grand Theft Auto series. I was actually surprised how realistic and beautiful the game turned out to be. First person mode makes GTA V feel like a completely different but immersive game. NPC artificial intelligence and interaction had improved dramatically but still not up to par with other games that have better AI. The plenty of graphical options will make any PC enthusist cream in their pants as Tessellation Advanced Shadows TXAA 4K Textures and a lot more are available with supreme hardware optimization. Animals bikes aircraft side missions immersive atmosphere and ambient enviornments make Story Mode surreal as GTA Online provides the most in depth experience ever seen within the series. Aside from disappearing cars/people even with extended distances maxed out some lengthy loading screens especially in multiplayer some hacker invasions in multiplayer and uninteresting/dull main character personalities Rockstar has definitely redeemed themselves within the PC community. This game does have Nexus mod support but installing mods will render multiplayer unavailable for obvious reasons. Multiplayer does have a lot of content but the community is often bad and is riddled with hackers so it may just pay to play Campaign with mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

I play GTA 5 every week for an hour or two to release some steam over the weekend. Yet I feel like I cannot recommend this game hearing the attrocious actions of Take Two against the modding community. I personally never tried mods fearing a ban on online. There's your first issue no support from the side of the company on enabling mods. Still I was planning on trying some mods knowing that it was possible if I just didn't go online while having the mod installed. Now Take Two even made that impossible basically banning the most used modding tool. Sad.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-22,0,0,571,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have tested this game on two graphics cards a GTX 770 and a GTX 1060 the 770 to replicate a Budget pc and the 1060 to replicate a good pc you can run The game medium settings with a 770 at around 45 60 fps Vsync enabled and of course the game on the 1060 is fine. The game seems very grindy and I would recommend against buying it if you only have the odd weekend to play as the game is hard in online you don't get money very fast and of course this is to get you to buy shark card (You pay real money for in game money) I would recommend against getting this game if you are younger and can't be trusted as there are Female strippers and drug use!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-23,0,0,55,False,Not Recommended,In my personal opioion this game is fun it really is however is gets really repetitve. I didnt play the story i just focused on GTA online and it was fun for like the first 6 months then it just got really repetive. Honestly I dont see how this game is still alive. It gets boring they add free content but it takes too long to execute. You either grind the heists or missions or you can buy shark cards and spend money just to buy a car then custiomize then BAM! You're outta money and have to buy more. Due to me not playing the story and only focousing on GTA online this game is average. Rating 6/10.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-07-03,0,0,213,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is truly an amazing video game. Everything is fantastic from the amazing open world to the intricate yet intriguing story. The story really succeeds at drawing you in and makes you feel connected to the main characters. There is so much to do ranging from exploring the vast open world to getting angry at other players online. In my opinion online is only ok when trying to play alone or random players but with friends it is a lot of fun. The only con of this game is that it is very hard to play/run with any computer but it is understandable based on how intricate the game is. 10/10P.S. Modding can impact your game immensly and can be a lot of fun when used properly.(Please keep OpenIV),Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,I have an Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 4GB of ram Intel Quad Core i7 and a good monitor. It's a relativelyt cheap gaming PC cost about $1 000 but most other games run almost impeccably on it such as Cities Skylines PAYDAY The Heist and Call of Duty Black Ops 2. However this game uses just about half my ram and while it looks magnificent it runs like dung. During the first police chase of the story mode the game droppped to 10 15 fps and the game almost froze. Horrendous.At that point I thought I might find some salvation in Online but NOPE still tons of lag and even a few server overloads. Also the races were incredibly laggy and games of Last Team Standing are fun when you can actually see your opponent. I realize that some people especially people with high end gaming PCs might disagree and say that I just have little RAM. However I shouldn't have to pay $200 or more for 8 or more GB of RAM or more than $1 500 for a high end PC just to play a good looking game. 3/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar doesnt give a about someone ruining your experience they only care about money so if you take money instead of buying shark money you will end baned.,Grand Theft Auto V

For the most part you might not have a problem but then you might run into a person who can't be killed and revels in killing you over and over. That's frustrating to be sure.I'd say ""yes"" I'd recommend this only because I guess most people would enjoy it.Then again there are those who wouldn't enjoy it myself being one of them.

2015-05-06,0,0,83,False,Recommended,Here's the thing. The method currently being used to mod isn't really what most people think of as modding.ScriptHook is an example of DLL Assembly Code Injection which sneaks foreign code into the process in order to provide a method for an additional payload of code to hook/modify the game process in memory.The problem with this is that there is no way to tell what the payload is. Nor is there anyway to prevent the payload from working in only some areas of the game.That's the point a lot of people don't understand here we're not talking addons. We're talking DLL files that have been modified to allow a user to run ANY additional code they want and have the game accept it and execute it. There are no limits to what can be run with this and the trainer that comes as the included demonstration of scripthook is a very benign usage of the potential.To give you an example of the dangers of allowing DLL Injected clients to connect to multiplayer servers or any other client for that matter until recently in Reign of Kings hackers using the same method that scripthook uses were using injected assembly code into DLLs to modify files on the computers of other players on the servers they connected to and in many cases even the files on the servers themselves.When we're talking about DLL Injection there is no such thing as singleplayer mod or multiplayer mod. It's just foreign code being run anywhere the user wants. The only way to prevent it is to check the integrity of the DLLs of any client on connection and cutting the connection as soon as a disprecency is found. It may seem like overkill but the alternative is a complete loss of security for anyone using gta online.,Grand Theft Auto V

Ingredients To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan Romano &amp Asiago)Note grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling. In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Grand Theft Auto V

So the game removed my 150h of farming because I wanted to have fun... So please dont waste money on this I also have been banned for modding to give me money for less than an hour (also to play around with my friends). But pepole how mod to annoy players are not banned because rockstar keeps their sweet sweet money and potentially gets more from the players how get killed and want to get better so they buy them money. Players like me how mod just to have fun should not be banned as servrirley and certanly not get their characters reset...

So they ain't living up to what they should be..For a game that's been out for almost 2 years.. It feels like a Ubisoft watchdog cash in where they just ported a shity console version..

2015-05-20,1,2,130,False,Recommended,"GTA V's Los Santos is the most fully realized open world I've ever had the pleasure of spending time in as a gamer. Cheers to Rockstar for taking the time and devoting development resources to do right by the PC version of this game. These days a ""port"" means offering the game to the PC market while doing the bare minimum to allow the game to play on WIndows. That means ports without custom graphics settings ports that still have tooltips and references to console controls and ports plagued by bugs.Rockstar did't go that route. Instead they spent a year and a half working on a true PC version of the game with higher res textures more detailed models better weather effects more cars more songs on the radio higher traffic density spectacular lighting effects etc. In other words all the fun stuff us PC players like the stuff we often lament because other devs can't be bothered to customize the experience for the PC crowd's more powerful hardware.I gladly paid full price for this game and I'll gladly support any developer who takes the PC market seriously.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-04,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,"Jack of all trades master of none.Singleplayer ""Grand Theft Auto"" indeed almost every mission is simply stealing and/or driving a vehicle from point A to point B. Pathetic customization each of the 3 premade characters has only a single preset vehicle and chooses their outfits at random even if you dress them. Aside from 3 heists a couple of air missions and one single car chase (of which there are many) no story missions are even remotely interesting. Remember those missions in Assassin's Creed where you walk next to somebody while they exposition at you? That's what 98.7% of the missions in GTA5 are except you're driving a car instead of walking. There is no sense of progression there is nothing to do in the world you aren't conquering districts or building an empire or moving to bigger and better pads not even upgrading your characters or doing anything at all. Its basically just one long cutscene with hours and hours of boring driving. Multiplayer ( if they ever make it functional)Fixes my complaints about singleplayer. Offers a wide variety of activities as well as the ability to create your own as well as detailed character customization. Unfortunately the multiplayer is literally unplayable because of the godawful lobby system and long loading screens. The multiplayer experience in this game unless you're just messing around in a private session with friends is the equivalent of waiting for an MMO Dungeon Finder that then kicks you out of the dungeon before you can ever complete it. * Because Singleplayer and Multiplayer modes are so different certain features are marked with (SP) or (MP) if the feature only applies to one mode. + Ocean Waves+ Ingame iPhone+ Fast travel taxis+ Headlight toggles+ Custom waypoints+ (MP) Passive mode+ (SP) Loads once ever+ Detailed environments+ (SP) Slowmo weapon wheel+ Interesting looking lights at night+ (MP) Tools for user created content+ (MP) Rewarding progression system+ (SP) Randomized storymode dialogue+ Voiced and acted/animated cutscenes+ (SP) 30+ hour storymode though a lot of it is drive time padding+ (SP) Slowmo toggles but only for specific characters in specific situations+ (SP) The 3 character system is such a bad gimmick. 90% of the time you can't even freely switch between them. And even though there are 3 of them there's no coop. + FPS mode is just another gimmick and not a viable gameplay option.+ (SP) The story ending while satisfying feels like it was forced in when the devs got tired of adding missions to drive back and forth. The characters are given no motivation to finally end things. Awful checkpoints (MP) Laggy desync System resource hog No preset graphic options (MP) Awful mission lobbies (MP) Can't tell whose talking Clunky controls and movement (MP) Insta fail mission objectives (MP) No vote to skip cutscenes host can do it Radio stations all suck and can't be customized (MP) Many long loading screens for every mission (MP) If any player dies in a mission the mission fails (SP) Bonus objectives not displayed until after the missions Most buildings don't have interiors even the few you can purchase Cop agro isn't a meaningful or interesting distraction just an annoyance Regularly drops controller input don't have this problem with any other game (SP) Purchasing properties seems pointless they don't even come close to RoI (MP) Unlock popups repeatedly popup if you die not sure if this is a bug or what (SP) Empty city no collectibles no activities very few side quests nothing to do 'Extended Shadows' puts a weird shadowless box on the ground around the player Falling 20 feet or hopping out of a car will insta kill you. Realistic maybe. Fun no. (SP) Endgame psychiatric report every single thing in it was insulting my playstyle? (MP) If any player leaves during a mission the mission fails which can happen before it even starts (MP) Lamar who I hated more than most of the villains in SP is the main character in the multiplayer story Boring driving vehicles feel slow handbrake turns aren't possible collisions feel weak and annoying. This is no Burnout Paradise City. (MP) Broken lobby system. Interrupts gameplay. Takes forever to find players. Seemingly launches countless versions of similar game modes with 2 players instead of filling ones that already exist. (SP) The ridiculous amount of money from heist missions makes all other actives in the world pointless not that there are many anyway Being an HD port of a last gen console game the graphics won't blow you away. They also don't perform especially well considering. Waypoints don't show in world and don't show distance or a minimap path unless you're in a vehicle Mindless combat. Take cover behind object peek out to auto lock onto anything in front of you spray for half a second until it dies repeat. This worked much better in RDR with 1shot1kill weapons the deadeye system and rewards for headshots. Missions fail because friendly NPCs die because objectives aren't clear because there's no way to restore health because of insta deaths because of split second timing because your vehicle got stuck Austin Power style and/or because of many more ridiculous reasons* For all the QQ about hackers I haven't seen a single one in 8 hours of online play.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-22,1,8,337,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is truly a phenomenal game and quite possibly the best game of our time. I've played GTAV on both XBOX 360 and PC version.Its very being is satire of contemporary America which accounts to its brilliant sense of humour. The graphics are gorgeous and its options are plentiful even more so with modding community. The storyline is compelling and never gets in the way of your own independent exploring of Los Santos and San Andreas. The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable beyond comparison. The online feature of GTA V expands the game even further with more content and updates let alone ride with your friends wrecking havoc across the beauty of Los Santos.The online feature does get more attention than the singleplayer and recent events regarding OpenIV ban have made modding obsolete for the time being. Regardless GTA V remains a masterpiece.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-02,0,0,241,False,Recommended,Look the game is fantastic. It's just what i always wanted. It's great the graphics are nice too. But if you are buying it just for online then i will not recommend it for you. Alot of the missions are forcing you to join in a public lobby which it doesn't sound bad. But if you really want it then you will face Hackers Griefers and Try Hards. Let me explain why that will be big problem for you 1.Hackers The hackers will probably use God mod Infinity Ammo (I think) Seeing you thru walls and the most deadly one dropping money for you. Why Dropping money for you is bad well it can get you banned PERMANENTLY. But i've heard for friends that there are some money that they can drop you that can't ban you (i am not 100% sure if that is real)?2.Griefers Well they will grief. I haven't seen a grief in game but if you want to see one before buying the game then go watch a video what they do.And Finally Try Hards These guys will just ruin your experience. If you are doing a mission they will kill you and you have to start the mission again (and probably lose money). If you just want to buy the game for online and roleplay then download FiveM.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-29,0,0,212,False,Recommended,Before I start I have a little message for all the negative reviews. Just because Rockstar had some shady marketing schemes on the summer sale does NOT mean the game is bad. Reviews are so that you can be informed on how good a game is not complaining about sales schemes. You aren't helping anyone by doing it.Anyways this is a very very fun game. You will need a decent computer but you probably already know that. It seems like many people get this game for GTA Online and while it IS fun the singleplayer is so much better. The story has lots of jokes and its overall very enjoyable. Gunplay and driving is also smooth but I would reccomend a controller. As far as online goes be wary of hackers. Also don't expect to make friends. Everyone on online wants to kill eachother. Public lobbies are practically deathmatch on the entire map.,Grand Theft Auto V

So I downloaded this game mainly to try modding and to also play some online with my friends. I downloaded a few mods carelessly just to see if they worked without me setting up anything else (They didn't work obviously). But when I tried to join GTA online it crashed. After attempting to download a mod manager because of the crappy modding support I attempted to join the game again and it worked. But the next I came on and it said I was banned without telling me any information on why I was banned or how to get unbanned. So that is why I think the game sucks.,Grand Theft Auto V

Not a matter of my hardware or connection the servers are GTA online is nice idea but there really isn't much to do except screwing around killing other people random events or trolling. You can do missions but they don't feel like part of the world when you have to go always go through 10 minutes of loading (and often 5 minutes of cutscene which you cannot skip even when you play through the same mission 10th time) breaks the immersion. Also the coin you make is way too few considering how expensive everything is (even the bullets you used cost a fortune). Doing missions with others with everyone having to do their own part was really exciting at first but when I hit level 15 I was already starting to get bored of it. It had turned into a grind and the god AWFUL LOADING TIMES make it even WORSE!! You also have to grind to get level because all the cool stuff has level requirement.Not to mention some of the missions are hard as hell enemies are bulletspongies and they are crawling out of your butt I think I'd do more damage slapping them with my,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-14,0,0,718,False,Not Recommended,Amazing game. The story and characters are great. Online mode is very fun. The problem is that if stutters and crashes very frequently making online missions especially longer ones such as heists impossible to complete. Not everyone has problems but many many people do and you will find them on every forum that talks about gta 5. I've done everything I can from update drivers to a total malware purge (and yes I meet the recommended specs). Rockstar's support team has been neglecting and rockstar doesn't acknowledge that there's a problem on their end. I would absolutely not recommend buying this until the crashing issues are patched.

2015-10-31,0,0,108,False,Recommended,Superb game with astounding system resource managment allowing for my mid level laptop to play on crisp high level graphics settings. I've played only the online portion of the game and find it to be essentially perfect leaving me with only one comment to make on online matchmaking and session loading the online sessions understandably have difficulty finding populated sessions for me when I decide to play in the middle of the night. This results in me being placed in foreign populated sessions typically with Russians. The issue here is that everyone's ping is through the roof and lag is abundant. So far as I can think of this is my fault and Rockstar manages this state of affairs just fine. With one exception...foreign servers tend to have hackers abound! Anyway I play with an Xbox 360 controller and the heists provide (truly) endless hours of entertainment cooperative enjoyment rewards achievements and plenty of laughs to boot. ALWAYS play with a headset or microphone. The online portion of this game is so tactically enhanced when teamwork via live audio communication is allowed. Honestly this game provides more cooperative satisfaction than mainstream FPS's. The verdict is in ladies and gentlemen 5/5. A perfect installment to the dazzling franchise!,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V has lots of customization to the vehicles (mostly at bennys) And you dont need to enter the strip club if you dont want to (I havent yet and dont plan to) GTA V has plenty of guns and gear for your charecter... I would get GTA V if you are around the 13 14 age becuase of the blood and violence. BUT rockstar will ban you if you are in a lobby with a modder not all the time but it has happend. Try not to get a money drop you do have a risk of getting banned. With the new update Rockstar is more serious about modders in the GTA comunity so DONT take the risk of getting banned also i would'nt recommend making a modded account because Rockstar can detect it and ban you right away.

All keys are rebindable ( you Fallout 4)!The let down comes when you realize the economy has been simplified down to one element the stock market. You'll do countless missions where you get ""screwed over"" or generally find that the payout is very near zero. If you want to customize your car you're crippling yourself because you need capital for the stupid stock market to have any type of progression end game. To make matters worse if you complete certain quests before building up a ton of capital you might as well start over. Give me cash for crimes I didn't pay to play day trader simulator.It's pretty clear to me that the singleplayer end game was intentionally gimped to push you into online play. I enjoyed what was there of the single player game but I quickly lost interest when I realized I'd done some quests ""out of order."" Screw that.My thumbs down isn't so much that it's a bad single player game not worth $40 (on sale). It's totally worth that.

2017-06-16,1,1,956,False,Not Recommended,"I hate Take two interactive. That's not the only reason for a thumbs down though. Since OpenIV is shutdown mod support and deving will wither and die (EDIT okay so they changed their minds but they deserve to eat anyway them). For this reason alone I cannot recomment purchasing GTAV. The story is good I admit but for the price the game is asking I don't think it's enough.Then you have the online game that is riddled with insanely grindy gameplay yielding very little cash while having you sit around waiting for literally hours looking at slow slow loading screens. Probably 20% of my online time has been spend looking at loading screen or wasted waiting forever in a lobby to get populated only to see some kind of matchmaking error in the middle of the mission which results in everyone getting booted back to freeroam (going back to freeroam also has a looong loading screen). There have been too many occations where I had 30 min or so to play and thought ""hey lets do a few missions to get some cash and rp"" only to spend all 30 min on loading screens broken matchmaking waiting in lobby.....Then you have the insane prices of items in online. It's despicaple really. To get the large apartments motorcycleclub businesses gunrunning bunker cool cars and military vehicles/helicopter weapons and ammo etc you would have to grind mindlessly for many thousands of hours. Yes MANY THOUSANDS of hours of boring repetetive extremely grindy gameplay.Also at the normal price on Steam the prices for both the game and the shark cards are ludicrously high. Let me tell you the price is insanely high especially if you want to purchase shark cards (other vendors out there sell them for 10% of the price on Steam. It simply cannot be recommended to buy them on Steam for this fact alone). I wouldn't recommend buying shark cards anyway though... TLDR Stay away from this humongous stinking pile of cashcow turd. Though if you are getting it anyway I recommend purchasing it from a vendor that for sells a bundle that has both the game + 8mill gta$ for around 30$ (half the price and with an added 8mill gta$. compare that to the 60$ Steam price with 0 gta$). That way you may be able to easily buy enough stuff in online to have a somewhat enjoyable time for a somewhat reasonable price. If you live in EU buying such a 30$ deal is even better since the Steam price is 60EUR and the euro being more valuable than the dollar.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-23,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,Plays like garbage. It's one of those games where the animators were never told 'no' so you press W and it takes five minutes for your character to turn around and build up momentum before you actually move. You fight the controls more than you do enemy NPCs. Very 'cinematic' but plays worse than a Telltale game.Written by a twelve year old. If you still watch South Park in 2018 you might get something out of it but then you've got bigger problems. It's not clever it's just obnoxious.There's little real progression. In the old games you could at least tolerate the lazy quest design and writing until you unlocked the third island but there is no second or third island in GTA5. Within a couple of hours you'll gain access to aircraft. So what's the player's incentive to do another mission full of characters clunky shooting and Trevor screaming all his lines?DRM nightmare. I didn't touch the game for a few months then when I tried to get back in to it I had to log in to Steam then log in to 'Rockstar's Social Club'. Steam is already DRM why the hell do you need your own DRM crap too? I'll never touch the Online crap yet you still need to go through this to play a singleplayer game. Rockstar asks for a username and password when you sign up which I wrote down but then demands your email to actually log in so why the hell did you ask for a username? Took me half an hour to find the old Rockstar confirmation email and figure out which email address I needed to log in with. Then it made me re agree to something like ten different EULAs/ToS (not an exaggeration) followed by a nightmare are you human recapcha test.I'm probably not allowed to recommend piracy but if you really want to play this mess it may be the objectively superior option and pirates may get a better version of the game than paying customers.,Grand Theft Auto V

Then when i got some money YES I GOT MONEY DROPPED i had fun but one day money got removed... DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET MONEY IN GTA V ONLINE. A CAR COSTS 3M Dollars thats not normal. It would be normal if money would be easier to make but the game isnt fun without mods and as we know modding online EVEN IN CLOSED SESSION gets you banned.

End of 2017 update The online portion of the game is completelly out of wack now a days theres every sort of military vehicle imaginable now and every random joe uses them to grief others anything they add has insane prices (a jacket? 50k plz a car? 1 5mil plz etc) and theres still no new heists still no stock market in online (thats been in limbo since 2013) and all they add these days are ridicilous gamemodes things like racing tiny cars (not rc tho because that would fit to much with gta's past) or a straight off pubg ripoff and dont even get me started on like tron lightcycles and batmobiles just wow way to sell out your franchise R*,Grand Theft Auto V

The Storyline(How is the storyline how thrilling it is how much I liked it and so on)3. Multyplater(GTA Online)4. How is the game itselfTLDR AT THE FINAL1. So MY PERSONAL SCORE is 9.1/10 I will explain why is 9.1/10 and not 10/102. The storyline is great the action is really good the plot is fantastic and ofc the shooting is really good3. GTA Online is a fantastic idea that made me buy this game on PC because I have it on PS3 and it was cracked so the cracked MP servers were garbage only hackers and modders I expected GTA Online on PC to be a lot different from the one on PS3 but it was just a bit different people WITHOUT hacks and mods wanted money from the people WITH hacks and mods and that in my eyes is a really stupid thing if you ing want money go ing do a heist or even buy shark cards witch would be the most idiotic idea ever or like the idiots(modders) do GET THE A MOD! A friend of mine took mods because ""There were too many ing hackers and he couldnt bare it anymore"" I wanted to ask him a question WHY THE DO YOU WANT MODS? WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE ING GAME IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE THINGS YOU SHOULD HAVE WORKED FOR?Evry time the I join a lobby a hacker is in it Thats why I said 9.1/10 if all the hackers would be gone i would make it 11/10.4.
