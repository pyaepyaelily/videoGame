2018-11-11,0,0,27,False,Recommended,Fun and entertaining game due to its simplicity and solid gameplay. Rocket League doesn't have power ups or different tiers. Instead every car has the same speed and abilities making every match as fair as possible. The microtransactions in this game are all cosmetic so performance is purely based upon skill. Double jumping at the right time to make that save flipping your car mid air to perform a perfect shot activating boost to reach the ball before your opponent does. In a time where every game tries to be bigger and more over the top it's a breath of fresh air to play something simple that is actually fun.,Rocket League®

All my cosmetics that I worked hard to get are now only half of what they offer with new banners cars and what not the matchmaking is awful being matched against clearly better than me and my teammates skill level not to mention the toxicity that has arisen in the game where I cannot finish a game without someone leaving my match and sarcasticcly using the chat options. Thanks I've had a good 200hrs worth this game but if you are a newcomer to rocket league or haven't played in a while I dont reccomend this. The experience is just not what it used to be. If I could be asked to write a review for this a year a go I would have given it a solid reccomendation as the game is great but now its just the community aspects and a few development changes that make me urk. Sad really and i'm rambling now. Damn it.,Rocket League®

The ammount of skill you obtain is unreal and aside from some server issues and toxicity from players who cant take accountability this game is fun.

2017-10-17,0,0,412,False,Recommended,"edit at the top for visibility I've seen a lot about the community for this game being toxic. This is just not a valid reason to rate the game negatively. In this game salty or toxic people do nothing to impede your play (unless they grief). You can completely ignore them and focus on yourself. You can turn chat off or mute them (and still have enough to communicate with your team) matches are five minutes so there's no worrying about having to deal with them for a long time etc. Players who are concerned about this need to learn some self control use the tools at their disposal and enjoy an otherwise amazing game. The best game I own. It has everything you could want in a multiplayer game. Tons of customization simple but deep mechanics multiple game modes etc. The community is generally nice and even when they aren't matches are five minutes long you won't have to deal with toxic players for long. Five minutes is a perfect match length that makes the game good in short bursts or for long gaming days. The trainings (both included and custom) and the workshop maps offer hours of gameplay just improving your skills or messing around in obstacle courses. Ultimately the best thing about this game is that you will get out of it what you put into it. If you don't want to spend hours getting better at the various and difficult advanced mechanics you don't have to you can still have plenty of fun. If you do want to you will feel a huge sense of accomplishment when you finally pull of a flick shot a wall aerial etc. No other game gives you the resources to get better and rewards you so nicely when you use them both psychologically and ""materially"" via season rewards which continue to be sick. Finally the developers continue to add content items modes cars and quality of life improvements.",Rocket League®

2017-04-09,0,0,308,False,Not Recommended,To put this in context rocket league has made over $100 000 000.Matchmaking is completely unable to match us with people of the same rank. EVERY game they put us against teams who have at least 2 players with full ranks higher than us. Like how does that make sense someone please tell me.Today we played as a gold1 gold1 gold2 team against a platinum and 2 gold 3 (a fat cheers right there) lost 5 nil had to forfeit with 3 mins left and then it put us against the same team for the next game. WTF. That is broken. completely broken. unplayable and this is from a 100 million dollar game.JUST HIRE 1 kid off the street for a day with some BASIC knowledge of coding (probably unneccessary) and tell them not to put people against the same person twice in a row. not ing hard.ALSO EVERY game at gold 2 level triples is full of people who are really really skilled in doubles but just log on to triples to play with their friends. The result is the equivilent of smurfing except there is nothing to stop it. It just adds to the problem of defective game.I'm starting to wonder whether the devs were just still born's that fell onto a computer and hit copy paste to the code of a ing fruit machine or something for the matchmaking. Nothing else could explain how ridiculously illogical it is and how they have done nothing to fix it.,Rocket League®

2019-01-12,0,0,894,False,Recommended,"Oh where to begin. i have put around 800 hours on ps4 before i switched to pc and put 800 more. rl is one of my absolute favorite games. the biggest piece of this game obviously is the ridiculouly addictive gameplay and physics. obviously its not a ""realistic"" game but it never claimed to be so therefore that part is irrelevant. at first when i played this game i was just confused. the concept of the game was/is a little absurd and so for a while i didnt really care much for it. then my friends started playing it more so i did the same but as I got better and started making passes and got ok at scoring i just started having a blast. also there is nothing better than when you are losing to toxic people saying What a save! What a save! and then you come back and end up beating them. its the best feeling and if youve played the game then you know exactly what im talking about. id just have to say the more time you put in the game the more you'll enjoy it. when you first start out you can barely hit the ball led alone get it to go in the direction you want it to go. then as you gradually play through you learn to drive on the wall and hit the ball learn to do some small aerials and just generally learn the controls but from there it just gets crazier. you start balancing the ball on top or your car (dribbling) and eventually you learn how to control it and flick it. you will also eventually learn how to take the ball off the wall and dribble it through the air to the goal. granted these things do take some time but if you try hard you can do it in less time than most. the one downside to this game is the learning curve. if youve been playing for a long while and you want your friend to pick it up too then they will go through the whole learning process that you went through and it will take them a lot of time to pick it up to the level that you do obviously depending on your level of play. but this occurs in a lot of games and is a flaw of life lol. either way this is hands down one of the funnest games you will ever play.",Rocket League®

2015-09-30,0,0,484,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a simple fun idea that is extremely well executed.It's incredibly easy to start playing and impossibly difficult to master. It's one of the best examples I've seen of a game with a very low mechanical skill floor while the ceiling stretches far out of the solar system.I can imagine many developers would start with a similar idea and go about it wrong. They might try to add too many things. Add extra complexity where it isn't needed. Everything that exists in a game of Rocket League belongs there from the way the field is laid out to the way your engines slightly animate when different directions are pressed.With a healthy player population you can start the game and be playing within seconds. Games feel quick and action packed and you feel really good when you pull off a tough move. The queue system is very slick. You can play with friends or alone. They've even allowed PS4 and PC players to play together seamlessly. What?!Rocket League is a game where two teams use rocket cars to knock a soccer ball into a goal. That's exactly what it is and it's exceptionally fun.,Rocket League®
2018-12-04,0,0,74,False,Recommended,Really fun and enjoyable game. It is nice made and looks good. You may need a bit of time tho to learn mechanics strats and espessialy aerials.

The one bad thing is that u get cases so friccccen often and u have to buy keys if u want to open them. Moneeyy is needed if u dont want to save all of the cases tho. Dont save.

2018-11-15,0,0,370,False,Recommended,I owe this game a review really. Some of the most laughs I've had playing games were trying to learn rocket league and when you get good its still such a fun game. The high skill ceiling means you're always learning. New mechanics are still being found 3+ years after release which says it all.9.2/10,Rocket League®
2019-01-27,0,0,517,False,Not Recommended,"This is a game which the tag ""easy to play hard to master"" goes perfectly with. It's fun it's refreshing until it isn't. Several fixes made to some pitches have turned the unique pitches into normal and bland there's no more uniqueness to pitches that make any of them stand out from the other except for the ambient. Toxicity is on the rise and nothing is being made about it. Server issues in south america are rampant and lagging and packet loss has become commonplace. Yes I put 500 hours in this. Yes I had fun at first. But in the long run this game doesn't have anything that I would personally recommend to anyone in regards of having a fulfilling experience. Playing solo is trash there's no ultimate goal to achieve no point of reference to say ""this is what I should be doing"" nothing. This game gets boring and empty extremely fast you just don't notice it until you've began playing better and realize that playing the game is actually a chore.",Rocket League®

I cannot tell you how many times I have tried to go get the ball hit it on my screen then proceed to get packet loss then see the ball glitch halfway across the map back to my side of the field. This game needs to fix it's ervers for the people in the middle of the country because right now it is literally unbearable to play a single multiplayer game. Also to add on I am not the only one with this problem many of my friends who play in Central America say that they steady anywhere from 80 to 90 ping with some high speed internet.

Constant updates large usually friendly community(watch out for those salty 12 16 yr olds) great to play with friends either sober or otherwise. Biggest complaint the lack of FREE skins for your cars. The skins in which you get awarded from playing the game are weak at best but the moment you drop a couple of bucks on crates they will shower you with a vast array of diff rims skins and cars. Other than that minorly annoying aspect the game is great. The matchmaking isn't perfect you will run into ppl with significantly higher or lower ranks than you in competitive. This game has overall provided me absurd amounts of fun for a very low buy in. 10/10 would purchase or recommend to anyone that even remotely enjoys games of this type.,Rocket League®

2016-08-24,0,0,673,False,Recommended,Where do I start with Rocket League? Its one of those games that is easy to pick up and play yet hard to master and fine tune. This creates the perfect balance of fun for casual as well as competitve gameplay for those who wish to learn more into the game. The developers have done a great job in creating a game that looks good and performs really well. The updates add to the game and they are willing to listen to what the community wants added or with what is not working. New cars new modes maps and with a growing array of customisation options to keep each vehicle unique and to make it your own.It's definitely one of those games you will want to join your friends in and enjoy playing. I recommend this game if you enjoy a fun arcade style but also with a competitve side to it.,Rocket League®

2016-03-19,0,0,608,False,Recommended,This game is a really really good game.The mechanics are really cool the gravity and the art style are pretty nice. Cosmetics arent really good and some of them are just boringly unoriginal.Cars are the best part there are a lot of them ( some of the best cars are of course in DLC .... )Maps are gorgeous but always the same and if it's a different shape of map it's usually fun for two games and then you start thinking the map is unfair and badly made.Casual mode is fun for a while but people always rage quit after 2 goals so it's kind of annoying since nobody's taking the game seriously on casual. Everybody wants to play comp anyway. Comp is straight up cancer. You can't play anything besides 1v1 if you dont constantly have a friend ( and one of your level ) to play with you. Because you will always ALWAYS get either players with you or way better players against you or afk with you rage quitters with you or smurf against you secretly grand champ that likes to ruin everybody's fun for their own entertainment or just young players unexperienced. Yes there is times where you have good players with you. But after winning (or losing since it's a fair game you can just play badly this time or the other gets lucky) you will have again a game that will make you derank. cool ! That's sooo fun.btw ranks are long as it's not even exciting to rank anymore.When I started playing it was really really cool. Updates kept coming good content the community was getting bigger. And more more kids and alkers kept coming too. Youtube scene became an awful mess of cancer vids with clickbaits and uninteresting gameplays. The game becomes stale. I used to be out of my mind when I scored an aerial goal. Now of course it became routine. Last updates were imho complete .. with the case opening madness everybody wants to trade. scammers are everywhere s too the more popular youtube channels are just for kids to my eyes now and clickbait is a plague in this community. Freestylers are the worst. I hate this. When you make a good center and your teamate thinks he's jhzer and try to freestyle completely miss the ball and disconnect... Freestyle goals arent even impressive anymore since I've seen soo many of these....What happened to this game ? Used to be so fun and exciting to wait for the content to come.. Now it's stale and it's going to slowly die.... Maybe not. Maybe it's just not fun anymore for me. But it's still a good game. It's a really good game. I used to play it every time I could. Now it's a one time a week game to not be bored too quickly...Play it it definitely worth the try and your money. But be aware that it's stale and becomes quickly repetitive.,Rocket League®

The team have also been fantastic at responding to community feedback tweaking their game as necessary and continually updating with new content and modes (for free supported by their cosmetic micro transaction model).Rocket League takes seconds to understand and enjoy but a lifetime to master. There's fun to be had here for players at all skill levels and that's quite an achievement. You should play Rocket League. It won't take long to understand why.,Rocket League®

2018-07-20,0,0,776,False,Not Recommended,"It's a good game in general but the issues about it forces me to not recommend it.Pros Pretty unique concept Soccer with carsFunny in concept Funny in realityNot pay to win surprisingly Besides the batomobile but even that has it drawbacks Regularly has events for free ""decryptors"" to unlock boxes allowing folks that don't like the crate system to open crates as wellCons Players can be pretty toxic at all ranks though in 1v1s they're alot better/nicer Game will punish you if it crashes Like seriously? Ranked is rigged Casual players need not apply here.As someone who is diamond 2 at 3v3s and Plat 3 at 2v2s this game used to be pretty good but recent changes to the ranked system screwed it. If you're a casual player this game is for you presuming you can deal with the frustration of being a new player but only those good enough to make money playing this will have legit fun.",Rocket League®

2018-07-10,0,0,1733,False,Recommended,First off I've been playing this game daily since the first day it came out and I can honestly say after all this time it has changed nothing. It started off well as a new game to play thats fun to hang out with friends in. Then everything changed when the crate nation attacked. They decided that money was the only important thing and that no bugs should ever be fixed. There have been bugs that have been in the game for over a year no matter how much the community talks about it. And as I recently found out there are now bugs that have been fixed before that are reoccuring in the game again. Overall I have to say it is still a great game to play if you just want to chill out and have fun but for the love of god never ever try and take this game competitively unless you want to punch a hole in the wall from Psyonix ing you over,Rocket League®

2018-01-29,0,0,54,False,Recommended,A very interesting sports racing game with many different variants for the game mode. Hockey Basketball and football with RC cars can be tons of fun. There are lots of ways to customize your cars and they add new cars in occasionally. Matchmaking can be brutal and doesn't take long to fit you in where you'll be facing some tough opponents every match. Performance is perfect the game runs great and doesn't require much power to hit max graphics. Definitely worth checking out!,Rocket League®

2015-08-17,0,0,221,False,Recommended,First I played soccer for most of my boyhood. Second I majored in Twisted Metal 2 in college. Rocket League is a majestic intersection of these two joys from my youth with rockets. Fast paced intense easy to enjoy but oh so difficult to master. Gameplay is very well thought out and there is room for a number of styles of play. My five year old loves to customize the Battle car every other match Online multiplayer matches are very smooth and I rarely experience lag and never had a dropped connection during a game. If you like soccer/football if you like demolition derbies if you like attempting mid air rocket shots from your customized Battle car and screaming in triumph after you miss miss miss miss then HIT one this game just might be worth your $$$$ and time.,Rocket League®

The game is one of the pinnacle games of competitive gaming. There are no special abilities cars etc. that give an advantage. Your success in this game is dependent on your skill as a player. There is a huge learning curve to this game. After a few months of practice you can score aerial goals quite easily.

2016-04-20,0,0,439,False,Recommended,This game is fun and adictive. simple at heart but complex when it all falls in to place the main aim of the game is to score as many goals as you can in 5 mins and the team with the most amount of goals wins if the game is tying at the end of the 5 mins it goes to a very tense tie breaker. The tie breakers can go on for any amount of time and you only need one goal to score them. this is the game yes there are more modes that you can try like basketball hockey and many more. You can customise your car by putting hats and boosts to give it your own twist. All of the cars have unique hit boxes and turning radi (so you can find the one that is the best for you and new updates every month will keep you hooked for ages. However now they have added Micro D.L.C like C.S.G.O's case system sadly this pulls the game down but not to much to make it a bad game.this game i a must own that can pull 100 of hours out of in days 9/10 only small issues!,Rocket League®

2017-02-21,0,0,1931,False,Recommended,OverallRocket League has become one of those transcendent games of recent years joining other phenominal games such as SimCity 2000 Civilization 2 &amp 3 Command &amp Conquer Red Alert etc...When no other game sounds interesting or fun to play Rocket League is always there and always fun.ConsThere aren't a lot but what is there is noticable after enough gameplay Servers are generally good but you're going to get one that's not performing properly. Players create new accounts to beat up on lower ranked players for fun If you have any network issues at all Rocket League is very sensitive to those. If you are skilled be prepared to play with others who aren't.ProsLiterally everything else. The things mentioned in the Cons section happen few and far between and not enough to detract from how great this game is. This game is worth every penny.,Rocket League®

2017-02-21,0,0,82,False,Recommended,What can I tell you about this game other than to buy it? Probably a lot but I won't. I've said enough.Now shut up and give them your money.Jokes!Pros Decent graphics kind of cartoony but stylised so it looks fine and it's low spec so you can turn it up. Decent physics ball falls slower than real life which can be annoying to get used to for some people though. Good selection of gamemodes and unlockables which can mostly be aquired for free. Ranked mode for competitive types. Private matches can be cross platform. Insanely high levels of fun and addiction will occur. All the time.Cons Normal matches cannot be cross platform(sucks if you're friends with console players). Like with all competitive games prone to ragers flamers leavers and trolls. Ranked mode progress can be reset if you don't play often. This is probably my personally biggest gripe A lot of new content updates are entirely DLC and store purchase which is kind of annoying if you paid full price for the game. Especially because the purchasable cars are clearly better than any you can get for free. This is starting to feel a bit pay to win as more and more people are switching to DLC cars. The game has sponsered tournements and costs 20 so I don't see why they need to center so much content on the store. TLDR Honestly though if you're looking for a game just to have fun with something to do with your friends or even a game to master your skills on this will probably suit your needs. It's good fun ),Rocket League®

Whilst on the subject of teammates with the IQ of a carrot most teamates are glory grabbers even if they can barley drive. ""Oh who cares if your shot was going in.

Too bad I had to work 60 hours before the game crashed and my save was corrupted putting me back to level 1 and having to start over. At least my online ranking scores weren't lost but I'm once again a semi pro and have a long way to go back to veteran.Apart from that it's a really fun game to play with friends. Controller is highly recommended. It's easy to enjoy but hard to master.What I wrote above still counts but now I'm done with it.To prevent losing my data again I backed my game up every now and then after playing. I wanted to play an hour ago but the game crashed again. I restarted it and saw the data was gone again so I used my backed up files.After launching it with the backed up files I got the error again and again. The backup did not work and I have to start over once again.I've played over 100 hours within a month to go from level 0 to 29 tot 0 to 23 to 0 again.The developers just ignore everyone who has lost his data and expects them to just play again as I did.Ok I got over my data loss now.

2016-06-05,0,0,254,False,Not Recommended,"The game in itself is great it looks good and the gameplay in itself is absolutely fenomenal...And after all of this the whole game is just a big dissapointment. First of all the matchmaking will make you want to drink bleach since it dishes out mismatches every second game or finds out countless of other ways to f**k up the match before it even starts.Secondly I can say that I have played games from CoD's to League of Legends but Rocket League has the most toxic community there is for sure. There's not a single game where someone isn't screaming insults to the mic writing trash comments in the chat or spamming the quickchat (Which by the way is the dumbest addition to ANY game quickchat's have allways been and will allways be trash that only results in spamming and whatnot)Then there's the whole ""physics"" part which is driving me nuts... Sometimes just a light tap to another car sends them flying to another reality whereas sometimes even if you ram into someone with supersonic speeds it's like you've hit god himself when the other car simply stops you on your tracks.. And lastly atleast in my opinion every addition they've made after the *Battle Cars dlc has been making the game somehow worse. It's like the creators are pushing content out forcibly on gunpoint since they seem to lack the fun and simplicity that made this game so special to me once.. So when you combine this matchmaking system with the toxic community and half a**ed physics you're just bound to not have a good time.As an idea visually and atleast somewhat mechanically this game is surely a 9 10/10 but when you're actually playing and trying to enjoy the game it's is barely a 2/10. Honestly as sad as it is to say I wouldn't buy this game again or recommend it to anyone.",Rocket League®

2016-10-24,0,0,779,False,Not Recommended,"This game is f***ing broken. In it's current state this game is unplayable competetively let me explain why.1. Matchmaking either finds you oponnents who are way WAY worse than you or way way WAY WAY better than you no match (2v2 with my friend) feels like it is even and both teams are trying to win it's just a stomp either way as in 9 2 or 0 42. Netcode for this game is utterly broken i know some mismatches here and there in a fast paced game are to be expected but when i get scored on after blocking the ball on my screen it's not fun. Even better so that the replays show me actually blocking the ball the ball SPAZES OUT FOR A SECOND then continues on its original trajectory as if i was not even there.3. Last but not least is the luck factor. It wouldn't be such an issue by itself but the problems above make it just all out rng. I'd say your skill contribution during a match is like 40%. The rest is just a question of ""Is the enemy 4 times as good as me?"" and ""I was winning 4 0 but then the netcode started to die and it wouldnt register me hitting the ball randomly and i ended up losing 4 5"" I'm running into those situations all the time. I play about 10 20 matches a day 1v1 ranked and 2v2 with my friend. Im challenger 2 in both. We keep running into people who either dont know they can jump twice or people who can bounce the ball 9 times in the air while scoring on you. This ruins all the fun of the game. All of it.The only reason im still playing this broken heap of s**t is some faint stupid hope that they will fix those issues and pure sado masochism on my part.",Rocket League®

Have you ever wanted a system where people can destroy you over and over and over and bully you but the report function just doesn't do anything? I think you're getting warmer to the game for you! Welcome to Rocket League where the matchmaking is literally moronic. Did you just lose rank in a ranked match against a full premade 3? Did you queue again? GOOD NEWS!

2016-07-01,1,3,22,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League without a doubt is already one of my favorite games gameplay wise in my Library! It's mechanics are unique in the way that you can easily control them from when you start playing but can be practiced with to use them even more effectively Gameplay good for both Inexperianced and Experianced player something you don't see as much. So this game would get my full reccomendation to anyone with a computer good enough to run it if it werent for the worst competitive matchmaking program ive ever seen! It bases the people you play with based on the rank you have making the opponents you face around the same rank as you. this would be fine. IF YOU DIDN'T RESET RANKS AND MAKE IT SO ROOKIES PLAY WITH EXPERTS!!! They literally have tags next to your name with your skill level going from rookie to veteran. Why then is competitive matchmaking not using this as a defining factor in matchmaking? tell me Why am I a Semi pro being faced off against a 3 veteran team without a anyone higher than pro on my team fair? They will absolutely dominate us and our rank will go down lower than they should be because of this. And if you have an expert player on your team and dominate them your rank will go up too high for you to have fun at that level of competition their and you'll have to play a couple games to go back down! if you have an expert on your team good luck getting any points or plays on you for your team as a new player. I have tried waiting and not playing this game for a couple of days to see if the ranks would figure out who should fricken go where it didn't. Me not playing a game because the matchmaking is unfair is absolutely ridiculous and shouldn't happen. If you put it so matchmaking was decided on rank AND skill you will make the game more challenging and fun for everyone and stop a lot of smurfing. This game is extremely fun but gosh darnit if the dev team wont fix competitive matchmaking THE MAIN GAMEMODE! I can't truthfully recommend this to someone.,Rocket League®

The one thing that could be worked on is the matchmaking because it is very strange the way Psyonix executes it and it sometime places people where they should not be. Psyonix is a good company though they engage with fans and customers and are always looking to help. Another thing I find great is the purchase of keys not only do you get to use them to open crates and/ or trade some of that money goes into the prize pool for the RLCS (Rocket League Championship Series) season and you can fund the pros. The professional players usually stream on Twitch or make YouTube videos so if you want to learn something or have an issue you can check them out and support the community!

2017-12-13,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,"I can no longer recommend this game. The community is extremely toxic although you can mute and disable chat which is probably for the best. The 'git gud' 'you suck' is thrown around way too much and Pysonix encourages this behaviour with the 'EZ' and 'SALT' score banners while simultaneously auto banning reported players for cussing. So expressing your frustration with colorful language is a bannable offense. Lovely hypocrisy Pysonix.I've been playing this game a long time and the RLCS has increased the average skill level to beyond what I care to obtain. This game used to be a zone out stress relief. However when the majority of games are shutouts and/or blowouts then either the average skill has dramatically increased (due to the RLCS) or the matchmaking is extremely broken and thus there is no more reason to play this game as stress relief. Because losing 20 games in a row is great matchmaking pysonix.

2017-05-24,1,3,352,False,Not Recommended,Fun game but the ranking system is flawed. I shouldn't have more points than anyone else in the entire match including the winning enemy team and still division down/de rank because my team lost the match there should be advancement based on how well you play not how many times you win in a row.The community is extremely toxic probably one of the worst that I have ever seen in any game. People start getting better attitudes around gold 3 but it is still bad. There are way too many people that will throw a competitive match if you do literally anything to upset them there needs to be a system in place that will punish players a little harder for throwing comp matches.,Rocket League®

2016-09-26,2,2,386,False,Not Recommended,I can't say anything else but FIX YOUR DAMN PHYSICS! Seriously the ball moves in completely unrealistic angles when hit by two cars and accelerates when 2 opposing forces hit it. Also hitregistration is buggy as well as random. Servers are super instable as soon as someone with a ping of 60+ is on the server. (Ping 60 is marked by the game as 3/3 connectivity bars) Glitches appear frequently with higher pings as well as jumping through the ball or an enemy player. This results in frequent ragequits due to random wins and losses. You could toss a coin at the beginning of a match wouldn't make a difference. Also the league system in ranked is the best BS I have ever seen. You win 10 matches in a row without a league up. (just asking for a league increas not even a rank increase. (5 leagues in each rank) ) But after that 10 won matches you loose 1 !!! time and instantly loose a league. DAFUQ is this randomness. Also the ingame pointsystem is super buggy. Sometimes you save and get a clear ball rewarded instead or you save and get nothing cause the game doesn't register the ball would've actually be a goal. All of that gets WORSE with every gameupdate.,Rocket League®

2016-06-03,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League is a game in which you play football/soccer but instead of humans you control cars with boosters and a double jump.Many people will agree when I say that that is an ingenious idea and it is well enough executed to be a videogame.And apart from the drifting which is in most racing games the most fun thing to do I fail to see the point of implementing it so poorly in this game.And now the bad stuff.There may be different options for a ball and what not and many different stadiums which are all the same but it doesn't help that you never change how/what you play.Imagine buying every single FIFA game and you have to play each one 2 hours at least. That's Rocket League in a nutshell.They never bother to build in courses powerups or cars with unique stats cause that means work. And nobody likes work. So it ends up feeling like an overprized early access indie game where each day you pray to god that they actualy make this game fun. But nopeIt's supose to be like an e sports game or somethingIn e sports there is no fun allowed.,Rocket League®

2016-12-18,0,0,316,False,Not Recommended,I used to love this game a lot. There is so much to love about it. That was until the crate system was introduced...&lt crate_rant&gt Now I drop into a game and with fair regularity you end up with a crate farmer on one side or the other. There was that one epic time that I dropped into a game and the whole other team was crate farming... Please dev's you need to rethink the crate system to put off farming it just ruins it for everyone. A friend pointed out that he didn't see it as much at expert level games and of course when he teamed up with friends. This makes me think maybe it's worse at the lower levels which is not good for the overall health of the game. If you're new and your first experience of the game is some dude driving around in circles seems like a receipe for peeps finding something else to play.&lt /crate_rant&gt Anyways apart from the crate system keep up the good work this game is well worth the time and effort so long as you don't end up with a farmer on your team )edit My spelling of crate left a lot to be desired. Seriously sick of this crate farming rt almost every game seems to have farmers.,Rocket League®
2017-03-18,2,3,179,False,Not Recommended,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!I did not buy it on release because my excitement was building up too much and I felt if I bought it at the time I might have died as my heart would have exploded because of the sheer excitement. Now I'm thinking what the actual fuc* is this I'm not a retard in understanding it's soccer (get triggered deal with it) but with cars. I'm literally getting rammed up the back end getting hit on the side (weren't supposed to sound sexual) and blown up into pieces. Everytime I am hit it's like my black self goes back into the slavery period and getting whipped uncontrollably. The cars are crap I've got a fast car and my opponent has a big truck you would be thinking that I should win the race to the ball everytime. NOPE not in this fuc*ing game the big truck always wins this game is a mess surely the developers went to school to learn about physics regarding weights? Oh don't forget the new 'added' features that are free you now get fuc*ing crates that are rewarded which you then have to spend 1.19 on a key to unlock a crap decal or a new hat. I'm playing a car football game not pimp my ride. I would like to add shooting pace and skill attributes to my professional car not change the wheels to look cool and pull some birds in my whip and taking them to Mcdonalds for a 99p hamburger. Then the team mates you get put with on the game they are window lickers and play as if they're playing the game with their feet. Always get team mates that score a remarkable own goal that only themselves could score because of how fuc*ing sh* they are at the game.. Whenever I try to score a goal the ball bounces about 12 million times hitting the post crossbar cars floor ceiling before the magnet out of no where attracts the ball into my own goal and the opponent winning because of BS.I would rather watch the Super Bowl LI again where it took over 4 hours for the game to finish when it should have finished in 1 hour it's ridiculous how it's classed as a sport Golf goes a faster pace than American Football. Anyway back to the review the game is trash just literally caked in shi* and I feel ripped off everytime I play it. Get some toy cars and a bouncy ball and you've replicated Rocket League. I'm pretty sure I discovered this game when I was about 5 years old I was just too young to copyright the game well I've got photo evidence of me playing the same concept so be prepared to get sued Psyonix.,Rocket League®

2017-08-17,1,2,170,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League is an alright game. But when the developers take away one of the primary reasons to play video games the game suffers greatly. You see many people use games as an outlet for stress or to get away from their troubles and when the devs ban them for simply insulting another player you know something is up. This is an extreme overreaction and illogical way to handle the problem. I got a 24 hour ban for this reason that only started when I entered the game again. I got banned from a game for saying something insulting. Not muted. Banned. BANNED. REALLY DUDE. This makes no sence at all especially when the person getting insulted could just mute me. If you really did want to help you could add a filter on the chat that once a swear word or insulting word goes through it it asks the other team if they want to mute the other user. This would be toggleable obviously. I cannot back this game that bans people for insulting others. That is the most outragous strategy for removing toxic players. Such a wuss approch and I HATE IT. It blows me away how the devs thing that I deserve my 24 hour GAME ban. I deserve at CHAT ban at the very most. If they really cared just ban the player from chatting entirely after a few times. A game ban is too far.About the game itself The game suffers from what CS GO suffers from. You will see someone who on your screen obviously did not hit the ball hit the ball. That is because of the server tickrate. The fact that this is so noticable is truly unacceptable.,Rocket League®

2016-12-08,1,7,90,False,Not Recommended,This game is extremely fun. It's identical to a game a friend and me built in starmade called Power Ball the customization of the vehicles is amazing and the fact that the devs give every new arena away for free is AWESOME. The only things that you have to pay for are different vehicles (that aren't better in anyway other than looks) and some skins / special effects for your vehicle.If you aren't playing with friends..... beware.The only problem with this game is a good portion of players. PS4 modded consoles where the game instantly wins before the 3 seconds timer is up and TONS and TONS of afkers. There currently isn't a system in place to kick these people or ban them from item farming (just sitting afk in a match doing circles or moving forward to get the chance of an item when the match finishes).There's no reporting systems for the PS4 network if they do happen to cheat. So it's really just a play at your own risk and realize that every 4 or so matches you're going to get people afking or helping opposing team.,Rocket League®
2016-10-27,0,0,1247,False,Not Recommended,So Rocket League. The idea is great it's a genius mix up that almost every person dreamed of when he was a child. You can either play online or in local with split screen like good old times. And you can also play with your friends at home vs players online. That's all we need. And you'll have a lot of fun until you keep playing among friends.But what about community? It's like a virus for the game. It's the worst I've ever seen. People insulting you over nothing people WISHING YOU CANCER or people telling you to KILL YOURSELF. No joke. Also you'll find a troll who suddenly starts scoring in your own goal almost in every match.You'd be super lucky to find a player with some fairplay. So many players are mean pure evil and scum. You can report them but reports are useless ban are super useless they just ban users for 5 minutes or so. Devs should make a better work with that but game's moving a lot of money and they'd lose a lot of players moving in that direction...Is this the kind of players you need? People trolling spamming insults wishing cancer and horrible behaviors? For me that's a reason to stop playing a game. Also matchmaking is so bad. I can't count the times when I was newbie that I had to play vs players with far greater rank than me or my friends. Like newbies vs legends or low ranks vs high ranks... Ridiculous.Devs abandoned the game under those aspects.EDIT 19 May 2017 Huge updates a lot of new stuff. Yet nothing has been done to improve the punishment for horrible behavior and the less urgent problem adjusting matchmaking.I'm collecting screenshots of players wishing death and other beautiful things everytime I play there are a lot already.EDIT 17 July 2017 Still huge updates. But guess what? Devs just work on adding new crates instead of curing gameplay and community. I have uninstalled the game. Worst community ever game with no punishment system. You can't just open the game to enjoy a match and have some fun. You'll just get pis*ed off for all the sh*tty behavior you'll find. I don't want a game to ruin my time and honestly if I knew about that I wouldn't bought it.,Rocket League®

2016-09-25,1,13,546,False,Not Recommended,My answer can't be just plain YES/NO I put No because it leans towards it. Don't get me wrong it's a lot of fun but that fun is often killed with minor stuff.My first problem is that I often see someone hit a ball deflects it in other direction and after a split second it resets and follows the previous path. This is enough to confuse you and miss the otherwise easy ball. This happens once or twice in every to games to me.Second problem I'm having is ranks in matchmaking. Just to set things straight I'm playing ranked 2v2 with my friend both same rank and division and both pretty much the same level.BEFORE last update which introduced crates we were constantly getting opponents whos combined rank was 2 3 ranks above ours which was sometimes a problem.NOW I don't have this problem but last few games I had opponents that had below 15 hours had Semi Pro level and were solid 3 ranks above us which played a lot better than us. I'm not saying I'm perfect in fact I'm not even good but playing against these is like playing against blue ranks (which is admirable).Plus a minor annoyance which is not being able to select which maps you can play because some people don't like Neo Tokyo map. The traction on some surfaces is very odd and feels like the walls on every map have some special coding just to hold the car on it. It seems as if the bumps are slippery and your car doesn't grip.,Rocket League®

2016-12-20,0,0,455,False,Not Recommended,While I love this game I cannot recommend it to anyone to spend their hard earned money on. It has been slowly going down the wrong path with the addition of crates the Rumble game type and AquaDome. The addition of the AquaDome arena is the main driver for this negative review. My laptop (see specs below) is under spec and I get that but have been able to happily play many hours with low quality graphics and get a very playable 30 fps. Then they added AquaDome. I get a very choppy laggy 10 fps and have to account for a 1 or 2 second delay. Now this was never a problem until this arena and it is negatively influencing my ranking. Every time I play in that arena in a ranked match my team loses because I cannot contribute. Once again I understand that I am below spec but with the direction this game is going it will make it unplayable on a wide range of computers and that's a shame to see. I try my hardest to avoid that one arena but that's impossible in ranked matches.

2018-03-31,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,"This game is absolute cancer everytime the ball is 2 metres in the air it gives the illusion you can hit it well guess what everytime you try and jump up to hit the ball you will never hit it either you do some rocket boosting glide to hit it in the air which is even more likely you will miss or you need to wait for it to hit the ground even though the other players will somehow beat you to that. The Ball cam is the most cancerous camera angle and point of view i have ever witnessed its like the camera is trying to leave my monitor everytime the ball goes in the air you camera does not look up in the air instead it will wait until the ball is right above you so you can barely understand where you and what direction you are going in.There is a clear understanding that the ranking and elo system does not work everygame i get the most toxic and idiotic players that troll spam quickchat &amp Leaves because the enemy scored 1 or 2 goals. everytime i have these players on my team. How can i go from getting a dream team to a braindead spektrum team.(edit my previous review was from 7 hours of gameplay i have played 10 hours more and i have 17 hours in total &amp can make a fairer review on this game)After Another 10 hours of playing i have figured out the no.1 thing that makes this game a horrid creation is the ranking. No matter how much you try you will end up hard stuck in a rank because you are getting the most cancerous players psyonix has to offer. I dont know if there is a elo system but there has to be one if i keep getting the most toxic &amp awful players.Going back to the camera angle it seems to of got worse now it truley has jumped off a ing cliff because everytime the ball in near it starts freaking out and spinning around in circles diagnosing me with a epileptic seizure... But after 17 hours of playing this failed abortion i can say there was alot of enjoyment and comedy from this game. Watching your team and the enemy team miss the ball while its not even moving destroying eachother with full boost &amp playing casual rumble. Psyonix has actually delivered something fun out of RocketLeague.This is the type of game where you have to play alot to become used to &amp good at the game and that would make alot of a difference seeming though the skill gap is quite far &amp large. After 1 final hour of playing this game i have discovered ""smurfs"" which is a player from a higher rank playing in the lowest of ranks to get free wins and to also ruin other people enjoyment of this game. Now knowing there is smurfs in this game and already hard stuck in a low elo and low rank makes it even more ing impossible to get out of your position.

The servers have been getting thrashed since there's well over 100 000 simultaneous players trying to go at it but even the single player is fantastic. Online when working is tremendous fun and addicting on an entirely different level than you might expect.Despite being friggin' rocket powered cars playing Soccer/football I actually didn't find videos to look all that much fun but when I played it for myself it was instantly obvious this game was something special after my very first round. The controls are perfect the game runs silky smooth even on when ran on a flaming dumpster of a computer and yet still looks fantastic.While a controller is definitely recommended the game works perfectly fine with keyboard and mouse if that's your thing and has a nice selection of options related to just about everything. It has a full on FOV slider and multiple other camera options to make the camera be EXACTLY what you need it to be.Buy. This. Game. $20 for this is at the same time a steal and the perfect price.Oh and the community thanks to be cross platform with PS4 (Who can get it free on PS+) is MASSIVE meaning you'll never be struggling to find a game. When the servers aren't being wrecked of course. You don't have to enable or do anything to play cross platform everyone is just on the same servers by default.Buy it! BUY IT NOW.

I'm always coming back for more to face tougher opponents. Rocket League is one of those ""love hate"" type of games and don't understand why you keep playing it. Perhaps it's to climb the ranking ladder to be next champion or to simply dominate your opponents.Like any other competitive game it's going to have a toxic community. It's to be expected not to be avoided. It can be said and seen in other well known games. Thankfully Psyonix is taking action to punish players that don't the follow rules. An auto ban chat system that detects any vulgar words. Which will result in a chat ban. Preventing to use the chatbox to communicate. I believe you can still use the quick chat commands.With the introduction of tournament mode it felt... incomplete. Yeah sure players can suggest adding rewards but it will still feel empty. My suggestion would be that Psyonix may hold tournaments through their own mode. In case you don't want to face RLCS (Rocket League Champion Series) champions.Extra modes as their called I really don't care about. However they're now ranked. Which means no more casual play. ""Why not both?"" you ask. Well Psyonix themselves said no because the player count for those modes are far too low.Psyonix has shown so much love to both their game and players.

And an argument could be made that the developers never promised NOT to put microtransactions in (unlike Payday 2 developers).Well sure. And perhaps some peple will be swayed by such arguments.

But when it comes to the ranked level this game fails a lot because this game consists in 50 % of skill and 50% of luck and the ranks have divisions between them which is clearly dumb. I'll give an example you are silver 2 in division I and you are matched with a gold I player when you win that match you only go to division II instead of rewarding you with division III or division IV. Now who was the ""smart"" person that design this ranked system ? With some many ranking systems like ELO rating system they choose ""divisions"" as your progress to rank up or to down rank such progress doesn't even reward you for beating higher ranks than yours....I would like to recommend this game but being a luck based game and with that enormous flaw in the ranked system I just can't do it.Just buy it if you want to have some fun from time to time when you remember the game still exists and you have it.",Rocket League®

I don't feel like playing this game until the loot system is some form of consistent reward.,Rocket League®

Now in season 3 the ranking system is and you don't gain a division for each win but you definitely go down one if you lose. The matchmaking is absolute and climbing is impossible. In the old ranking system it was at least 50 50 you win one you go up you lose one you go down. But now it's unfair and even if you're already a pro losing unlucky games drags you down the ladder and reaching the top could take up to hundreds maybe thousands of games.

2017-08-28,0,0,1071,False,Not Recommended,"Rocket League is on the decline it's honestly not worth the normal price anymore and hardly worth the sale price. RL devs were supposed to be adding variety to the maps in ranked mode and casual maps like Neo Tokyo Starbase Wasteland Etc. Though now it seems they've totally abandoned the idea for no real reason. So every map is the exact same with a different texture now and it's really repetative and boring with no variety. Reccently with the latest season they've added an auto ban system that will ban you for almost anything. I haven't dealt with it yet because i play with a disabled chat but scores of people are getting banned for just cursing or saying anything that could be considered negative. So winning a game against a guy cussing you out and flaming and saying ""EZ"" will get you banned if the guy reports you. The bans roll from 24 72 1 week then permanent. Which is why i would say don't buy it you could get perm banned for false reports or just minor smack talk which is a part of every online game. Just about the only way to play a full 5 minute match is in the ranked mode and even then its not guaranteed. Casual is a joke you will see 3 6 different players come through one 5 minute casual match because there isn't a punishment for leaving. So everyone leaves as soon as a goal gets scored on them making the game a waste of time. I do like Rocket League It was a great game but it's best years are behind it and this new season is the begining of the slow downward spiral into mismanagement.",Rocket League®

Any chance of a casual game to kill some time for fun at these levels is nil. you psyonix for matchmaking. I'm not good so stop pairing me up with good players. This game stopped being fun atfer everybody takes it way too serioulsy and practices to 'git gud'This might sound like a funny review but it's unfortunately all serious.Some of the player base is extremely toxic and Psyonix in their brilliant wisdom have decided to implement an automatic banning system for saying the wrong word in chat. They have also decided to keep that list of automatically bannable words secret so we don't know what little snowflake words people are offended by. If people are so offended there is a ""Turn Chat Off"" option so this auto ban is completely uneccessary.

Its qualities are endless its formula is brilliant its skill ceiling seemingly nonexistant and the skill floor in order to have fun very very low.Which is why I'm telling you to stay away.See developer Psyonix recently decided to introduce a crate key system modeled after CS GO (a game that's a cesspool of twelve year old and russian cheaters in and of itself) a move that can only be described as making a quick buck off of underage gambling (this time on consoles too just to lower that age range a little bit more and get us to FIFA territory! just like that 12 year old kid who spent thousands of dollars on their dad's credit card to buy FIFA players...) To make a long story short I want to be vocal and do not condone such behaviour which is why I'm posting this review and hope to be one of many negative reviews once the crates come out.

2018-03-03,0,0,559,False,Not Recommended,"Ok...So lets talk about Rocket League. Its quite difficult. I may not have played this game as much as others but I played it over the timespan of several years and in this review I will talk not only about the game in general as it is right now but will let my opinion being influenced by the evolution this game has gone through. And boy thats a lot to talk about. The relationship between Rocket League and mme began quite some time ago I started playing it as a team game with my friends about three years ago. In fact we used to upload videos about our gameplay on YouTube as we had fun doing that by the time. Also it was kind of a trend back in the day. I have awesome memories playing with my friends on the early levels to pro but there were quite a few bugs and misinterpretations of the game. People used to go on ""rages"" slamming their cars into teammates or enemies when they were tilted. I cant really compare that to the Rocket League I'm used to today but as time moved on so did I expand my friendlist and I met a few really nice players. There was toxicity sure but it was okay and acceptable. As background I played League of Legends on a daily base so I knew what flaming and trolling was. Back to topic the early ranks were horrible. The enemy team didnt knew what it was doing and neither did we. We had a fun time. Time change place change As my friends played Rocket League with me less and less i started playing alone. I never played 1v1 before so i tried and it wasnt that big of a game. I won too hard it was too easy. Of course i needed to get ranked first so I played my rankeds and got placed even thought I won 7 of the games in prospect 2 todays bronze basically. It was kind of disappointing as I thought I was really making progress (I was only few XP away from Veteran). But it was fun instead of ranked I played 2v2 and got a lot better in my playstyle and overall skills. The game just didnt noticed that. On level 36 I was still being put in games with and against semi pros or even beginners. After I won one or two games the game difficulty rised to master and above. Keep in mind that at this time I could barely fly with my car or do any stunts. It was ""that"" time the hype the trendy game Rocket League. Many started playing this game and apparently noone at Psyonix noticed this (as well as my increase in skill and the increase in the others people skill). As expected their servers (or server) couldnt handle that massive load and collapsed several times. That didnt happened once but over one year (Fun Fact Sometimes it still happens today). I really dont know how to run a gaming company but thats one of my main critique points right there for Rocket League or Psyonix in general it takes so long for problems to be solved. Instead they had added chests tournaments special rarity for items and even new maps. But nothing changed that would have been neccessary for example the matchmaking or the many cheaters and bug abusers or the main part the community. I feel like they didnt care sh*t (excuse that please) for me I was just another worthless player securing their income. At this point I hadnt had fun with the game anymore you had to go full tryhard to have a chance at winning if you won you were playing against two skill classes higher than you if youre losing two skill classes lower. I really cant imagine what could have gone through a developers head to think that that was a good system to categorise players in matches. And the most ridicolous thing about it they still failed to change it or anything that could have lead to a better community athmosphere. At this point I play with my girlfriend which is two classes lower than me against people on my level or above (rather the last one) which is impossible to play against for her. I got put in a match between a Rocketeer and an ESL Champion in standard 2v2. How? I dont know. I dont understand why with so many people playing this game noone on my level can be found. Does it always have to be difficult? If I lost a game when i started playing Rocket League it was my own mistake maybe even got flamed a little. Today its the exact opposite (mostly) the enemy gets disrespected as much as possible I'm losing against beginners and semi pros as a level 51 player because each of them is playing better than the legend on my team and me combined. Cheaters are everywhere smurfs even some really bad people (dont take me wrong I mean ""less experienced players"") on my or the enemy team in ranked games. I am not able to understand the progress this wonderful and lovely created game has gone through but I can describe it with one word ""Moneymilking"". Lets conclude this review. These bulletpoints are in no order.Why you should buy this game Great gameplay really high skillcap ""Easy to learn Hard to master"" Cars with rockets playing football There is a high revenue streaming community and esports community behind this There are some really good guys out there who would love to be your friend the game looks very good in higher resolutions ( I personally like it in 4k)Why you shouldnt (mostly) toxic community This is my experience as a level 51 player. I cant speak for lower or higher levels Cheaters everywhere ( Level cheating gamespeed cheating ping cheating all thats no good is possible here) Completely unbalanced matchmaking ( I mean that. Its so annoying to constantly play against players above or below your rank as they influence your game experience very much. Stupid ranks ( the ranking system is basically garbage. Sorry to say that Psyonix even CS made a better one years ago) Stupid season rewards system ( This one is kinda connected with the one above. It is especially devastating for players who play only now and then. Basically you get nothing except you play a hell of a lot games to try and get the wins which takes forever. Why? look above!) The possibility to hide his skill rank ( That one cranks me up af since you dont know what to expect. Symbiosis with point 2) Bots are still unfitting for higher skill ranks ( As you climb up the more predictable they get) No caring for players ( Server mainteance is a farce. It was worse at a time though) Connections are being synchronised and therefore plays are possible that werent before. You will know when you see it &gt ( Reports do nothing. Or at least it feels like that. The cars can go 80 km/h at max speed. At least add some zeros here. It takes a lot of time to learn and there are too little tutorialsConclusion All in all I dont recommend buying it. It is fun for about 20 hours then you should have at least one friend to play with you. Keep enemies muted as they will spam the chat with everything they have. At some point enemies will start to play differently and this is where you invest most of the time to keep up with the other tryhards. Ranked is useless you will get placed very low regardless of how good you played and its really hard to get out of the lower tiers ( I wont use the word elo hell cause thats simply not fitting). Dont imagine getting any nice season rewards ignore the fact that sometimes you join in empty games (or games that have just been lost by others) get your day ruined every day and you will maybe perhaps eventually start to hate that whole soup of miserable gameplay just like me. In fact I still play it cause of my friends but either me or they ragequit at some point. Better play DotA then.With honest regardsB.J. Cobbled*ck",Rocket League®

Battle pass feeds off of your current level so if your level is high it takes much longer to go up in tier for the pass. Time for some Fortnite to end my misery.2. Matchmaking is absolute trash! Like literal trash! One match you feel good score some goals have the dream team going strong.....and next thing you know Rocket League pits you with some of the most god awful players in the world. Rocket League then one ups you and sticks you with those same S%&amp $* teammates for what almost seems like forever.3. Community is bad mostly angry kids who talk big game but then later realize that what they resort to as bullying is just a joke like a teen doing the tide pod challenge kinda joke.4. Suffer Demotion! Get used to it boys and girls you are gonna be grinding for that gold maybe even platinum. Then....all that goes away in the blink of an eye. It don't matter how many goals assists saves etc you do in a game.....if you lose two games in a row your getting demoted. No if ands or buts on this one. ""Pack your stuff get out your fired"" as the good Cave Johnson would put it. (So yeah the tier system is broke as well)5. Customer support........................................none end of complaint6. Keys keys and more keys. If those beautifully experienced people out there already know that Rocket League had already incorrporated microtransactions then congradulations you get to buy.....more keys. Its the bread and butter of the game. Keys open up crates and get you passes. It just feels wrong how what already was taking my money now wants more money. I say ""sure whats the worst that can happen?"" Now I'm making a list of the worst fake laugh hiding real pain.7. (IGBR) or ""In Game Bully Reporter"" for short does not work. Which makes me laugh everytime I see a kid say ""REPORTED"" in the chat. Like tears come out of my eyes its so funny. 8. Customer support......................wait I said that already but it's that bad.9. Laws of Physics..........thats a joke its a game I'm not a god damn scientist so this does not apply.

When you play this game with a controller the camera is locked. I can tilt it but it immediately ""forgets"" if I let go. Let me put that into words. Say I'm looking at 90 degrees (3 o'clock if that is easier) and I release pressure on the right stick. The camera will immediately go to 0 degrees (12 o'clock). This is unnecessary and impedes me ever wanting to play the game. ""Just switch between ball cam and regular cam"". I don't want to have to do that. Would you want to have to hold a button to be/not be in ball cam? That's kinda my situation.TLDNR prospect of game killed by terrible camera.There is no ladder system in game which promotes seal clubbing and smurfing (buy new account to pretend to be new). This game also involves loot crate gambling. It's against the rules to sell items to other playes (because it is easier and cheaper to get the items from buying them directly rather than using the in game gambling store). Webster defines gambling as to bet on an uncertain outcome. This game gives you the crate for free along with a number of other items you can use for free. This tricks the player into thinking they have won a prize. The reality is you have won a chance to give the company 1$ to have a chane at getting the desired outcome from that crate.Several European countries are moving to ban all forms of lootbox gambling. But let's say you don't think this is gambling. What would you call it if someone held a gun on you and demanded your wallet?

This person sent me a link to what was supposed to be a different profile. While in game (I was in the main menu on rocket league logged in) I click on the link in the message which then brings a pop up saying I need to sign into my steam account and looks like a steam login page (it was in the tab+shift page thing in game which is why I tried to sign in). Well like a dumb I tried to login and this person got my info logged into my steam account went into my rocket league account and traded away around $175 worth of in game items all the while I was in game.I realized within about 30 seconds what was going on and changed my steam password. I don't think this person got my visa card info and I don't think they wanted it but was instead only after my in game items. Psyonix doesn't do anything about this kind of thing which is why I'm posting to warn the rocket league community to be careful.Psyonix doesn't offer any sort help for this and rocket league doesn't have an in game trade market. This would stop this kind of scam but Psyonix attitude seems to be to bad so sad don't be a dumb What's even worse is that I have no way of reporting this person. Now this person will continue to scam whoever then can. I don't know which profile my stuff was sent to but here is the profile used to scam me https //steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198866165975/Rocket League is a great game. I give the gameplay a 10 at of 10. It's the only PVP game I've ever played that is 100% pure skill however Psyonix as a company is terrible. 0 out of 10 and not just for what happened to me but also for the fact that they don't support this game beyond cosmetics which you get though loot boxes and now a battle pass. overall I give the game a 9 out of 10Please keep in mind that we do not get involved in any trade disputes and will not rollback any account actions. If you encountered an unpleasant trade experience it is important to note that we do not get involved as a matter of course.We understand that this may be difficult to accept but we insist that players ensure that a trade is fair equitable and whole before accepting.If you feel your case merits special review simply submit a request through our support site.

2017-07-31,0,0,1598,False,Not Recommended,"First of all let me say that this game is fun as hell. Otherwise I wouldn't have over a thousand hours on it. HUGE skill ceiling potential for tons of fun *when playing with friends*.Frankly half the community are ing garbage people that just want to everyone else off in the server and the MMR system is pretty bad. I made it to the second highest rank in every season since season 2 in almost every queue and it STILL puts you with people who can't hit a bloody pass or make one to save their lives it's embarrassing. The skill gaps in ranked are just stupid at higher levels (unless you're in the top 0.5% maybe) and it ruins ranked play.Community play is fun but again the skill variance usually makes for pretty one sided games.So yeah fun game but I can't recommend it as anything more than a casual game to play premade games with friends.*UPDATE*Oh hey they implemented a new ban system which autobans you for (???) ... nothing we've figured out. They claim ""abusive language"" but won't provide a list of what they consider abusive language. Also it seems that you can get banned for the hell of it if a 3man party decide to report you because they don't like you without providing any valid reason.I hadn't played the game in weeks logged in and I was banned for 170 hours LOL. Apparently I was toxic but I don't even play with chat on LOL. How the can I be toxic without using text or voice chat?

2019-02-10,0,0,822,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Every day I play less and less. This is the first time ever I have written a negative review with that I said it all. Do not let my played hours fool you this was a really fun game. I T W A S. Past tense. I literally lost all respect and simpathy for the game.Unless you are ready to buy like 4 copies for a couple of friends of yours do not buy it. This is the most CUCKED game I have ever played let me elaborate.I really loved the game back then I didn't search it it came to me as a gift. I kinda regret coming this far.The idea graphics and music are 10/10 the problem? This is no longer a enjoyable game.At the beginning this was a real ESport only skills matter. Right now it's just a total kinder playground safe zone lets gamble and buy seasonal pass game. Everything is a trigger you cannot longer really interact to your team if you are just paired with people online and be ready to literally lose an entire match just for telling someone on your team to go for the ball. The game is totally playable (almost) without any purchase at all except the game itself (DIN DIN) but you will realize the game seems off.The community is ok every competitive game has it's toxic people but the game has a problem where the Devs are trying to adjust it to become less and less humane so you can be just another car because if you have something to say you will probably get a ''Chat disabled'' message anyway. Are you trying to congratulate a friend of yours? Get another ''Chat Disabled'' message. I am not even close to get banned but since everything is a trigger now I most probably will in a future so Imagine buying a game just to get banned (not my type of game nu huh) the game seems dead off playing in literal mute all the time. I would have better play with the AI and pretend I am interacting with people online. Your own team won't even tell what you are trying to do because ''Chat disabled''.It was once a game now it is pathetic I honestly think so. You might not really get what I am trying to tell you unless you play the game after just ONE match I am sure you will say ''Ahhh yeah this is what he was talking about''You can still play it but it wont be any fun. This is a no fun zone only ''Pay seasonal pass and become a robot to play'' zone. TLDRUnless you are playing with your friends in a closed game and probably even not you can have some fun on this game. This game leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth on every single update.GG EZ PZ This game entered my heart as a jewel and left it as a garbage blob. Why couldn't it leave as a big one like TF2 for example.,Rocket League®
2015-07-26,5,60,27,False,Not Recommended,Pros+Fun and unique game mechanics that feel well designed and fleshed outDiving off of walls to stop the other team's game winning goal is satisfying everytime.+graphics look nice and game runs well60 fps nice interface etc.+No issues with lag from servers (although some have complained about it)+Split screen multiplayerSpeaks for itselfCons Lack of game modes/varietyThis is my biggest complaint about the game. The game only has one standard game mode there's no differences between cars other than visuals and only a handful of arenas to play at which again do not affect gameplay.I understand the game is trying to create a competitve experience which means skill has to come before luck and in game car upgrades however I feel this is a valid complaint. Lackluster single player modeI understand again that this is a primarily multiplayer competitive game. However the singleplayer modes offered are extremely shallow. The primary modes are exhibition (a single match) and a league mode. However the league mode struggles because all of the cpu teams are set to the same difficult setting (easy medium or hard). This means that once I beat one team the other matches should generally go the same way as none of the cpu characters play different from one another (from what I've seen). The league mode ends up feeling more suited towards the multiplayer game because of this but is not available in multiplayer. Controller supportMany controllers generally do not work with this game. While there is a fix on the forums to correct this the fix brings up a new issue. For example if I have an xbox controller (which by default works with the game) and my friend has a logitech controller (which by default does NOT work with the game) and I attempt the fix posted on the forum at best I can allow my friend's logitech controller to work however my controller will no longer work. The fix only corrects the problem if all players are using the same type of controller. I returned the game because of this issue.Overall for 20 dollars I think the game provides an enjoyable that will ultimately end up being hit or miss for a lot of people. Personally I felt the lack of variety in the game took away from it's lasting appeal and I didn't feel the core gameplay was enough to keep me playing.This in addition to the controller support issue leads me to not recommend this game. While I know many people may enjoy it I feel a large number of people may also feel similarly to me and a majority of the reviews neglect to point out the issues with single player and variety as a whole within the game.,Rocket League®

2017-05-26,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,I am complaining about the 2v2 &amp 3v3 ranking system I have played this game for a long time now and I have to say I love it but I feel like the creators don't care about the ranking system anymore (especially for middle ranked people). I have to say that this game has the same problem with CS GO's classic ranking system which is that you can play at a high level but the ranking system won't give you a buffer if you carry the team. You can get ranked up after carrying your team practically 1v3 or 1v5 and then get deranked from the next game with a close match overtime with a great teammate. Plz Pyonix!If you guys think that I am bronze you are F***ing wrong I have been Diamond 1 and now I have deranked all the way down to Platnum 1 due to greifing/trash teammates and Pro leveled smerfs boosting their friend while stripping my rank away! I can live with this stuff if I didn't go down a divi every time I come across one (sometimes even two) which happens every 4 matches. So my conclusion is that if you are a serious player and you get tilted as much as I do when this sh** happens than don't buy the game until they get the ranking system right. If you are the type of person that plays it casually (and doesn't care about your rank) but plays compeditive?!?! KY$ because you guys ruin the game and ruin other people's experience as well. Overall don't buy this game. P.S. don't get me started on their greed in car customizations (that use to be free about 1 year ago) crates (yes like the ones in the new age COD) and their sometime glitchy car physics.,Rocket League®

It must be me but i dont really like the game i would keep playing but the graphics and quality is giving me a bit of an eye strain. Considering i've only played the tutorial im trying to understand why the game is so fast paced and motion sickining. I guess im just unhappy with the game worth $20 dollars im not asking for a refund i might be so yeah. Maybe its just me i don't reckon its a game for people with eyes like mine. Jk,Rocket League®

Well this game isn't that. This game is more like that time Hurricane Al got you kicked out of the Adult Superstore in high school and on your way back to the car the school band rode by on their busses and caught you all in the act. However that detail isn't important what is important was the whether or not the clerk who kicked you out was a chick or a heavily metrosexual dude and that's all you can ing talk about on your car ride home. Then the driver gets off at Al's music and your directions. He's yelling at everyone to shut up and he's just about ready to smash the car into the nearest innocent person. Instead he should vent his anger with this game because it's great.,Rocket League®

2016-08-28,0,0,737,False,Recommended,Mario Kart 8 is a beautiful fun kart racer that introduces sound new ideas to Nintendo s 22 year old franchise. While it doesn't reach Double Dash levels of risk and experimentation Mario Kart 8 builds on the series' most essential aspects better than any of its predecessors. Twisting U turns a blistering sense of speed skillful track designs robust tournament and online features and gorgeous graphics fall into lockstep all at once. The end result shouldn't come as a surprise Mario Kart 8 is the king of the mascot kart circuit and it gave me hours of enjoyment.The single best improvement in Mario Kart 8 are the subtle yet ultimately satisfying antigravity transformations. They set up visually impressive moments while introducing a unique new mechanic to the race. Bumping nearby racers while in anti grav can give your opponent a speed boost though so you have to consider the best potential angle to slam into them so that you re the only one who benefits. Nailing a perfect bump after a tricky S curve delivered a satisfying feeling of accomplishment. It s surprising to see such a potentially chaotic idea turned into a nuanced mechanic.Online mode supports up to 12 players and Nintendo gets a lot of mileage out of Mario Kart 8 s basic online features. It s easy to join races setup tournaments and even upload highlight videos to YouTube but once again Nintendo s den mother attitude rears its head Chat is restricted to lobbies with friends only. There s no option to invite friends into a game and Mario Kart 8 also doesn't provide message notifications. This is seriously disappointing because you have to use outside means to coordinate friends only races. These omissions often make Mario Kart 8 feel like a fancy import Ferrari with an old ham radio built into the dashboard.Mario Kart 8 is the best kart racing game Nintendo has made in a long time. It strikes a careful balance between refining old ideas while introducing fresh new ones. Admittedly its gorgeous graphics and jazzy orchestrated soundtrack bolster its presentation but you re getting a lot more than just looks with this one although I spent an awful lot of time gawking at the details in slow motion the fast and furious pace of racing with friends both locally and online is what really kept me coming back.,Rocket League®

2017-03-29,0,0,170,False,Recommended,Rocket League PC ReviewIntroductionRocket League is the follow up to the not so successful Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars game which was the prequel to Rocket League. It had similar aspects to Rocket League such as a single player campaign a five minute time limit and the only objective is to score the soccer ball in the opposing team s goal and when the time duration ends whoever scores the most points is the ultimate winner. All goals only account for one point a piece and if it so happens that the game ties as is the case with traditional sports the game will go into overtime. We can all view Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars as Rocket League s little brother while Rocket League is the big brother in this case the more polished version of the ultimate experience. Rocket League can be seen as a stand alone expansion towards its little brother. While its younger brother released in 2008 in North America Rocket League debuted in July 2015. The game in the category of E sports and online games in general on the console and the personal computer is still relatively very new. So what sets Rocket League apart from other sport game competitors as well as the racing genre as a whole? Also does Rocket League ultimately flop at the end of the day or is it a game even your run of the mill casual players who go on every once in a while play?PresentationOne important feature to note about Rocket League in reference to its presentation is it is overly simplistic so much that it is a key feature in most E sports games with the exception of course of League of Legends Dota 2 and StarCraft II. The only purpose of the game is to score goals in the opposing team s goal much like soccer but with the added addition of cars that can fly up into the ceiling of each arena. While there is a good assortment of different arenas the sounds that play in these arenas and the overall sound quality is something left to be desired. It is not that the sounds do not mimic placing one in the environment that each conveys but overall the immersion is not significant enough such as the case is when going to an actual hockey or soccer game. The assets which were chosen by Psyonix in the cheering noises of the crowd does suffice although I am not one to agree with fandom when it comes to sports because of it leading to idolization. Despite this concern of mine I feel that the crowd chanting is not necessary in the game especially considering you are not able to see any physical features of the crowd s tenure while constantly hitting a ball across dome based arenas.GraphicsThe graphics feel polished enough for a game which combines two things flying cars and soccer together. Lighting is fluent while the details on each arena give some bouts of excitement to the player and an incentive to keep on playing. It is nothing that is groundbreaking when compared to things which can be made from the full use of the Unreal 4 Engine but still nonetheless the details shine to make its graphics a staple in the interactive community. Cars look excellent although I would have liked to see much more reflections in each arena when you are driving around. There is no reflection on the field s surface primarily because it is made of grass. Only as a matter of preference it would have been nice to mix and match different shades of grass textures together and mesh them which could have been generated from a voting poll directed towards the community as a whole. Other than this and the fact that AquaDome would look a tad better if the dome surrounding it showed some of the cars in its reflection it would add to the immersion as well as possible textures to mimic true glass walls of the encompassing dome shaped arenas. Online Game EnvironmentHere is one of the major atrocities and failures of Rocket League and that is the online community. Every online gaming community generated by a game created by a developer and published by a publisher requires a great deal of precision but also the knowledge to understand that it is not the developer who makes the online game but the players that make the game s online environment. Rocket League s online community is better and more acculturated than the Counter Strike community as a whole but there are still many people that feel too acculturated into the melting pot of the online gaming culture fully head on. One who cares about their health will take precautions to only play Rocket League in acceptable dosages because as is the case with any online game primarily centered around multiplayer for its lifespan endocrines are released into the central nervous system which if at non acceptable values can significantly harm a person s physical mental psychological and emotional health. The fact that most people do not seemingly care about this especially some Rocket League players that have not been educated on the dangers of overstimulation may find themselves addicted to the simplicity of online games. Most reviewers will tell you that this game is flawless but we should let the empirical evidence found in the game itself dictate that which the flaws will now be covered.Single Player/ Season Mode/ GameplayThere is not much to the gameplay except learning how to time aerials if you want to have any skill at all in the game. Otherwise if you don t take this game seriously as an E sport which I believe a good majority of the community doesn t then it is ground ball with Burnout Paradise gameplay elements all the way in propelling the ball across the arena and in boosting whether on the ground and some in the air. Single player is the main highlight of Rocket League because it provides a fair advantage and without the miserable banter of the online community with many players who are immature and even lack sportsmanship single player revives all misnomers that have just been discussed through the eyes of all critical elements that make the game what it is now. Single player has varying difficulty from Rookie to All Star level. One problem however with All Star difficulty is it is bugged some. What I mean by this is that pro difficulty is much more challenging than all star difficulty when compared to a match by match basis. In All Star difficulty for bots I noticed many times my teammates would position themselves right by the other goal sometimes in it sometimes just around it and sometimes slightly out of it. Overall score totalPresentation 7/10 Menus are quick and easy to access graphics are polished but reflections would be a welcomed addition. It loses points for the lack of any rules in the game at all because it becomes a play as you want to play venture online which can be dangerous.Gameplay 8/10 Solid gameplay with controls that are responsive physics that work and a stable experience.Online Community 5/10 The online community is 50 50 Many are immature and the ones you do find either has nothing to say or only want to win through a method of whatever it takes.Achievements 8/10 Not difficult nearly at all. Achievements are engaging if you do decide to go do an achievement run.Single player Excellent 7/10E sports quality 6/10 Good mainly because it is half and half. I could see if it is mostly aerials to take care of the physics portion which is the definition that would make it an e sport but without this it is only a normal soccer game but with cars.Final Score 9/10If you wanna show off to your friends this game is for you.If you like soccer then this game is for you.If you like playing with cars then this game is for you.If you like Need For Speed then this game is for you.I only buyed this game yesterday I'm bad at it but time to time I'm getting better.I only have played this game on Xbox so I know what its like.My brother cousins recommended me this game so I buyed it.Hope if you enjoyed this review you buy,Rocket League®

Other issues include the main menu music frame lag (counter acted by the wonderful arsenal of visual modifiers you can apply to the game thanks to the good devs at Psyonix) and extremely fluctuating queue times.I reccomend it but I didn't like it.

2016-11-25,0,0,1623,False,Recommended,3 years later and this is still the best multiplayer game I've ever played. Some games you still like and support after months or years have passed but they start feeling stale and playing them starts feeling like a chore... this is absolutely NOT one of those games. It's perfect in every single way. Pros Gameplay is fast paced fun and very skill based. (but still enjoyable no matter your skill level) Many game modes and options great multiplayer features splitscreen crossplay trading all done well. Graphics are sharp and car customization is addicting and VERY extensive. Music is fantastic and very fitting for the game. Lootboxes are purely cosmetic and you can still get the items without them if you're lucky and/or into trading. It s a game i will be playing for a really long time and still enjoy it thanks for that Psyonix !!,Rocket League®
2018-07-08,0,0,658,False,Not Recommended,Good game but I wouldn't buy it if you haven't already. I've experienced a couple of weird bugs that don't affect gameplay over the years but the main issues is the toxic community and a steep learning curve. Psyonix doesn't seem to do much about toxicity (especially for players on their own). Not as bad as some other games (R6 Overwatch) but still I'm seeing people being awful with trash talking teammates and the other team in a really gross way that only online people can do too often still. As a guy who does 95% of my time with a team it still makes me pretty irritated that this sort of crap has been happening and has not changed over the past few years. As for the learning curve the game been around long enough that everyone can arial pretty consistently so be ready to lose a lot for the first 100+ hours.Edit So apparently reporting and muting an entire team for being toxic gets you put right back into a match with them. Most games blacklist people after you would do such a thing. And now that Snow Day and other modes are comp you'll get a 5 min penalty for leaving even if your entire team does because you queued together. GG Psyonix.,Rocket League®

2017-10-21,0,0,1354,False,Not Recommended,1000+ hours in this game Lost my love for it because players have turned it into HELL!Back when it first came out it was good you had a good mix of players and often you would find a teammate that would work well with you. Now not so much you have players that are AFK can't hit the ball for their life but will blame you for any mistake that they make but don't ever point it out to them or you'll get reported and they'll ask the opposition team to report you too and they will. Psyonix' ban system doesn't have any offical reviews but more after a certain amount of reports you get banned so even if you say nothing you can still get banned. 10/10 for stupidity there! The game itself works well not any glitches that i've noticed recently you can actually have a lot of fun with the right people but too often you get around a 70% to nice ratio so it really degrades you're morale for the game. I wish it wasn't this way but it is and it doesn't look like thats gonna change...,Rocket League®
2017-11-03,0,0,220,False,Recommended,I mean as fun as it can be I must admit that there are a few features that may need improvment.1. There are many rumble (a gamemode) glitches such as a grapple not working when another player activates theirs the tornado not working the ball moving when being frozen and being destroyed in strong/god mode by a player who doesn't have it.2. It can get very annoying and raging.3. The voice chat system is not fully developed. All players can hear it and there isn't a mute player option.4. There is no matchmaking (or it's very broken). So this means you could have your first game yet you'll be up against a team of roketeers (top rank).5. Keys are pretty expensive. (Like 3)6. The blowing up feature in this game is very irritating when your just trying to play the game and then you just get blown up.7. Teamwork doesn't exist. Some players are just kids and have no concept of teamwork they just roam around the map and do nothing 8. Controls are pretty hard to learn but you can still change them any time.Yet there are some great features 1. A good range of customisables2. Good party system and gamemode accesability.3. Good graphics and good gameplay.4. Fun if you arn't in a competitive spirit.5. General preformance overall is nice.I'd reccoment this to 14 onwards.,Rocket League®

The skill required is crazy not a problem if you can take the time to learn and the practice maps are very well made. The problem is the community. It's the same issue overwatch has where you're forced to work with complete strangers. Well humans don't do that very well at all almost every comp game you'll get in will have someone make an easy mistake and someone will call them out on it either rudely or just a nudje on what they coulda done better. Yeah for that team it's over then and there. The person that messed up is now either sitting there typing how it was never their fault or heavily insulting the person that called them out the enemy team is typing ""lol git gud"" on repeat all game as they score easy goal after goal. At almost 250 hours played 3/4 games has been that way every time. The toxicity is unbearable. Reports mean nothing whatsoever. Then we get onto the factor of how absolutely atrocious the server lag is.

Until this is fixed i will not reccommend this game.,Rocket League®

2016-03-12,0,0,429,False,Recommended,"Multiple sports all in one game! Rocket League is a racing game a football a destruction derby game all together ok its basically a football game with extraordinary cars you have a big ball and a bunch of cars trying to score with a huge bouncing ball and the game psychics are awesome as well as the level designs!.There is plenty to do for the single player gamer the AI works surprisingly well in single player but for the real challenge the online option against other players will be even more fun with some friends or random people.Its fantastic to play but difficult to master there are so many ways to play the ball fly or use your car in any way possible.There are also plenty of cars racing cars trucks buggy and some ""themed"" cars for real money. But rather than the look there arent many differences. Customization of colors antennas hats rims powers/NOS colors is all possible.The game is very entertaining and very much worth your investment you are going to forget how fast time goes. DPlaying the game is awesome meeting a top tier party was destructive but also a fantastic way to show me how much is possible in this game. 10/10 The long way to glory.",Rocket League®

2016-09-09,0,0,548,False,Recommended,I'll try to keep this short and say this is the kind of game I can see myself playing for years and have already put hundreds of hours into. It's the kind of game even a newbie can pick up and play but has so much depth that even people with over a 2 000 hours into it still have things they can improve on. It's 100% skill based if you win it's because you're better than your opponent. If you lose it's because your opponent is better than you. If you practice and get better you will slowly but surely be able to beat more people as you get better at different techniques. It is a perfectly balanced competitive game.All that aside though it's just really really fun. It's very aesthetically pleasing I mean visually it's just something you'll enjoy looking at for hours on end. You can jump into a game incredibly quick and games are 5 minutes long (not including goal replays which can be skipped and overtime if the score is tied after the clock hits 0). The Free Play mode and training modes (goalie/striker/aerial training with 3 levels rookie pro and all star) and they're all made actually really well for practicing they aren't just t. There are also mods people have made on the internet that allow for more complex training like a dribble mod and a shot trainer where you can select specific shots to practice against in Free Play. It is also often as cheap as $5 during the big summer sales so I would watch out for that but even at $15 or less it's pretty cheap considering how much bang you're getting for your buck. Competitively two of the best 3 cards in the game (Breakout and Octane) come with the base version of the game the DLC is mainly just for looks.The best point I can make though is to look at where Rocket League stands in Steam's Top Played Games stats (which doesn't even include the cross platform numbers which is a lot) and how many hours people like me and others here have in the game. It's just pure fun. Just make sure you get a controller for it I use an Xbox 360 controller myself.,Rocket League®

2018-06-17,0,0,514,False,Not Recommended,It was fun at first but as you level up it forces you play against less casual players. If you want to just enjoy the chaotic fun that this game got famous for then enjoy it while you can at the start because the matchmaking will suck the fun out of it very quickly and only buying a new copy will fix that.Throwing random casuals that have no interest in practicing complex aerial shots that require learning new controller layouts against overly serious teams and season champions because everyone is the same game level but not skill level is a game breaking issue.,Rocket League®

2016-07-08,0,0,821,False,Not Recommended,A typical game on Rocket Lag 3...2...1... we all go for the ball! Oh yes... I got there first but it still rebounds into our end as usual. We manage to recover and after a couple minutes' hard graft we score at last. The crowd goes wild with chants of 'savage... savage... savage... chat disabled for 1 second'.A short time later we suddenly get another on a flukey bounce off the wall oh the poor sods! We are leading 2 0 with only a minute to go. Surely they cannot come back now.Then 3...2...1...lag!! What's this?? I race for the ball but miss it entirely due to lag. Unfortunately it hasn't affected them so all I can do now is watch it sail majestically through the air... right into our goal.Oh well no need to worry we are still leading 2 1 right? But seconds later the lag strikes again. The ball jitters left and right. My car is on the floor then suddenly driving on the ceiling and I am powerless to stop them scoring another. The game is now tied but hopefully the server will sort itself out before overtime. Must stay on the defensive!With 2 seconds to go the ball now utterly possessed decides once again to manifest itself in our goal. Oh how quickly the tables have turned but not due to skill or even blind luck! Annoyed and feeling cheated I quit the match immediately.A great game ruined by the omnipresent and oft reported lag problem.,Rocket League®

2017-05-18,0,0,2758,False,Recommended,I approve of this game because it has deep mechanics after you get through 300 hours of the game the physics are great and the game is growing extremely fast. The items also are a bonus because that feeling of always having the same car isn't as good as getting a hot new look and going in your first match. And losing of course.However Around the 400 hour range I started to stop. The game seemed to lose it's mechanical sense and I got stopped because my playstyle was different than everyone elses. I realized how good I became and I beat a team of grand champions in season 3 and yet I couldn't get past the stupid players taht ragequit and couldn't hit the ball while I carried my team multiple times. I was the MVP of almost every other game and I still wasn't moving fast upwards like I traditionally had.Get this game to play for 100 hours and stop immediately before you get into the mechanics. You will literally rage quit and play more matches and then call your team a bunch of ers. /UPDATE This game is the best game ever created. If you ever wanted to play soccer this game is for you. I can't stop playing it to the point I'm seeking medical help. The ragequitting just brings me back to it.,Rocket League®

2016-03-09,0,0,925,False,Recommended,"This is quite simply one of the best video games I have ever played. I would have to call it my favorite game since Super Smash Bros. Melee. In fact it reminds me of SSBM in many ways. At their surface both appear to be straight forward casual multiplayer games where you can hoot and holler and have a great time regardless of your skill level. But the better you get the more you realize how much room there actually is to improve and that leads to a great competitive scene.At Rocket League's most basic level you play soccer with cars. (The strategy reminds me more of hockey but I digress.) You drive around the pitch trying to smack a giant ball into a net. My first few dozen games I did just that and it was a blast. However the cars also have ""hydraulics"" that let them jump as well as rocket boosters that let them fly (or speed around the pitch). It is the mastery of these two abilities that bring the game to incredible new heights (bad pun I know).The jumping and flying ability allow more experienced players to do some crazy things. You'll see them flying through the air to hit crazy spinning aerial shots and saves. It's a sight to behold (YouTube ""kuxir97 montage"" to have your mind blown). And there is nothing like the feeling of hitting one of those shots for yourself.The developers are also the most responsive of any game I have ever played. They take suggestions from their playerbase via Reddit and other forums and they implement them in short order. Want an improved ranking system? Done. Licensed cars like the Delorean and Batmobile? All yours. Any DLC is entirely cosmetic (no pay to win here) and very reasonably priced (usually $1.99 to $3.99 for new packs that include different cars decals toppers antennas boost trails etc.).Anyway if you're reading reviews you probably want to know if it's worth buying. Obviously I think the gameplay is fantastic. Simple concept plus a high skill ceiling equals a great multiplayer game in my opinion. The visuals and music are both top notch... simply stunning to look at. The replay value is also amazing I have played over 3 000 games spanning 400 hours and I'm not even close to being sick of it. Don't hesitate buy this game and join the fun.",Rocket League®

It's constantly getting updated with new content such as new goal explosions and ways to pimp out your cars. The DLC is great because its all cosmetic and don't give you an advantage over other players. It takes a while to get the gist of how to play this game and is much more fun to play with friends so you know whos defending and whos on offense. They keep adding new game modes to keep spicing it up so definitely get this game if you want to have a fun time playing with your friends,Rocket League®

2017-03-11,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,I didn't want to write a review without testing it thoroughly. I am not going to focus on the pros as many people already do I am going to write about the cons.The matchmaking system is bad. To be honest a group of monkeys pressing the keyboard randomly could do better. You are often placed in games where you are either too good for the opponent or too bad for the opponent there is no middle term. The community is bad people complain about dota lol and cs... they are nice compared to this one... a bunch of 12 year old kids sitting in front of a screen playing the game all day can really make you crazy... but the worst... the absolute worst... is the f***ing camera and physics... it is just irritating contra intuitive and stupid... your car gets stuck to walls even when the inertia is not supposed to hold you there... there is no sense in the physics the game has. This is the worst game physics I have ever seen. To make things worse the lag... there is constant lag to the servers... and in a game where most of all you need reflex... lag matters... lag can be the difference between losing 10 to 0 and wining 10 to 0... Concluding... great concept shity physics and bad programing. Please don't waste your money on this game it is not worth it.,Rocket League®

Would come home from work and load it up anxious for that sweet sweet menu music just to tickle my competitive fancy. And yet Reddit existed and I became aware of plays I could never fathom to mimic. After awhile other games caught my interest. As with any game. However after awhile my life took a turn. I stopped studying and taking a few minutes off with a game here or there. There was a soft moment in my life where I needed to reevaluate things I stopped drinking started working out more thought I'd turn my life around for the better. That's when I rediscovered Rocket League my stone my rock. Loaded up a game one night and BAM that menu music punched my pathetic downtrodden metaphorical face. Until one night when I decide to endulge myself in the cutthroat gameplay that is fake virtual robot cars playing fake football I log on to find. Alas! Banned! For inappropriate chat that is chat that was delivered only by the tools that I was handed. A few words here and there barely a sentence... ""Great shot"" ""Wow!"" ""I'm defending""...

2016-06-08,0,0,623,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I have no time for video games. Yet I've found a way to put 200+ hours into this one. Simple to learn difficult to master. Easily the best most entertaining sports game that I have ever played. Once you get to the point where you are able to aerial and juggle the ball the game really becomes something noteworthy. I haven't had this much fun playing a game with friends in a long time. Scoring a goal or making a save as the time winds down can get your blood flowing as if you are watching the final minutes in the NBA finals and your team is down by 2 points. It is truly a deep well balanced game. Once you see two pros go at it you begin to realize just how deep the mechanics can get. Yet the game is fairly welcoming to newbies. It is such a simple concept that anyone can play a game or two and have fun almost immediately. You must play with a controller. I also recommend switching between ball cam and free cam on the fly. Last but not least learn the floaty physics of the ball. They are unpredicatably consistent. That is an oxymoron if there ever was one but it reigns true.

2016-09-09,0,0,172,False,Recommended,Amazing physics! Great game! It's like a real sport. You can have fun at all levels of skill/competition. You can constantly learn new things as time progresses and as you play. An awesome game to play with friends. Ignore the remainder of this game if you believe in skill and practice. Stop ing about microtransactions people! It is still Free to Play AND Free to Win. You can become the best without spending any money inside the game. It does help to buy a couple car models but if you are talking like its pay to win...its not you just suck Sorry honey...The loot crates is mainly geared towards people who wish to decorate their cars further. If you don't want to spend $10 on some keys then don't. Some people want to flaunt their cars and thats A OK. Stop ing and practice. Or better yet if you are a moaner just leave. Your toxic presence is better off outside our community.,Rocket League®

A console is nice for the game but is not needed. the dlc's are cheap and a cool. there's also a pretty big esport scene to this game wich is always interesting.

At first you are crawling on your knees and the next thing you know you are up on your two legs. In rocket league you start off driving on the floor and flipping forward the next thing you know you are up in the air using boost to its full advantage smashing balls out of the way of your goal freestyling halfway across the map and sniping a pinch from your own side of your field all the way into their goal. Playing with friends even gives you a better experience and you will be communicating like there is nothing else to do. You will soon rise up through the ranks where some even make it to pro level. There is one haunting though..... One HAUNTING that i hate. It is called (you are banned for 24 hours for explisive behavior)!!!!

I have no clue how they managed to intoduce it like it is a patch or something but it needs to be fixed. It completly ruins the game.

2018-11-14,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,"Would have recomeneded back in the day but as most games do that are succesful they have fallen down the path of greed. While im sure after countless sponsership deals at esports events filling their pockets they definatly need more money so you should buy their subscription system for additional cosemtic items. ofcourse you dont have to buy them to do better it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you go back to the game and find they are cashing in on other game companies marketing strategies without doing the reasearch before hand. It would be one thing if the company needed the money to continue providing a service like WoW does as they are dependant on running their own servers. but a peer to peer server based quick play game has no need to charge people monthly as they already offer a multitude of payment options to buy cosmetic items.

2019-01-05,0,0,154,False,Not Recommended,"As fun as the gameplay is the matchmaking player base and banning system make it a waste of time and money. If you're good psyonix is gonna pair you with someone who isn't someone who doesn't know how or when to rotate whiffs all the time and plays at the skill level of one or two whole ranks below you. You are naturally going to get annoyed and frustrated at this happening all the time so you say ""what a save"" or ""nice shot"" sarcastically. well now that player will refuse to forfeit and will either afk or just straight up play for the other team. This is pretty much the player base and people are going to report you bc you hurt their feelings or insulted their intelligence/skill at the game. eventually you will get banned...fine except that you can't play ANY online game mode and there is no way to redeem yourself. You can't charge people money for something and then deny them the ability to use it. I really hope gamers boycott rocket league or else other developers are going to think it's okay to follow the same banning model. we all deserve better than psyonix",Rocket League®

2017-10-03,0,0,4014,False,Not Recommended,The best game in a while for me but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend for a number of reasons.1. The servers are incredibly unreliable and in the western US rubberband lag is common on most servers. This only gets more frustrating as you put in more time and wins and losses come down to fractions of space and time.2. The arena favorite/unfavorite system appears to do absolutely nothing. Since I've disliked Farmstead I've played at least a third of my matches on it. Don't include that system if it's not going to work.3. The trading system is broken and basically welcomes scammers. Obviously psynonix isn't managing 3rd party trading sites but nonetheless they've totally blown it here. They know there is a market for the cosmetics so they create super rare items. In creating super rare items they're creating items of value exceeding the MAXIMUM amount of tradeable items currently in their system. Right now you can only trade 24 items at a time. If a goal explosion is worth for example 35 keys either one side risks being scammed 24 keys or the other risks being scammed 11 keys. It's a simple fix don't let scammers run the trading community please.,Rocket League®

2017-07-25,0,0,616,False,Not Recommended,Playing in Linux is a bit useless. On the other hand playing in windows shows that it's a nice game. But if you want to play in Linux it's such a bad game. Playing with GTX970 and i7 4790k makes the game unplayeable. Too much lag when playing online(20 30fps) and so often to have huge fps drop(to 5 10fps) in some situations. It would be so nice if performance in Linux could be at the level of Windows's...until this happens I will remain thinking to not recommend this game.Trading via steam is something I really like but with rocket league it's not possible. I don't understand the reason why developers did it but whatever it is I still think is something that would improve the game. I have been trading for a while and I have found too much people with really important mental deseases like You tell him to trade what he posted in a web and he call you (?)If you play competitive hiding the text chat is a must.

2016-04-24,0,0,2664,False,Recommended,"Great game great gameplay. It's nice to play a co op/pvp style game that doesn't feature killing and griefing. I don't care about the unlockables or customization that much but it's a cool system and it's nice to pay a reasonable price for a hosted game and not have to deal with a cash shop or a sub.Another very good element of the game is the tutorials. There are a variety of tutorials for the different elements of the game along with exhibition matches and custom matches you can setup vs bots and whatnot so there are all kinds of tools for not only learning the game but for helping you improve your game even as you are into playing it.The drawback for me is that the matchmaking is horrible at best. You end up joining blowouts and other disasters and you can leave them but it's a waste of time often and being able to leave matches without penalty often makes for very volatile matches.The matchmaking is also whacked in that cowards can hide their title/rank (dumbest idea ever if you want to be anon stick to bots or just don't play) and the game is so screwed up that high ranked players can group with lowbies and end up in matches way beneath their level which basically means unless they're a gimp in addition to being a coward that they dominate. It's not fun in ANY pvp to be in a pug against a good premade and it's especially lame when you have to play against far higher level people with far more skill at the game.All one ever wants in any kind of group based PvP is a fairly even match and a chance to compete. You often don't get that in rocket league due to the whacked way super high level players can group with and carry gimps or with decent premades vs pugs which happens a LOT nor with the matchmaking dumping you into craptastic disasters of matches where you'll get too much xp for either not helping in a blowout victory (due to some god on your team going nuts on everything) or for a blowout loss you didn't cause and get into late.The idea that level equates to skill is also pretty stupid as a basis for matchmaking although in general you do get better as you level up if you give a crap (you figure out how to play). The fact that you get tons of xp even if you lose thus rank up faster even if you're not getting better further encourages people to bail out on matches that aren't going well.Lastly the game has no penalty for leaving matches. This is partially good because the matchmaking is so terrible. But there should at least be a penalty for people who leave early in matches (matches are only 5 minutes long for f's sake). It's easy to come back from a goal or two down and you see epic comebacks on a bigger deficit occasionally but when one of your three players bails out in the first minute just because the other team scored it makes it harder since the disruption of a useless bot and/or players coming and going makes it harder to get thru.Because there is no penalty for leaving people often leave for any reason at all they want only easy wins and to be carried they don't want to join a crappy match in progress they rage and blame everyone else on a 3 person team when they're just as much a part of a problem as anybody etc.The game should do a better job of determining winnable matches and NOT queue you into those 0 5 with minimal time left hopeless losses (nobody wants xp for a loss they didn't even help create) and the game should punish people with an in game timeout (have to do tutorials freeplay or bot matches to work it off not just log off) for leaving matches that are reasonably winnable and at the least should punish the complete and utter scrubs that bail out in the first minute for any reason.Another semi negative is the built in voice it's just bad. The audio quaility is horrid. Mercifully you can mute people which handles the wanna be ""vocalists"" that spew incoherent due to the low quailty idiocy and it mutes their in game idiocy as well and as with any online game you get your share of people raging and/or otherwise actiing like poorly raised brats in chat.",Rocket League®

2017-03-18,0,0,1354,False,Recommended,Well Rocket League.This game is a football game.....in cars.The game overall is very well done graphics look awesome sound....sounds awesome the only real downside to this game is that solo queueing can be a nightmare players in the community can be highly salty not the game's fault but it happens it is better to find a friend that plays the game also and play together in a dedicated team and you will go far random matches with random players is not that well balanced you can have one match and you will win easily and the very next match you will get slaughtered.So while this game is very good and well developed i will have to give this game a 7/10 it loses 3 points for its very badly implemented Matchmaking and ranking system which only uses a invisible MMR point system to define skill levels which is very flawed since there are players that are VERY good and have the same score as me....and i am not that good at all.Overall 7/10I would recommend this to any group of people that can do multi teams of 2s or 3s but a single player? doubt it cause it would be a very bad experience.,Rocket League®

2016-05-27,0,0,4,False,Recommended,"DISCLAIMER This is a first impressions review and NOT a full review if you want a full review then please read better reviews then mine What happens when you place football (or soccer in the USA however in this review I'm calling it football because I'm European and this is my review so there) and cars and mix them together? You get Rocket League. Rocket League is a racing mixed with sports game developed by Psyonix. The same people who made the free to play game Nosgoth! In Rocket League you basically drive a car and hit around a large ball into a goal post whilst defending your own goal post pretty much it's football with cars. It might be the best sports game I've played this year!The game offers some of the greatest gameplay I have played and it is extremely competitive and this game will make you lose your friends as it can make you punch someone in the face trust me. Rocket League's matchmaking is extremely fair and matches you with players that are the same as your XP level. Although Rocket League looks very easy to pick up but it is a hard way to master...Rocket League's graphics are very pretty and make me feel like I am in a stadium playing a football game even though I hate playing football and I despise it as a sport (don't hate me). The music is amazing as well it made me want to buy the soundtrack which I rarely doRocket League offers tons of customization for it's cars and offers additional cosmetics through DLC although I don't agree to it I'm not complaining. Plus the game offers cross platform! Which I fully 100% agree!Rocket League is an amazing game to play for lovers or haters of the sport this game will hook you in completely with it's amazing gameplay and fantastic graphics and very competitive gameplayGO PLAY ROCKET LEAGUE! RECOMMENDED ) THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"" etc... So I have decided to make my own!)",Rocket League®

2018-02-06,0,0,975,False,Not Recommended,I personily love this game but I can't play because of System Lag. I hate that I can't play a game that I love. I've experimented to see what the issue was. It wasn't Steam because the lag wasn't for other games. It wasn't my computer because I deleted so many programs and my FPS is still normal. In Rocket League I have been getting these Screen Stutters and i've experimented on the Video Settings for a week. I couldn't find a problem with anything. In conclusion I now can't play a game I love and have to not play it anymore. If you read this Psyonix you have just lost a costomer that buys in game currency. Bye Psyonix.,Rocket League®

So these retard developers can banned someone for 24 hrs for trash talking to teammates that do not know how to play properly don't even know basic movements not even rotation players that do not even contribute that just stay in the goal and don't even know how to defend...RL Developers suck a big one. Fix your match making and I guarantee you that people that trash talk will dwindle by large numbers.I reached Shooting start before you changed the name and by the time the season was over b/c of your match making I got deranked all the way to challenger. This keeps repeating even now I have reached Platinum III and I have gotten deranked multiple times.Your match making is so I take two and three week breaks from your game and return to play a random match in competitive and I get matched with people person that doesn't even know how to fly HOW???? IN PLATINUM??????????Make a reporting of players skills based on how they play and ban them too. D*MB*SS Developers make a competent reporting tool if you are banning people. People need to be reported because of their skill level.FORCE THEM TO PLAY IN REGULAR FOR A SET AMOUNT OF HOURS AND THEY WILL IMPROVE F*CKT*RDS,Rocket League®

Cross platform multiplayer with PS4 further expands its online player base.Its optional microtransactions and DLC are largely cosmetic so you won't miss out on anything important by not buying them. I didn't even notice there were microtransactions available until last week but maybe this says more about me than it says about the game.Highly recommended.,Rocket League®

2015-09-25,3,54,11,False,Not Recommended,TL DRIf you live in China don't buy this game... yet.Before you pass read this review and it'll tell you why it's bad.This is a good game it really is. Not being a soccer fan at all whatsoever I love this game because it combines both cars AND soccer AND rockets with explosions and fast speed. Yep pretty exciting. The graphics are wonderful the cosmetics are great and this game is enjoyable with or without dlc. Although this game is made for people with controllers me personally not being a fan of the controller still managed to play this game and mastered its basics within the timeframe of 2 hours. Great simple controls make everything easier to study.So why am I giving this a bad review?Because of the servers.Right now I'm sure they're working on it as Rocket League is somewhat fairly new. But in the place I live in China the servers can't connect for some strange reason prehaps the government blocked it but was able to connect to the servers through a VPN which still gave me 200 ping and gradually incremented to 400 for no reason whatsoever even though the VPN is extremely fast.Once the servers have been fixed I'll be happily able to rewrite this review and reconsider. For now I guess I'll play offline...,Rocket League®

2017-11-20,0,0,413,False,Not Recommended,game is extremely simple couple of cars and some very lazy unreal engine physics. the devs and community act like its a sport lmao. gotta do something about their egos i guess.speaking of egos this is the whiniest community in gaming ever. all they do is cry about how everyone else didnt win the game for them. they queue solo for triples attempt to hit every single ball with no consideration for the rest of their team and then flip out when they lose because theres no way it could possibly be their fault. then they report you out of spite. no use communicating with anyone in game as pretty much every thing these days is verbal harassment apparently. if you're not praising everything then you get yelled at. again with the whiney egotistical community. the only way i will play this game now is if my friends are playing it because its the most frustrating game to play by yourself. the servers are atrocious. constantly it will show you have it hit the ball on your client side but then the game glitches out and the ball is suddenly at the other end of the field. skill is directly related to ping/server connection. dont let anyone tell you different. gambling micro transactions always a no in my book. game would be ok for $10 and play one or two games. but the community kills it even for that price.,Rocket League®

2017-11-11,0,0,1,False,Recommended,"+ Great storytelling.+ Its themes evolve as the story progresses in Afterstory.+ Incredibly emotional.+ Unique characters that all provide purpose to the story in some way or another.+ Nagisa Kotomi Tomoyo Ibuki Kyou and Sunohara are top tier best girls.+ Akio and Sanae are the best parents I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.+ Exceptional humor.+ Extremely replayable.+ One of the most genuine MC's in Visual Novels (Tomoya Okazaki)+ Unique story where you actually SEE the married life of a couple and the relationship they had prior.+ Easily the best OST I have ever heard in a game each one contributing so much to the message each scene is trying to portray. Snowfield is honestly one of my favorite song in videogames making me cry because of the beauty of the scene it was involved in.+ Afterstory is my favorite 2nd half in a visual novel alongside Steins Gate evolving its themes to a much more family orientated setting as well as providing emotional heartbreak that no other game could ever provide except this one.+ The ending is amazing and the use of the ""orb lights"" is one of my favorite plot elements ever being detailed enough for hardcore analysis on the role it played in the final moments of Clannad.+ The Illusionary World is absolutely genius.+ Another aspect I enjoy about the themes of Clannad is that they are family orientated and could honestly help anyone in need of advice on what to do with their life offering many unique perspectives on certain ideals that are evident in the world we live in. Art is charming however it is definitely not for everyone. The game is on average 80+ hours being one of the longest videogame scripts EVER!!!Overall Clannad was a 10/10 for me. I don't think I have experienced a story as great as this one since the original Steins Gate and Steins Gate 0. The way Clannad tells its story in such a simple but unique way constantly evolving with time progressions is truly a thought provoking and ""valuable"" experience. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants to involve themselves in the ""Visual Novel"" medium as it is the best one I have ever played besides Steins Gate. The game is worth every cent 50 dollars is honestly not a bad price for one of the best games of the genre BUY THIS and enjoy it as it a truly profound and life altering experience!",Rocket League®

2017-12-11,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,"Short Version. Unless you can put 3 people in a party and gaurentee your team is decent save your money. The 4 pack version is the ONLY version of this game you should buy. I see that ones gone ( If you dont have friends the matchmaking is garbage.Pros Graphics Are Fanstastic Takes NOTHING to run (Optimized) Cars Are Cool You Unlock Most Customization just but completing matches (However this has led to a problem too) All Cars perform Equally Game is Skill based. Game is Extremely fun provided the below doesnt get you. Cons Game is RNG based More than skill. Matchmaking is GARBAGE. That is the only correct term for it. Players leave their game on and Just AFK Away to get free stuff. There is no Kick system for these players. Skill Balance is usually one sided. You end up leaving more matches than staying in or becoming a afker. Non Matchmaking Cons. Aerial Controls are often impossible to do quickly as you will end up rolling instead. When you lock the camera to your car and drive on a wall the camera doesn't rotate with it. usually resulting in the car blocking the entire screen. So untill the AFK problem is dealt with and Matchmaking has some tweaks I don't recommend this game. AFK could be simple has the player been not moving/had the same input for 30 sec continously if so kick player. (taking into account all controls not just one.) There is nothing I can really offer towards matchmaking. It needs to be rebuilt.I really do like this game... and it keeps drawing me back to play it but the end seems to always be the same. Search for a decent game for 20 min play 5 min of heaven then search for 20 min. The Gut Reaction version. (What I typed before Condensing.) As long as you don't play online by yourself or without a full party you should be fine. However If you do decide to venture alone prepare to either dominate or be dominated (second is more likely) as in my 48 matches I have Done in the last couple days at least half have been with a team 2 people short due to afk players. or sometimes Its you vs the world but of course these games also put all the players more skilled than you on the other side when this happens. SO have fun trying to even touch the ball. If you can get a truly even match this game is a lot of fun but chances of getting one are about 10 percent.If you get a team you like dont get attached The game will make sure your not part of that team for the next match. There needs to be a kicksystem implemented in this game for players that don't move. Half the games I leave are because half my team is afk. The game also seems to like sticking skilled players with skilled players and average players with average players. So you end up with 3 skilled vs 3 average LOTS or 4Skilled vs 4 average. Sometimes it will give you a decent balance but then it looks like this. 1 ""Professional"" player 1 skilled 2 average vs 4 above average guys. The result is almost always the same. One side Gets their rear end handed to them the other side just steamrolls. The ranking system seems to have no rhyme or reason either. I went from Rookie Rank to Semi pro in about 8 matches. I quite often watch the players i'm stuck with EASILY pull off crap I cant even do in the tutorials. Which by the way the advanced ones tell you what your supposed to do but dont explain at all HOW to do them. Now. in the 6/7 actually fair games I have got this game is a lot of fun. But if you intend to buy this outside of the 4 player pack you can get and not have a full team or ""Party"" going in then save your money This game just gets agrivating and you find yourself leaving more matches than you complete. Because there is either no contest at all or your down most of your team.",Rocket League®

I would recommend IF the devs 1) fixed the ranked games to be more fairly matched2) if they will fix the new season ranks so people who were 1 point away from gold are not playing people who had just gotten to silver3) if they fix the ranked exp system!

Do not get me wrong some of the item are neat but in the long run you will waste about 80% of you money opening a crate for a chance to get nothing sweet.I would absolutly love this game if it had daily challenges which granted you a key through completing the challenge that way people can come and enjoy this game with out having to waste money they worked very hard for that way the trade system would work better that way people would not get SCAMMED REAL MONEY and thay way it gives players something to work towards each day they come to play.its sad to see such a good game with amazing potential go to waste cause you got money hungry producers i have put alot of time in this game and i have fallen victim to paying $5 for keys but in my opinion its really not worth your time considering the way the game is at this current moment.,Rocket League®

I regreted my purchase...It was developed on Unreal Engine 3 which is alright. It looks good (except for the wierd FOV rendering) physics are alright and so on... Fun concept design of the cars...Now for the problems. First off this costs 20 . If you going to sell something like that expensive you need content you need replayability. All maps are the same except for really minor changes only one playable mode (you do have sort of campaign with SEASONS but you will beat the AI everytime). And what about the content? Do you unlock every car by leveling up (not sure why there is there a leveling system)? ""What? No? DLC CARS? FOR 1.99 A CAR? OR 3.99 FOR 2 CARS?"" Now its NOT a pay to win situation because all cars have same stats. But why am I paying 20 for locked off content which is already in game? Do I really need to pay 64.85 to have content? Are you serious? The basic version has barely content for 7 50 game... If it was a free title then sure but NEVER HAVE THIS KIND OF DLC IN A PAID GAME!Oh and there are crates... with keys you need to buy to unlock them... like CS GO...Players are not working as a team. In a team based game. All they want are goals and they hate you if you take it from them.Hate this review all you want its not even going to lower the overall review stats anyway.

A struggle with most communities that have age have the people here are either too sensitive for a simple suggestions or a joking 'What a Save!' on a goalie who misses a simple to block goal. If you provide any grief whether you feal it was grief or not on any other player in this game you will easily be put to a temp ban.

Where Psyonix used to be all about chasing their dream of making a fun exciting experience driven by their own dreams they have turned into a money hungry company that is chasing profit at every turn they can find it... and they've abandoned the larger pool of us ""casual gamers"" (who want to play a game with friends and have lots of fun doing it) to court the serious ""e sports gamer"" who only care about official tournaments and profitable recognition.A system of ""crates"" and ""keys"" was recently introduced and all the things which used to be easy affordable DLC now require players to spend LOTS of money to literally gamble for cosmetics. This has turned the whole game into a cesspool of ""farmers"" ""spammers"" and straight up scammers who are concerned about nothing more than trying to score rare decorative items. You can barely play without getting bombarded by requests to ""trade"".And now most recently the developers have started eliminating all of the unique creative arenas from the game because ""our RLCS (Rocket League Championship Series) players have indicated that they prefer playing on one standard shape and size of field."" GREAT! Punish all of the people who actually play this for fun and enjoy being challenged to cater to very small segment just because they are generating revenue through e sports.

2016-12-03,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,Cheating smurfing and a whole lot of AFK players using bots to farm for crates. I can't recommend this game when people are allowed to farm using bots with impunity it sucks when they're on your team doing nothing but jumping in a corner of the arena and it sucks when they're on the other team ruining the competitive fun of the game.Apparently the report feature is cosmetic because several players can report a botter and that bot will keep showing up in queues unimpeded and apparently without penalties. If there were real penalties for botting and cheating people wouldn't risk it but they do proving the system is not functioning or not effective.Rocket League's devs need to take a play from the Blizzard playbook and make it clear that botters/cheaters will lose their accounts.Aside from that RL has all the ingredients of a fun competitive online game. The art style works well with the theme the cars are unique and cash shop items do not impact gameplay they're cosmetic only. The devs also do a good job putting out content updates with new arenas which are available for free like the fantastic AquaDome.But again none of that matters if the fun is ruined because people are allowed to use farming bots smurf to destroy low level players and cheat. Fixing those issues are an absolute non negotiable must.,Rocket League®

2016-01-17,2,22,470,False,Not Recommended,"Consistent InconsistenciesThere's a particular reason im thumbing down Rocket League. This Football with Cars Type of game is beautifully executed has a clear visual style tight controls (although partially frustrating on double jumps not adjusting when using ball focused camera) and a huge following. So huge it caused massive outages in its early days. Those are luckily a thing of the past and it's a great party game because of its built in splitscreen.While the game has a certain simplicity to it the advanced moves such as aerial kicks handbreak slides and precision shots can offer a huge skill ceiling.And that's where the huge problem comes in. This game is consistently inconsistent. After you've hit a certain rank and skill level yourself you will notice HUGE sways in game results based on sheer luck and ery in the physics system. Even at 20 milliseconds of ping you will regularly phase through the ball hit it clearly but ""miss"" it while it does a twitching animation reminiscent of early access games and concede frustrating amounts of goals not because your opponents were the better players but simply because the way momentum given to the ball especially in pressed situations is so utterly unreliable it makes you wish to avoid engaging in pressed balls alltogether (which believe me is not a great strategy because it leaves you very vulnerable to long range shots).It should be of positive mention that the developers have kept upgrading the game with additional visual content as well as new game modes although they're nothing special just your run of the mill modifiers you'd expect from an arcade racing game. A bunch of it is in DLC form (total cost at this point 13 96 ) including a rather dodgy Delorian from Back to the Future which may or may not grant you in game advantages. I personally found my winrate increasing 10% when using it and memorably losing more commonly against it but that might just be down to too small sample size of only 180+ hours.The competetive scene for this title has remained rather small and lost a lot of viewers very early on as a result of these issues. There are amazing montages of pro players to be found on the web but they obviously do not contain those moments when it shouldve been a goal/save but wasnt. Unless you have the patience and nerves of steel to improve yourself to skill levels where you completely dominate your opponents you will frequently lose to slightly weaker opponents simply because they had more of those ""twitchy"" moments go in their favor. You can even see the pros adapt to this as they favor long range shots and a stationary goalkeeper just to keep the randomness of a closer approach on a smaller scale and sorry if the pros at your e sport have to change their playstyle to adapt to how bad your physics work in a physics based football game you have failed.So if you're just looking for a casual party game with inexperienced players tumbling around and scoring hilarious yet rather awkward goals go for it. But if you'd want to actually explore the skill ceiling and compete with others in the ranked ladders don't bother. You're more likely to make holes into your equipment in rage than to beat the game's consistent inconsistencies.February Update With the Season 2 Update to Rocket League even more of my previously negatively mentioned inconsistencies have been intentionally added into the game. You may now experience matches even in the ranked ladders on non default maps completely at random. Not only are some of these maps intentionally designed to enable inconsistencies (curved walls leading to vastly different deflection angles based on the height the ball hits them) but you may also play on that map completely at random meaning if you are not accustomed to whatever map shape you're playing on and the other team is because they've been playing on that map type for a match or more in a row you'll have another layer of randomized advantage and disorientation. Also the developers intentionally patched the feature to forfeit the match before kickoff resulting in a canceled match at a reduced point less (to potentiall skip the aforementioned sand map) out of ranked queues leaving you completely at the whim or RNG to be forced to play on a map you may not be accustomed to.Additionally matchmaking for the randomized player queues has been obscured in that it no longer displays you any progression in your rank. You may find yourself de or upranking after any match based on your ""performance"" (which is basically nothing else than your in game score) meaning you now get additionally penalized for a defensive playstyle which tends to be a safer choice but yield lower scores than a risky all out attack strategy. It also takes the ranks of the players you're matched with into account for the ranking changes you no longer get shown so hurray for even more RNG. If this review would have a score it wouldve gone down from a 7/10 to a 6/10 simply because of the developers unrelenting intent to patch more inconsistencies into the game.",Rocket League®

More you go high in competitive matches more people like this you'll meet and then it will start to lose most of the fun.In short a good game ruined by bad players.

2016-09-12,1,3,11,False,Not Recommended,"First off it's telling that you can't comment in the community discussion boards. That's probably because they got tired of reading people complaining about being ""given"" crates and then having to buy the crate for cash money even after you've paid for the game. This alone is pretty gross.Or about how horrid the NPCs are pretty much tossing the idea of a solo season out the window. On easy they're all potato and your own teammates will very often run the ball into your goal. Neither your teammates or your opponents will use boost so you're going to win. On Pro the enemy NPCs work as a hive mind scoring mostly shots that would be impossible to time otherwise and your own teammates remain potato though they do gain some sense of when to block. Not that they actually do so but they kind of hang around in front of your goal at the appropriate time sometimes. On multiplayer the servers are pretty solid and there are no magical hive minds but you're always at the mercy of getting That Guy on your team that doesn't seem to understand what's going on. The game is also extremely repetitive and although there are different car modifications none of them affect anything. You can play and play and your car will be functionally identical to when you started.In summary Very fun for maybe 5 10 hours depending on your tolerance for doing the same thing over and over. Not good for solo at all and mediocre for multiplayer and you're still going to get those wonderful crates that require a credit card to open even though you've already paid $20 for the game.",Rocket League®

2016-04-23,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League is a physics based sports game loosely based on soccer. You play as a rocket powered car and your goal is to bounce an oversized ball off of your vehicle into the goal on the other end of the field. The standard setup is 3v3 but you can play with teams of any size from 1 to 4.The game is very simplistic. The controls are fairly basic but are at times frustrating. Your car can drive forward or in reverse skid to help you rapidly change direction give you a rocket boost or jump (and double jump). The jumping is the most complicated part of the game if you jump and use your rocket boost you can fly through the air for brief periods of time. You can also shoot through the air with a sort of rolling rocket boost instead of jumping/double jumping which takes your car on a much lower arc.The controls are tight in their own way but also frustrating there are very few commands but the jump and the throw your car through the air commands use the same button with the only difference being directional controls. This is a bit frustrating at times as you want to double jump or boost and get the other thing. It is something you have to get used to but it feels strange that you have to at all because there are so few buttons actually being used.Likewise flying through the air on a rocket is extremely awkwardly executed. It takes a lot of practice to do so reliably and the controls are very sensitive making it easy to spin out or end up somewhere you didn t want to go.The overall physics of it are decent enough it is generally fairly predictable where the ball will go but oftentimes multiple cars will collide with the ball at the same time making its trajectory much less predictable.There is both a single player mode and a multiplayer mode to the game the single player mode takes the player through a season of games with NPC teammates while the online multiplayer mode has both ranked and unranked modes at multiple team sizes. The ranking system works pretty well and I was mostly being matched up with reasonably skilled players close to my own level though it seemed to overestimate my skill rather than underestimate it so I was usually one of the weaker players I did not once win the MVP award when I played online.The games are also quite short clocking in at five minutes each though the replays on all the goals make them last longer especially in single player where sometimes the weaker AI levels will allow you to rack up 20+ points in a game.All in all the game is a decent sports game albeit with somewhat questionable controls.So why the lack of a recommendation?Honestly while the game was fun for a while by the time I d played it for a day or so I was already more or less done with it. It wasn t that it was bad it was that like many such games it was pretty repetitive. But the game itself felt very simplistic.If you aren t a sports game fan you re likely to get bored with this game fairly quickly. If you don t have a high tolerance for repetition you also won t really care for this game very much.If you do like the sort of repetitive iterative competition and don t mind a bit of chaos in a game this may well be something you enjoy. But personally I got all that I wanted to out of the free weekend and I can t really see wanting to buy it to play it more.,Rocket League®

I was doing this awesome smoking hot chick and moreover one who was unavailable to my peers.

Most of the players are very upset by this and the solution is simple a map filter. The developers are however very inexperienced and refuse to listen to their community. They say they intend for all players to have to play maps they don't find to be fun which shows that it was an INTENTIONAL move on their part not to include these maps in the base game so as to misrepresent the type of game this was and move more units.I used to LOVE this game but the lack of developer skill and willingness to listen to their community has ruined it.

Im proud that i pressed the UNINSTALL button.EDIT THIS GAME .. like for real .. playing Cancer League is like having a autistic boss who annoys you every ing workday in the Nuclear Power Plant. He cant even speak right but baits you with a better payment every IN day and you cant even quit this job cause you fall for his everytime cause youre a Mother ing RETARD... Seriously Trashyonix cant you even fix your ing Game .. probably Programmed with ing Visual Basic on a Cryengine 2. in fix your servers mates ...if i want to see everything in freakin Slow Motion ill get myself some in LSD which is probably better than this in cancerous Game.Its all in Fun till you join a Match and you realize it will be ed up again cause the in countdown starts to lag like mother ing Witcher 3 on 16K on a in Celeron CPU with Intel HD graphics.If i could choose to get a Supercomputer ill never need to upgrade anymore and a 5G Connection OR Ban Rocket League for 12 hours from all Platforms Id choose to ban this ing Game.This game is worse than Hitler. this",Rocket League®

2017-07-04,0,0,1098,False,Not Recommended,"For casual players Rocket League offers an insanely fun physics driving/flying soccer game. Unfortunately the competitive scene doesn't live up to the hype. You can't punish bad plays at all mainly because boost (what you use to drive fast and fly) is essentially infinite so your positioning largely doesn't matter. You can miss a shot miss a block or take a bad shot and you haven't lost anything. This makes the optimal strategy in every league above bronze ""hit the ball in random directions as much as possible until you get lucky"" which makes ranked pretty dull after awhile. The top players make very little money and that will never change.Most of the community (ranked and unranked) are toxic trolls and/or idiots. If you intend to get RL disable all chat. You'll thank me for it.Overall great for casual playing. Terrible if you want to compete.",Rocket League®

I'm now over 200 hours into the game and I am still having the same amount of fun I did when I first started. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys competitive multiplayer games (CSGO and LoL players too). THIS IS NOT A TIME DEMANDING GAMES! Matches go for 5 minutes!! and you can leave in normal games as you are replaced with a fairly good AI player until someone else joins. Trolls can not effect you. You have the ability to turn off all communications with players (or toggle Team Only) which includes the in game voice and text chat. Perfect game10/10,Rocket League®

2015-12-13,3,24,109,False,Not Recommended,While this game is a really fun multiplayer game especially when playing alongside friends the game is too unstable for me to enjoy properly. A current issue I'm experiencing is reoccuring rubberbanding at the start of every match no matter the server or game ranked official or private match. A bit of digging turns up a lot of other people having various rubberbanding and lag issues as well.If you're able to enjoy the game without these issues it is a fun and challenging experience that rewards both individual skill as well as co ordinated teamwork. The physics are a bit cartoony but that seems to be somewhat of an artistic decision.When I'm able to play it it's a lot of fun. However the issues I'm having with the game is really frustrating and often disrupts what is otherwise a fun gaming session. A pity really.

2015-12-27,2,22,10,False,Not Recommended,"I really wanted to like this game believe me. As a fan of weird football games Fifa Street Haxball some other game that was released in early 2000's... I put countless hours into them even though they weren't pretty good. This game has so much promise it got sexy moves uniqueness good customization and endless variety of play. It all could matter something if the game had some decent camera controls or simply just an overhead cam that has been apparent in every football game ever made. Unfortunately at this state of camera I am given two options ""Know where you are"" and ""Know where the ball is"" there is no middle ground. Thus it makes the game unplayable for me. Other matter is matchmaking. I have started playing the game two days ago and I am matched with people flying all over the pitch and I am looking at them thinking ""what the actual "".When camera is fixed (if they even bother seems like most of the people are fine with the game) I'll come back to it and play the out of it.

Because everytime I play I get stuck with either 500 lag hackers or they put me on a team with all rookies going against all veterans and above. Its not fun constantly losing. It almost seems like the devs have a personal grudge against me. I can play the game of my life and still lose because I cant carry 2 other ppl and 3v1 and win. I shouldnt have to go 20+ games per day before a single win due to matchmaking screwing me. That is what is most frustrating to me. But I will keep plugging along and hopefully someday get good enough that I will have the ability to carry an entire team and the devs will stop blacklisting my name and totally screwing me over in choosing teammates.

ALSO blatant ignorance of allowing players to actually ban others themselves or having a basic place to send videos and get players that deserve a ban to be banned. Overall if you want competitive 1/10. If you want to troll 10/10 since they never ban or do anything to stop trolls.Once they actually stop the ignorance of ignoring the playerbase and blatant trolls the game would possibly go up to a 6/10. The ranking system is a WHOLE other issue at the moment but getting a proper ban/report system up would be better first.Adding to my review now that they want to ""ban"" due to ""verbal"" abuse. Only way to get them to notice you and ONLY you is to report any issues. They want to silence anyone who would ""abuse"" their game. So a little more info about how they seem to ""ban"" players. They don't do any type of review of the games or the means of people's report they ban due to multiple reports and only in excess.

You're constantly unable to join games lobbies are screwed more than every other game and with every single patch there's new bugs to be introduced.

2016-06-05,0,0,475,False,Recommended,Rocket league is one of the best games that I have ever played.... The game consists of a level system which awards players experience points based on how much they play and their performance in their games. The game currently consists of 8 level titles for levels 0 100 (according to my knowledge) The titles are as follows...Rookie Most rookies are begginer players who havent developed the skills required to play the game with a balance of skill and fun. Rookies tend to miss the ball a lot but forgive them. We all started there. Semi Pro People are starting to understand the game and have probably realised there is a tutorial . This means that people can now get a sense of positioning and manage to hit the occasional bicycle hit. However these players are still frowned upon by other higher level and skilled players. Pro Pros do not seem to live up to their title. However they learn to shoot from the ground but their shots tend to lack accuracy. You might see this player hitting a nice shot but most of it comes down to good positioning and luck.(I have yet to discover the world of Rocket League and my opinions of the game will change as I spend more time on this game thus the unfinished review.

I understand this being a thing and it's sort of nice and all but the fact that there's no way to turn this feature off and the frequency with which I get put into games that are more than half over where my team is down 0 5 is unacceptable. As much as I enjoy getting to play a fun round of this that seems to happen less and less often cannot say I would recommend this game to anyone the rare instances of enjoyment do not justify the frequent dissapointment,Rocket League®

This even beats the Rainbow Six Siege in that matter so you know that's worst of the worst.If you are casual player don't come near that and better play lucio ball in Overwatch at least you will be less annoyed. Also not a single skin for weebs in the game and its out there on Steam for 3 years adding only cosmetics disgrace. If not for friends I wouldn't even bother wasting my time on this.That just confirms that if you hate sport games Rocket League is not gonna change that it's even opposite.

Its always getting updated with new things and ways to make the game better so thats a bonusCONS Personally I think that matchmaking is sh*t. it either takes forever or you get paired with someone whos not even close to your level (Master with pro) Crates just coz i hate crates They changed the season thing so that you have to play more games to get more rewards to get things which I dont see why they did that? Like its 150 'stars' to get a decryptor when it used to be only 100. I dunno why they changed that. just makes you play more games. It has like a half/half comunity as in half of it is toxic af and will hate you and the other dont care about anything and Just enjoy the game I hate console players they take forever to join the game. most the time they have a ping and i just dont like them so i dunno thats a thingI realise at the end of writing this that this is more of a rant review that an actual review but whatevs XD I still very much recommend this game Youll get hours of fun out of it!,Rocket League®

2018-01-14,0,0,155,False,Not Recommended,I only have 20 hours but I still need to say what I think. Btw I will be mentioning CSGO alot but alot of this game reminds me of it.Its a good idea but the community is utter crap its got all the scum from CSGO playing it I know because I used to play it when I was a salt shaker read my review of that aswell if you want.The competitive play is pointless matches you with either people too good or too bad and you get a rank change litterally almost every single win/loss causing no consistency in the game and if your having a bad day it will ruin the next week of the game trying to get a decent rank again. Finally I think steam has given us a game with a ranking system that could rival CSGOs.Again typical money making scheme with loot boxes which is such an original idea I dont know where they thought of it and bad connections to the server. This might just be me but the ball is way too slow causing a deathmatch under it every time it goes up and it to go flying over the top of you when you try to dribble it more than two metres.So if your going to get it wait till a big sale or it will just annoy you more than its worth in money.,Rocket League®

This game is very very unfun for beginners like me people ramming you constantly and you can't hit the ball but that's all fine because I was playing with my friends. But then the update came as a person who constantly getting less than 50 points per match suddenly gets no exp from it??? Is that you way of saying you tried your heart out but didn't get enough points so we still catagorize you as throwing. Wow game you sure knows how to make a person feel great for playing this game. Why do I want to play this game if you are constantly telling me that I am piece of ****?? If you are having fun with the game good for you keep playing it because I think there's nothing wrong with the gameplay.

You also join games that are already in progress but you're way behind when you join. Sometimes (9 out of 10) you join a game where you're actually ahead. In special events you don't gain points from losing games so there's no incentive to keep playing because it becomes a waste of time.

It's not fun and you don't get better just by playing rather you have to be able to master esoteric and awkward controls and try to mitigate the inconsisent physics that can have the ball roll down the wall one time but take some unexpected bounce the next. I can't emphasize enough just how unintuitive the controls are and how absolutely awful the camera modes are (especially when the ball goes above the car or up the wall).I don't know if there's a better way to program rocket cars but trying to aerial dribble win 50/50s hit the balls accurately etc. all seem insurmountable no matter how much I go into training (custom or otherwise).I'll probably uninstall this game again because it's so unenjoyable.,Rocket League®

While the core concept and the way in which it is implemented can be fun it is nigh on impossible to play this game for much longer than 2 hours without wanting to put your fist through your computer screen.

Also great community short queues (2sec) no impact from microtransactions being entirely cosmetics and many maps.In a nutshell this game is about football hockey and basketball with cars/ spaceships in 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4.10/10 would recommend get it on sale doe as 20$ for a time killer game might not be entirely worth it.,Rocket League®

2018-07-09,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,"There's not much to say about Rocket League. I deliberately ignored it for several years on the basis that I don't like sports games. It's a game where very small teams of rocket cars play soccer. Maybe if there were like 30 cars instead of 6 it might be more fun with randoms. It's got cool car designs lovely bright colors and goofy accessories. It LOOKs like a game that is about fun and it can be...Provided you don't play against people.It's one of those games that's very amusing with friends in private matches where you can play against bots and fiddle with the mutators but an absolute how in quote ""casual"" or ""competitive"" playlists. I've yet to see a game where matchmaking actually works and this sure isn't one of them. The skill curve is one of the steepest I've seen in a game and the progression completely skewed after only a few hours of play I've become matched with players that can literally drive circles around me and perform effortless aerial shots while I'm still trying to figure out how to make car hit ball in the air. After several matches of 0 A ing lot point the other guys with spams of Wow! Wow! Wow! as if I was playing goddamn For Honor I'd be regretting the half off sale price were it not for the afforementioned private matches. I think I've actually been less frustrated playing Mobas or blink and your dead FPSes.Some of the music isn't great either.If you have friends to play with locally or in private matches by all means give Rocket League a try.

2017-07-06,0,0,812,False,Not Recommended,"I really do like alot that there is so much to learn and you can constantly improve your skill the gameplay is great but everything ""around"" the actual gameplay is really annoying. Toxic community (nothing new like in every online game) but here they also get the chance to spam stuff without even typing. Wow Whew OMG Savage I really like the possibility to say your teammates great pass or nice shot even the enemy sometimes but things like wow really just have no meaning. the only option is to mute the people who spam. for me a filter that just shows the really relevant stuff like great pass or nice shot would be nice. Finding games Mostly when playing alone in the evening it is hard to find a fresh game. Most of the time you join a game that is already lost. 2 minutes to play the enemy has 4 goals great. So you leave the game just to see that the game puts you in the same lobby. Sometimes 3 times in a row. Is it so hard to make a system that prevents stuff like this? and the worst thing the matchmaking.in my opinion and experience it is really horrible. Currently I have 700 hours of experience i still suck at wall jumps and not to mention freestyle. When i'm playing with a friend we have a combined time of 1400h experience. So it happens very often that we play a game and get completely destroyed by more advanced players that have 1400h alone. I know that playing against better enemys makes you improve but that is just a complete slaughter sometimes. it is frustrating and you have no chance to intercept the enemy.There must be some hidden mmr and either ours is really high for some reason or the matchmaking considers our mmr and a much more advanced players mmr as ""okay for a matching"". But still when we lose our rating should drop and the opponents should be easier but well it still sucks.I wanted to write this review because I like the game but everything mentioned above just ruins the fun.Oh and the map like &amp dislike function is a joke even if you dislike wasteland or the other strange map you will join those games anyway. even if it is your first game without any lobby were ppl could have favored the map.",Rocket League®

2017-05-21,0,0,362,False,Recommended,Rocket League is quite simply one of the most amazing and addicting games I ve ever played. It s easy to pick up and play but very difficult to master. The concept is absolutely brilliant. It's even a great game for those that don t like sports games the description sports game is a very loose term to throw around when referring to this game as it s just not what you d expect. The controls are intuitive and very comfortable however I do recommend that you use a PS4 or XB1 controller or something equivalent or the game just won't be very enjoyable. You'll put hundreds of hours into this game though and for $19.99 (or less depending on sales) that's a steal. Another great aspect of Rocket League is the constant flow of new content and game modes. Psyonix has proven great models exist for implementing DLC into a game. They release fairly priced DLC simultaneously with new free additions to the base game. Ultimately the paid DLC isn't necessary to success in the game however completionists may want to get all of the DLC in order to have all of the game s car models. With all of that being said Rocket League is a fantastic gem of a game that's loads of fun alone and even more fun with friends. The constant flow of content by Psyonix keeps the game feeling fresh. Honestly this game gets a 9.5/10 from me. It doesn't get a full 10/10 score because sometimes the servers can be wonky but in what online game is that not the case? You won't regret purchasing Rocket League.,Rocket League®

2018-04-10,0,0,1393,False,Not Recommended,Psyonix I'm dissapointed in you.I joined since season 2. You gave me a great game I gave you all the support that I could within my power. You needed players I made a little RL community where I live. You needed views and you became the one and only Twitch channel I ever watch. You needed money to start RLCS and asked me to support you with gambling methods like lootcrates and I didn't even think it before fully supporting you and the developers that work on this piece of art.However you forgot me. It started a year ago. I joined a match I get 120 ping. It was frustrating for me but I was understanding. It was only a couple of matches maybe 1 out of 10 matches. I was appreciating the work you did. The work the entire team did. So I didn't say a word. Months passed and it got a bit worse but I still loved you.But now I realize you don't love me anymore. No matter how much I try no mater how much support I give you you look at me with cold eyes. 6 out of 10 matches I join I get 150 ping. But you have other players now. You have players who will have maybe 50 ping in their worst day while 50 ping is the best ping I've ever had. So now that is easy for you to turn the blind eye on me you look away. You broke my heart.If that's how you want it to be so be it. I had great memories with you. I enjoyed the game. I enjoyed the RLCS. I enjoyed supporting you so you could grow. I'll keep those memories. But you don't care for me anymore as you have already other players that are easy for you to be with so I leave.FarewellTL DR If you're outside the US and you're closest to EU East server so you pick that one you'll get 150 ping aprox on most matches. Even if your speed is +100 Mbps. It's unplayable for ranked lists.,Rocket League®
2015-07-14,0,0,202,False,Recommended,Love this game. The ranked system could use alot of love thou. Now why do I love this game but I cannot recommend it to put it simply it is because the game will probably have a very shot lifecycle and there isnt alot to do outside of multiplayer. Unless the devs insitute and ranking system or better leaderboards my $20 bucks will shrivel up and die (starcraft 2 dota league of legends all of these games have a very repitive multiplayer and not much else to do similiar to Rocket League the reason people keep coming back is to advance in rank). In its current state I dont see the game being very popular for more then a couple months. After that it will be one of thoes games that is fun with friends. I also feel that $19.99 is to much for the game. I would recommend for $10.00 even $15.00 the gameplay is fun but I think it is overpriced. I pray the devs add more to the ranking system. Being able to create a team/guild/whatever you want to call it and bring it online into the ranking system is exactly what this game needs. Solid game just not to much to it for $20,Rocket League®

They recently implemented the ability to vote against maps you do not like and do not want to play on... especially in competitive. Even though i have the maps disliked and do not want to play on them i continually get stuck playing on them. The new maps that change the way you play in the normal style arena are terrible. Yet for some reason they keep making these trash maps and forcing them on me. Make me wait longer in queue STOP PUTTING ME ON THESE MAPS!

Game can be loads of fun when you have good teammates and are playing on maps you want to be playing on.,Rocket League®
2016-04-24,1,9,3,False,Not Recommended,While the game is incredibly fun.

You hog the ball in the corner of the field. Sometimes it goes to the middle. You try to take a shot. And your team mate c*ck blocks you by ramming into you. So again. If your oke with most matches being allot a like and some others more fun and different. Than definitely buy it. Especially now that it's 40% off. However if you don't. I wouldn't even recommend buying it even if it's 50% off. There are a ton of other games out there with much more varied gameplay then what your paying for.,Rocket League®

I Love it when i try to hit the ball adn then someone joins and causes me to lag and i miss. I savor every moment of that lag. I also greatly enjoy when i join a game with my friend in a friendly game of 3's. and we are split up on the teams and one team somehow has 4 players. This is my favorite feature in the game. I am so glad these hard working american developers who are definetly not chinese in ANYWAY possible added this feature and so many more like when your profile pictures are for some reason jumbled up and you dont end up with yours. If in the event you do not have a human person on your team you are paired with an elite cold blooded insane madman from detroit who knows this game in and out. he will NEVER miss the ball. he simply only wants blood. and goals. The maps are scenic and beautiful. You can see how the real world inspired it and where they got their inspiration from. My favorite map is the japanese one because I LOVEE AMINE! i learned japanese from this map alone. I think its really really cool. thank you.this game is definetly not broken and misfigured.

Ah yes Nosgoth a shadowed game in the Legacy of Kain series. A 4v4 asymmetrical game that had replayablility gore and excitement! Alas these asshats at Psyonix phoned it in during development (I believe around 3 4 years of Alpha state that you could buy in early with multiple Founder packs 10 100+$ which upon shutting down in Beta (lasted a few months in 'open beta' they ran off with ALL THE FOUNDERS MONEY AND MICROTRANSACTIONS 'keys for chests'!). I do hope all those who got that game shutdown grows a very aggressive form of cancer in the middle of the night and wake up to a locked jaw and petrified tongue. I do not and shall never again support Psyonix. I hope this word gets back to them. You ruined a great game to put all effort into a garbage one.,Rocket League®

2016-03-11,0,0,72,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is amazing and has the potential to be incredibly fun when played the right way. Unfortunately the game becomes almost completely unplayable when your randomly matched teammates don't hold up their end of the bargain.Playing with friends is great! Unfortunately for about 4 out of every 5 games I'm matched into (in unranked and ranked mind you which you would THINK would make a difference) at least one (and often both) of my teammates are either so inept that they hurt the team more than they help they are selfish to the point that it isn't fun to play with them they are spewing hateful (and super racist) chat messages because I'm trying to convince them to strategize instead of ballchasing or (often) some combination of the three. Many times my teammates will be sitting completely idle in matches for MINUTES at a time. Yet I get penalized for leaving terrible matches.Reporting people doesn't do anything. Matchmaking needs some serious work or at least there needs to be some way to get into games with people with similar skills and mindsets.Overall one fun game in a blue moon isn't enough to outweigh the frustration this game causes.,Rocket League®

Its a cool idea it really is. The execution is where I have quite a few problems. I could have easily written a positive review for this game but I didn't choose to do so.POSITIVES Decent graphics Lots of cosmetics Not any noticable bugsNEGATIVES Gets old very fast with few gametypes Cross Platform so instantly PC players are better due to inferior console controls Ranking system that relies more on levels than ranks Expensive Price (20$ which is pretty ambiguous coming from a indie company and a steam game...) SAME FREAKING SONG EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE GAME (jk I still love you...)OVERALL This game tries to be competetive which is where it fails most. I'd say at the least its a fun casual game but personally I don't think I could ever get into this game like I do with games like CS GO or Overwatch. Decent title but far too overpriced as mentioned before. All in all buy it on sale and have a fun night with your friends but don't expect to dedicate all of your time to it since it gets bland fast.,Rocket League®

2016-09-10,0,0,183,False,Not Recommended,Great game! Lots of fun as you can tell by my hours. But something that has made me disapointed at such a great game that is the keys and crates system added in the new rumble DLC. There are some other things about the new DLC aswell these things are 1) The rumble gameplay is all over the place and overhyped. 2) The preset thing is pretty bad and needs to be fixed. 3) Decals need to be less exclusive from trading in items and from crates. Following on part 3 I always get the coolest decals from trading in my items but never for the cars i use like the backfire or the Tekkius (however you spell it) Anyways please don't ruin another great game with crappy micro transactions. I recommend if you want to get cool stuff for your cars and you have boat loads of money don't if you're like me and think that these should be added as an unlockable and not some micro transation bs. I get that you need money but dpn't you think you could just raise the price or something?

2016-10-13,0,0,767,False,Not Recommended,"For all but the best players in the game the standard game mode is plain randomness as the ball is so bouncy and uncontrollable that any form of coordinated gameplay is impossible.Don't get me wrong Naturally there are better and worse players in this game but the difference is that the worse ones make 1 good play out of 10 situations whereas the better players manage to make 4 out of 10. That still leaves most matches as horrible comedies of errors and misplays. Even worse as the ball usually bounces way up into the air managing boosts becomes the main focus to the detriment of most other tactical considerations.Did I mention that the community is absolutely horrible? Usually once a team is one or two goals down then one player will simply leave the game which is easy to do because there is absolutely no penalty for leavers in normal queue in this game. This has the nasty side effect that these leavers ""enrich"" the queue with games you get put into where ""your"" team is down a couple of goals which is demotivating AS HELL (there is a leaver punishement in ranked matches though). Last but not least the devs couldn't resist the temptation to cash in on their successful game by introducing exclusive content obtainable through a real money random loot system which is the usual EA style red flag and big warning sign that players get suckered into spending a lot of money for unwanted items in order to maybe get the things they actually want.The bottom line is The game is frantic good fun at first until you realize that winning and losing depend on the sole abilities to control boosts and perform ""aerials"". Consequently it's a resource managing competitive flying simulator with horrible incentives to spend real money after purchase. If that's your game....then go ahead!EDIT Recent changes to the car handling made the game even more of a slow moving clusterfrimp sucking much of the remaining game dynamic out of the game. The only game mode which allowed for some fast tactical gameplay Snow Day was virtually annihilated by changes to ballspeed and vehicle inertia. Teams now have to rely even more on the ability to perform aerials further removing it from a tactical team based game to an ego trip flight simulator.",Rocket League®

2016-09-15,5,26,917,False,Not Recommended,I'm sorry I'm not making any exceptions to my rule. Micro transactions are a true cancer to gaming society and until Psyonix learns to respect their fans and stop nickel and diming them I'm no longer recommending this game. Its got good game design its got good graphics its music sucks but that's just me probably and its simple but in depth. There's nothing wrong with the game in terms of gameplay or anything but just the inclusion of having to earn crates and buying keys in order to open them is greedy and disrespectful to paying customers and I don't want anyone to support this game until they remove it but I doubt they will since they get special treatment which is t. If Ubisoft and Payday 2 can't do it I don't see how that doesn't apply here. I no longer trust Psyonix and unfortunately they will only continue to spread the cancer. Nothing is sacred anymore and I guess a world of micro transactions is upon us since no one cares sad really.,Rocket League®

2015-08-19,9,31,70,False,Not Recommended,In the current state of the game I cannot recommend it and I cannot recommend it for several reasons.#1 Awful matchmaking If you are a solo player or ever want to play solo do not play this game. There is nothing in ranked that protects you from being matched against a premade. It is the same problem that World of Warcraft has with battlegrounds. Of course if you want to stomp a team 50% of a time if you have a team then maybe it would be for you. But the current state of matchmaking is unbalanced and inefficient.#2 No real penalty for quitters. The quitters are everywhere and often. Most of the time one of the teams will become inbalanced either at the first goal or from someone not making the initial connection. #3 Server lag. The servers are incredibly laggy at the moment. In many matches it's so bad that everything seems to teleport along. The servers are utter garbae in thi sgame.#4 No customization. Want to build your car to be a certain way? Perhaps have better handling at the cost of acceleration? None of that in this game. All cars have equal performance with tweaks being entirely cosmetic.#5 The biggest gripe is the community. This game has a horrible community that makes League of Legends look like a therapy session by comparison. CONCLUSION This game has the components to be a good game but it's not there yet. There's a lot to be desired with this title and it needs to grow up to be worth what they're asking for it. Not recommended at this point.,Rocket League®
2016-04-22,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,Unless you have a dedicated group to play with it's absolutely pointless to buy this game. The randoms are absolutely worthless but think they're gods of Rocket League but that could just be from the free weekend. Your own team will you over more than the enemy team. 1v1 mode is equally worthless because the slightest little thing can fling the ball across the map and into your goal without any chance to recover. The ball physics seemed to act up more in 1v1 but maybe it was lag or something. The matchmaking was also a pain in the It would constantly throw me into matches on a team that was losing 3+ to 0 and with like 10 seconds left. Plus in the 3v3 and 4v4 matches I was finding that there was almost always a person just flying around and ramming people to death which would cause a chain reaction and then it just became ramming simulator 2016.Besides the horrible randoms and bad matchmaking there's not a whole lot of terrible stuff. The physics can be really dumb sometimes but great at others. I was completely unable to get used to the camera. The ball camera negatively affects your manuevers but the other mode makes it hard to follow the ball. I tried switching between the two but to try to do that while trying to actually play the game was hopeless.,Rocket League®

2016-12-31,1,5,1651,False,Not Recommended,"This game is getting a thumbs down until they fix the broken map system.

You get nothing but the new maps (which are cool the first time don't get me wrong) but then you get them every other game and it's just too much going on and you cannot see the ball or anything going on. It's literally ruined the game for me and the ""Thumbs Down"" system literally has zero effect. A group of 2 people who thumbs down the same map should have a 100% not to get that map yet my buddy and I get the three maps 50% of the time. GG Psyonix it was fun but you're ruining the game. EDIT Just wanted to throw it out there that I was still giving Psyonix a chance to fix their game but they literally just keep breaking it further. The servers are and rubberband even with a 30 ping and now the queue system takes 15 minutes if you don't have cross platform enabled which in my opinion is what's causing the rubberbanding.

As for the reason I'm not recommending it? The devs.The most recent update for Season 6 topped off the watering down of Rocket League by the devs. To give you an idea here is all the BS we've had or have to deal with We got reskins of the Retro Labs maps that looked nice but were god awful for competitive play and no way to not play on them or make them appear less frequently. The servers couldn't even handle Starbase Arc's Octagon variant and the ball would commonly rubberband. The personal voting system they put in didn't do anything either. It wasn't until this season that they FINALLY made all the maps in ranked have the default layout. We got Aquadome which violated a lot of players' computers so it was common to basically be a player or players down. They fixed this after 2 3 updates but it made the game unplayable for awhile. We got crates and cosmetics which created yet another cancerous economy and group of useless players that join games (casual and ranked) to ask people to trade instead of playing the game. Were they oblivious to the all the years of watching TF2 CSGO and other games go down the drain because of that or was it because they wanted more money at the expense of the quality of the player base? Everyone and their mother knows the answer to that. They also did something about external transactions taking place. Not sure what that's all about since I'm not a trader but I'm guessing it's so that they stay in the profit loop. The ranking system is really bad. It used to be worse before and it's still bad. The idea of doing ranked matches to estimate where you're going to be placed is okay IMO but RL's system takes 0 consideration of what rank you were in the previous seasons. You can have bronze and silver players running into GC players and losing against them or getting carried by them to ranks they shouldn't be in because the system starts everyone from the same place. From there whichever players are unlucky enough to get boosted players get screwed etc.Then we have the reporting system. A system that has been useless for 5 seasons and when it's finally put to use it's the worst part of the game. You have 3 reasons to choose from when reporting a player Verbal / Text Harrassment Unsportsmanlike conduct and Cheating. The latter 2 are supposed to target ""intentional disruption of the game AFK'ers etc."" and ""smurfing opponent collusion etc."" respectively. This would be helpful if it wasn't a BS numbers game. You have other players calling you a N***ER and a FA**OT or throwing or both? It's okay as long as more players report you for the same reason you're going to be the one banned not them.You can get banned for practically anything now and apparently on the 4th consecutive ban it'll be permanent. You know what that means? You have to play and behave like a bot and if you don't you get banned. Players that want to play again will have to rebuy RL (and the DLC) on another account which means more money for Psyonix.Rocket League as a standalone game 10/10.Rocket League with Psyonix devs 1/10.",Rocket League®

But it isn't worth the constant frustration it gives you when all you want is to get to play a complete game and not non stop games which are already half over and your team isalready way behind when you enter.I have played multiple other games with Matchmaker (MM) systems.

2015-10-01,1,14,1,False,Not Recommended,It's fun but hard to have fun and highly annoying to play because the team balancing system is crap. Almost every game so far as a rookie it's been me and two other rookies against veterans and pro players and it's nearly impossible to win a game because you're putting a bunch of people that are brand new and don't really know how to play against people who'm have been playing for quite awhile and know exactly how to play. It ruins the fun if the team balancing was better it would be a lot easier to have fun.Not only this but if you're playing alone and you join the match making queue you get put into a game with two minutes left and the score is 0 5. 95% of the time the match making screws you over.,Rocket League®

Mine doesn't work so I made a negative review explaining why this is a major flaw in the game.So as fun as this game is it has a lot of issues with online play. Now if you're a more casual player in this game and feel playing with bots is more your cup of tea please click away from this review. Now as many of you are aware this game is a fun game hell I can't believe I'm making a negative review for this game just because of what I have to do to run it. (Basically My steam needs to be in Offline mode. reasons being will be explained later within this review.) Anyways I love this game actually but there is one MAJOR flaw that is forcing me to negitively review the game. That is that the online mode is really reliant on Internet explorer... Now before you click away calling me a c**t for this being the only reason that I have made a negative review for this give me some time to explain to you how bad this is hell I'll give you a visualisation for it. Now I have relatively 18 hours on this game more than 90% of that time is from troubleshooting it and waiting 20 minutes MINIMUM just for it to launch in Online mode and even THEN I can't play online with EVERYTHING that is possible to do to get Online play working for this game. I even port forwarded my router to attempt to run the game in online mode and it still doesn't work It even DELAYS the game launch time from what would normally be expected to be from 5 seconds to a minute. I will admit My internet explorer does not work however Other game developers have made it possible to play online games such as GTA V for example without the need to use internet explorer. So what is my point in this review you may ask? Well the point is that the game is fun as hell however I have suffered migrains to attempt to play online multiple times and shorten the time for it to launch in online mode. All of which HAVE failed. I understand that internet explorer is not just a web browser but also a tool to configure your internet settings even if it is not your default web browser. But still I am ing livid that I cannot play online because of the fact that my internet explorer is not working and that is a major issue to me because of how I cannot play the game and enjoy it as intended by the developers because of that.,Rocket League®

Is it football? is it racing? is it doing tricks?... you know what... let's put it all in one crappy game...lol. But in all serieusness Graphics are good nice music (house/dance) quite a few gaming modes (9 for what i've seen) a lot of options to customize you cars (ofcourse you have to unlock most options) and for what i have seen/read there is a nice active and big community online.I like football games racing games games you can do tricks like on scateboards or whatever but this is totaly different then anything like any of those games. Not saying that is a bad thing just not my cup of tea... so i am not recommending it.,Rocket League®

2018-07-02,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,*UPDATE 20+ hours of beating the salt*I still suck at it but I have embraced it. Solo ranked matchmaking is rarely fair in team match ups. Usually go against 3 Gold 1 2's versus me(Gold 1) and 2 Silver 2 3's...guess who ends up with the leaver/tilter side? This guy... Playing with friends is about the only way to actually enjoy this. *UPDATE +3 hours of gameplay with friends*Requested Steam to remove from my library. I don't even want my money back at this point...I just wish I had my time back. Completely wasted. How is this popular??????My first thought For $10 on sale sure let's try it. Repetition should help me improve. (LuL)*7 hours later*My second thought This game is made for ages 10 15 who also enjoy a broken defending mechanism. Let's not forget to mention the constant spamming of toxic chat from a kid with wet spaghetti arms and the voice of summit1g. There's no side rolls worth utilizing flying is a complete RNG joke for ball hit placement car explosions exist just to abuse constantly. Overall this was just poor coming from some one who put countless hours into the CS 1.6 mod of this. That mod was free and way more balanced than this pile of dog We won't mention that the mod was made over 10 years ago as well developers...smh. That alone should've been my warning sign to not purchase this. My third thought Uninstall this POS and write a review about how I feel. This is a soccer game made for the special kids who can't figure out how the real sport works. It should include a complimentary helmet that you have to wear in order to play this after you purchase. Or hell maybe some velcro shoes because you lose IQ by the second in this game. Save your money and mental health I wish I could have...,Rocket League®

It is not enjoyable and because of this atrocious behavior of the match making to constantly put me up against much better players this game is not enjoyable to me.

2017-05-02,0,0,823,False,Not Recommended,This game is very VERY frustrating especially because the stupid developers decided changing ranks and deranking people was such a great idea. I was a Challenger on Avg. and I was fairly matched. I am NOW a bronze and all I see are people in my rank league hitting freestyles and finessing me like they should be way higher in the ranks. If you didn't reset everyone's progress and if they kept their ranks then I'd be fairly matched with people in my skill level. These people should have been a better rank instead of Bronze. This is for all the people who are in bronze who can not get out of it because they're stuck with Grand Champions in Bronze League. Now that everyone has to restart their ranks makes no sense. I could come across a Grand champion in Bronze and they would beat me. Deranking players and changing up the ranks was probably the stupidest decision Psyonix ever made.

Matchmakins is a bulshit you play as a rookie with 3 hours vs platinum untill you lose all youre points new players are always rekted cause they get vs veterans 3. This game was free for gold members on plystation.4. Cars dont jump high enouph and controls are up by default you nedd to spend 1 h just to make them as you belive they are.5.

You will win about 3 4 games and go up 1 division then lose 3 games and lose a division each time deranking you. Never mind the fact that the game places you against wayyyy higher ranks every game. (I am pro and i haven't seen another pro in atleast 20 games. no exageration. I will ALWAYS be placed against masters and veterans) There is no more fun considering im losing most games about 5+ to 0 because I will have terrible players or console kids that dont know what they are doing. The physics are severely broken to the point you will jump up high and forward smack the white out of the ball and it will literally go backwards to your own goal. Never mind the fact that every game will have the guy that gets 3 lucky goals from their goal with the random touch that goes 500 trillion miles/hour.

2016-05-01,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,Started off liking this fun and an interesting way of football however after a few days it all gets too repetetive kick offs are just ridiculous and half the goals will come from freak accidental hits on the ball and this is where the game fails for me don't believe those who say this is a game of pure skill there is some skill involved but the game is too much of a random will it won't it go in for my liking. Your car will end up flying around without you being able to control it and the ball will be rolling towards your goal for an easy tap in. had the game a week and i'm totally ored with it only cost me 11 euros so can't grumble overall fun to start with but the repetition and freak goals will just frustrate you as you try to learn how to play. Before i get flamd I am not an uber gamer and not just salty because I am not that good at this but all players of this will agree that this is a game is fun but the fun wears thin as you lose to goals from the kick off when you both hit the ball at the same time but somehow the ball goes towards your goal with you either upside down or skidding without any chnce to get back and defend the inevitable tap in this happens time after time in solo play and is just ridiculous why doesn't the ball get dropped at kick off? It would at least make it a bit more skillful to boost to the ball rather than just crash into the ball at the centre and so many stupid tap in goals happen? out of 5 I'd give this a 2 fun to start with but soon becomes very dull.,Rocket League®

2016-08-24,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Right. Let me summarize Rocket League.You know those weird 'Soccer Celebration' thingos that games like World of Tanks I think War Thunder... or Overwatch's LucioBall( ). Yeah Rocket League is that.Except... you have to PAY MONEY for it.The matchmaking is awful I keep getting lumped in with idiots or laggers who for some reason have over 300 ping when everyone else is below 50 I keep getting thrown in with people who are just BETTER PLAYERS than me and judging from how frikkin fast the matchmaker is it's not very accurate. Not accurate whatsoever. I would rather sit around waiting for a good matchmaker to make me a match instead of just being thrown into a game fast as possible.The gameplay is pretty much WYSIWYG you drive around sometimes fly around and hit balls until they cross the invisible line that causes them to EXPLODE. Sometimes cars explode I really have no idea why. Personally I preferred the slightly more methodical nature of World of Tank's 3v3 soccer. More tactical. Yeah sure upper tier players are crazy gods who can judge distances and angles and stuff great good for them. But largely this game will just devolve into driving into the ball and sometimes using the jump/double jump to knock it somewhere.If you are gonna play this solo prepare for misery!If you have friends hey you might have fun.inb4 'boohoo why you don't like muh favrite game',Rocket League®

2018-06-23,2,1,2,False,Not Recommended,This game is kind of fun for the first 15 minutes but once that short amount of time is over the game is boring and bland. There is only one feature and that is to play soccer with the most slippery controls in any video game. The first problem is the controls. Going left and right is way harder than it should be which make trying to hit the ball a nightmare. You always go way too far to one side when trying to go left or right. The game's biggest problem is the lack of content. Buying the game without any of the dlc will give you a game with only one thing to do which is playing soccer with awful controls. Sure there are different types of matches but the objective is the same and the controls are still bad. Don't pay money for this game becaues it's a waste. If you want to play this game go to a friend's house (if any of your friends hate money enough to spend it on this piece of trash ) play it for 15 minutes and then see how little content it has. Finally the nail in the coffin for rocket leauge is that it has loot boxes and microtransactions. Need I say more.,Rocket League®

All players are equal distances to the ball and each start at the exact same time they each have the exact same acceleration and reach the ball at the exact same time. This is what happens literally every match so what decides who gets the ball first? The laws of physics dictate the ball should just stay in place but this game does not seem to operate on that.,Rocket League®

2016-12-23,0,0,264,False,Recommended,Short and simple Rocket League is amazing. It's so amazing it has taken the #1 spot for my personal favorite multiplayer game competing against other titles such as BF4 the Halo series ARMA 3 and even going back to the many hours I spent with Guitar Hero. I know that 3/4 of those games are shooters but that's the point! This game brought something new to the table such as when Guitar Hero was at it's prime and it works tremendously. I love games that gather everyone around the living room or ones that are equally as fun online with your friends.Rocket League has such a simple yet complex game mechanic that gives a desire to strive and perfect your skills. Who would have thought soccer with rocket cars would be so fun? The graphics are beautiful the gameplay is smooth and the customization is a hoot.Whether you're looking to play casually or competitively this is the game that is sure to fit anyone's play style.,Rocket League®

2016-01-28,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,"This is my personal opinion mixed with a bit of fact. The game is difficult for sure. I don't know if it's just me but control wise it can be hard to get a handle on. I don't mind this too much it just takes a long time to get used to. The thing that gets me about this game and the reason I don't play it is the community and people who play it. I'm not too good at the game just about every game I play that's all I hear. ""LOL LOOK AT THE SCORE YOU GUYS SUCK quot and the likes as if it's a bunch of CoD 12 year olds. That being said I simply don't play the game anymore. It's not because I ""can't take an insult"" but more so that I don't like playing with immature kids. Not to mention that the DLC cars have better hit boxes or some like that.To be quite honest this game is like poker. Based off of luck it seems. Especially with your connection. If you don't have tard low ping you're pretty much screwed so keep that in mind if you wish to purchase this game.Additionally the ranking system is terrible. Maybe this is what causes my troubles but from my first online match I was up against Veterans and not too long after Experts. Sure throw me into the fray to learn but I get fed up with constantly being rolled and don't have much of a chance to learn.Hope you like spam too.+ Cool gameplay mechanics+ Graphically appealing+ Fun with friends Ranking system terrible Absolute community and players You have to pay for good cars",Rocket League®

2015-11-02,0,0,661,False,Not Recommended,Why the negative review ? Some will say it's because i'm raging over this game. It's part true because this is the game the most frustrative game i've played this year and by frustrating i don't mean the positive sense.If i play on an unranked 1v1 game i win right off the bat. Then if i start a ranked 1v1 game it should be if not easy kind of challenging. But no i find me against with people who do aerials to goal and other stuff rather hard for my level. So yeah i'd say it's okay if you have the starting 50 points. But when you're found with 0 points with a dude who keeps doing aerial against you.I won't go over the ping issues as they are issued in the other review.I know this review will have many poeple not in agreement with me and won't be on the helpful tab. But remember that if you really want to have fun don't play on ranked alone if you're not ready and be sure to have a friend because this game feel hollow without friends.,Rocket League®

I really recommend it play it with a couple of friends and you'll have a blast.But...The game has been out for YEARS and the content has barely increased. They've added new game modes but the customization options are still lacking. It's pretty much a slap in the face when a game developer earns so much on a game title and make little effort in bringing more content to the customization part. There should be like thousands of new customization parts (including all) by now but they've added like 20 ish new stuff to car customization. Oh okay they added engine sounds wow. Like people actually pay attention to that.Consensus is that this game is a game where you get a lot of customization but if you compare it from start to now it has gotten nowhere in terms of customization.

2016-12-07,0,0,390,False,Recommended,This is a good game! I first started playing it with 3 friends in front of a TV. That was a blast. The driving controls are arcade y and fun and feel familiar. However actually trying to drive your car around a giant ball to hit in the direction you want is REALLY HARD especially at first. The combination of the controls feeling good and yet the gameplay being so unwieldy made for a great party game. We spent hours just messing around and failing terribly basically playing the worst game of soccar ever despite trying our best.Then you start getting better at the gameplay part actually able to hit the ball where you want it to go... and that's when the whole crazy high skill ceiling comes in to play.

2015-09-12,0,0,68,False,Not Recommended,"What can I say. The game has great graphics good core gameplay a sound concept and a good execution. It's a good game or so you think.It is the only game that makes me want to throw my PC out of a window and jump on it until there's nothing left.There are three ways to play the game with AI which only understands the ability to chase a ball and jump and hit it with local players on splitscreen which leads to graphic glitches and with humans on PC or PS4 online.The AI as I've said is thicker than the earth's mantle layer and will own goal at will. Because the matchmaking is horrific since the addition of the option to disable cross play finding someone to fill in the places on a doubles standard or chaos match will be impossible forcing you to team up with the AI. While I'm there the option to disable cross play has lead to the ghettoisation of the online servers. While originally there were plenty of servers will many people available to play once you get to a server with no PC team mate you're stuck there for good.Fun fact I once waited half an hour in the pre match waiting screen with no one else because the matchmaking is broken.That's before I get to humans!The player base is the most vitriolic toxic player base I've ever come across and I used to play games on the Xbox 360 system!You make a mistake such as timing your move wrong or you misjudge where the ball lands and you're branded as ""noob"" ""f***tard"" ""easy"" or something else. And if you're lucky enough to have a human team ""mate"" they'll brand you with just the same amount of silly vitriol perhaps more.The game servers are better than they used to be but are still horrific. You could be stable at 40 50 ping then suddenly because someone else on the same broadband internet connection opens up a web page you go to 800 ping and start rubber banding more than flubber. Not everyone has Fibre To The Property broadband and lives in the likes of London New York San Francisco Singapore Paris Berlin or wherever the fastest internet connections are.If I have fun it's for a handful of minutes then at that stage it's gone and I feel like I need to start hitting someone.This game was made for E Sports but I hate the concept of E Sports. There's no sportsmanship there's no fun it's serious twitch reactions something that video games seriously need to excise.",Rocket League®

Sonic &amp All Stars Racing Transformed features many playable characters multiple tracks and a variety of racing options Rocket League took 3 years to drain the heart of gaming out of segas masterpiece and the final product has NO characters NO tracks AND the only objective of all game modes is to displace a ball from one end of the court to the other.The vehicles in Rocket League offer no flight mode no water mode and objectively has no time off land in the entirety of the game.This game is a monument to how far the quality of games have regressed.Instead of Sonic &amp All Stars Racing Transformed we have rocket league instead of SpaceHack we have Arma and instead of Blockade 3D we have Dark Souls.Join me in boycotting Psyonix and stand up to the gaming companies that sell out seemingly just to spite their fans #PysonixRuinsLives,Rocket League®

Let a goal in have a group of 10 year olds spamming ""What a save!"" in chat. Miss a shot the same group screaming ""Nice Shot!"". The salt becomes even saltier when they refuse to skip replays. I still can't understand why the hell Psyonix hasn't included the ability to remove post goal replays from online matches. The micro transaction system is rubbish. I've bought around 50 keys so far and it's just decal after decal that no one gives a damn about. I've bought all the DLC something recommend if you really want the advantage on the field with turning radius and hitbox advantage. Standard cars in the game are useless. Also don't get scammed by traders.Do not ever play 3v3 in ranked games. You will rage. Your teammates will be useless and will blame you for losing. Even if you carry the team in a loss scoring all the goals and doing all the defending they will find a reason to blame you. Doubles and solo are recommended. Psyonix had potential to make this game great but even something as small as the animation in trying to control the car or flip it after you've fallen off a wall or gone into a wall just takes too long which opens a massive window for goal scoring. Tired of the cancerous community online? Go play with bots. Win 10 0 in an ""unfair"" game. The bots are useless even at their strongest.

2016-02-07,1,7,584,False,Not Recommended,This game is a very popular one among its kind. But there is only one reason behind its publicity. There is no other reason for this game to be this popular. For instance there is a game called Zero Gear which is a beautiful game with several modes of gameplay and many people do not know what it is. At this point we see the importance of introduction of a game and its publicity and promotions. First of all it has terrible angles. Either you are able to see the ball or where you go. You can not drive according to your purpose. What is more this is not a very difficult arrangement for a game. There are many different games in different types has more useful angles and driving experiences. Secondly this game has only one type of play which is football. There is no racing no chasing or capturing anything... After a while you get bored this game type and quit the game. It requires more game modes. As I mentioned before Zero Gear has many different modes including basketball racing hockey sumo etc. And it is much more amusing than this game. On the other hand it has many many customize options and they are unlocked after every game you played which is good. This make you play more and increases the pleasure. You may see very absurd cars while playing and you are able to create a very unique car for yourself. Yet the customizing options does not vary the abilities of cars. When you put thicker tyres you do not gather speed faster than any other players. Or when you changed your car with more musle looking one your car does not become stronger. There changes are for only appearance. If this upgrades are run in it would be more complicated and depends more on tactics more than ability to drive. Right now it is only a drive through game.Finally the price of this game is reasonable we can say. It is not too cheap but it is low enough to buy and play. Of course in sales it would be more cheaper but you may not want to wait until the sales time if you really wish to play. Again comparing with Zero Gear this game has much higher price Zero Gear is for only $1 or something so it is a shame that people are not playing it. For overall I think this game needs some repair and extra modes. So right now I do not recommend but if you are interested in this kind of game you probably buy and play.

Costumisations are limited just 4 or 5 pre set stickers per car. Every car has the same theme stickers with a different pattern. You can put a hat on that will only match with one of your colors or add an antenna that are mostly sponsors and just an eyesore on your vehicle.If you aren't looking for a game that feels the same every single time and you'd like some depth in the gameplay then skip this one.

Today it is based on playing with premates to be successful in this game. I started playing at season zero and now at season 2 I can not play without premates a few rounds to keep my rank (Rising Star). I am constantly loosing because of bad matchmaking and inactive/disrespectful mates who are thinking and behaving like the last piece of beginner... All in all it is not worth the 20 $ etc. and there is no real fun while playing ranked. Rocket League was a good game and now it is like all the other ''Community Based Games'' which are overcrowded with kids noobs and flamers...There are too much ranks and the divisions ( 1to 5) which are impossible to climb up because of the written reasons.

2015-07-30,1,9,12,False,Not Recommended,Well. I don't know I just can't get into it I guess. I bought this because of the eurogamer review and the first few hours of playing this were pretty fun. The game crashed once and only once I had server issues in 10+ hours of playing so the the online mode is alright.But for a competitive party game it's just too time consuming (which is probably a good thing for quite a few people). People say the game is easy to learn and hard to master but I disagree. I had to watch a 20 minute long camera angle tutorial to even get a chance at hitting a bouncing ball. The ingame tutorial and the sandbox mode are lackluster at best. The challenges are way too hard and boring to grind for beginners so you have to watch another tutorial on how to practice properly with the few options the game gives you.On the other hand you can just jump into online mode right away without knowing what you are doing and can have fun too and it worked for me for like 10 hours or something. On the highest level this game is super fun I guess but getting there is just not worth my time...,Rocket League®

2016-06-11,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game alone and with friends. You can't complain that I haven't tried it properly. I've tried to have fun with this game but I just find it boring. Doing advanced moves like air saves and air hits get repetitive after a few minutes. Otherwise I guess it's OK but it's just not for people who look for more than two qualities in a game. For example if you are a fan of grand strategy games then this will feel like it was made for idiots as it's simplicity becomes mind numbing after just a few minutes of hitting a ball around a stupid stadium. If you like the idea of having different unique cars that are different and provide a new experience then you are very wrong since they'e all EXACTLY the same as an easy google search will tell you. In short if you're not into games with interesting logistics and complexities then go buy it. If you want a game with interesting content then save your money for something that is simply better. This is my opinion so don't flame me idiots. (I'm quite tired),Rocket League®

2015-10-01,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,Would be fun but terrible hitboxes physics bugs nonsense startformation and advantages for lagging players make it impossible to play for casual fun because there are lots of people abusing those unwanted mechanics. Playing with more than 2 people also makes it so that you could basicly not move at all and have the same effect on the game.Yeah I am terrible at it but you should not need over 100h of expierience to enjoy a game like this.Usually a ranking system helps with finding players of your caliber but not here. You start with a random amount of points. ( I started with 500 Points my friends with 0 or 100.) And since you only loose about 5 points per game it would take around 50 100 games to get to the ranking with your type of players. Which is not doable for casual play and also makes it freakn frustrating.Even if you are on the winning side it feels extremly uncomfortable since the enemy gives up after maximal 2 goals and you just wait out the rest of those 5 minute games not shooting since it would only prolong this farce. Or they ragequit what also feels stupid. So you end up with those who have either more expierience or abuse the bugs and seem to move with boost all the time flying for the whole 5 minutes.I had fun when i started playing but as with most online games the community ruins it after a while. Playing with friends is a lot of fun though. Just take care and dont take it to seriously or improve to fast since it will become very one sided very quick. I do not recommend.,Rocket League®

Also this game is very unfriendly to new players as there are always smurfs in Casual &amp Competitive. You will also need to figure out the controls all by yourself.

2016-04-26,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,"I like to call this game ""Football with cars"" thats because its all it is (I don't give a about the basketball update).Here are some positives The car customizations are pretty sweet and the maps are great too. I like how the party system and the practice works in this game. The graphics are pretty neat and the game is also able to run pretty smooth on a low end computer like mine.Here is what ruined it for me The idea of football with cars sounds great on paper but in practice its unplayable (although I have to give them credit for the neat controls at least it isn't as hard as playing football with cars would be in real life) the in air controls could have used some work though (with that note pretty much the funnest thing to do in this game is ramming your opponents).So thats pretty much it I would tell you to play a different video game with football (or basketball gahd what ever) instead of this but then again in my opinion they are all and you should just play those sports in real life (if you can't then I am sorry but you will never truly enjoy it... EVER!). This game is pretty over hyped just like CS GO League of Legends Dota 2 Rust Ark and others that have not come out yet or I havent heard of.P.S. you should also remember that this is my peorsonal opinion of the game from my (1 hour) experience with the game if you enjoy it then good for you go play it",Rocket League®

2015-09-21,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,Good game that got ruined by the lack of good camera settings... rather than give free camera that could be controlled with the mouse one is presented with two options and both of them are quite bad. Considering that it seems to be otherwise good game that got ruined by the camera I'd have to say that it has the worst camera in gaming (in my experience).Camera aside the game is quite alright. The reason I would not recommend it is because I am not much for on line games anymore because I can't seem to get along with on line communities and I would recommend the game to some people but not people of similar tastes as me.The gameplay is good you control a car and playing either solo or in team you need to get the ball into oposing teams goal. The off line gameplay is alright but repetitive due to playing against bots that don't have much in their arsenal. I found the training to be most interesting aspect of off line side of this game.On line is one of the more disappointing things for me. For every one nice person you meet there are a hundred of obnoxious types so at the end of it I just disabled all of the communication within game. The matches take only 5 minutes so in case the game is not going the way you want to you get a redo in just a few moments. Ranking matches are as always a bit off. I have found that matchmaking is quite good but from what I could tell ranking is using some ELO based system to award or remove points and it is still not a good system for individual ranking in team games. ELO works on solo duels or as a rank of a whole team but not as individual ranking when playing in a team with other people.That being said I disliked more of the game than I liked. I would probably recommend this game to people who like grinding their own skill cap and don't mind the on line community (I guess they could get used to the camera as well). The short matches in the game make bad games that much more beareable.,Rocket League®

2015-12-27,1,4,136,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun but now it s more like WAS fun. The reason I'm writing a bad review is because I keep getting disconnected from every online match. The cause isnt from my side because I have no problems in any other game my internet speeds/connections are solid and other people are having the same issues as well. Hopefully the devs will fix this issue but until then I do not recommend people buying a game with crappy servers. It was fun when it actually worked but for the past week I have not been able to play this game.

2016-02-22,0,0,34,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun i wont lie about that but ranked match making is the worst match making I have ever came across.

2015-07-19,4,13,1,False,Not Recommended,This game has a simple premise and a simple goal! Score! Put the ball in the opponents net! IT Couldnt get any simpler! Its Football with cars! And for the first hour it was fun! The tutorial eased me into the game nicely yet I felt the game could still offer me a great challenge beyond learning the basics. The graphics the games stability (baring match making) were all admirable.My first Online match couldnt have gone better I sunk 2 in the net and the team went on to win 5 2. Great I thought thourougly enjoyed. However an hour later and honestly I was bored! The more matches I played the more I realised that this is just a physics based pot luck game. Every match was essentially 8 cars throwing themselves at this giant ball hoping to either get the ball into the opponents half or score! And thats IT! Theirs literally nothing else to the game! Yes you can customise your cars etc! But the cars arnt that detailed theirs no difference between them other than shape/looks. A van type car you would think would be purposed more towards defence vs the sportier sleeker cars etc but No! Each car is identical so what happens online is nothing short of 5 mins of manic chasing this giant ball. Getting bashed around left right and centre by not only the opposition but equally by your team mates. I keep seeing people saying the game has multiple layers of depth and you can tell the skilled vs the none skilled players etc. Guess what? My team of all noob Rookie labelled players just beat an entire team of Semi Pros 6 2. Did we play well! NOPE we just launched oursleves at the ball blindly and hoped for the best! The hitboxes on the cars are sketchy at best. On countless occassions I slowed down and methodically hit the ball from a certain angle i.e. left or right. Only to have the ball bounce straight up in the opposite direction!? I've scored from one end of the pitch to the other even though the ball was actually put in the net by the opposite team trying to clear it from the goal! Apparently this game has no concept of HOME goals!I've watched numerous Twitch games streamed and I'm sorry! I am yet to be convinced their is anything skilled about this game! Yes I have seen some fancy goals scored on YouTube etc and people stating thats the difference between a skilled and non skilled player etc. Equally! If probably not more so I have seen many incredible goals scored completely without intention or knowledge of the player who scored them i.e. blind luck (or dodgy physics engine!). This game to me was a 5min pick up and play game with friends on a Friday night nothing more! The hype and reviews on this game at the moment I just dont understand! Its football with cars without the complexities or intricacies of the beautiful game. Just be careful when you buy!Watch a few videos ignore the web reviews just watch! Then make your decision! This is by no means a bad game by any shout! In fact I'd probably give it a 7/10 its a quick and easy to get into pick up and play game! Just beware of the hype machine on this one.,Rocket League®

2016-06-16,0,0,276,False,Not Recommended,"Update 04/04/2017 2/10 Optimizations getting poorer game getting more broken. Matchmaking has been completely overhauled without balancing making it even worse. Servers promised to be fixed instead crashing repeatedly. Like Rito games Psyonix is in this for the e sport money and nothing else. 3/10 Poorly optimized game with broken collision models and lack of proper matchmaking.Pros + Fun with friends to around on. + Some entertaining moments where the game s up so horribly that the ball goes flying off an enemy car and into their own goal. + Simple graphics yet pretty.Cons Broken Matchmaking 2 Prospect Elites went against a Challenger 2 and an Unranked multiple times. Warped Car collision models. If you want an easy win play Merc which has a 1.5x hitbox on the top allowing it to hit the ball in ways that will never touch the van. Broken Ball mechanics. A car hitting the ball at low speeds will send the ball flying into the top of the arena whilst High speed the same car will see that the ball goes flying at high speed to the top of the arena in the opposite direction from where you hit. Buy once and then buy everything else. While this is technically only for ""Cosmetics"" when each car has their own hitbox detection it can break the game watching a ball not touch the car and still recieve the hit. DX9 x86 only. x64 players beware you will experience the odd crash as a game that is ""new"" was designed for an outdated system. They've also stated that they will not be inputting x64 versions or DX11 versions into their game. While this is a UE3 error and not theirs I feel their error was in using UE3 to begin with after UE4 had been on the market 2 years before their game was released.Probably some more bugs that I haven't remembered yet but in the end it's only a game worth playing if you're an e sport person. Like League of Legends this game is flawed with no attempts to fix it in sight. Unlike League of Legends you have to buy this game which makes it worse in some aspects.Also the Number 1 player in most of the challenge boards is called Psyonix Fix Your Game or something to the sort.

2016-10-08,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,"This is an entertaining and fun game for people who are naturally ""gifted"" at video games in the talent or skill accrual departments. I most certainly am not . The music in this game is nice the premise of the game is great and it's attractive and colorful but the problem with multiplayer games if you just aren't good or able to ""git gud"" as they say is that you're just screwed and going to exist as a stepping stone for the success of your opponents and a pebble in the shoe of your more skilled team mates annoying them that you're slowing them down.If you aren't talented or able to get good hastily this game will wound your pride while inspiring rage and envy in you by the bucketload as you watch other players perfectly rocket up off of the field to hit the ball into the goal from above while you try and fail HUNDREDS of times to do the same. It took me about 36 hours to pull that off once and I did it by accident when I succeeded not one I could repeat either mind you. Unless you're naturally good at games or just want to be filled with negative emotions and 50 CCs of butt hurt then I would highly urge you to avoid this game or only watch other people play it online if it interests you that much.",Rocket League®

The game has continued to go down the exact same route and yet I still play it. Obviously the game is a well designed game but the new addition of rumble mode has added another feature to make the game frustrating due to pure RNG.,Rocket League®

I play it and I hate that I try hard to win in this mess cuz it has the WORST physics in video game history. Mario Kart has more realistic physics and I mean that literally.Nothing makes sense about this game's physics. Hit the ball left it goes strait hit it down it bounces off the ground and goes uuuuuuuuuuuuuup to the ever so tall ceiling................Block a shot with a nice strait at it full body block and it simply keeps going strait as an arrow directly at the center of the goal as if you never hit it at all.I have seen this happen 3 times just today. Happens all the time. Also saw a teammate nail it strait forward and it kept on going....right into our goal as if he had done nothing at all just like my shots.They say there is no way to hack this game....play as much as I have and you will be dam sure that is not true at all. People can simply attach the ball to them on contact and take it anywhere no matter their speed or how fast they turn or even jump.I have seen it all. People claim much but I am no noob. They feel I should believe many lies but that is just not about to happen. I am a lady of truth and the truth is ANY game can be hacked and an E Sport is the most likely to be targetted. You go ahead and look at a flying car with a ball magneticly clingling to it thorought a full course aerial flight and act like that is the same sort of reaction you got during your own practice and in game experience.,Rocket League®

And if they (AFK) gets kicked you only can abandon the match which locks you out of multiplayer for 15mins. I enjoy playing when it's not for these issuses.

Additionally until the new maps are brought out everything is just a basic flat map with walls. The additional game modes and maps haven't been implemented yet.Don't get me started on the incompetent team AI. If you play with the AI be prepared to have your own team block you at every chance score goals on your own goal and more. Worse yet if someone bails your online match they're replaced with one of these AI which then gimps your team worse than having no one at all. I have literally watched on many occasions an AI from your team pushing the ball the entire way from the enemy goal to yours to score a point. They will incessantly push the ball towards their own teams goal.Once this is all fixed I'd recommend it but until then... No.,Rocket League®

The ball goes where ever it pleases and paired the the aweful hitboxes makes it a bad experience. The servers are from the lowest bidder and cars frequently teleport when around the ball the ball itself when hit suddenly changes directions.Online experience is terrible too really no skill to it just smash the ball as hard as possible and thanks to the phyiscs engine you'll make some crazy shot which in turn makes the player feel more skilled even though its all random at most. My suggestion is buy this game for the same amount the servers are worth less then 5$ anything more then that and your just getting scammed.

2015-07-07,19,121,1,False,Not Recommended,There's a lot of hype surrounding this game and I know people can be defensive about new releases that they love. Before you judge this review helpful or not please read it instead of crucifying me based upon my recommendation of this game.Rocket League is essentially football with cars. There's actually a Top Gear episode that is pretty much exactly this game minus the rocket boosters! Two teams of between 1 and 4 players face off against each other and try to score as many goals in a 5 minute period using their custom vehicles to hit the ball and each other around the field.This game is undoubtedly a lot of fun. The physics are funny the cars drive well (though the rocket boost flying is tricky as all hell) it looks beautiful it runs fantastically at least for me so it certainly seems to be very well optimised and I've had no frame rate issues so far. Surprisingly they also didn't screw up the UI which is a very common mistake.So if all I'm doing is heaping praise on Rocket League why aren't I recommending it? Unfortunately there is simply not enough content to justify a 15 price. Sure there are tons of customisation options for your vehicle and they are absolutely great and really make you unique. The problem is there's only one arena to play in and after 2 or 3 games it becomes very very same y. Sure there are different skins for the arena and day/night versions but they don't change the gameplay at all. And really petty though it may seem that's all that's keeping me from recommending it.At first I honestly believed this was an Early Access title and that more would be added soon. I feel as though this game might have benefited from a free to play model with cosmetic microtransactions though it's hard to gauge how effective that may have been.I would compare this game to the Mario Strikers series as both are a kind of zany take on football. I know it's unfair to compare a AAA title from a Mario series to Rocket League but I think the developers could have taken some great inspiration from Mario Strikers Charged. Power ups characters with different abilities and hazardous arenas ensured that each game played very differently and was wildly unpredictable. To me that's what Rocket League is missing and why I can play Mario Strikers Charged again and again but got bored of Rocket League within the hour. To anyone that's played Rocket League so far imagine this one player presses a button in the arena and for a limited time the sides of the arena only reflect the ball. Players can fall and be knocked off the sides into the abyss. I think you get the picture more inventive arena design really would have helped this game.Recommending and not recommending is a thin line though so while on the whole I would not tell me friends to pick this up some people might enjoy this. If you and your friends intend on playing a couple of games every now and then then you may well enjoy this a lot. If however you're looking to sink more than a few hours a week into a multiplayer game then I do not believe this is for you.Essentially I would compare this game to a dolled up version of Air Hockey because that's really what it is. For what it is it's great and a lot of fun but for me and I imagine a lot of other people that fun ran out extremely quickly. Perhaps DLC will add in what this game is currently missing but for now I cannot recommend it at this price.5/10P.S. If you do get this game please please make sure you have a controller. It shouldn't have to be said but just in case racing games on keyboard/mouse are awkward and poor to play and you'll have a sub standard experience. I've been using the Xbox controller and it's worked great for me. If you have a different controller try to find information on if/how it works with this game.,Rocket League®
2015-08-12,2,7,23,False,Not Recommended,Great game but the many flaws make this unworthy to recommend so far most of them are small issue that are not from the gameplay but from functionnality.

2015-11-02,18,3,1028,False,Not Recommended,no support for musterbating while playing. Game constantly requires both hands to play and there are no guides online for how to set up your key bindings to enable 1 handed play. Can not recomend until this is patched.,Rocket League®
2015-10-17,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,This game is really fun runs really well and looks good. I ve no issue with any of the gameplay only the way the camera works. You have two modes one where the camera locks onto the ball and follows it this will work fine for a while but you will get disoriented quickly and it makes it harder to line up shots due to the car facing the wrong way.The other mode is with the camera facing forward with the control on the joypad this is fine if you re used to it but for someone (like myself) that really does not use a controller will struggle. This game has been released for pc so you d think it must have some competent keyboard and mouse support no it does not you can try binding your mouse to the camera controls in the game but they are clearly designed only for a controller. If you're expecting a competent PC game with Keyboard and mouse support this is not that in my opinion it is missing the basics for a PC game.,Rocket League®

This happens in competitive 1v1 as well.I don't recommend this game.Update since season 4 matchmaking is super slow. Expect 5 minutes between games instead of 30 seconds.Update ... and a rank reset again. Every season (say every 2 months) you have to earn your rank again and end up terribly matched for about 50 games.,Rocket League®

2016-04-23,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,I expected something like the deathball mod from old unreal tournament 2004 just with cars and good physics like in gta v or any other average racing game (or at least ball physics like in pinball or billard simulations). furthermore i expected some fun aspects as in old games like destruction derby. the first impression is still ok but the more you play the more flaws and annoying things you notice. the physics are terrible. the camera can't decide between being fixed at times or randomly turn. the cars have no brake instead they stop instantly when you switch from forward to reverse.the cars bump around as if they are made of chewing gum. you can jump and turn the car in air like it has no weight at all. gravity is an issue anyway in this game. especially the ball gravity looks and feels totally weird. so the look of this game might fool you to think that it's a fullprice game. but the game mechanics feel like in alpha state or worse.even the new sumo mode in gta v is much more fun than this cos at least the gravity works there...can't recommend this. not for $20 not for $10. maybe in future for $0.99 in a humble bundle but only if they fix the physics and car behaviour.,Rocket League®

2017-07-30,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,This is an ok game but the controls are crap. The mouse should control where you look and you pretty much have to rely on your WASD keys or if your left handed on a computer (Like you have a mouse on the left side) IJKL. In a 3D game where you need skill I don't feel like it's that good for PC. I wouldve liked to be able to be holding W and when u moved my mouse to the right (like I pointed it right) then I should turn left. This feels like it was more developed for a controller but this isn't worth the $20 for me. If this can be fixed then I'll play if not I am most likely never playing it for a while. The game doesnt even take up the fullscreen but that doesn't matter to most people. I've played it on the PS4 and even though I dislike the controller I don't mind not having to turn with a key. This is my opinion. And if you've played FP (First Person) games then this may not be worth a purchase. If a friend of yours owns it play it on their PC/laptop first to see if you are ok with it. I screwed around with the controls and still nothing happened.,Rocket League®

2015-07-23,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,"I was trying to play ranked matches and there is no punishment for those players who do not finish the match. Instead they are free to leave at any time. The matches are only 5 minutes long but if your team goes down by 2 or more goals its like people immediately leave and get to the next game. Additionally the core experience of the game is understood within 3 minutes. Most of your games will play out in the exact same fashion very rarily will it be close and even when it is its not all that exciting. 80% of goals are luck/physics based.Customization options are pretty limited outside of picking some decals and some color but you can't really go too crazy with it. Everyone is on the same playing field quite literally. There are no clases and no real ""depth"" to the game outside of ""I should play more defensively right now"" or ""I want to score a goal"" 2/3 of the people on your team will definitely want be scoring a goal and it gets out of control quickly. There is little strategy involved.For me this game was not fun past the first 30 minutes. I cannot recommend this game to friends or even strangers at this pricepoint.

People in 2015 have certain criteria that needs to be met when it comes to there video games. People in 2015 expect guns and violence and death when it comes to their video games so far this game meets none of that criteria unfortunately. You dont even customize your guy so you can see him split in half by a car all you do in this is drive remote controlled cars in a box and hit a ball. You think im joking? Thats seriously all there is to this game there is no strategy to this game whatsoever. It's worth noting that there is no team deathmatch or capture the flag in this game there is only one mode in this game which limits variety. In this mode players of two teams try to hit the ball to there net and win maybe some people who are 5 years old can get any enjoyment out of this game but since im an adult this crap just doesnt cut it for me. This game should be marketed to toddlers and little kids because there is no strategy or depth to this game its boring as sin and in 2015 i really expect more from my games.In conclusionsThis is probably the worst games i have ever seen in my entire life for this review im giving this game a 15/10 worst game ever.,Rocket League®

2015-08-03,0,0,649,False,Not Recommended,I can not recommend this game. Just for the simple fact that people who has nivida cant run this at a decent 60 fps. Or just any gaming laptop in genral because you wont be able to run it at a decent framrate. I saw the pinned topic and it says that nivada panal controll does not support this game. Secondly there is alot of crashing. I apper ingame for about 3 seconds and then im kicked out it will also ask for fiel uplodes. Because of that i lost all my saved data and had to start over. 3rd and final this game is fun but if you have a gaming laptopt with nivida you might just want to get yourself a ps4 and play it on there theres crossplay so you can play with you freinds on pc.

2015-11-01,0,0,238,False,Not Recommended,"It's a good game don't get me wrong. It's fun at the very least. That being said 20$ is a lot for what is essentially ""soccer cars"". If you can get past the price tag you're met with dlc and while it's not expensive and completely cosmetic there's a lot of it which adds up and it started coming out almost as soon as the game was released. I don't mind cosmetic dlc but if your game is brand new and you have lots of DLC almost as soon as your game is released it looks and feels like a baltant cash grab. People talk about ""supporting psyonix"" by purchasing the DLC but as a player whose already paid for the game I don't really feel that I owe Psyonix anything more. This isn't a patrion campaign it's a computer game. If you can get past the price tag and paid dlc and into the wold of playing against people get ready to be called a "" "" and a "" "" and told to ""kill yourself"" in 5 out of every 6 games. And that's not a creative estimate. The community you find while playing Rocket League is in no uncertain terms awful aggressive and offensive. Sometimes you'll meet someone who is friendly or at the very least won't go out of their way to try to ruin your day but those people are few and far between. Nobody should have to put up with that. I play a lot of CS GO and I've been called worse things on a greater frequency in Rocket League than I ever have playing CS GO and CS GO has a reputation for having a ""toxic"" community. There's no report function and while you DO have the ability to play with communication off you're still playing against those same people and if you can't talk to people what's the point? You're pretty much playing bots at that point. After putting in way more time into this game than I should have I uninstalled it. I can deal with the price and the DLC but the community is really what pushed me over the edge. The gameplay can be fun sometimes but the people just ruin it. If you get the game you might have fun. Until you just get sick of getting on over and over again. Not worth it.",Rocket League®

2016-04-05,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,"* AUTISM SIMULATOR 2015 CONFIRMED *2018 Updated This game is rigged to keep you online as much as possible by taking advantage of your negative emotions by using scripted programming on the ball to ignore direct hits to the goal by steering the physics of the ball in the game developers favor. It makes you look as if you were performing poorly at the game when in reality it is all part of their plan to keep you online and it works on most of the casual playerbase but sadly I am not stupid to fall for their tricks get caught up to in their malicious practices.This removes all skill in the game and punishes skilled players. This is how they manipulate games to keep you interested enough to purchase their DLC with winstreaks and losestreaks. This has become a standard business practice in games such as Overwatch Clash Royale and Call of Duty Black Ops 3. If you don't believe me see how the ball literally goes through the player completely ignoring it. There is even a Reddit post of players questioning the idea.They completely ignore certain direct hits that are assured to go into the goal and you will notice how the ball completely ignores a straight direct hit the velocity of the ball slows down considerably or steers away from the goal which allows your opposing team to build up enough time to reach the ball to defend it. This is completely rigged and goes to show how rigged it is to prevent skilled players from winning their matches very easily.You will also notice the ball ignoring dribbles direct hits and even prevents your car hitbox from registering correctly. You will even notice the ball steering away from it's intended path instead of going where you want it to go. I have made basic ball physics in the Unreal engine and I know when the physics are completely off. This is why the esports genre is a joke.Electronic Arts was also caught manipulating game matches as well. Don't believe me? See for yourself. It is literally in the source code. I am not some ""conspiracy theorist"" blaming my losses for my lack of skill. The major issue is that game companies are profiting from this by taking adventure of the negative emotions comparable to that of gambling slot machines to trick you into putting as much money as possible into the game.They cater to casual players that make up 80% of the playerbase meanwhile the 20% of the pro scene would alienate casual players to the point of never coming back to the game. This is proof that skill becomes a liability especially when money and greed is a strong motive. This is why skilled gamers such as myself are playing older games without any connectivity to the internet to no longer tolerate this type of t anymore.",Rocket League®

When playing 2vs2 its actually 1vs3 because your bot will ram you and make own goals.

2016-01-31,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,The game had great mechanics and entriely the driving experience felt smooth overall. I even found the driving experience so smooth that I wasn't concentrated on jerking motions from the car and rather the turns focused my vision on the playing field instead of my position. The wide turns could sometimes be annoying but this I found to be fundamental for the positioning aspect that I aforementioned was backed up by a great driving experience. What more could you want in a competitive/casual car game? Well I found myself after playing Rocket League slowly not wanting to play it again. I couldn't place my finger on any true issue with mechanics or gameplay but effect of after playing a round was unsatisfying. If asked by my friends to play a round of Rocket League I was hesitant at first. I can tribute this very much to the experience I felt when playing PAYDAY 2 in such that when I open the game now the excitement of playing it was already lost (now having 24 hours in the game). Nothing truly takes me back to wanting to play Rocket League and I only have 2 hours in the game. So if I were to reccomend the game to a friend I wouldn't be quite sure what to say. Games like CS GO have me constantly wanting to play another match after I am done with the previous one but Rocket League just doesn't. Maybe the game can give a more capturing feel sense of more achievement or non monotonmous races (never once was I on the edge of my seat playing Rocket League). I can't exactly say Rocket League is a bad game but I would not feel happy classifying it as good game either in my personal opinion. So I guess it is a opinion that should determine the purchase of the game.,Rocket League®

2015-11-27,3,1,110,False,Not Recommended,I Previouslly game this game a thumbs up but after a long while of more playing I'm saddend to have to change it. It's really simple actully Ranked mode is broken. I know ranked isnt the entire game but it's such a huge part of it I have to change my review.Let me tell you how it's broken. It does not matter how well you play a match it could be the closest most skill based match of your life but it doesnt matter. If you lose you lose just as many points as you would have gained if you won. If match making is working as it should you should be matched agasint people around the same skill as you. Meaning that the average player is winning around 50% of the time in ranked mode.Do you see where I'm going? if you win 50% of games you make no progress at all. Even if you win 53% of the time it's still not enough to gain you levels at a realistic rate. I know because my win percentage is 53%. In all the hours I've played I've only just broken bronze 1 rank and then lost it the very next game. I predict that you'd need to win around 60+% of the time to make ANY KIND of reasonable progress in raked mode.You feel so freaking stuck. because even if you do break the cycle and start getting better a the game it's not long before you're paired up with people just as good as you again.HOW TO FIX IT Base rank points of how well you play the game for christ sake! not just if you win or lose. I could have a dozen saves and 4 epic saves lose by one point and be down just as many points as if i just drive around in circles for the whole ing game! how is that fair???TL DR You need to be decently above average to progress in ranked mode. Rank is based only on if you win or lose and not on how well you play. if they fix how ranked points are calculated ill change my review.,Rocket League®

2015-09-18,1,1,30,False,Not Recommended,"This game belongs in timezone or your local arcade machines where kids toss in $1 for each game. This game has no potential to become an ""e sport"" this game becomes super predictable and repetitive after 10 hours. This game becomes super boring the cars. This game has two different player base the first one is the super casual I don't give a f*ck sort of player who just around and talks sh!t all day. The second kind is the super serious analyst player who believes this game will become the next big e sport to take on the international stage. These kind of players are the most toxic to play against because they take this game way to serious and end up not having fun whilst taking the fun away from new casual players. Example of this would be when I was in my 2nd game ever and I couldnt work out the jump mechanics of the game and people would laugh at me on the enemy team and my my own teammates would say ""holy sh!t dude just jump"" The good thing about this game is the match making system where people will just randomly be put in the same game with different abilities I can be a veteran player searching for a ranked game and I will have rookies or people on their first ever rank game in my team or on the enemy team. tl dr this game is super aids after 10 hours of gameplay but fun for the first 5 hours when you are discovering the mechanics of your car. 2 kinds of players in the game one super casual troll players or super serious analyst players who put 100 hours into each car there is. only good thing about this game is opening it up and listening to it's soundtrack while you get blowies from your gf.",Rocket League®

2016-10-08,8,1,162,False,Not Recommended,"I first heard about this game from my friend who had nothing but praise for it and highly encouraged me to give it a try. Needless to say he has terrible taste and we arn't friends anymore. My first impression of the game was the cost. 15 dollars seemed a little steep to me. I am a firm believer in the old montra ""Free to play here to stay"". After all games arn't art they're just games. Thats like asking me to pay 15 dollars to go play kick the can outside m house with the neighborhood kids but even with the steep price I was willing to look beyond this serious flaw for the sake of my (ex)friend. When I started downloading the game I noticed the very short download time. It only took me about an hour to download the game. I was a little upset about this because as we all know short downloads equals lack of content. After the game finished downloading I opened it up for the first time and immediatly started the tutorial. To my dismay the tutorial was concise and easily understood. I like most people enjoy discovering games for themselves and like long drawn out tutorials with unclear directions so I can maximize the time learning the game to keep the feeling of discovery. For this game however it took a little more than 5 minutes to learn all the controls which I found dissapointing. After finishing the tutorial my friend invited me to a game. Once again I was dissapointed this time with the short time it takes for a game to be found and for the game to load which left little time for me and him to come up with a very large and complicated strategy. I was also slightly annoyed with the lack of an accept button. Its like the game just assumes I want to join a match just because I'm in the waiting queue. Once me and my friend joined the game I was struck by the severe lack of children yelling profanity into their mics. This bothered me because not only do I find the sounds of children relaxing but if there arn't alot of children that must mean that this game isn't child friendly. A smaller but still valid mistake with the game is the severe lack of ethnic variety. I didn't here a single word of Russian or Portuguese in the entire hour that we played the game. In fact this game seems to lack any sort of personable community at all because everyone in all the games I joined just said the same old kind generic words to me every time I made a mistake simply forgiving me and encouraging me to try my best. This I found as any other sane person would particularily boring. I tried several times to spice things up with a little old fashioned profanity but it seems like this community isn't very welcoming of free expression. In conclusion I can't recommend this game for the many problems listed above. These game developers obviously didn't model their game after the other great games of todays time. After this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth I think I'm done playing any other non valve games for a while. Oh well I guess its back to only TF2 DotA 2 and CS GO for me. Now those are real games!",Rocket League®
2015-07-13,1,15,133,False,Not Recommended,Promising but repetitive for sure. A good game and a cool idea but has a few issues.For starters it crashes. Not a crazy amount but I've had it for 24 hours and have had 4 crashes. It's not my system as I can run more demanding games without a problem. The server issues are well documented and accurate. There can be a lot of lag and a lot of disconnects.Gameplay wise it is definitely fun but having only exhibition games online is definitely boring after a while. I haven't played any offline yet so I can't comment on the season mode but it would probably be more interesting online if there was some variety.I don't know exactly what could make it better in terms of variety. Items? Weapons? Game modes? Larger teams/maps? All I know is that I hope they are experimenting with other ideas for online play because it is repetitive. Good for killing 30 minutes but thats about it.Bottom line is I can't recommend it at full price. This would be a great pickup for $5ish but at $20 Canadian it is definitely too bland. Mechanics are excellent but theres not a lot there for twenty bucks.,Rocket League®

Rockets does something that few other games do it takes a concept simplifies it and then perfects it. When you play this game you find yourself in one of the best feeling looking and joy filling games you will ever play so why is it bad? This game may have some of the best combat you will ever experience but you can do nothing with it. Imagine Rockets like an towering skyscraper it is jaw dropping beautiful and unbreakable. So what is the problem with the building? Well the thing is empty! There is no furniture no colors no substance. They have laid the ground work for one of the biggest games we could ever see but they have left their foundation completely empty. There is two game modes (Both of which are just the basic battle with different health systems.) one AI four maps and thats really it where as what the game doesn't have is more customization more single player ability and ONLINE! Why would you not give this game online that just doesn't make sense! I hate to see such an amazing game go down in history as just another indie game just because it didn't give people enough to talk about but here it is and here is will stay.

2016-10-04,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,Rocket League is very competitive requires some skill. It takes some effort in the beginning just to do the basic gameplay of the tutorial in a match with other people how it is supposed to be done. While doing this you will meet people with anger management problems people who easily give up and leave or people who just put much more hours in the game than you do. You lose either way. After this period of time you finally understand how this game works how the community works if you want to battle both investing a lot of time.Well I bought Rocket League for having fun.

I have to force reset my computer as the game freezes my PC completely. I haven't experienced the problem with any other game so far. The matchmaking is very bad and the community is the worst.

I can see that this game is fun and original but after some time the novelty wears off. The first few games feel great and I can definitely see the appeal in them. But it just gets repetitive with only one gamemode just altering in player counts. So you are paying 15 for one gamemode and nothing to work for. Don't get me wrong I can see the good in this game but it is worth 8 at most.

2015-12-04,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,"Was gifted this. Personally didn't like it but could see how it may appeal to some people. It suffers from ""meme"" syndrome. Again I can see how it may appeal to some but it just isn't my thing. I don't care for 5 minute matches with quick games that boil down to who can bounce it off a wall first to set. It seems like other games such as HoTS were the game's match is made to be short yet this is so short it feels like I accomplish nothing. Not to mention it essentially bashes me to use the controller. I've tried both KB+M and controller and it doesn't feel right with either. To give you an idea its like Eurotruck Simulator with a controller. There's other problems but I'll leave it at that so I don't appear ungrateful.

You win or lose your game but the worst of it you spend 5min struggling against the lag cause this lag is not even latency issue it teleports you all around the stadium slows the cars slows the ball getting you forward and backward then forward again. Some players prefer to leave the game to search another one on a stable server... Russian roulette.The developers don't care about the quality of gaming on their game. They took our 20e and don't care about players issues I didn't bought this game to play training...I don't recommand buying this game until lags have been resolved on EU server I play pretty much only ranked and when you lag and lose a game cause you can't control your own car... you feel screwed.,Rocket League®

It REALLY ERALLY is. But the games servers aren't very stable. At all. nor is thier matchmaking system. Since this is basically at its core a multiplayer game these two issue force me to give a negative review.For example. You load into a ranked 2 player game but because the servers are unstable someone is often left without a teammate and in ranked you aren't given an AI replacement.At least 40% (more likely more) of thier servers lag horribly causing you to miss your targets. While mildly amusing these games are extremely frustrating.That games lots of fun when you have close competitive games but its also really irritating when you have these games interupted with complete trash laggy servers or poor matchmaking.,Rocket League®

It doesn't have enough in it to keep my intrest in the long run. Sure i play a few rounds with mates but after 2 3 rounds i'm already starting to get bored.

2015-07-19,2,5,308,False,Not Recommended,Awesome addicting game. It offers simply fun. Only downside to its crossplatform play is that it doesnt support party system which is really annoying cause most of my friends got this on ps4 cause its FREE there. I only bought this to pc cause I was willing to show credit to games creators by paying for it but now I feel bit cheated. Game was advertised as crossplatform game and it doesnt have a party system there VERY DISSAPOINTING from that perspective. Hope you fix it soon. Cant recommend it till that.,Rocket League®

2015-07-19,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,This is a great game like SARPBC (Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars). This game brings back good memories of it. If you are a regular gamer and u do not know SARPBC I strongly suggest you get the game as it is very good. But for someone like me a die hard fan of SARPBC it dosen't cut the mustard. As to me it feels like a they have just retextured the old game and given it a better name. There are new things I like e.g. The customisation system. But they sorta dummed it down they removed the funky and weird maps and used the bog standard maps one of the maps is reused but they gave it a texture upgrade. They have got rid of challenges that made the game so fun sometimes by adding a small but game changing twist. The game is not as chaotic as it use to be. I tried the AI and majority of the time they do not boost. which ruins half the fun when playing with them as the most you got to worry about is being hit out of the way. In SARPBC they would boost and u would have to worry about being destroyed at a moments notice (I know it is designed for multiplayer but not everyone wants to constantly be on multiplayer). In my opinion of a die hard fan they have gone back a step from a amazing game to a really good one. So with a Heavy heart have to give it a thumbs down. Even though it is a good game.,Rocket League®

Not only this but if you were to buy this game keep in mind that to compete with other players you NEED to be using a controller. If you don't have a controller then do not buy this game as you will just keep getting out skilled by other players who have the advantage of using a controller. Overall I would save your money and wait until this game comes on sale or until they at least upgrade their servers.

2015-12-01,4,7,15,False,Not Recommended,"Rocket PowerHere it is everyone eSports. In trying to legitimize playing video games as anything other than a complete waste of time Psyonix have crafted quite possibly the most boring game I've ever played. Playing Rocket League is like playing a real sport except it comes with none of the satisfaction that playing a real sport has. Sure you just drove your cyber car into the digi ball scoring the game winning hyper goal but at the end of the day you're still a gross smelly nerd playing video games and probably jacking off to anime girls. If I score a goal in soccer I feel happy not only because I'm helping my team win but also because I'm bettering my body and mind at the same time. I want to be able to win a game and then not immediately feel immense disappointment because nothing I've accomplished is real.In attempting to emulate a real sport Psyonix also failed to properly utilize their medium. Rocket League is so simple that any novelty or entertainment factor that it has quickly wears off as long as you're a normally functioning adult. Think to any other game that one would consider an ""eSport"" and you'll quickly see how little depth there is to Rocket League. Hell Counter Strike another game which requires very little strategy is much more complex simply because of the nature of the game.In short what we have here is an attempt to fuse two incompatible worlds that of real sports and that of fake sports. In doing so Psyonix has stripped away what makes each of these unique and the result is some sort of unholy abomination that is better off turbo blasting itself into the dumpster.Taster's score C",Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Bad support for keyboard users devs doesn't care enough to fix it.This game mostly caters to controller and as a result it's a lot harder to play on keyboard even when small fixes could make it a lot better this is the reason for the thump down.What I mean about this is that they have made it a possibility to bind your mouse x and y axis to free cam mode but the free cam mode also always try to center to the original position therefore it creates a problem for keyboard users as it isn't a continues input.This is a easy fix and people have been talking about this for at least a year time without any changes. To me that's a clear indication that the devs don't care about the keyboard users and therefore deserve a thump down.,Rocket League®

The machinery will fail because the onus of all machinery is failure. The strangers with whom youve been thrown in will fail you because they do not know you and you cannot physically harm them. Although it is a shame I cannot feel remorse in giving this game a negative review for although the team behind it is clearly tallented and has excecuted their idea superbly on a technical level the concept around which the game was built is flawed to it's core.,Rocket League®

2015-07-25,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"This is utterly broken. It's crap. Don't buy it.So this game got a lot of attention and yeah everyone needs it? No.My bias upfront I hate football (or soccer if you're from _that_ country) and suck at driving games. So I was really quite certain that this game isn't for me but a nice YT guy convinced me that it might be fun if played with the right crowd.That's the problem The online sessions are broken. I have a play time of around 4h (more than 50% of that was incidently the game sitting idle in the menues while I tended to my kids I guess. Steam refunds are only possible within the first two hours. Oh my...).A normal session limited to Europe as region looks like this Wait Wait some more because only 4 out of 6 show up Wait times out 2 bots join Those bots score more than everyone else and do insane stuffYay. The AI is good. That isn't fun though. It's rare to have a full human match and the difference in skill level at my level is too big. AI Amazing Everyone else is .. somewhere between incompetent and somewhat capable (I'm heavily leaning towards incompenent myself).If you ignore that there are no (full) games Even a mediocre difference in ping leads to a completely broken game experience. Mine is usually around 20 if some of the rare humans in a match have something around 90 100 the game is unplayable. The ball jumps back and forth travels back in time and the game is there is no other word broken beyond repair.Combine this ""Not enough human players"" with ""Enough latency and the game is unplayable"" and .. well fun right?I regret every cent I payed for this game. It's not only bad it's the worst game for me this year and I don't recall a worse game from 2014. I wanted to exercise the 'Refund' option for the first time in my loooooong Steam history for this very game. Unfortunately as described above sitting idle in the menus is 'playing the game' for Steam so yeah I totally 'played' this game for 4h so far and therefor cannot get my money back.The least I can do is to state here that The game is utterly broken I advise you not to buy this game You should if you ignored the first two bullet points give it 90min to confirm my complaints and instantly ask for a refundBlech.",Rocket League®

People have to use the forums to find others for matches. I would hold off buying this game till this company irons out the issues.

2016-11-22,0,0,1068,False,Recommended,I've never liked sports nor am I a fan of any Fifa game but boy do I ADORE Rocket League!There is almost no doubt that you've already heard of this game or at least seen it played but for the uninitiated I'll try and explain the concept.Rocket League stripped down to it's core is soccar with player controlled cars... I know that doesn't seem like much of an exciting game but trust me when I say that simple concept is enough to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. Each player controls his/her own car on the field and each game runs for 5 minutes. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Pretty basic? That's what I thought when I started playing this game all those years ago. The thing that sets Rocket League apart is it's ball/car physics and that each car on the field is equipt with it's own Rocket Booster allowing cars to go flying through the air. As you progress through the ranks in Rocket League you'll learn to read every shot learn how to fake players get better with your arials work on passing plays with your teammates and much much more!The game features 1v1 2v2 and 3v3 casual and competitive modes and casual can also provide game modes such as 4v4 Dropshot Basketball Hockey and Rumble. Each mode offers a new fresh set of game rules and I'd recommend looking each one up. Rocket League's party system allows you to play with anyone who is on the same platform (in a few months this will open to cross platform as well) letting you queue up together whether it be for your own private matches or for online casual/comp. Cosmetics can be traded between players on your friends list and does not utilize the steam community market. Cosmetics in the game are for looks only with the exception of different hitboxes that come with some DLC/Crate cars. Any DLC can be purchased for a few $$ and through the use of trading most items including import cars can be obtained for a key or two without opening a single crate. In saying that Rocket League will occasionally have a special event where you can redeem special items or decryptors (basically free keys that are not tradable) allowing you to open any crate in the game without spending a cent.In short I'd highly recommend this game. I have barely gone into the learning curve Rocket League offers in the 900 hours I've played of this game I still feel there is plenty of room for improvement and I'm striving for that 1000 hours and hopefully in the future that Champion rank!,Rocket League®

It has tons of different modes for casual play and a large player/fanbase for competitive play (also has a decent esports scene) Customizablity for cars is really good with extra cars you can buy from the SM and more you can unlock from the loot crates. Devs really care for this game with lots of updates coming monthly with new maps cars content etc.Cons Solo queing is a bit annoying with players often giving up after conceding a few goals Connection is also a bit of an issue with servers sometimes acting up (for me at least)That said if you like football I can't recommend it enough as it has tons of casual content if you don't want to tryhard it and also a great competitive scene if you want to go bigRecommend the full price of this game 100%,Rocket League®

2017-09-18,0,0,950,False,Recommended,10/10 Psyonix released the game just over two years ago but it wasn't until its console release on Xbox that I got my hands on the game. I'd loved the look of the game from the moment I saw streamers and YouTubers playing it and so the moment I got to play my very first match I knew I wouldn't be putting it down anytime soon.Now 2500+ hours of playtime later across both PC and Xbox I can without a doubt say the game we know now has exceeded all expectations. An independent studio creating a game that has not only made a name for itself in the e sports genre but also amongst casual players across all platforms. Its made various changes since release bringing in modes like Hoops Snow Day Dropshot and Rumble all of which require different skillsets and allow players to grow and try out new mechanics that help keep the game fresh and exciting.It's the main game mode Soccar that keeps me coming back. It's competitive and puts a brand new spin on football/soccer as a sport. A caged arena that in 3v3 can feel claustrophobic and require planned out teamwork to get the game winning goal can also feel desperately large in a 1v1 match that will require a whole other mindset to play in. The use of walls boost management aerialing and even the ceiling by highly skilled players causes you to never treat to matches the same.With the player to player trading system you can customise your car in a whole new way and though I'm not a fan of most micro transactions in video games I feel that with the upcoming Decryptors it will allow those that only spend their money on the base game itself to gain access to crate only items.Honestly this game is one of the greatest I've played in years and is one of the main reasons I bought a PC. If that doesn't come as enough of a recommendation then the fact that it's only 15.99 surely should persuade you when compared with newer released games asking for two or three times as much and providing half as much content.See you on the pitch!,Rocket League®

2018-06-26,0,0,335,False,Recommended,Most frustrating game ever made.,Rocket League®
2018-06-26,0,0,107,False,Recommended,Long Version scroll down for short versionRocket League is my favorite e sport game. I have always thought that soccer with cars would be fun but I never realized how awesome it was until I played Rocket League. I have put about 80 hours into RL through PC and Nintendo Switch. I am already Pro status on both platforms and well on my way to Veteran on PC. Computer Requirements You will likely be wanting a fast computer for that buttery smooth experience. At least 4 cores 60 fps all that. For those with laptops if there are no integrated graphics then I would recommend at least an i7 core CPU for it to still be worth the money. If you don t mind frame rate drops then by all means go for lower that s just my opinion. Gameplay The game is jump boost and drift. That s about it. Yet it s so addicting. When you jump you can boost up high to hit the ball above others and into the goal. This takes some practice though. No penalties just simple soccer with cars. There are also a few different modes too. Standard 3v3 Doubles 2v2 Duel 1v1 and Chaos 4v4 . Then there are special modes Dropshot where you must make holes on the other teams and shoot the ball into those holes Rumble which is basically 3v3 with special power ups Hoops which is basketball Snow Day which replaces the ball with a puck and Rocket Lab which has maps with a twist to them. Graphics and Audio The graphics can be changed from High Performance to Performance to Quality to High Quality. This keeps things simple I really like it. High Quality is perfect for powerful computers while High Performance should work well for computers without good graphics. The audio is spot on with the purrs of each engine. The music also sounds great though any headset or speakers. DLC As of this time of writing there are two types of DLC. There are car packs which include one or two cars with a boost wheels engine sound etc. Each DLC pack is different. Also keep in mind that all car packs are just cosmetic and don t really affect the gameplay in any large way. Same applies with everything you buy with keys. Keys let you open crates for more cosmetics. All keys cost money but crates can be given or bought with tokens through special events which happen periodically. These tokens are given simply be playing during these special events. Of course there are also decryptors which you can buy with tokens during the special events. Decryptors are keys but if you unlock a crate with one you will not be able to trade that item. Soon however a new Rocket Pass will be coming. This lets you receive many cosmetics through leveling up a new form of DLC I m looking forward too. All that being said however you won t feel like you need DLC as there are hundreds of cosmetics with the base game. More info I also want to mention a couple other things too. Cross platform play is enabled but you can t invite someone from another platform to your party. The only way you can play with your friends from another platform is through a private game which only gives you bots for your other players/opponents not other random online people. So that s annoying. There are also many different practices that you can do as well as endless practices that other people have created. A big free play mode is open too for practicing. Matchmaking is usually super fast as there are a lot of players playing. Finally you can save replays although I which I could clip replays and save them within the game. Conclusion For $20 this game is a must buy I strongly recommend it. Although if you are still hesitant during big Steam sales you can find it half off. h1 Short Version /h1 What a shot!What a shot!What a shot!Chat disabled for 3 seconds...,Rocket League®

2015-12-24,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Soccer with rocket boosted cars. That's enough to sell you right there right? If it isn't just watch someone play it it's a blast! (Pun slightly intended)It is an online multiplayer game primarily. You can play seasons and exhibitions and tutorials singleplayer offline but most of your gameplay will come out of online multiplayer. Which runs great mind you and is loads of fun! The graphics and sound is very impressive and controls and such are great! Don't have much to complain about at all other than the fact that I'm not too into games without an end goal (pun not intended) but if you love multiplayer games than by all means play Rocket League. It's explosively fun! ...Okay sorry that one was a little forced.,Rocket League®

2018-10-03,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Had this game uninstalled for awhile since my old computer couldn't handle it. I was going to play it today to collect achievements (and was bored) but apparently everything has gone to s*it since the last time I played (according to recent reviews). Even though the game has basically turned into a cashgrab and the community has become toxic it's nothing new compared to other popular games online. While casual play being removed sucks it's turned into a real competitive game which is key in this type of game. If you're not good at it train hard and try to climb the ranks. If you have a lot of experience it's unfortunate that it was ruined for you.Being banned for mainly no reason is an understandable issue and the developers should respond but people will keep playing/buying RL regardless of itI personally won't re install it due to these reasons but can see past all of the problems as just a business strategy.Overall if you're tolerant of the internet and the entire gaming community (whether it's toxic or not) buy/play this game (even if it breaks/censors you).,Rocket League®

2016-04-27,0,0,2904,False,Not Recommended,Almost 3k hrs in. This game used to be so much fun. But Α. The community gets worse day by day. The toxicity levels and anger issues tend to ruin everything. Disabling chat helps noone. Its the people that ruin it.B. The latest update (as of Oct 3rd 2018 it's 1.5.3) is rubbish. Stuttering is all over the place.Some say its triggered by the season's awards fancy boosts. I believe its the servers or something badly programmed. In europe's servers at least.C. I kinda liked the Rocket pass. If you grind enough you may get them all. Just buy the first 10 keys and play. Dont spend any money. D. The crates system is just a fraud. When they were firstly introduced it was intriguing. But when you spend REAL money that you or someone else worked hard to earn and then you decide to open 20 crates wishing for a mystery decal and you NEVER ever win it you know its just a FRAUD. This is really an EU's matter and not mine.E. I'm really sad that I see people (youtubers and pros) earning so much money out of it and yet here I am editing my once good review to express my feelings and saying goodbye to a once cheerful mind blowing and exciting game. This was once a game. Now its just a cash machine. I send my regards to the people that had love and joy in their hearts when they were developing this. Peace.F. To all the new players please please please learn to play allowing quick chat only. And try to have fun. Dont get addicted. Have some fun elsewhere too.G. To the devs. Try to do more. Stop sniffing around only for money. And please when you have something really good to show notify me. I believe you know how to. xxxZeroiner,Rocket League®

2018-07-02,0,0,941,False,Recommended,This may well become your main 'go to game'. It will take a little while to get used to it. Flying in the air with a car... to hit a ball in a specific direction... is not an easy thing to do. No other game ever made will prepare you for this.You will find yourself hating this game at times. Hating the matchmaking. Hating your own lack of skill. Hating other peoples lack of skill (helping you lose 10 matches in a row). Etc. Etc.But that is only because the game is so good. If it wasn't we wouldn't care. Unfortunately we ruin this game for ourselves. We play with higher players lower players on other accounts (I don't) while drunk while tired while.... well who knows right?And that leads to some unbalanced games. The trick is to concentrate on each moment you're in and better your own skill and game intelligence (what you choose to do in each situation..positioning etc). Spending less time on worrying about the individual games' outcome. Then advancement will sort itself out.This will allow you to play more relaxed and playing Rocket League in a relaxed state is the best way to play. More fun will be had and more wins too. Weird that huh?Grab this game on sale and stick with it for 3 months. Playing regularly. There is a good chance that you'll fall in love with it. Then always have something to play for as long as Rocket League exists.There is no need to buy any add ons or items of any kind. No pay to win here. It's all skill based...with a little luck )Some items are cool some cars are too. You may grab something down the line. Even for free. 'Keys' named 'Decryptors' are given away in events. If you get lucky you'll get something awesome. I have gotten a couple of cars and some expensive wheels. Crates opened with Decryptors yield items that can't be sold though.So in conclusion Rocket League is underpriced can be addictive will be fun and will stand the test of time for you.I also have hundreds of hours in the PS4 version. I have to recommend this.,Rocket League®

2015-07-20,0,0,39,False,Recommended,This game is just genius and very fun to play.It is easy to learn the basics but it is really hard to master it.The only thing which is not as good as I would like it are the stats.It would be very nice to have more stats available btw. to have more precise stats like telling you in which modes you won and lost how many matches instead of just showing the wins from all modes together.But that is really everything I can complain about. The game runs very smooth and stable and currently there are a lot of players online so you never have to wait. Additionaly the game will add bots if you don't find enough players and so far the bots seem to be pretty balanced. Maybe sometimes a bit to good but overall they are very fun to play with.,Rocket League®

2018-07-01,0,0,469,False,Recommended,This game is just amazing and it keeps getting better the more you play.Easy to get in insanely difficult to master. Rocket league is 3 years old and you will still find matches faster than games like OW. The community is not as toxic as in other games because the game is frenzy and you usually can't get your hands off your controller. But ocassionally you will get the stupid toxic salty person in your team.,Rocket League®
2018-09-12,0,0,582,False,Recommended,Good Game !!,Rocket League®
2016-06-09,0,0,221,False,Not Recommended,Servers are too bad to play. Yet they do not fix it for years. They only care about crates and money. Its community is even worse. If you concede even only 1 goal they will just quit or vote for surrender.If you cant touch a ball even only 1 times they will say bad words about you.And if you lose enemy team will mock you for no reason. Game itself is a good concept if you dont count servers but it is unplayable for a person who plays solo.Now they have a ban system(I dont know if it is auto ban or not).Meaning if someone trolls or leaves your game they will be perfectly fine. But if you say something bad about them you'll get banned. After taking a break on this game for months I joined a game and saw that I got banned 24 hours for saying bad words. I mean what on earth is that ? I didnt play it for months how could I get banned ? Or how was the punishment still needed 24 hours to end ?,Rocket League®

2015-07-09,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Fantastic gamePretty steep learning curve takes probably around 20 games to just get the hang of playing to where you stomp the easiest AI 10/10 times. I've probably logged about 10+ hours between here and PS4 and all I can say is that Psyonix have made a fantastic arcade game. All the hype surrounding it was well met. Sure the servers were down for a couple of days but whatever that doesn't detract from the fact that this game is straight up fun the way a game is meant to be. It has competitveness and it has the casual feel of an arcade game. Some games you are playing like Pele and then the others you shoot like Heskey. Regardless the game is fantastic and is built upon fast paced games. I highly reccomend this game as it is pretty much a 9.5/10 in my book.ps. once the servers came up I had the most fun I've ever had playing this game online (mostly because I am still sad about losing the playoff finals on pro),Rocket League®

One reason for that is the way this game looks its so bright and colorful. The car modelss look great the lighting and the design of the stadiums are awesome. Another reasson why this game is amazing is the control scheme. Rocket League takes the simple mechanics to learn yet hard to master approach and thats what instantly ups the replay value in my book. The game isn't confusing its small cars playuing football (soccer as we say in america) and its pure fun with a life span that hopefully lasts a long time.,Rocket League®

Pro+ cheap and fun+ great opportunities to customise your car+ DLCs are optional and cosmetic+ easy to learn hard to master+ different game modes from normal soccer to Ice hockey basketball and experimental stuff+ events with event currency you can earn and use to buy keys for boxes you otherwise would have had to pay for with actual moneyContra the soundtrack is annoying better have your own playing in the background the community is partially very toxic (but which community nowadays isn't?) when you play ranked and you are not at least platinum you will constantly have ragequitting kiddies on both teams servers tend to lag at peak time matchmaking is sometimes doing random stuff like matching 1 Pro and 2 Rookies against a Veteran and 2 Masters there is a goal explosion with a dabbing ghost.

But casual 3v3 or whatever is pure fun! Who cares if you're trash or the next eSports Pro! Thats why I enjoy this game so much!

Game is about trying to score as much goals as you can in time you have and defend your gates from enemy attacks like In normal soccer. There s also competetive mode normal mode championship 1v1 with your friend 2v2 with your friends or random people 3v3 and 5v5 also training with 3 difficulty levels and more. Also you re often getting skins but sadly it s not steam items. Also there s no money or something that you need to buy you can earn a lot nice things just by playing but also you can get crate by playing longer and buy key ( it cost real money) to get even better skins cars decals wheels and other things. And no game is not pay to win you can t buy speed or anything else to get advantage so everyone can play it without spending extra money. Game also has ranks levels and more.If I see this game on sale again when I have money I ll buy it without thinking.RECCOMENDED,Rocket League®

2018-09-05,0,0,491,False,Not Recommended,"Look I used to love this game I still do for the most part but when you play it a lot you relaize that couple of things in this game are absolute dogsh*t. For example In Poland connection to servers is hot garbage (not only Im experiencing these troubles my friends from Poland also are) and hitboxes of some cars are just f*cking ridiculously unpredictible. And randomness in matches is sometimes just unbelivble. It's not because ""someone is lucky"" but random wall bounces pinches and sometimes you obviously drive in to some other guy but he destroys you insted of you destroyng him for no god damn reason. I often feel like I have no control over what is going on on the field just like my skills doesn't matter. I quited Rocket League about 6 months ago now I tried to come back and what has changed? We got new skins... Just f*cking great... Im also experiencing terrible FPS drops but I guess it's my computers fault. Anyway. I realy love this game and I'd like to come back to it but it's just unplayble for me. Psyonix please fix issues with your game before adding new stuff. All we need right now is some fixes not ""Rocket Pass"" or some sh*t Focus on important stuff first so everyone can enjoy playing your game.",Rocket League®

2018-07-01,0,0,89,False,Recommended,"I've owned this game since 2016 but have just started putting hours into the game.This game is very relaxing to play but at the same time it is very competitive. It is extremely fastpaced (higher ranks especially) but at the same time you have so much control over the car and the ball.The game may seem hard or complicated at first but with most games when you put in the time and the practice you find so many different ways to handle the ball and your car. It is extremely fun. Just recently they added a ""Rocket Pass"" which allows Free To Play players (Players that don't want to pay for cosmetics) a way to earn them just by playing the game in a way that's very similar to Fortnites system. I totally recommend this game to anyone that just wants something to do in their downtime or a new game to rank up in. But I also have to mention if you're playing and you're getting really upset after about 2 or 4 games of losing just take a break or go into Casual or Practice. Try to wind down because if you're upset it isn't going to help your chances of winning (Or it might who knows.)",Rocket League®

I personally love the 2 V 2 game modes te most but the powerup mode is alot of fun aswell offering more play styles for more players. The unlockables are awesome because you get some for just playing crates drop and you can buy keys for them but most the time you get some really sick stuff from the drops.

2015-12-05,0,0,783,False,Not Recommended,I really loved this game played ranked and casual but since the new update in late September 2018 the game doesn t make fun anymore. They did now finaly Rumble to ranked but also deleted it from Casual so if you like to play Rumble you HAVE to play now in Ranked Mod even if you don t like same is with the other fun sports like snow hokey.Whats the problem playing in Ranked? You have 8 of 10 Matches with overpowered players you lose very high and peoples quit or offend more then before all the fun is gone because its impossible to win agains Champions or Diamnond players if you don t have there skills. I love to play it now and not in 3 Weeks when all players are Ranked the right we have a System here that knows the Skills of the peoples so choose peoples near your skill and not putting Champions with Silver or even Gold Players. But thats not the problem you also have sometimes a matchmaking that gives you also bronze Player when you are Gold so if you play 3 vs 3 and 2 can t play or leave you lose because you can t win again 3 player. A lose gives you a Division down if not more but a Win gives you no up so to get your down up again you need at least 2 wins in a row what is in this matchmaking impossible.The fun is gone because of the toxic community this game suffers now and since the update it suffers more then before because peoples only like to win and not to lose even if they can t play you get offended or peoples leave and you are alone and for staying and playing you also get a division down.Game also suffers from bugs and sometimes crashes since the last patches what means if you get kicked out because of a crash count a 5min bann because you let your mates alone rejoining doesn t work because you get an error 59 (facepalm)Rocket Pass was added every quartal you need to buy it what cost you 10 Rocket Keys its not a must but its another milky thing not enough all the DLC s they add and the lootboxes nope now another paying Pass every 3 Months.if I could I would ask now a refunde incredible how money can destroy a good game like this one.,Rocket League®

The primary key for matchmaking are cars. U won't get opponents on same skill level. U get opponents with same car. WTF? Why? When i take dominus a play agains dominus. When a play lets say takumi i play against takumi.Ranked matching doesn't much care about your rank. It allows you to be grand champion and play in party with somebody who can't even hit the ball. SO lets say u have Gold 3 div. 3. U should play ranked against lets say Gold 2 dvi 4 Gold 4 div 3. BUT u're gonna play against grand champion with brozne..why not..OR u just get 12 divisions ""better"" opponenst just because...well i don't know why...Ban System Ban system is bull_s_h_i_t. U can get ban from matchmaking just because server crashed. YEA what a great idea psyonix! In game reports have no point. We don't know if it's working but it looks like not. There no way to meet so toxic people all the time.Server As i said servers crash a lot. That's not all. Servers are beeing shut down in main play time. About 8 p.m. for 30 40 minutes. Not every time but once or twice every 2 weeks. WHY? Well...they probably don't want do maintenance at night or in the morning when almost nobody play it.Physics Well physics sucks. It's getting worst every single update.Psyonix support + bugs.That's (not) funny part. If u report some1 after match u can choose between two buttons. ""Mute all"" and ""Mute all"". Originaly That was only 1 button with this text and it muted all players + there was a button called ""BACK"". This BUG is there fot 8 months. WHAT? Thas a simple bug that can be remove in 5 minutes.Supprt. Well that's a name for psyonix robot that send u in little different way to fuc* yourself. You can sendi replays with cheaters in hope u get your rank back you can report bug but all for nothing. And after 3 tickets they ban u on support. LOLI thing rocket league was fun for a while. Playing with (and only with) friends can be still fun but... no worth it.PS. U can get ban from matchmaking even if your teamate leave game (or just lost connection).

2018-07-14,0,0,333,False,Recommended,"What is Rocket League? Rocket League is a soccer game with cars... and MOTHERLOVING ROCKET ENGINES! That's right. Rocket engines.The standard game mode looks like this You (can) jump with your car to try to shoot an oversized ball into the opposing team's goal while also defending yours. You pick up boost by driving over boost pads which are spread across the field. Rocket League features many different maps cars and items to customize your car and bring some fashion to the playing field. The standard mode can be played 1vs1 2vs2 3vs3 and 4vs4. You can play competitively 1vs1 2vs2 and 3vs3. 2vs2s and 3vs3s can also be played with a friend!BUT There are also other non competitive modes such as Dropshot (3vs3) The map is split in half and you have to ""charge up"" the ball and let it touch the enemy field which will damage it and after two hits destroy it. The enemy can prevent this by ""counter charging"" the ball which will make it dangerous for your field. The objective is to create a hole in the enemy field and shoot the ball through it to score a goal. Basketball (2vs) It works just like in real llife. Try to shoot the ball into the enemy hoop and defend yours. Sounds easy right? Ice Hockey (3vs3) Pretty much the standard game mode but of course you're playing with a puck and since there's ice everywhere the damn thing will slide endlessly. Rumble (3vs3) Again the standard game mode B U T with some GODDAMN P O W E R U P S. They are unbalanced unfair power ups which can provide a lot of frustration or a lot fun depending on whether or not you're on the receiving end or the little piece of that laughs his butt off while the unlucky other one gets teleported away sped up pulled away or whirled away by a tornado... I have to correct myself here it's the standard game mode with a lot more bullying... in game of course.Back to the game overall! Rocket League itself is a very fast paced game with a lot of mechanics. Those mechanics are not always needed and I don't recommend learning them if you don't want to spend too much time on this game however they will provide you with the ability to make ""dashing"" (ha) plays in different situations and will add a lot of tempo and challenge to the game.As I said you don't need to learn every single mechanic in the game to be able play it. In fact this game is very easy to learn but hard to master. The game is ""noob"" friendly but some players that you'll come across might not be but we all know and love those tryhards who will try to ruin even the funniest matches.I highly recommend this game especially if you have someone that you can play it with. And if you don't fret not! It's very easy to find other players that you can play with thanks to the in game chat and the many different quick chat commands. With them you can easily and quickly tell someone how good they played or give your team instructions and announcements. Or you can be a jerk and spam sarcasm it's up to you.Oh and there are loot boxes. Yay.Good luck and have fun playing!",Rocket League®

2018-07-04,0,0,1117,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a simple and beautiful game. With hardly anything more than an arena cars a ball and a physics engine they've managed to pull off a game that is endlessly fun and challenging. The minimal approach means the game not only has a relatively small pricetag but everything that is in the game is top quality. Whether you're an expert hitting ceiling shots or a total scrub it's still a blast and that's part of the magic of this game. Another big plus is that rocket league has the least toxic community of any online game I've ever been a part of. I get friend invites nearly every time I play (and it certainly isn't because I'm anything special).The only con I can think of is that over here in S. Korea the matchmaking can be a bit slow.

2018-07-04,0,0,138,False,Recommended,I recommend this game to anyone who likes sports games games that require on teamwork or games that require split second descision making. This game's multiplayer mode completely relies on the player's ability to work with other teammates. If you get this game expect to be training and practicing against bots for hours before going online. Unlike some other games you will need to work hard to improve your ability to do things such as hit the ball into the goal defend your goal dribble the ball or hit the ball while it's still high in the air. Even simply touching the ball with the car can be a difficult task for newer players. However once you practice enough you'll be able to play well agaisnt other players. While you can have fun matches with friends and other people online you can switch to ranked matches to play competitively agaisnt harder opponents. You can attempt to climb up the ranks in this mode but the more you win the harder your opponents get so I suggest you wait to play ranked matches until you have good control over the car and ball. Also I recommend playing with a controller instead of the mouse and keyboard. While you can adjust to the mouse and keyboard you may be at a slight disadvantage since you are using buttons to move the car instead of joysticks that give you more options for the car's movement. One example is that while you can only turn fully left or fully right on the keyboard you can decide how much you want to turn left or right with the controller's joysticks. You can still play with the mouse and keyboard but you might have a very slight disadvantage to players using controllers. This disadvandage isn't nearly large enough to decide who wins the match you're playing so don't feel you need to buy a controller to play it.,Rocket League®

2018-07-14,0,0,58,False,Recommended,lolol,Rocket League®
2016-11-25,0,0,366,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games that take a very simple concept and apply it so perfectly that it becomes a long lasting game that one can play for hours. If you re anything like me a fan of racing games and sports games Rocket League will find a special place in your heart. The premise is simple it s soccer with cars. But how Psyonix manages to make something that simple unforgettable is simply amazing. Anyone can pick up the game in play it but where the game really begins to shine is when a player starts to master the mechanics. You see there s so much more to Rocket League than just scoring. Once higher levels are reached by certain players new mechanics are used that one must master in order to keep improving. Aerials ceiling shots air dribbling half flips are just a few examples of things one must learn to get good. I have around 200 hours in Rocket League and I can only see that number building. There s surprisingly a lot of game modes to enjoy in Rocket League as well. You have your standard 3 s 2 s and solo if you enjoy any of those. In those competitive modes one plays 10 placement matches and earns a rank then they play people of the similar rank ranking either up or down depending how you play. In those modes you are free to party up with your friends but you will get matched with people similarly ranked closer to the highest ranking teammate so it s best to find friends around your level. The ranks are very spread out ranging from Bronze to Grand Champion each level with their own number (i.e. Gold 3) and each number with their own divisions. That ensures that you play people closest to your skill range. Partying up with friends in 2 s or 3 s is something fun to do and I strongly encourage it so you don t end up with teammates like me. Solo is the game mode I personally prefer though as if you lose it s your fault and if you win it s still all you. You can t be let down in solos by bad teammates but sometimes solos can get extremely frustrating if you end up with someone much better than you. Solos aren t over until the clock stops as people can score a succession of goals in a matter of seconds if you re not careful. I m currently Platinum 2 in solos and that s because I went on a really lucky win streak climbing through the ranks. Sometimes this games ranking system can be frustrating and you will win 2 or 3 in a row and only go a division up then lose one and immediately go a division down. Lastly for competitive play there is something called Solo Standard. It s 3 v 3 but no parties are allowed. Unlike CSGO playing alone isn t going to be a 45 minute investment with possibly toxic people but it s still a very frustrating 5 minutes if you get queued up with toxic players. And sometimes they are enjoyable if your team can stomp the opponent. Toxicity in this game is honestly the biggest turnoff for me. Far too often do I come across negative players who want to forfeit when we re down by 2 or give other players constructive criticism very rudely. The best way to deal with this though is to find friends so you don t get flamed by your teammates for making mistakes. A large group of people who play this game doesn t understand people can have bad games and making the person feel bad will not only ruin his game but also his experience and it will definitely put them in a worse mood. Trust me I know from experience. The other team can be toxic too. For example if you miss a save they can hit you with a quick chat saying What A Save! or something and although it s frustrating it s not really that toxic just slightly petty. If the competitive play isn t your style have no fear because the casual playlist is also amazing. It has all the competitive modes plus some fun party games. It has rumble in which everyone has a power up dropshot where you're trying to break the floor and score and even hockey. I find myself going to casual play to either warm up play with friends who are better than me and not impact their rank or play rumble which is honestly my favorite mode in the entire game. It is so much fun to get the powerups and learning what each of them does then mastering them is fun. And that s all it is fun. There s no rewards ranks or anything but it keeps drawing me back and back again because of how much fun I have in it. Casual is great for new players or to practice things you learn in a game environment against other people. The game has bots but they aren t very good at all. Lastly there s a training mode which is just that training. It has many different styles to train for and there are public made training sessions too. Rocket League is like an actual sport if you want to get better you re going to have to train and practice in training. Just playing it won t help. Car customization is another large thing this game has. You have many ways to customize your cars and unlock a base amount of items just through playing. There are more fancy items and cars through a mechanic everyone is familiar with crates. Although I will forever believe if you want a crate item just trade for it I still have items from crates and I have spent money on crates because I want the coolest car. At seasonal events you also have the chance to earn keys to open crates through playing which is really neat and I d like to see that introduced to more games. But again all these items are cosmetic only and all the cars are relatively the same other than turn radius and hitboxes and it doesn t really influence the fairness of the game so I m all for these crates. All the pros use the Octane anyways so these new cars are mainly for looks and not practical. There are also a number of DLC cars you can buy ranging from really weird cars to officially licensed Fast and Furious or Batman cars. The level of play I m at people really use all cars so if you like to spice up how you look I d say use what your heart desires. All in all Rocket League is hands down my favorite game I have ever played or owned. I would recommend this game to everyone. I have friends who hate sports and racing games and sink hours into this because although it is one of those games it s not. It s its own thing and whatever it does it does perfectly. Next time this game comes on sale pick it up but if you don t want to wait buy it full price it s still worth it. I ve never bought a game from Steam that s not on sale because I m a patient man but this is a game I honestly would pay a full $60 for.

The online multiplayer works well for the most part however newcomers might be greeted by a wall of players who are far more skilled than they are. Still that doesn t detract from the fact that playing this game with a bunch of mates is tons of fun something that will keep it alive for many years to come.Read my full review here https //www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/07/24/rocket league a ball oh boy oh boy/,Rocket League®

2016-03-17,0,0,173,False,Recommended,Rocket league! A game about hitting a ball around like soccer (or football if you're from the eastern parts of the world) has never felt so satisfying. To say the least I suggest you use a controller as this review is based off that.Rocket league is a multiplayer or a singleplayer (though i'd highly reccomend to get some friends) game in which Super Sonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars (tm) play soccer. There's no story or lore behind this game so don't expect any points to be given or taken.Gameplay Man are the controls tight and responsive. I feel myself sweating everytime that ball gets close to our team's goal. I tense up so much when even approaching the ball with the thought of 'Am I gonna miss?' running though my head. The double jumps can either make or break a goal for your enemies. I could go on but that's about it.Customization Oh gee. Cars that can perform aerials? Lame. I hear you say. But oh no. These cars ain't same they special snowflakes my boy. Make your own car and make it look sweet.Ranks Yep. It's one of those CS GO games you can do comp but no sweat you don't have to be rank 3 to begin playing comp! Jump right into that bad boy.Overall this game is just amazing and actions speak louder than words. Trust me if you buy this you will not regret the hours of fun you and your friends will have.

2016-11-20,0,0,58,False,Recommended,Product received for free. My incredibly kind friend gifted me this game for my birthday. I was very stoked to play it since another friend of mine had been playing it for a while and was very positive about it. My friend wasn't wrong in buying me this game my expectations of it were exceedingly satisfied!My first experiences with this game? Ehh.. I can't lie and say that I found the game very fun in my first couple playing hours. That's all natural though you need some time to get used to every game before you'll start liking the game a lot more (my opinion at least). And that's when I indeed started finding this game addictively fun. I'll continue by listing some personal pros and cons of this game (please note though that they're highly subjective) Pros I think the game is very accessible and friendly to every type of gaming audience. Boy or girl young or old everyone is welcomed. I think the learning curve is exactly right in terms of how steep it is. The gameplay is not too easy to master too quickly nor is it overwhelmingly hard to get the hang of. The game has a great community in the sense that only a very small part of it is toxic and almost everyone else is friendly. I definitely like some of the DLCs in this game and I don't think they're too expensive either. The RLCS on Twitch are a very fun watch and you may learn a thing or two too from watching Rocket League pros compete against each other.Cons I found that there wasn't too much cosmetic stuff to unlock for your cars when you don't have any DLCs installed. I had collected every cosmetic feature after about 35 40 (?) in game hours. The amount of gamemodes which I think the game doesn't have too much of may get boring to you after some time. My very honest opinion is that I think some of the DLC cars look far from handsome.,Rocket League®

You may think that combining cars and soccer is a bad idea but whats important is the result is a really fun easy to learn fast paced game. In no time you will be having a blast and lose track of time before you know it. Once you persuade a few friends to get it the game is even more enjoyable (if thats even possible) because laughing with friends about the goal you just scored on yourself (Oops!) is great. 10/10 Would score on myself again,Rocket League®

2018-07-05,0,0,24,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a competative game about cars and soccer. I hate soccer games but this is an exeption. Driving around and hitting a ball into a goal is such a simple concept but the way it's executed makes it so amazing. I played this so much on my xbox. They also added in more gamemodes which are all very fun especially drop shot. My only issue is that on PC you can't pan around with a mouse. Why is that? It would make so much sense but whatever you could still plug in a controller and play. Aside from that other issues would be toxicity there's enough salt to drown in! And sometimes you get silent team mates who won't co operate (probably because they had to mute everyone due to toxicity can't really blame them). In a game like this communication is key. But other than that it's a great game. Worth a buy if you can get past those flaws.,Rocket League®

2016-02-11,0,0,260,False,Recommended,Rocket League being the sleeper hit in 2015 is indeed a game that everyone should try. Very easy to learn but extremely difficult to master. If you play any sports football/basketball in particular you would have a good sense of ball physics. And they are so meticulously detailed here in this game that they are almost real. The weight of the ball and it's size compared to your puny cars is well detailed. If you have any idea of ball physics you'll be right at home with this game. PROS Many car choicesGreat car customization (with licensed cars/flags from other game/movie IPs etc.)Realistic (with just a tad of arcade) physicsMany game modes (1v1 5v5) Extremely enjoyableFast paced (edge of your seat fun)You'll sweat your hands offCross Play (PS4 PC)CONS Some players are ball hogsYou might never get a touch in a gameTrolls (any online game)Some goals won't make any senseNot a detailed hit box (more like a bread box regardless of car size)From all my playing I haven't seen the server lag but once.

This also seems like a trend with many other games I wonder what goes on in developers minds they actually think it's fun or is it just a reminiscence of their youth when the match making in gym class would always put them in the ""not so sporty"" bunch and they are trying to turn the table now?",Rocket League®

2016-02-12,0,0,289,False,Recommended,"I don't play soccer I don't watch soccer but boy do I love Rocket League. Rocket League is about as close to soccer as NBA Jam is to basketball or NFL Blitz is to football. It's a very entertaining mix of rocket cars and exploding giant (beach?) balls that is just quick enough to leave you wanting more. It's a brilliant game for jumping in to burn 5 minutes until you realize it has been over an hour since you started. The game's offline mode is decent but might mature to be better over time. There's a lot of modes to play offline with splitscreen and a simple 2v2 is pretty zany as far as spectacle and competitiveness go. I wish the ""season"" mode would have more substace to it since it doesn't really matter which team you pick at the start. I like the playoff system that's built in for the season mode though.The online multiplayer is where the game's meat is. The casual modes are very quick to get into (since usually someone is guaranteed to leave as soon as their team is down a score) but it seems like the skill distributions are all over the place. The odd time you do get a close game though it is a fun time indeed. The competitive playlists of multiplayer feel like a work in progress. It feels like their matchmaking algorithm isn't super mature yet and still follows the same progression of either blowing the other team out or getting blown out and somewhat infrequently having a close match.Overall the game is probably the best sports game I've played since NFL Blitz. It's probably my favorite splitscreen game on steam and has a bright future ahead of it.",Rocket League®

2017-02-18,0,0,1374,False,Recommended,If you are interested in buying Rocket League you may as well go to your living room where you store your consoles grab all of your sports games disc by disc and snap them in half. You no longer need them. Aside from Role playing as some sports legend in a real sport (lol) there isn't a feeling any of those games will give you that RL won't give you a checkbox it won't check or a sports like itch that it won't scratch. Rocket League is rocket car soccer with a skill ceiling higher than you're mom was in the 60's. Go from being a derpy driver flipping goals into his own net or crashing hilariously into his own teammates to a high flying bat car air dribbling balls from one end of the dome to the other without ever touching the ground dunking on kids in glorious fashion. No computer AI to blame or feel cheated by Just you and whatever random human being(s) the game decides to let you carry or be carried by. If you're looking for a competitive skill based game that generates desk flipping excitement or rage every single game and generates more clutch moments then driving a standard in rush hour then rocket league is definitely the game to make you foresake all others.,Rocket League®

2018-08-22,0,0,47,False,Recommended,I bought Rocket League out of pure curiosity and interest in the gameplay it offers. I wasn't into it all that much until i went over to my friends house who loved it. We ended up playing together for 6 hours that night and i finally started playing the game more. The cool exploits that make it feel like Melee and the Cooperative play that makes it feel alot more like a Strategy game ultimately form the perfect experience. I give this game a 4.5/5 and the missing .5 is due to the lack of things to look forward to when playing the game for long periods of time similar to the limited time SARPBC 10th anniversary event where you could collect credits to buy items. I hope this review has encouraged you to buy the game or at the very least entertained you.,Rocket League®

2015-07-09,0,0,174,False,Recommended,This game is one of the most innovative new IPs I've played in a long time. It's fairly easy to learn and really addictive once you start getting good. There's a lot of customization options for your cars online and 2v2 doubles is the way to go. Get a friend and rek people online and I could play for hours. If you don't have internet or when 100 000 people were on today and the servers crash this game has basically what $60 AAA games have Season Mode. Create your own team pick the cars the colors and battle in 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 in 5 minute car football for a certain period of weeks and become the car football champion or whatever.

You can hop in and go for a 5 minute match or trying to better your skills and be the best in its competitive mode. Rocket League also offers several game modes in case you get bored of the main one or you prefer different setups which is a nice edition to keep the game fresh and entertaining.I highly recommend it to everyone as it s a fun experience whether you re playing alone or with friends and there s no need to be a sports or cars fan to enjoy it.

But I have played this game a bit on PC and I can say that the 8 hours I've put into the PC release have been very enjoyable. This is a very well made game no questions asked. If you enjoy racing games or sports games at all I heavily suggest that you buy this game.

2017-12-30,0,0,286,False,Recommended,I evermore prefer games that are fast paced depend on your response time and have no story in general. 'Rocket League' is a perfectly derived game fitting my standards. Unlike different games this game is absolutely unprecedented in its class. The game has linked the epicness of soccer and the momentum of driving into a union unreservedly thought to be too entertaining.During the game you can be capable of accomplishing some 'Epic saves' as situated in the game Just in time so you can perform some goals by striking in some aerials.Apart from that The game has 100+ items to accumulate and trade with other people. There are seven rarity classes. Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Import Exotic and the most remarkable Black Market.There is also a competitive mode where you can rank up. There are six ranks. Bronze Silver Gold Platinum Diamond Champion and Grand Champion. All of these except Grand Champion have three divisions.With constant updates and awesome gameplay I will break down Rocket League as Items 10/10Playability 10/10Gameplay 10/10Price 10/10DLC 10/10Tricks 10/10I will give Rocket League a TitanScore of 10/10!This game is a TitanElectrons Certified Epic!,Rocket League®

2015-07-08,0,0,6,False,Recommended,For what it is right now this game isn't worth 20$. The game doesn't have enough single player modes and the matchmaking is completly broken. They should add a notificatication saying they are having issues or add an ETA on when the game is going to be fixed because right now its not even worth loading up. If you have a ton of friends on steam you can do private matches and get something out of the game. I reccomend everybody else stay away.Update Matchmaking is working now! I'm getting matches quickly and the game is pretty fun. Everything you do in the game unlocks cosmetic features and the game has a couple different training modes that are pretty good.,Rocket League®
2015-07-10,0,0,94,False,Recommended,Im going to start off by saying that although I have very few hours put into this game it is incredible.

Anyhow I think that is the only con I can think of. This is a game that will hopefully become the next csgo (in its own way) but I can not stress how AMAZING this game is.

Your car will be on track to score the winning goal and suddenly swerve to the side without any input from you costing the game. If you intend to play online wait for a sale because paying $20 for the servers is NOT worth it. Otherwise great game.,Rocket League®
2018-06-09,0,0,311,False,Recommended,The game is great and fun the community is awesome as well. The game takes time to learn with the skill capabilities of the player base getting higher and higher. Rocket League is proven to be a successful game as time passes.However when it comes to new updates new bugs and problems come up without any fix. Take the latest update 'Salty Shores' for example. The new map is not properly optimized causing crashes and even causing lag and frame loss to players with a not too powerful computer as compared to other maps which runs smoothly.As for recommendation most players nowadays are hardcore players the casual or new players are often found to be helpless against them. If you think you are up for the challenge to learn the skills and have the capabilities and a capable computer and internet this might be the game for you as this is a skill based game. If you are mostly a player who plays game for fun and not take things too seriously it might not be for you as things can get quite annoying especially when just starting,Rocket League®

2016-01-31,0,0,70,False,Recommended,"This game is so simple to learn and almost impossible to master. Thats why its so addicting!.. That being said there are definitely features that are missing such as saving custom cars in your garage and switching cars after a match without having to exit to the main menu. For a game so focused on cars this seems like a huge hole in the design. I hope that they will fix this with a patch soon. Also it seems that the smaller cars (mostly DLC) are not good alternatives to the larger cars such as the MERC due to the fact that its harder to hit the ball. Some stats for each car would be nice. Allowing the cars to be upgraded would be a huge boost to the replayability as well. Now you can upgrade aesthtetic featrues such as wheels and boost type but theres no differece to the performance. If there were like 4 different ""classes' to choose from such as 'Speed' 'handling' ball control or 'goalie' it would add so much more depth to this game. Lastly whats the deal with no online season play!? such a huge missed opportunity there! So as a recap.... Show us the stats of the cars and allow us so save and manage our custom cars with the ability to switch them after each round so that we can continue playing agaisnt current opponent in unranked matchmaking AND look into adding a class based system that would allow players to choose a buff that has its advantages and disadvantages.

2018-08-16,0,0,1301,False,Not Recommended,"Well there's a lot to tell about this game. According to the played hours I might suggest it. I really like the concept and playing with your friends is just fun. I've been playing more or less active since the beta. The game evolved in many ways since back then. But at the moment the game and ranked matches become more and more unplayable. The community is led by toxic 12 yo kids.Back then in the beginning people would try to figure out how to do stuff and learn moves that are the basics nowadays. It was exciting and fun. There was rarely someone spamming the quickchat with ""Wow"" and ""OMG"" in a penetrative manner. Those people somehow copulated and evolved into flaming on regular chat guys. Afterwards they would just vote for a forfeit if you do a single mistake that leads to the 2 0 for the opponent even tho there is more than 4 minutes left on the clock. Nowadays people instantly vote to forfeit after the very first goal just to show that that goal wasnt their fault and they wanna feel superior. But currently it gets even worse. Despite the quick forfeit votes or the ragequits the people that did the mistake rage quit from being blamed for a SINGLE mistake. This community destroys every way of playing competitive gaming. This shouldnt happen. It's just a game and people forget to enjoy it.Just to give you an insight. Ill get a daily notice that people got banned thanks to my reports yet I have to report about 5 10 players for every hour I play. It's not enough and there have to be changes about the behaviour in this community otherwise I just can't recommend it to anyone.",Rocket League®

2015-08-09,0,0,371,False,Recommended,"So I first played SARPBC several months back at the suggestion from my sister and her boyfriend and while visiting them recently I played Rocket League. The first thing folks will notice is that the two games are very similar. Drive a crazy car around that can jump flip and fly (kind of) and hit a giant beach ball type object in to your opponents goal. Simple to play hard to master and a ton of fun.I can't get enough of this game. It's purely competitive and it takes skill to win. No weapons no obstacles Just a big field or pitch depending on your preferrence and a few friends or strangers trying to out score the other team. The devs are adding free maps as DLC some of which may have ramps and obstacles etc to add to the game's greatness.I mentioned above that Rocket league is simple to play and it is. Drive fast hit the ball thats it on the face of it. But as you play you'll learn how to use the cars ability to jump effectively and then figure out that a double jump will help more in some situations and even learn that a double jump with a flip will help even more and then if you can combine all those things will a rocket boost you can do some incredibly cool stuff. All cars have the same ""stats"" that is to say that there is no difference in how they play just the way they look. There are plenty of cosmetic options to vary the look of your cars all unlockable for free. It does appear that the bigger cars have an appropriatly bigger hit box but I can't confirm that for sure. Plays Best on a controller so far but the keyboard and mouse isn't too bad to use either. The game has a pretty comprehensive training mode that covers all skill levels and I would suggest utilising it. It's simple to go through but will teach some pretty important skill combinations useful in game. Every match has the potential to surprise you. One moment your team is ahead by 3 goals the next moment you're tied with 8 seconds left and it's time to do work. So you've got to either score to win in the last seconds or tie and go in to over time. Now you find yourself in perfect postition a jump with a small boost will surely send the ball straight to the opposite goal but wait your oppenent has the same plan and ""BOOM"" it's done GG.You'll have the option to play online against people or play exhibition matches against bots of varying skill levels. Rookie bots are a cake walk but the All Star bots have a very real ability to play the game. The biggest issue I see with bots is that they tend to sometimes just push the ball into their own goal. As if they can't pick a path that takes them around the ball to move it away instead. Still though great for practice or warm up games to get you going.So far the community has been for the most part friendly. There are some very useful quick chat options available right from the ol' Dpad on your controller ""Nice shot"" ""Close one"" ""defending"" ""I got it"" etc. You can hit ""T"" on your keyboard to type in game but generally there's not enough time to get a line out before the action picks back up. I've only run in to a few elitist super jerks who suggested I end my own life because I missed a few goal clears but as a human with some intelligence I decided that wasn't in my best interest and I continued to play and have fun anyway. For most people like myself who just want to play and have fun and laugh and be satisfied with some amazing shots and great replays the game's base mode is unranked competition. However for those who want to be serious and potentially endure some verbal abuse there are ranked leaderboard matches. I personally will never be an uber player it takes the fun out of the games when they become a job. That's my opinion anyway. But it's out there for both sides and frankly that's wonderful. Honestly though if this game is ever played on a E Sports level I'll probably watch matches.Aesthetically the game is richly colored and very pretty. The lighting is great and the Unreal engine just shines in it's ability to make something look great and still play smoothly. The net code is pretty solid as well at times there are some huge lag spikes and it's very clear when it happens but luckily it's not very common. I would suggest selecting the most local region though rather than just searching for matches worldwide to lessen that effect.In summary Rocket League is a load of fun not possible to get bored with there's not enough time to do so. Mostly friendly community who understand that mistakes happen and who cares anyway if you're playing unranked matches. Simple to start and tough to master but fun to bring up your skill level. Solid net code great game play in a nicely but simply detailed world. Free map DLC to keep things fresh and some paid DLC on the way but very affordable and IMO worth the money anyway to help support such great Devs. If you're in to competitive games check this out I'm sure you'll love it.",Rocket League®

The gameplay is fun and soccer with cars is perfect. The car customization is great and you have many options without having to spend any money. However it is very easy to trade for neat items like decals new cars and goal explosions. There are so many aspects to the game and there are even more modes than traditional soccer like Hoops (basketball) Hockey and Dropshot (kind of like volleyball). Updates come out at a nice rate not too frequently and not too scarcely. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.,Rocket League®

That was the best gaming decision I've had. Ever.I bought it the next day and have been playing the game ever since. I am around 40 hours in and still playing.I understand that this game is not everyone's cup of tea. I thought so too until I tried it. It's fun it's addictive it's got several game modes it's got a great community over at reddit.com/r/rocketleague and what I like the most The Devs actually care. They listen to suggestions and comments and continuously work on making this game better and more enjoyable.It's easy to get into the controls are clear and easy to remember. There's also a training mode where you can practice your moves jumps shots saves etc. Want it to get cooler? It supports CUSTOM TRAINING MODES made by other players so you have additional training options (for aerials freestyling goalkeeping and all sorts of stuff)The gameplay gives you the best combination of sport and racing and the results are hilarious. Whether you're a veteran doing amazing aerial stunts or you're a rookie struggling to hit the ball at all you will definitely enjoy being part of such a wonderful experience.This game has something that other games mostly miss out on fun! It makes me feel so good while playing it and takes me back to the time when I was a kid just getting to know Mario Kart CTR etc.And to add to all of the stuff mentioned above it supports Split Screen! How cool is that!?Pros Gameplay Attitude of the devs Community Graphics Music and sounds Adrenaline mixed with lots of fun Better soccer game than FIFA or PES Better racing game than NFS It's not UBISOFT or EA Aerials Price You can't get enough!

2016-02-19,0,0,1497,False,Recommended,So addicting! The game seems simplistic at first with not much replay value. But as you continue to play it quickly becomes clear that there is so much to learn and skill involved. I recommend using the training feature to become familiar with goal keeping airial attacks and other aspects of the game. They continue to add alternate game modes that keep things interesting I can't wait to see what they come up with next. Currently I play the game solo but I can see how it would be awesome to play with a team of friends.,Rocket League®

2016-02-19,0,0,119,False,Recommended,"I'll be honest ... I bough this game because my frind was looking for a teammate. I was not really interested but it was on sale and I had a steam gift card so I decided to buy it to play a few game with my friend and then burry the game. So I played my first game and.... oh... my... god! I never had that much fun since my childhood on my NES... I must admit that it was a huge surprise.At first the game is pretty simple to understand. ""I must hit that big ball with my car and try to aim for that big goal over there"". Easy right? Well... no it's not. You soon realize that you need to be quick and precise and you need to work with your team to score. Scoring your first goal is very rewarding. I was literrally yelling in my basement...Then you realize that if you want the edge against the other team you'll want to get to the ball first. So instead of waiting for the ball to touch the ground why not try to use that big rocket on that car to make it fly? You'll need lots of practice to master that. I'm at around 65h of gameplay at the time I write this and I still miss a lot of rocket jumps. But the feeling you'll have when you score your first aerial goal is simply exhilarating. This is one of the rare game where it gets more fun the more you play it. You play you gain skills. You gain skills you make awesome moves. You succeed awesome moves you want more skills so you play more.Don't underestimate that game... It's one of the funiest game i've played for years.",Rocket League®

2018-09-18,0,0,273,False,Recommended,This is an Interesting take on Soccer. Some people might find it odd. But then again do you really expect a game with Rocket powered cars hitting balls at 100kph+ normal? Yeah me neither.This Game is quite fast paced especially once you go up in ranks. The goal of the game(Pun not intended) is to like soccer have the most goals scored before the 5min timer runs out. You will start a few meters away from the ball on kickoff then there is a 3 second countdown then it s all for the ball. You can jump flip forward/backward/sideways for extra momentum in that direction. You also can collect boost which allows you to accelerate much much quicker. Oh and it allows you to fly. No you heard me correct. Fly. You can hit the ball in many different ways you have almost full control of your car. You can roll your car in the air flip demo other people(a very viable strategy although you may get a few hate comments)The even added a drift button(One of the least noticed features but you understand how important it is later on) There are over 40 Million different customisation options in the garage (aka No car has to look alike). Not to mention a ton of other modes that can be loads of fun Rumble. You get power ups to use to aid the ball into the goal(Or Annialate Annoying players) Dropshot. You break the floor to score with Self recharging boost ice hockey. Instead of a ball you use a Puck(In my Experience It does not obey physics even remotely)Psyonix Have also added a New Completly Orginal Totally not taken from Fortnite Which is totally not taken from PUBG Which is 100% not taken from Dota(Yeah it s a reacurring theme here) Rocket pass which allows you to unlock new Cosmetic items for you Car. Which brings me to my favourite aspect of the game. It relies SOLELY on skill Not items. Which means you do not need to pay money to be good at the game or even have a good looking car. A lot of the simple cars look the best. So the verdictPros Extremly Entertaining And Fun Requires skill not How much your willing to spend on the game to be good Fresh new updates with new arenas seasons Cars items pretty regularly. Cons Matchmaking takes ages a lot of the time If you want to be good be prepared to use all of your free time(1000+hours to get to Diamond which is Top 40 20% of players),Rocket League®

2016-11-25,0,0,1990,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT/Sep 2018 update No longer recommend the game unless you're into spending hundreds and putting in little to no effort in actually playing the game.Seems Psyonix with the new update have not only taken inspiration from a feature found in Fortnite though they have pretty much taken and disregarded the game itself as a whole in order to earn more revenue.The new ""tier"" system benefits those with deep pockets and isn't really well balanced for people that play the game without knowledge of how to trade or that play without purchasing any items in game.In my opinion this feature completely destroys the game as a whole for me as trading can be quite a substantial part of the game and therefore after nearly 2000 hours playing the game I no longer want to play this game. It feels like one of those horrible cheap cash grab games rather than the fun experience it used to be.",Rocket League®

Which is awesome so it gives all the players a fair chance. This game has cross platform support between PS4 and PC and rumoured to have Xbox One support soon. I wish there was some sort of way of telling what platform players are using whilst in a game. Not that it matters too much.

2018-06-24,0,0,308,False,Recommended,I've never been a fan of football and racing games are fun at times but Rocket League manages to combine these two genres into a funny and chaotic mess. This game is really addictive and the skill gap/depth is what makes me wanna come back every time. 5 minute matches where you either play 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4. It's like football where the difference is CARS FLYING CARS NITRO HUGE BALLS HIGH SPEED MOMENTUM CUSTOMISATION and most important WHAT A SAVE!I think this game is great and offers something different but exciting to the gaming community. They manage to balance the game and make it great with consumer friendly mtx. They reward the players with rewards from progression events and soon we get a season pass both free and paid. MM is what I play most and almost everytime with friends. New season means new rewards and the grind is fun when they add new maps and other content once in a while. I rarely play solo because I find most of the guys I play with toxic and douchy. There are many game modes to choose from. Standard hoops rocket labs snow day and so on. Personal favourite is hoops (basketball). I find it relaxing to take a break from MM and play hoops. The sound the floor makes when you slide is just eargasm. The controls feels tight and scoring an aerial is always nice. There is something new to learn every time and you notice how good players are when you reach a higher tier. Feels good to be destroyed 6 1 by skilled players knowing you can reach the same skills yourself. All in all a great game and I can't wait for what they bring next.,Rocket League®
2015-10-23,0,0,1815,False,Recommended,Where to begin? This game is a great all rounder in my opinion. It offers a very competitive experience but it's also great if you just wanna hang out with some friends and just chill. Games are pretty short so also an ideal game if you're jsut taking a short brake from studies/work etc. It also feels really rewarding if you play well (most of the time) and the feeling I get when I hit some insane shot or when a trick finally works is unlike anything I've experienced in any game though that is my experience. People are generally pretty nice safe for the occasional salty cucklord and most things are said in good fun. Trading is also great fun but very optional as it gives you no advantage other than looking awesome in replays The only thing that bugs me a bit is since I had to do a fresh install of Windows the game has been crashing a lot and I cannot join back when it happens which gives me a pentalty so I can't play for exponentially increasing times. Other than that Great game 9/10,Rocket League®

I don't care what it is I'm just looking for an excuse to give these folks more money. Also be aware that if you have multiple monitors setting up split screen games on separate screens is pretty easy. There's one small change you have to make in a config file and then you're ready to go. I play coop and competitively with my kids and we all have separate screens and it's wonderful.

Fun game and you can easily use your controller for PS4 Valve X Box and more to play. The customizations you unlock but it is very easy and random to unlcok them. Really easy controls.

2016-02-23,0,0,62,False,Recommended,"I'm normally not into sports games or anything but I picked Rocket League up during the last sale and I'm glad I did.This is one of those games that you can pick up and play very easily but also has a high skill ceiling. That means that casual and hardcore players can pick this game up and enjoy it. The matches are typically limited to 5 minutes though there are times when a match goes into overtime or ends early due to a forfeiture but those don't happen very often. So it's not one of those games that you have to invest hours and hours in to be able to be productive or enjoy yourself.As a whole the community seems to be alright. Most of the players I've been in matches with have either stuck with the ""canned"" messages or said nothing at all. I've only had 2 encounters with ""toxic"" players so far and thankfully they seem to be a minority. Granted that may change at some point in the future as I get more hours in the game but so far I've had a good experience.The physics are very good or at least very good for what you would expect out of a game where you chase a huge soccer ball around while driving a random assortment of cars. The physics of the game are also what gives it the high skill ceiling I wrote about earlier. All in all this is a very good game especially when you consider that it came from a smaller developer and I would highly recommend Rocket League to anyone who is looking for something besides MOBA's or FPS games.",Rocket League®

There are many mechanics to this game it is not just run around and hit a ball with cars. Flying is super fun and can make for some tough but beautfil shots.

2018-06-29,0,0,874,False,Recommended,This game is fun but I have a few issues with it. The ranking system needs to be seriously updated. as someone diamond nearing champ I should not have teamates unable to hit arials. (or teamates quitting after one goal). The servers could also use some work. nearly every casual server is really rough at the moment... and the competetive servers should give people the opprotunity to play competetively. Not be at the mercy of lag. All and all i highly reccomend the game it just needs a bit of work,Rocket League®

2015-07-21,0,0,202,False,Recommended,The game is very fun and has alot of potential. I am not big into soccer but the game itself made soccer into a fun game. Even short few minute matches are fun. The boost and the ability for arial moves allows the players to really perform in a new height of skill. It is similar to goofball goals in a way but a more polished and chaotic form with alot of action. Can you explode cars? Yes and it can also be a tactic Can you play both offense and defense? Yes especially with boostIs the game worth the $20? Yes and I'd even say it would even be worth $30 if that were its original price.Does the game server lag? From time to time maybe 1 out of 20 matches i find does but im looking in my own timezone.Is the game worth playing? It is competitive even if you arent competitive you will love the game and spend a lot of hours playing it.Overall I would give this game a 4.8 out of 5. It is well done and holds alot of mlg status to become a game to look out for in future mlg tournaments if it reaches to that point. It evolutionized the soccer games and it did it with cars!Feel free to check out my youtube channel in the link below for my series of Rocket League or add me on steam and play with me occasionally. https //www.youtube.com/channel/UCBEGZHUcTEqOIPayYY EH4g,Rocket League®

2018-10-09,0,0,162,False,Recommended,"When I first started hearing about Rocket League the premise tickled me. Playing soccer in cars seemed amusing so I gave it a shot *ayo!*. I goofed around with friends and had a lot of laughs but as I continued to play I unearthed what is a gem of a game. If you want a game that rewards individual skill and potential Rocket League is a goldmine. You can become so freakishly good at this game there are players who are discovering new mechanics and ways to play the game years after its release.Pros The game is entirely about technical skill and can range in extremes of completely goofy and casual to extremely hyper competitive. Anybody no matter how bad they are at the game can pick it up and fool around. If you enjoy learning and want to truly master a game Rocket League has a near infinite skill ceiling. The limits of what you can do come down to how many hours you want to practice the games mechanics and how creative you are in pushing them.When you buy Rocket League all of the gameplay itself is yours. The only items in the game are cosmetic so there is no advantage to switching things about. A stock car with a talented player can beat a car bedecked in rare cosmetics. This is always of value in a game removing the element of ""pay to win.""The sound track changes with each season and it has been persistently fantastic. The music for this game is serious A grade quality.The game has massive amounts of cosmetic options. This is always a nice bonus. It also features many additional game modes some of which are much sillier and will help separate the pros from the beginners.Training modes are available and plenty of custom training rooms have been made to prepare your skills for specific scenarios and situations. There are lots of tools to facilitate your learning even if you are playing alone.Cons The game has been out a long time. Players are very good if you are matched against a pre made team of good players it will be a real struggle. It is hard to learn when you are constantly fighting just to touch the ball. Even veterans coming back may struggle in high levels of play simply because of how the meta can evolve and give advantages to players who have kept up to date with current best practice.The game does occasionally dole out cosmetics but most of them are acquired from loot crates battle passes or micro transactions. The loot crates can also give you specific cosmetics for cars you don't have yet making them functionally useless unless you buy the car from the micro transaction store. RNG based micro transactions keep currency flowing to the company but they are not to the advantage of the consumer. Many nations around the world are reviewing RNG based purchasable rewards in gaming as a form of unregulated gambling. It's not to the advantage of the consumer. In conclusion I rate Rocket League a very solid 3/5 An average or above average game. The game is fun well designed and has lots of potential for both casual and competitive play. It's an absolute blast to play with friends and is a really unique take on traditional sports. Mechanically well designed and free of bugs I could find little to no flaw with the game itself. It would be a 4/5 a great purchase for most consumers it not for the greedy manner in which the loot crate system was designed. If gameplay is all you are concerned about this game will have earned that 4/5 for being incredibly well crafted mechanically. For the average consumer though most people want to look the way that they want if the option is available and locking customization options behind an RNG based money wall means you'll have to spend way more time or money than you were bargaining for to grind for the cosmetics you'd like.",Rocket League®
2018-10-09,0,0,308,False,Not Recommended,This was a really fun casual game. I'm not a gamer I play games for fun in my spare time after work or in between projects. However ever since season 9 when they decided to bring competitive to hockey it's been nothing but stress. No longer can you find a fun group and endless queue you're forced into new opponents each time. They've ruined a game I had spent 300+ hours in.,Rocket League®

2016-12-02,0,0,1865,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015 with ports for Xbox One macOS Linux and Nintendo Switch being released later on. In June 2016 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of 2017.Described as ""soccer but with rocket powered cars"" Rocket League has one to four players assigned to each of the two teams using rocket powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single player and multiplayer modes which can be played both locally and online including cross platform play between the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows versions as well as cross play between Xbox One Switch and Windows versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.Rocket League is a sequel to Psyonix's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars a 2008 video game for the PlayStation 3. Battle Cars received mixed reviews and was not a major success but gained a loyal fan base. Psyonix continued to support themselves through contract development work for other studios while looking to develop a sequel. Psyonix began formal development of Rocket League around 2013 refining the gameplay from Battle Cars to address criticism and fan input. Psyonix also recognized their lack of marketing from Battle Cars and engaged in both social media and promotions including offering the title as a free download for PlayStation Plus members on release to market the game.Rocket League was praised for its gameplay improvements over Battle Cars as well as its graphics and overall presentation although some criticism was directed towards the game's physics engine. The game earned a number of industry awards and saw over six million sales and 40 million players by the beginning of 2018. Rocket League has also been adopted as an eSport with professional players participating through ESL and Major League Gaming along with Psyonix hosting their own competitions through the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS).Rocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. Players control a rocket powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals in a way that resembles a soccer game with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field enabling them to quickly cross the field use the added momentum to hit the ball or ram into another player's car to destroy it in the latter case the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also use a boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can also perform quick dodges causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team. 3 Matches are typically five minutes long with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point. Matches can be played from between one on one up to four on four players as well as casual and ranked. Rocket League also includes a competitive ranked online mode where players compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons with victories or losses raising or lowering a player's rank respectively. The game includes a single player ""season"" mode with the player competing with computer controlled players. An update in December 2016 introduced ""Custom Training"" sequences that can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform players are able to specify the ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots on goal over and over.A few months after it was released Psyonix released an update that adds game modes known as ""mutators"" modifying some aspects of gameplay such as increased or decreased gravity ball size ball speed and bounciness. For the 2015 holiday season another update replaced mutator matches with an ice hockey inspired mode (called ""Snow Day"") played on an ice rink and the ball replaced with a hockey puck with different physics. Positive reception to the ice hockey mode led to it being extended for a few weeks after the holiday season. Snow Day was permanently added to the mutator settings for private matches and exhibition games on February 10 2016. ""Hoops"" a game mode based on basketball was added on April 26 2016. A separate ""Rumble"" mode which incorporates unusual power ups such as the ability to freeze the ball in place or cause a single opponent to have difficulty controlling their car was added on September 8 2016 as well as including with the update the new ""Crates"" system. An update in December 2016 known as ""Starbase ARC"" (based on Psyonix' mobile game ARC Squadron) added support for custom arenas for Windows players supported through Steam Workshop along with other new content.A new game mode Dropshot was added in a March 2017 update. It takes place on an arena without any goals and a field made of hexagonal tiles and uses a ball that becomes electrified after successful strikes or passes. Players use the ball to mark tiles on the opposing's side of the field while the ball is electrified marked tiles are then removed from the field when the electrified ball hits them or marked tiles in contact with it creating a goal for the team. Once a team scores the floor on that side resets to normal (while the floor on the scoring team's side retains any existing damage).In September 2018 Pysonix added a battle pass feature to the game known as the ""Rocket Pass"". Each pass which lasts a few months has challenges and other opportunities through playing Rocket League that allow players to increase the tier of the Pass from which new unique customization options tied to that pass can be unlocked. While the Rocket Pass is free to all players a flat cost premium one can be purchased which accelerates its level up rate.Airbourne cars above a football pitch attempting to hit a ball situated beneath themA car sits idly on a football pitch as another flies above him following an explosion at the goal postsPsyonix's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars (left) immediately preceded and inspired the development of Rocket League (right) which would make vast improvements upon Battle Cars' gameplay and online features.Psyonix had previously developed Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars in 2008 for the PlayStation 3. That title itself bore out from previous modifications that Psyonix' founder Dave Hagewood had done for Unreal Tournament 2003 by expanding out vehicle based gameplay that Epic Games had already set in place in the engine into a new game mode called Onslaught. 23 For this Hagewood was hired as a contractor by Epic for Unreal Tournament 2004 specifically for incorporating the Onslaught mode as an official part of the game. 24 Hagewood used his experience at Epic to found Psyonix. Among other contract projects Psyonix worked to try to find a way to make racing the Unreal vehicles in a physics based engine enjoyable. They had toyed with several options such as race modes or mazes but found that when they added a ball to the arena to be pushed by the vehicles they had hit upon the right formula which would become Battle Cars. 24 Further to the success was the addition of the rocket powered cars this originally was to be a simple speed boost.",Rocket League®

2018-10-16,0,0,869,False,Recommended,I like this game its very very addictive has great replayabilty and has a very wide skill level .... but .... its got worse over the years imo.One of the essential things in MP gaming is to have decent servers I can't say that Rocket league does so be prepared to rage and to be raged at whilst u cannot figure out why you randomly get really bad ping whilst ure playing some days its fine .. then the next ure screwed no matter how many time u restart ure pc &amp internet connection Initially tried to combat this by limiting the servers to the EU and then by turning cross play off .... made no difference n its only this game that in my steam list that I get connection issues with? The only fix i found is to forget about it and find another MP game on ure library in the mean time.The items that u get in game well tbh dont really matter as they have no effect on the gameplay at all.They have added a rocket pass where u can gain a whole load of items that u cannot delete or even even trade in to get a better item if u dont particularly like the ones u got ure just forced to keep them / The only trading ure gonna get any fun out of this game is if u put ure hand in ure pocket big time. Every now n then psyonix holds events where u can acutally select the items that u wish to purchase using the in game currency that is provided at that time this is great but Im finding that it just serves to remind me how bad the connectivity in the game is probably just cos im playing it more.Also more new updates have been added that include a annoying flashing big icon on the screen reminding you how badly the connectivity of the game is programmed / when ure trying to concentrate on what u are actually trying to do a big flashing light is not helpful or very user friendly u cannot turn this off / Also you cannot play dropshot/rumble/hoops/snow causually any more?? I love that you can now play it ranked but to take it away from casual is plain stupid Its had the effect of people in my party not wanting to play it as they are all at different skill lvls not being able to play it causully any more means they no longer have a enviroment to practice and get better unless they play by themselves / I hope they bring this back.Saying all that tho I keep coming back to the game as it is a very unique game sure there are a load of driving and football games out there but when u add that together its bloody good fun and a crazy mix that can give u a load of laughs. I Wish they would just invest a bit more in decent connectivity its sad to say but if they released a DLC that purely guaranteed u a decent connection every game I d probably buy it cos the game is that good! It feels like psyonix created a great product but are willing to let the money talk rather than fix the issues. At the end of the day for 15 ....... ure gonna have a blast n will deffo gonna get ure moneys worth even with all its server issues .... but if u want any of the extras ... ure gonna have to put ure hand in ure pocket and gamble it on the roulette or spend hrs on trading forums.,Rocket League®

And then ofcourse the community... just skip the trollers/toxic people who think that they are RLCS(esports) players and consider themselves being a god. For the rest are the people you meet mostly nice and kind and give you compliments when you give them a nice assist or you make a goal yourself and someone says 'Nice shot!'

The one and only problem has been playing with PS4 players. Not because that they would be annoying (they aren't really) but because it's not possible to create a party where both PC and PS4 players could join. So dear creators of Rocket League could you possibly add something like a ""Join Party"" option in the next update and with that option the players from different devices could join eachother's parties with a party number or something like that so it would be possible to play in online matches together. Besides that I would rate this game 5/5 because of the insane action great graphics and gameplay and because of having fun with friends in a way that can't be reached in real life social occasions.Please buy this game.

2015-07-22,0,0,158,False,Recommended,Rocket League is where elegant design is combined with an engaging theme resulting in a terrific gaming experience. The rules objectives and controls are simple enough for almost anyone to pick up very quickly. However due to the physics at play there is a surprising amount of depth to the maneuvers you can pull off using just the core set of moves (jump boost powerslide). Also like any good sport game positioning and awareness are key components that players can expore and practice with as they progress in experience. The theme is the icing on the gameplay cake. The bright colors and sound assets (roar of the stadium) further elevate the bombastic gameplay into something that will have your adrenaline pumping throughout the game. I haven't played a game in a while that has made me cheer out loud the way this game can (I'm sure my neighbors appreciate that). I recommend this game highly and will also be picking up the console version when it comes out.,Rocket League®
2015-07-22,0,0,74,False,Recommended,This game is Perfect in almost every aspect. Basically MicroMachines on crack and sweet adrenaline.This game iw what separates boys from men. Cons servers aren't the best at times unbalanced teams... as a result of it unpunished leavers. (tho the game rejoins random players midgame) crashes... tho game loads very quickly and quetimes are very short.I myself am guilty of leaving matches but only due to AFK rs DC ers or at times I get a guy who just doesn't know how to turn around and goes backwards like 80% of the match.Or the guy who thinks that you absolutely must hit the ball and it doesn't matter which direciton even your own goal does not stop his abition of actually hitting it.Got em!!!Coregameplay is without a fault competitive difficult flashy and sexy.,Rocket League®

2015-08-13,0,0,85,False,Recommended,I love this game it's so much fun to play. I love playing 2v2! 3v3 and up is kind of chaotic more like bumper cars at that point. LOL I really like how each car has a different hitbox and even a bit of a speed difference. You can also make your very own unique looking car. Many different colors and accessories to choose from!There are some nice players out there but it feels like a majority of the people playing are jerks with a 12 year old mentality. If that's something that makes you upset I suggest you mute voice chat and maybe even disable text chat lol.Also players from both teams can hear voice chat it's not only your team.The new content and DLC was a nice expansion to the game however the new field is too bright and colorful it's too busy for my eyes. The new cars are also nice which is part of the DLC. They are not too different from already existing cars so if you did not get the DLC you are not at any disadvantage.,Rocket League®

2017-06-17,0,0,714,False,Recommended,This somewhat 3d game is a phenomenon. Went thought the tutorial. Did about training up to pro most of it. Did look at the community training custom programs. Still need miles to go before I get consistent. I will say this playing the AI is strange. They can be so instructive if you look at the replays and the in game strategies the AI (computer uses) Right now I have the Pro difficulty setting and in Soccar the AI can be more of a hindrance than help. Sometime my own team will keep me from scoring or hit a goal for the other team.(Perhaps too many AI calcutions if more than 2plyr teams) In 2plyr games sometimes they improve for example in Hoops the other team will do a rotating charge near my teams hoop each cpu or AI taking a turn at the ball. They know how to keep the ball near our hoop. On the replays you can see just how the AI made the miracle shot and try to remember the positioning and movement and boost used. I have a tough time angling and boosting plus jumping or double jumping still practicing.Well Rocket League is a fun game. Some persons vary in how much fun they want to have playing. There are options for creatiing or starting a game and customize a team if such is our tendencies. On a side note If there was really a giant Soccer ball or Hockey puck would the giant Soccer ball be so floaty or the Hockey puck not ever stand on its side?,Rocket League®

The game has awesome graphics fun to play and even more fun to play if you got some friends to play with.But there are some things that makes the Rocket League experience worse. Matchmaking When I first started playing Rocket League of course I was a rookie and when I first queued up for an online match i got matched up with a VETERAN which is like 3 ranks above me. And obviously i got beaten up like a pulp. This should definetly be fixed. Lag without connection problems The connection problems that occur sometimes are quite annoying because you could miss a shot and ruin the whole match (This is not my Internet Sometimes you can be conncted to random servers such as SA resulting in high ping) REMOVE STARBASE ARC FROM COMPETITIVE,Rocket League®

2015-08-11,0,0,438,False,Recommended,"The game is a ton of fun. I gve it a 8/10 for competitive match type games. Rocket League is one of the few games I can open up and know without a doubt I will enjoy however long I spend in the game. This includes winning or losing granted I HATE losing but still the game is action packed and it's hard to not have fun even if you get irritated along the way more than a few times. I would make demolition ""kills"" last longer. Not too long but right now there is no real benefit to demolishing an opponent they spawn rather quickly and of no consequence. Either don't allow it or make it have some kind of consequence make players have to keep their eye open for possible incoming in hopes of avoiding it. The only time it really benefits you is when you hit the goalie and the ball is already right on their goal.Otherwise a super fun game. Mostly playing Ranked right now reached platinum so far in standard 3v3. I definitely reccomend it even with the things I would change.I do wish they would have kept the different shaped arenas. Outside of the one with two different level fields that one sucked. The others were pretty cool and I wish they would implement more interesting fields and arenas.",Rocket League®

You don't even have to watch football to understand this game. One simple goal get the ball into the net. No problems whatsoever even with the DLC rumoured to having some. It's fun enough to be playing alone with other people online or just trying out the Season (basically a long tournament against A.I).

It's a daily play for me and there are only a few other games I have that I've even come close to dedicating as much time into as this game. Which is why it kills me that since the most recent update my connection has been beyond terrible. Not sure if anyone else has had the same kind of issues but it's making it to where I can't even enjoy unranked. The game is quality there's no doubt about it. But I don't know what's changed to make it completely unplayable for me I've never had connection issues like this before..and it just seems coincidental it happened with the most recent update. Hope it gets resolved soon. I'll do some research on my end as well.,Rocket League®

2015-07-25,0,0,154,False,Recommended,"You know a game is good when you can spend an entire day playing it without even realizing how much time has passed. This is one of those games. Rocket League is a textbook example of ""Nailing It"" when it comes to making a great game The game's premise is easy to understand. (It's football with cars. End of story.) Gameplay is simple but still offers a challenge for casual and hardcore gamers alike. You can personalize your game experience via car customization. Visuals and audio are spot on and give plenty of atmosphere to the game. There are multiple ways to play the game all equally effective and fun. The controls are flawless. Watching others play the game is just as fun as playing it yourself. Even a brand new player can pull off some amazing shots. The game makes everyone feel like a pro.Long story short Rocket League in my eyes is a game that will stand the test of time going forward. While other games may falter and lose popularity simple addictive competitive games such as this will always be fun to come back to and will always have replay value.This game is worth every penny of its price tag.",Rocket League®

2015-08-11,0,0,80,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games that's easy to learn but difficult to master. You're basically using RC cars to play soccer. But the rules about dangerous play go out the window as you can demolish other cars knock each other out of the way when making a play and also drive up onto the stadium wall to make a perfect aerial shot into the goal. On the surface the game is easy but with difficult advanced mechanics you could spend hours just practicing aerials alone and still miss the ball a lot. Group up with some friends for some 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 action that just gets even more awesome when you play as a team. With lots of free content already included and some paid DLC on the way Rocket League promises more fun to come in the forseeable future!,Rocket League®

This game is great!This game all around is amazing and I figured I should give it a better review.I've played this game well over 600hrs or more. I bought it on all 3 platforms PC/Xbox One/PS4. If that doesn't scream this game is amazing I don't know what will. Haha Pros There is no unbalanced z like in other games. There is no lag if you go into the right server. (Your region.) DLC does not give ANY advantage what so ever. Microtransactions are purely cosmetic. (Very nice items btw but I'm VERY unlucky.) Ranking System is decent. Physics are spot on for this game. Gameplay is incredibly fun.It does have a steep learning curve but it's not that hard.People can do some incredible shiz on this game!!! Cons There always seems to be some sort of leprechaun giving luck to the enemy team... That's it there's no bugs or anything anymore.BUY THE GAME 10/10,Rocket League®

Put the ball in their net more time then they put the ball in yours in 5 minutes but the level of control you can get to is insane. I first was exposed to this series when Northernlion and Baertaffy did a small youtube series just playinng the game and I thought ""wow this game has a really large skill cap. Im deffinatly interested."" I got the game and started getting smashed by all star bots. Then I seen the Kronovi beta montage and my mind was blown. I thought that was the skill ceiling how could you stop someone like that? I look back at that montage now and it isn't remotely impressive to me anymore. The community is constantly getting better and the skill range continues to grow. I am ranked diamond 2/3 and people are saying that diamond 3/champ1 is around the skill level that pro's were in the first RLCS season. Playing rocketleauge has been a journy to constantly get better and add something new to my skill set. If you are a competitive person I can not recommend this game enough.",Rocket League®

One piece of advice when starting the game for the first time a message will popup saying ""Playing with a controller will allow you to enjoy the best experience"" and they weren't kidding. I've tried playing with a keyboard and mouse and while it is playable (it is a known fact that it is easier to juggle with bears while driving a unicycle through a burning hoop than playing Rocket League with mouse and keyboard) you get your bottom kicked if you don't play with a controller (luckly I have one).",Rocket League®

2018-05-18,0,0,510,False,Recommended,This is my favorite game of all time. It's absolutely fantastic. It's the only game that truley resembles sports and you control every single thing about the game not like Madden where you just press a button and pass the ball it's a physics based game. It's very challenging to master and it takes a long time. But it's worth it. A good competitive game of Rocket League is extremely fun and no matter how long i play it never gets old. Whether you are competetive or casual this will apeal to you. The price is also way lower than the value and the hilarious moments with my friends and overall just fun i've had it was far past worth it. If you like games I recommend this. (Unless maybe you absolutely must have a story) It has great graphics a great concept super cheap not super hard to run and has a big cosmetic trading market and community ontop of the gameplay. If you're like me and you like replayable games that don't need a story you'll especially love it. If you have friends on console they are also adding cross platform parties i believe in july of 2018. Sometimes it can have some pretty annoying bugs but that's usually not a big deal. Overall this is a great fun game that can be played by anyone and enjoyed by anyone. I highly recommend it.,Rocket League®

2016-11-21,0,0,729,False,Recommended,My Rocket League ReviewWho is Rocket League suitable for?EVERYONE. Age or skill range doesn t matter. Tons of fun to be had for anyone. There are not a lot of games out there that can say the same. Game Modes?There are tons of game modes tailored to your preferred playing experience. Wanna play with a couple of friends? Play competitive 3v3 or 2v2 and hone your skills. Wanna play alone? Play 1v1 or competitive solo standard (3v3). A mode where it only pairs you up with solo queued players. There are other more obscure game modes like 4v4 Snow Day (Hockey) Hoops (Basketball) Rumble (Power Up mode) Dropshot (Watch gameplay). Is the Matchmaking any good?Yes. 99.99% of the time will be paired up with someone of the same skill level. Are the Servers any good?Yes. I have only experienced two directly server related issues so far. Community8 out of 10 times you re gonna have good teammates and opponents. The other two will be really toxic. It sucks but its expected in a competitive game like this. Obviously the toxicity levels will vary. (Side note Its nothing like CS GO or League of Legends)Graphics Potato Very bad Bad OK Good Excellent RevolutionaryWhen is it worth it?

Matchmaking is pretty good but forget having a friend play in your account if you ever get too high they'll get constantly pummeled online and there's no way to reset your (invisible) rating.

2015-08-28,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Although this game is great fun and a blast with friends it's lacking. There are only a couple of maps and it's not like different cars have their own unique stats/abilitys. Wheels paint and anything unlockable provides no help in success. Not even the DLC provides enough for the price it's worth at. Although people might say that if different cars did have unique stats then it would be unfair I still want to see some redeeming qualitys of unlocking things. But If the game is on sale and you have some friends to play with I recommend it.,Rocket League®

2015-08-28,0,0,26,False,Recommended,What can I say about a game that I started out despising? Was it the fact that I feel the game should have been named differently? Sure... I still think Soccar would be the ultimate name for this game this however does not detract from the amazing enjoyment this game has provided.There is only a slight con and this is that on some occasions there exists lag online that can be frustrating. This however is not a major factor as it seems to be rare that it occurs (for me at least).Having played it on PS4 and PC I can say that Rocket League provices moments of immense pressure white knuckle fights that bare down to the very last second only to end in supreme victory or gut wrenching defeat.The community for the most part is great! The action is non stop and the level of enjoyment is one that is higher than most games I have spent $60 on. Customize your cars play with friends and enjoy the madness that is Rocket League...

2015-08-28,0,0,758,False,Recommended,One of the most addicting games in the last 5 years. Easy to pick up learn how to play and play online offline or split screen with you friends.Works GREAT via LAN in the same room communicating with a team of 3. Learn to Fly to hit those HIGH bounces or knock a goal into the net from across the map. Maybe you like to be a goalie and get game saving blocks and turn them into a quick score while the other team is trying to overpower your goal.This is a arcade meets strategy and AWESOME cars. ROCKET is the name. Collect boost to increase your chances for a HARD hit and blow up your oppenents. CARS isn't in the name but it should be. This game could easily be called ROCKET CARS because they are so damn fun to drive once you get used to them. Flips spins bicycle kicks and flying....This game has it all.,Rocket League®

2017-06-19,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,Still dont recommend the game because of the lack of answers to help the people who buys the game. I got mine to work now by opening Bitdefender and adding rocket leauge exe file to accepted list. Rocket leauge is the only game i have had to do this for. But its something they should tell people who buys the game. That they manually have to go in through antivirus and set it to accept.(earlier review)I would not recommend this game right now. Not until they have fixed the problem for people that is 1. cant even start the freaking game2. Couldnt autosave and you loose all lvls items etc.I wrote a post asking for help in the bug report where they have witten a post about how to fix the problem. And even though lots of people tried this it doesnt work. There are new updates for the game but I havent had an update fixing this problem yet. So therefore I dont recommend you playing buying the game. You dont want to build up and loose all of your things over and over again. I will update this post when I see a change or when they have fixed the problems.Do not buy it. Wasted money right now for the people who it doesnt work for.,Rocket League®

Never was a fan of football or racing games but this baby of those two genres got something in it something special you can't really tell what but it works!It's fun it's entertaining. Easy to pick f.cking hard to master.The only problem which is unfortunately a big one is the matchmaking.. It's just bad it puts you 40% of times with against better players another 40% of the times with beginners... and in the rest you can play a decent game.Update matchmaking is seriously f.cked up. devs should be punished by an anal double penetration.,Rocket League®

The game is simple. You're playing soccer in rocket powered cars in a variety of formats 3v3 being standard. The matches take 5 minutes which is really nice for just jumping in when you have a bit of free time. Matchmaking generally takes under a minute so the action can keep rolling.I like the communication system in this game. You have access to a quick menu of handy messages to sling out to everyone in the game or just your teammates. You also have the choice to use voice communitcation but thankfully it dosen't seem to be used very much.This game is insanely fun.,Rocket League®

2015-10-13,0,0,855,False,Recommended,The best $20.00 you will ever spend on a game. I got it for PS4 first when it was free I later bought it for PC to play with other friends without hesitation because the devs deserve the support for this beautiful demonstration of how UE4 was really meant to be used! Hats off to them! This game is beautifuly polished with only aobut 3 major bugs from launch that are now all fixed up for the most part. Although the game is simple and quite easy to pick up you will always find yourself putting more and more time into it in attempt to master it. The thing is you will never master it. The #1 player in the world hasnt mastered it. Because behind the simple and sometimes goofy looking gameplay there is a pandoras box of skills and tricks for you to keep mastering. This game reminds what the game industry used to be all about POLISHED and UNGREEDY games with incredibly loyal devs! You need this game in your life!,Rocket League®

This game relies mostly on skill and there is a long ladder to climb. However the game has loot boxes that require keys that you need to buy to open them and get cosmetics.

You can be losing or winning a game and teammates will leave out of nowhere making it a 1v3 or 2v3 which is unfair. Smurfing when a high level players make new accounts just to destroy low ranks. Terrible servers honestly it blows my mind how good this game is but still suffers from not being polished and plagued by almost constant lag. Especially in competitive which could throw a match and kill your rank. Overall this game is amazing and you need to do yourself a favor and get it!,Rocket League®

2015-09-05,0,0,600,False,Recommended,This game is definitely worth buying. In Rocket League you get to play soccer except instead of controlling a player or a team you control a car. Each game lasts about 5 minutes maybe a little more and includes up to 4 people per team.Pros Large choice of customization options that are fully FREE Enjoyable with friends in private games Easy to learn hard to master Ranked matchmaking for those who play solo Amazing graphics and effects Season mode with botsCons Game can get repetitive Lowest graphics settings are not forgiving to those with low end computers You can figure out how to score easily against even the highest level bots so practicing against bots isn't useful Due to the highly detailed graphics you may feel the urge to flip and/or fly around with your car instead of helping your teamRating 10/10I've never been into a game this much in a while and I really hope this game gets picked up in E Sports.

I thought it was going to get old quick but once it sits right next to Dark Souls 3 for time played I knew it wasn't going to anytime soon. Most of all ping issues appear to be gone player base is large and varrying in skill and hey cross platform. Yeah I didn't even know that one at first. I regret not getting it sooner.This game is about skill timing and placement. Yeah there's pretty much nothing that tips the scale in anyones direction besides ones own skill.

I played a majority of hours solo in season mode and really enjoyed it. The second I started playing online my experience changed. Everyone just attacks the ball and hardly anyone plays smart positioning. Find a couple friends and communicate while playing and this game becomes highly addicting!

In the regular online modes you will frequently come across special needs drug abusers and other slow learners which don't put up much challenge or are any fun to play with.The skill ceiling is so high that the game is filled with people who are terrible at it with a small amount of decent players in the regular online modes even the ranked matches.

After loading up my pickup with as much propane as I could I found the League headquarters and proceeded to sell them as much propane as they would take. After several minutes one of the developers offered me a copy of the game. At first I denied profusely fearing being corrupted myself.

2015-10-02,0,0,114,False,Recommended,I buy and try out a lot of games and many of them get an hour or two of playtime and then get uninstalled. I've put 52 hours into this game thus far and I'm going to put 10 times that into it before I'm done. It's phenomenal. There is more joy in football in Rocket League than there is in FIFA.I don't know that I've played a game with more perfect gameplay. Everything about the play of the game from controls to driving physics to the behaviour of the ball on the pitch is dead solid perfect. The visuals are gorgeous smooth as silk and even look good on lower settings. The sound is excellent with a really killer soundtrack. I think the thing that most sells me about this game that makes me into a disciple of the church of Rocket League is the pure raw satisfaction from doing something right. Scoring a goal completing a good pass making a save executing a good defensive play working as a team it's just so completely and wonderfully satisfying.The only very small drawback isn't from the game but from a few bad apples in the community and the lack of a report feature it'd be nice to be able to remove that toxic element that I have seen forming in the multiplayer community over the past few weeks.In short buy this game. Buy it now. Then friend me and let's go get some games on. ),Rocket League®

Even though the game sometimes bugs out for me it is still quite an enjoyment to play and there are many different modes to explore. The competitive aspect of Rocket League is also quite fun however I do believe that there could be some changes to the games ranking system. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would probably give this a 9.,Rocket League®

2016-01-23,0,0,621,False,Recommended,This is the most entertaining game I have in my Steam library. It's so much fun and it's one of those games you can just play if you have a spare 10 15 minutes or if you feel like killing three hours without even realizing it's been that long. There are a lot of things to unlock and you get them very quickly (which is both good and bad). It takes a lot of hours to master all of the skills in this game and it's incredibly satisfying when you are able to use them in competitive matches. The one negative thing about this game is the connection issues. Rubberbanding and hit accuracy need improvement along with ball travel paths. Also some players can be incredibly toxic. Happens to every game that's popular unfortunately. Overall highly recommended. 11/10,Rocket League®
2017-06-30,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Combine rockets cars technology and soccer (football) and your result is this fun chaotic game.

But if you have a friend or two or even more (up to 8) this is one hell of a fun game. The music is also great not many games have music where I instantly look it up on youtube/spotify immediately.

2015-08-01,0,0,19,False,Recommended,This game is a very enjoyable game but it has its flaws like any other game. My biggest issue with this game is not the game but its players. Most players are self centered who want every goal for themselves will hit your car knocking you out of the way or in the worst case just want to hit the ball. The guys who just want to hit the ball often dont care where it go and knock it towards or in your own goal scoring a point for the other team. The guys who want every goal for themselves knock your shots away while trying to score for themselves even though IT IS GOING TO SCORE. The game is infested with these types of players. The only way that the game devs can fix it is to add the ability to talk to your team (though i fear most players are the pre pubescent people who seem to know how to satisfy my mom). Do I recommend this though? YES.**EDIT** It actually does have voice comms im just dumb and noone uses them.,Rocket League®

2017-03-12,0,0,1197,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Most people think Rocket League is just normal soccer with cars. Don't listen to them. Even the idea of cars playing soccer may seem interesting but this game didn't make into Steam's top 10 most played games for no reason.Rocket League as much as it may not seem is strategic as much as it is player skill oriented. The cars you drive don't simply drive around you can do all kind of manuevers and using the rocket powered engine and the complex car control options. Over the years the Rocket League community has uncovered many techniques that nobody even thought of (like shooting from the ceiling carrying the ball onto your car's nose mid air etc.) meaning that the game is in a constant state of progression the only limits being your own skill.In this game you can costumize your cars to an extend where you never see two cars that look the same. The game has an entire free market player oriented economy like CS GO and TF2 in case you like trading.The game sure isn't boring as far as I can tell let my hours in the game speak for themselves.,Rocket League®

2018-06-22,0,0,1247,False,Recommended,Beautifully simple mechanics but incredible depth of gameplay like any other traditional sport. The learning curve is steep the skill ceiling non existent and the feeling of improvement is extremely satisfying. It's great for playing with friends too. It's the one game I keep coming back to. One problem that I see with this game is boosting and smurfing in ranked. The game doesn't do much to discourage it which is a major flaw.Overall it's an incredible game. If you're torn over whether or not you should buy it then just buy it! I would buy this game for twice the price tag.9/10,Rocket League®

2016-06-04,0,0,26,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket League is a minimal and extremely fun game where players essentially play football with cars in a short and fast paced competition.Pros Simple and universal game play Beautiful graphics and excellent fluidity Best party game I own so far to play with friends Many modifier options to experiment different match conditions Overall friendly fair play and fun community except for the few inevitable trolls and ragers Many car customisations and arenas New game mods developped recently to add diversity to the game Fast and effective matchmaking Constant updates and improvementsCons Even though prices have gone down the price without sales feels a tad high compared to the actual content in my opinion The game really loses its sense when played solo. That just goes with the game style and isn't an actual con just bear in mind you need friends to play with or go online The game has awesome music in the lobby and loading screens that suddenly stops when you start a match. An odd choice from the developpers in my opinion you may be able to change that somehow but I just ended running my own music in the background A few odd and frustrating glitches e.g. players not being able to play when wearing uncommon hats in local mode however this should be corrected soon,Rocket League®

2015-08-02,0,0,716,False,Recommended,Six (or so) cars one oversized ball and one arena. The game basically needs no further explanation beyond that. The core gameplay is simply excellent and most matches last about seven minutes. It almost feels like it's a Garry's Mod map except a lot of care has gone into the gameplay and physics. As a result the game is still hovering near the top of the Steam charts three weeks after release despite a $20 pricetag (seemingly expensive by PC gaming standards nowadays).The concept is very simple but it's extremely well executed.

A side note before i continue on the review if you have friends this game becomes a lot more fun but it is still fun alone. I know this review is really bias but the game is just so good and there is only a few bad stuff about this game like the match making is really anoying and glitchy by telling you no servers are live but there is like 13000 live.All in all in know this review wil never be sawing by anyone and if so you will disagree with my opinion but the game is so good and i would give it a solid 9/10Mememe1930.,Rocket League®

I went from being rising star level to being unable to get into prosepect because of how garbage this new ranking system is. I won 8 of my 10 games to get a comp rank in the new season and got put in bronze 2(second lowest division possible).

It's perfect.DONT READ ITS ALL MOOT NOW13 hours inabout 4 hours were casual playThen i started ranked. Oh my god. There is NO punishment for leaving a ranked game. Enter a 3 v 3 RANKED match... let's say the opposing team scores within 30 seconds. I can GUARANTEE one of your teammates will leave before the replay of the goal is even finished. No one will come in to fill their spot. Your team will most likely lose at this point.""OK"" I originally thought ""He's getting his comeuppance. He'll be deranked quickly if he keeps that up."" Yet i've played match after match again and again regardless of if its my team scoring first or theirs. Someone will always quit. ""can't be worse than this"" I reason.oh but it can. It really can.Wait until TWO opponents/teammates leave. 1 vs 3.. within the first 60 seconds of a RANKED game that lasts for 5 minutes. It's not fun for either side.So I thought ""OK 2 v 2 must be pretty intense then. At least in 3 v 3 you have a (slight) chance of still winning if one of your teammates es out. They must have more respect in a 2 v 2 then right?""Nope.2 v 2 is even worse.I've had to play MANY 1 v 2 games. It's horrible. Why even create the ""RANKED"" gameplay if there is no punishment for quitting a match early? There's no loss in your overall ""rank""! The worst part... I've started quitting ranked matches myself because I let an easy save into the goal or maybe I missed an easy goal. Why do I care if I quit? Why SHOULD I care? I don't. I can save myself time by quitting right now without any consequences.It's cancer. It really is. The game should implement something like CS GO where you are banned for X amount of time each match you quit. I've always ALWAYS hated people who did this type of in any game.. yet here I am slowly realizing that ""My team WILL lose so why waste my time attempting to win? I got better things to do."" so I'll quit the match.It's not a good culture to breed your game into.",Rocket League®

I have checked everything on my home network but I cannot find a cause to the problem. All my other games run fine online. The lag is so bad that the ball changes direction in flight by itself whenever it feels like it. More annoyingly I'm about to save a goal and then I lag a meter in the wrong direction and lose.

2018-08-22,0,0,74,False,Recommended,A simple concept with solid execution. Rocket League is soccer played with cars that have the ability to jump and rocket boost. Driving feels good and you have pretty good control over your car. People say this game has a toxic community but that can be completely avoided. I have great fun playing casually with my friends. As you progress your skills in this game you will realise that there is so much you can do with your car. Rocket League is a great game to play casually.,Rocket League®

2017-11-24,0,0,1675,False,Recommended,First off let me start by saying how much I love Psyonix. They are by far the best dev team I've ever seen. The game's progression from buggy and clunky to polished and refined is amazing. This game has captivated me for over 2 years and it's still going.However over the past year or so the quality of the competitive community has dropped dramatically. I've stopped playing doubles altogether because 30% of games I would get matched with a toxic and arrogant teammate and lose. It feels terrible to get into a game the you literally cannot win and it makes me want to stop playing every time it happens. Since then i've moved to standard and I know this is partially on me but teams of three just dominate and I can't find a teammate that I play more than 5 games with. And 9 times out of 10 I'm forced to mute the other team because they spam and bm which I hate because I love playing games where I can have fun with the other team while still being competitive (what rocket league used to be). This caused me to go to solo standard. It's not great I don't like the lack of coordination but you don't lose whenever you get a bad teammate and you don't face 3 stacks so I don't have a choice. I know this isn't Psyonix's fault but it's an issue in their game and they have to fix it.It truly pains me to write a negative review for this game I love so much and dedicated so much time into but I just can't recommend this game to newcomers given the current community. Psyonix make changes to th report system the matchmaking system (in regard to standard) or honestly whatever might work because I do really want to see this game return to it's former glory. EDIT THIS GAMES GOOD AGAIN I'M TRULY ENJOYING RANKED AGAIN. PLAY THIS GAME,Rocket League®

2015-08-03,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Simple to get into and difficult to master Rocket League is an absolute blast where the magic never dies (if you've got pals). While playing online match making is fun the real game starts when you're sitting in your prefered voice chat and playing with friends. The comments and dialogue you'll have will almost be as fun as the game. The only downside I really see so far is the Ranked system is TERRIBLE. While in normal games when people leave you find a replacement Ranked doesn't do that (for some odd reason) so there will be a bunch of games where you'll be faced with fighting a man or two down. Also you lose a hilarious amount of ranked points for a lose and gain very little for a win making it a tad hard to climb unless you've got a friend or two in skype or the like. All in all it's definitely worth the admission price and offers a unique and fun thrill ride that doesn't let up.,Rocket League®

2017-01-18,0,0,302,False,Not Recommended,"I have been playing this game for a wile now and posting this should help the write types of people with wanting to know more about this game. Overall the people are Horrible. Never have I seen a game with such negative and bad attitudes over the littlest things you do. Quick Commands have turned into a nightmare for bullying each other around. Example you are playing miss a save and the whole game What a Save! spamed more times than the game can even keep up with. That is nothing new. Matchmaking is one of the worst I have seen in ""Fair game"". The game dosent stick you with ""matched skill"" level players. No Instead it puts you with people 20 to 40 levels above you! New players wont stand a chance. (I know I didnt). I dont really want to say anything about the trade system other than its fine. Besides the occasional ""scam"" that everyone eventually comes across. But the game is very fun. If you as a player can look past the negative side of the game then a lot of fun can be had in this game. I would recommend this because most people can look past the neative side and wow thank god for the 20$ price tag. Other than the constant spending money for keys. When it comes down to the other reviews that have one line that say game is good its no review. If you want to play a game thats full of Smurfs and Scammers recomended but I would waste my time with it because ranked isnt even fun anymore. got demoted so many time because of all the smurfs and you cant do anything about it. I wouldent recomend this unless you have a lot of time to waste.",Rocket League®

2018-09-04,0,0,937,False,Recommended,"As you can see I have maaaaaaaaannny hours on this game.I actually bought it twice for PS4 and Steam. I have been playing I think for almost 4 years now.Pros It's easy 5 minutes games all the hype start another game. Not pay to win which is cool. If you don't put the time you don't get better. SORT OF some cars have different hit boxes but if you see which ones are mostly used are the old classics. But for shorts gitgud kid. Not too much wait on the queue unless is after an update or during holidays D Freebies after the end of a season. On the last update now you see an HP counter still need to see how the new leveling up system compares to the old one.Cons Matchmaking can be a pain. When in casual doesn't really matter we are all there for the lulz when matching for competitive it matches based on Competitive rank. I'm a Legend by now and I found myself matched with Experts and Vetarns on my side when the other team had all Legends and Rocketteers. That's not fun. Crates. Crates. Crates and more Crates. I remember the time when I used to get the odd Crate full of goodies. Now I have a bunch of decals and crap for cars I don't own or I get the same common topper countless of times. The money of my unlock keys seems wasted. I haven't received a new car in more than a year i believe same goes for new decals. Even though I would always comeback to my fav cars is good to get a new one to feel refreshed.Things I'd like to see In game full customization. I would love to be able to create my own decals In game and trade designs with other players. If you have a team create a decal that would have your team insignia D More goal animations. There's not enough u_u I think the camera settings could be a bit more ""modifiable"". After so long I noticed I would like to increase my field of view for example and I can't do it anymore. I would like to be able to like more fields to play on. I found myself stop playing in some fields because I don't have 'likes' left for new one. Don't remember how many I can like and dislike honestly. AI....oh my glob. I'd rather be missing a player than having it replaced by an AI. Their skill needs to be improved. The skill level is the same regardless of the level of the other players. Got tired of having an AI scoring in my own goal.Comments When this is not an issue of the game players. Players that don't look at their partners and leave the goal without protection u_u gooby plz also lot of players AFK it may be them having connection issues though. Another not related to the game itself. A lot of amazing players that are ranked as Rookies. Unsure the reason if they resetted the game if they got banned and had to start from scratch if they hacked it to play lower rank games and get more wins (possibly) but anyway. Don't trust the rank label. Saltyness....well...there's a lot. I ignore people but it got to a point where I had to block all comments forever. Self entitle chauvinistic egocentric morrons that verbally annoy the rest of the players. Salty winners are worse than salty losers. This is a game FFS keep your crap to yourself. I have reported MANY users don't really know how much the devs pay attention to those reports.But hey! I love this game and I would like it to see it grow bigger and bigger!",Rocket League®

2015-10-19,0,0,204,False,Recommended,"This game is fantastic if you dont have more than an hour to sit down and play a game. Each round takes 5 minutes (and some change for replays) so you're not committing to anything time wise. The gameplay is incredibly addicting mixing the best of soccer motorsports and rockets. There is seriously no better feeling than hitting a ball out of the air into the goal or making that epic save with just centimeters of the ball sticking out but even if you cant pull off those advanced maneuvers its still fun to drive around do flips and blow people up at ""supersonic"" speeds. In addition to all that this game is very pure and straightforward just like the good old days of gaming and for the price the value can not be beat by similar games. The DLC's arent totally necessary but it's a good way to show the devs your support even if you generally hate the idea of DLC's. I highly recommend this game to anyone even if you dont like soccer. Youll change your mind after a few rounds of playing I promise.",Rocket League®

2018-08-17,0,0,375,False,Recommended,So first of all I don t have too much hours on this game (on this account) in total I d guess it s over 1000 gameplay hours in total. But I ve learned much from the first day of release more techniques skills and even the reason why it s so competitive. At first it was a very VERY hard time to actually know what to do because it just throws you directly in sonde with a tutorial which you can choose to do (I never used the tutorial till now xD) and it just is a game where you have to learn the standards and grow continually yourself (Skills and reactions and also the ability to learn new mechanics) and also on how everything that is going on on the battlefield. After all I m still playing this game because there is so much competitive spirit in it and also just a fabulous game when you UNDERSTOOD everything that you d want to learn which gives motivation again.I ve repeated myself I think... xDBut the only downside of this community and game is the toxic players and trade scammers to new people. In my opinion the scammers should get sued actually because that s a crime in my eyes. After all you screw with people and sell them they didn t want for what they wanted luckily many ways got patched and refined to actually stop this process. But there are people who fall for it still.You should buy this game it has many growth potential but I warn you just try to go to YouTube and so and get social information about the game and how the community is also learn how to fight against scammers...

2016-11-28,0,0,133,False,Not Recommended,"Okay. So the gameplay is good. However as it is a primarily online game and a competitive one there are just a few issues that I have to talk about. 1 At least in the european region there are far too few players to give you fair matches. Most of the time it'll be a stomp one way or another. That or Psyonix's matchmaking system is simply terrible. Wouldn't surprise me since I've been placed in gold this season and have maintained probably some sub 20% win ratio in the following matches making me question why was I put so high only to be (not so promptly it took a long of beatings) put back down. 2 Toxicity. The dev's response to that is ""just turn off your chat lul"". People leave as soon as opponents score once only a minority of my competitive games have ended still 3v3. I don't know if Psyonix doesn't care or just can't find a way to deal with it but the community seems pretty terrible and it's a shame the devs don't crack down on it.Fun game to play with a couple of friends on a couch? Yes. But nowhere near a good online game experience. Maybe if the devs direct their attention away from adding superhero decals and flower power events and actually fix the issues with their game it would be worth playing. But they've had a long time to do this and didn't yet so don't get your hopes up.",Rocket League®

2018-03-21,0,0,821,False,Recommended,What is there left to say that hasn't been said about Rocket League yet?Rocket League initially has gotten a lot of attention due to Psyonix letting streamers promote it. The game became popular the streamers stopped playing it but the players stayed. And this is where the game has to survive on its own legs and it actually does which is why it maintains a high playerbase.I am a big fan of the racing genre I love nothing more than a proper challenge a game delivering me challenging but yet fair physics paired with the proper environment to use these physics is what makes a great Racing game for me.Rocket League has done an absolute perfect job of creating in depth physics balancing the environment around it just as perfectly.The Ball physics the cars the arena the 3 dimensional aspect of the game they are all developed to perfection in terms of balance and fairnessBefore the game you most likely already saw how good players play the game Aerials re directs dribbling you name it.Then you start playing the game yourself and you start at the very bottom try to even hit the damn ball!Once you have managed that you try to hit the ball into the direction you approximately want. Then you train yourself to not hit the ball all the time and instead only kick it when it makes sense.You can see where I am going with this there are many many many many small steps to become a better RL player each step is a fun challenge on its own once youve succeeded a step you immidiately feel the success and reward as you are now a more competent player.Once you get to a decent level the game is very fast paced hell even getting ingame is fast paced. Compare it to other Online games like League of Legends where you spend a good 10 minutes even getting into a ranked game. Rocket League takes 1 minute from starting the game on Steam to being in a match.It is a competitive game that could not be more competitive in its nature. Many other competitive games have random aspects to them they have inbalances between the 2 oppositions CSGO has 2 different starting locations and weapons MOBA's have 100+ characters not allowing one to be played twice at the same game RL gives you the exact same starting conditions every game for everyone except the car which has no major impact rather a minor one.Psyonix the developer has done a magnificent job on the game. Not only developing it but also keeping it updated. We constantly see free content updates reasonably priced DLC Psyonix truely cares about its fanbase and it is important to appreciate that as a player.The only downside I can currently think of is server instability which does sadly happen a bit more often than it should other than that there is no big downside to the game.It is not a game for every one despite its popularity. If you're somewhat interested in Racing Games if you're somewhat interested in competitive games you will not have any regrets purchasing this game.If you are not interested in either and have no friends to play it with then I won't give it a definite recommendation.Overall I give this a 9.5/10For more racing game recommendations check out my driving games curator page containing race simulators arcade racing games basically anything with cars and racing. http //store.steampowered.com/curator/9174759 Best of driving games/,Rocket League®

However I would in no way want that discourage people who are not fans of soccar or driving games. I myself am not a big fan of either sport games or driving games yet this game is an absolute blast to play. It's super easy to pick up and there is a multiude of skills to learn and master making this a great blend of fun and skill for most everyone involved. If you havent seen or herd about this game then throw a rock out onto Youtube or Twitch and I can guarantee you'll find some in game footage of this on that channel. Plenty of cosmetics and fun visual add ons help make it a fun time for all ages. 9/10. One point off for a slight problem in the match making. To go from ""Rookie"" rank to ""Semi Pro"" rank takes only a few matches while to graduate from ""Semi Pro"" to ""Pro"" takes some 6 7 hours of gameplay. Meaning there is a sizable gap of experience possible for people is the ""Semi Pro"" ranking.",Rocket League®

2015-10-22,0,0,14,False,Recommended,Look at it see them graphics? you don't normally get that for 20 bucks. the only negative i can find is sometimes bots on your team will score against themselves and effectively you that should be fixed. but if i ever find myself truely upset i jsut look around literally every stage has more detail and work put into the background than some entire games. and i mean good games not a piece of crap. this game has heaps of aethetic pleasure. i get distracted from a heated match jsut by looking aorund. stormy train station is my favorite stage it soothes me. But at the same time there is room for improvement. i think an interesting application would be a team capture the flag game where you have to keep hold of a ball or flag and it rides on top of you if you get knocked you lose the ball. time point based. would be enjoyable obviously the game is amazing on its own but this could be a good piece of DLC. granted that woul be up to those who made the game. Otherwise i have absolutely no complaints. i bought it on sale and bought for a firend for full price i would spend it again twice over if i had to at both full price.,Rocket League®
2015-08-18,0,0,33,False,Recommended,A good and fun game. A good game to play with friends.But a super big minus is the price. 20 for the game and 4 for the DLC is super overpriced.But still a recommended buy.,Rocket League®

2015-08-17,0,0,16,False,Recommended,I have played Rocket League for quite some time now and all I can say is that it's quite enjoyable. I'm not a fan of football/soccer but there is something oddly satisfying about scoring a goal. GOOD Soccer with cars Online/Offline Multiplayer Lots of players to play with or against Good songsBAD Steam Cloud is 50/50. Somtimes it works sometimes it doesn't No SEA serverI live in the Philippines and connecting to other servers usually result in me having 190+ ping Limited chatThis is an insult to the glorious PC master race!I would have to say that despite these shortcomings I still recommend Rocket League! I hope they fix the Steam Cloud issue and add some SEA servers though!,Rocket League®
2015-08-18,0,0,617,False,Recommended,"very fun well thought out game. Distinct lack of ""upgrades"" as all the variable parts of your car are cosmetic which is fair but they could have made it so that each upgrade impacted other aspects negatively so each car was still equal just in variable areas of its capability. DLC became available a lot sooner than I would have liked but the devs also released a free map to the original users so they havent forgotten where their values are in the people who paid to fund their next releases.",Rocket League®

2017-03-27,0,0,1293,False,Recommended,The only game I have ever (to this point) left a review for and the only game I haven't become sick of like I do every other game I play.The simplicity is divine the complexity satisfyingly furiating. Anybody and their dog could play this game and enjoy it.If I have one fault it is not on the game itself but the community. Very unforgiving rude and childish but I suppose we are mixing the competition that comes with sport with the toxicity that is the unconsequential mess of a masked man behind his computer. Also the servers can be slow cometimes but not game breaking usually.While it's hard to compare this to other masterclass games such as my favourite The Witcher Wild Hunt and other games of the type Rocket League is a beast in it's own right one that I would bet not too many would be dissapointed with.If you love the competition of sports and the creativity of video games this is the love child you are looking for.,Rocket League®

2016-05-04,0,0,71,False,Recommended,This is the perfect multiplayer game. The matches are 5 minutes so I can play one or two before bed or whatever or I can sink hours into playing and never get tired of it. The devs have provided an incredible amount of post launch support and free content with all dlc being aesthetic only. The PC port is awesome with plenty of options and well optimized. IT can even work with multiple players each getting their own screen from one PC (assuming you have the power.) I can't recommend this game high enough.,Rocket League®

2016-05-04,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Never too late to pick this up and play. Trust me when I tell you anyone can play this game and have a blast. Kids adults and manchildren alike will fall in love with Rocket Leagues unique charm and style.Easy to pick up difficult to master what every competitive game should be.Pitting teams of 2 to 4 vehicles against eachother think of this as NASCAR meets futbol meets Burnout. There's not a lot to say about this game that hasn't already been said. Teams start on their side of the field and try to knock the ball into the opposing teams goal using their car. Sounds boring but you'll soon see these are not your average cars. They are aerodynamic death machines with the ability to double jump. Yes the cars jump and it is fantastic.I picked this up for $9.99 but I highly reccomend it even at it's full $19.99 price tag this is easily a $29.99+ title.My only gripe with the game is I prefer a mouse and keyboard and this game simply doesn't support M+KB if you want to do arial manuvers. I do not normally enjoy driving games but this is truly a gem.,Rocket League®

Many people still play and you can still find a game in couple of seconds. Learning curve is not steap and it's casual and competitive friendly. It has couple of fun modes as well. This game is almost bug free (I never saw any bugs myself) so you won't lose game because of some bugs. Games are short (5 min) so this is great game to play when you don't have much time. Comunity is not that great but it's better than most MP games and every MP game comunity is bad so yeah. Buy this game on sale btw!!!,Rocket League®

When i first started out i was horrible but probably about 200 hours or so i was getting very decent to the point i think i can start playing in competive. i played and played this game for 3 years off and on. im working my way to 1000 hours currently because it is a fun game and alot of mechanics to learn. The server side of things... the game runs great for most pc but their servers are killer. everyplay games from ubisoft well their servers are similar but better. you will receive packet losss and latency through out your play time. its frustrating sometimes but it evenutally works itself out and you wll be abck to playing in no time. 10/10 reconmend it!ps make sure you have money for cosmetics and rocket pass so you dont look like a noob,Rocket League®

2016-01-04,0,0,266,False,Recommended,Rating 8.9/10Overview In 2015 game developer Psyonix released Rocket League. It is a vehicle/soccer hybrid video game built on the physics engine of the Unreal Engine 3. This is the sequal to Psyonix's 'Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars'. Obviously the name is the real improvement. In the game (much like futbol) players operate cars to push a ball into an opponent's goal to earn points. Every car uses a jet engine of sorts to boost and fly through the air to hit the ball.Gameplay I could never imagine operating any vehicle in a game without a gamepad. I played this game using an Xbox 360 controller which synced all controls instantly. The button configuration is perfect (in my opinion). The graphics look great for the current generation of games. The game isn't focused on realism so the graphics should follow. I think it is beautiful and runs smoothly. The game's soundtrack is all 'trance'. It adds a very upbeat and fun feel while playing the game. I have listened to the soundtrack outside of the game and it is still fun to put on while doing the chores. The game offers multiple vehicles and vehicle customization (color vinyl patterns antenna flags boost wheels etc). The modifications don't make a huge impact on gameplay but help to make every vehicle a little more unique. I personally prefer to play using a bright pink pedo van. There are several multiplayer queues to play. Duel (1v1) Doubles (2v2) Standard (3v3) Chaos (4v4) and ranked versions of each gametype as well. During the winter an update added a holiday gametype which replaced the ball with a hockey puck and an ice rink inspired arena. There is a big learning curve it becomes learning between hitting the ball hitting the ball in the right direction landing in the right direction and doing it all in the air while boosting. There is also a difference between matchmaking alone and with friends. Good tactics by working together are important to achieve a win. Usually it is balanced through ranked matchmaking. Each match has a time of 5 minutes so games are very quick and enjoyable. Even though each game is essentially the same I never feel like I am repeating each game over and over. it feels fresh and new each round.At the current time PC players are not able to queue with players from the Playstation Network but are able to connect to them randomly through matchmaking. This was a bummer because I looked forward to playing with all my friends on PS4. Microsoft announced that their version for the Xbox One would not be cross platform because they won't allow it. Price $13.99 during Winter sale. $19.99 regularly. Absolutely worth the price either way. I believe it is a must play. I would recommend getting multiple friends into it to play together.Conclusion A must play for 2015. I would recommend using a controller. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge and groups of players who enjoy a cooperative experience.Price 9 (on sale)Graphics 8Story n/aGameplay 9Controls 10Enjoyment 9Concept 9Music 8,Rocket League®

I agree with the consensus ""easy to play hard to master"" when describing this game although your first few matches will be spent learning how to hit the ball. The matchmaking is superb so you will not find yourself getting stomped by experienced players right away. This game is great to play with friends and to grind at alone. It's definitely worth the 20 bucks (the DLC is not necessary but there are a few car models and cosmetics to be had which some people may prefer).

It's team oriented skill based and is a vary basic game yet quite complex at higher levels.I've been playing this game for 2 years now and i still play almost every day.The only bad about this game is how toxic some people can be. Unlike Call of Duty (where you're 6 8 on each team) this game has 1v1 2v2 3v3 only in competitive mode. This means that you and you teammates weight a lot more in succeeding in each match. This means that if one player is playing selfishly or talks trash during the match you'll most likely lose the match. As a result this game is by far the most mental game I've ever played considering how many people can be toxic. Still one of my favorite games in recent years.,Rocket League®

The toxic type (will insult you for everything including your mom) 5. The wrong place type (play competitive even if they don't know how to play) 6. The bragger type (a bit like the toxic but on the opposing team. He'll rub your face into your bad plays) 7. The I HAVE TO TOUCH THE BALL PERMANENTLY type (self explanatory it's more dangerous to try to do plays with him than staying in def and hoping he'll score someday)Was on PS4 before. I'm kinda glad I switched (FPS/graphic wise) but the fact everyone can type quickly isn't a good thing...Some may say if I can't tolerate these guys I shouldn't play but the fact is I like the game and it's just sad that some people can't play and simply have fun.,Rocket League®

2018-03-26,0,0,95,False,Recommended,A very fun game especially to play with friends. Of course its not perfect but it has a lot of mechanics to keep it somewhat fresh. Playing alone can kind of get boring after a few matches at least for me and the time is extended if you are playing with friends. It has many mods such as rumble and hoops if you want to change things up for a bit. The devs recently added a service where you can pay for keys to open crates that you earn from matches. I normally do not like having to pay to look good in games but rocket league does this faurly well by making the rare decals really good looking and not required to play the game. They are just cosmetic. So in all this game is pretty good and is definetly worrh the money although after a while it may just collect dust in your library.,Rocket League®

2017-03-18,0,0,152,False,Recommended,A friend told me about Rocket League and I decided to play it. It is a not so massive online first person car football (in USA soccer) game in which you 3 on 3 or 2 on 2 play with and against other players. To accomodate the football like spirit cars can jump and (thusly the name) launch their jet propulsion rocket thingies.I started with the amzing full featured training modes which introduce into the secrets of RL. To be honest I just played them because it rained Achievements. Anyhow it gave me a first impression of what awaited in the actual game. There are 5 different trainings modes the tutorial in the levels novice/advanced. Here you learn basic movement goal keeper training in the levels novice/pro/ultimate madness storm training (as above) jump training (as above) freeform training only you with yourselfThen there is of course the meat the real games. So guess what you need an internet connection to play. Usually I don't do plain online games but this was fun.I played one evening with a friend in a 3 on 3 game. And the game is just this 6 people in cars in an arena with huge ball and to goals heavily crashing into each other or trying to put the ball in. Success and failure are just one mouse click/gamepad press away. Most interesting was to play with strangers while there is almost no means of communication. Oh that doesn't mean there is no chat or so. RL comes with text chat and even voice chat. But I did not use that because I already was on TeamSpeak. (TBH I sweared almost the whole time so there is no gain)But as it turned out playing RL is basically rocket science (pun intended). I use a PC and the keyboard steering is kind of unprecise. The mouse is used both as rocket and jumping starter. I for one needed to get used to it. I tried to modify the keyboard/mouse mapping but this didn't work out very well because either the mouse was to slowish or..or..or.For those who don't like to play online games there is the season mode. The name didn't really made it clear that this is a single player mode. Here you find three leagues in the difficulties easy medium pro.One thing to mention is the oversized garage where you can customize your own car. Along the way i.e. the more points you earn the more goodies you get. But there is no point in it and goodies start to amount while you probably have the same car over the whole time you play.In the end I found Rocket League a game of mixed feelings. Whily the game play is bound to be filled with adrenaline the actual results with all the jumping in the wrong place where frustrating. I guess I'd suggest to buy this game for less than 10 (dunno like $12?) but I payed 13 on steam this is available vor 20. 20 Bucks for half way frustration is perhaps a bit too much.,Rocket League®

The 5 minute matches allows you to always have a little time for one and if you get a very bad team and a frustrating match it ends before you get mad.Xbox control is nessesary but if you got more than one you can play local multiplayer and even make a local team and play online!Still the recent announcement of DLC me uneasy as the game could potentially become saturated with DLC (like what happened to payday 2 and others) PSplus players got it for free but on PC we already payed $20 so the payed DLC feels too soon. However it's only cosmetical and stadiums are released for free (let's hope it remains like this).Buy it if you like but i would reccomend wainting until there is a 4 pack or something as playing with friends is the best experience and $20 feels a little too much specially now that there WILL be DLC.,Rocket League®

2016-01-04,0,0,47,False,Recommended,This is one of the easiest to describe games ever soccer with rocket powered vehicles. This game is super fun and has become a favorite among friends and especially non gamers. Because the rules of the game are so familiar and simple it is easy for anyone to play. If you play online you will notice that the skill ceiling is very high as advanced aerial maneuvers are extremely difficult to execute reliably. But trying to pull these kind of moves off is so enjoyable that you will keep coming back and attempting them. In my experience split screen is the optimal way to enjoy this game. There is usually a lot of yelling.,Rocket League®

You're constantly victim of opponents scoring those annoying clumsy and extremely lucky goals. You always seem to be on the team doing the biggest f*ckups every time again and again... Ranked matches are used for practicing aerial hits and rocket flying them in the nets always missing the goal by miles making you look like a complete fool.. Don't even think about climbing that ladder to get your recognition as a better player your team will help you crush that dream... Team play is not applicable whatsoever and greed for goals by steeling certain goals from your teammates is a real issue in this game. Nothing goes as planned... its just one giant mess.......and I just can't wait to get home and do an all nighter again with this piece of Best fun I had since Keen Dreams...Pro's+ Only 20 euro's+ First game where lag is a good thing (seriously though servers do need a fixer upper)Con's No team play.

2015-11-22,0,0,269,False,Recommended,This is one of the best games for an affordable price. The dlcs are a bit pricy with 4 5 dollars but do not improve gameplay only visuals like cars and paints But maps are free and come no matter what. The matchmaking is very quick as well as startup by being in a game within 1 minute of startup in game. The game is like soccer except there are rocket powered cars so you can fly around the map and hit the ball into the net. Its very addictive and you can play with friends in parties so you will always be together. All cars have the same stats so there is no choosing which one is faster but some are bigger if you want to have a better chance of hitting the ball instead of accuarcy (mainly if you play goalie alot). I would reccomend this game to anyone because there is no dialoges but as always online interactions are not able to be rated so the chat is not blurred. They have also put thought into the game because there are quick chats available so you can inform your team without stopping what you are doing.,Rocket League®

2018-04-18,0,0,504,False,Recommended,Very fun and addicting. But some things should be known.After years they still have big problems with the game hitching and stuttering. The game could very well be playable on super low spec machines if they had put the effort into optimizing loading in assets/content. Crashes/bugs after each significant update are pretty common worse yet for console users because it's generally more difficult to recover from unlike a computer OS. Many people complain of lag and while I seldom suffer from those problems the game becomes very unplayable with any sort of higher latency since it's all physics based and there's no real prediction/interpolation like you'd see in shooters.Overall it's great but ultimately it's an addicting time sink like DOTA or others games in that competitive genre. You'll wonder where the hours went doing the same thing over and over. Thankfully matches are short so it's a pick up and play kind of game.,Rocket League®

2015-08-23,0,0,646,False,Recommended,Well it actually runs so it's already better than most recent AAA pc games. Maybe if you like car football because thats all it is there is only one game mode (with differing number of players) the different arenas are (as best as I can tell) purely cosmetic as are the various car modifications so gameplay is too samey for long sessions. However it's really nice to see splitscreen multiplayer on the PC and was easy to set up so we had a screen each (albeit with the score cut in the middle). This is the kinda thing that would have been a free mod back in the day but noone does anything for any reason than monetary gain these days so we should be glad it's not 60 quid however 15 for an unreal tournament mod seems steep,Rocket League®

Some of these games are unbearablely laggy and I'm located in SF CA fairly close to your servers. Sometimes i have sub 10ms ping other times it goes into 300ms. Once you've completed a game you can't see which server you're on. It's incredibly frustrating losing games because you're teleporting halfway across the map.Growing pains.

The ranking system is completely broken. One minute you're playing people who can't even hit the ball and the rest of the time its Champion levels carrying other people to get season rewards in exchange for in game items. I've had a few very good games but most of the time its obvious that there is no standard for ranking people other than wins. They really need to incorporate some other criteria. Other than that its a great game that actually gets even more fun once you learn what you're doing.,Rocket League®

2018-04-17,0,0,19,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a fun soccer game but with 1 tiny little twist It has cars! This game looks fun and is fun with it's amazing physics and gameplay. Every stadium looks incredible and every car looks better. Graphics and system requirements Rocket League's graphics simply look amazing. Every car has a diffrent shine and everything from the ball the the menus have so much detail. One draw back is that you need a medium to high pc if you want to play this game with no noticable slow down. Difficulty This game is easy to mess around and hard to master. Overall it has medium difficulty whilst playing singleplayer and with friends and is hard when playing against real people online. Game length This game is endless mainly because it is a game mostly driven by it's online but the singleplayer will take about an hour to finish. Bugs/ glitches I encountered no bugs whilst playing this game. Extra content This game has a LOT of extra content with 20 extra cars to buy. Overall Overall this game is perfect to play with friends and more fun when you play with your friends against other people. The game's main idea is creative and is pulled off perfectly.

The ranking system is a little messed up (my group of three won all 10 of our placement games winning most games by 6 or 7 goals and we got placed into Prospect 3) and Wasteland kinda sucks but I haven't had this much fun with a game in quite some time. The game being multiplayer focused is obviously better with friends but I always have a good time getting on alone and pairing up with randoms. The community isn't perfect but it is far less toxic than most other multiplayer communities such as CS GO and pretty much all MOBA communities. I am very eager to see what new content Psyonix will continue to deliver to this game. The fact that it's only $20 is a huge bonus as well.,Rocket League®

2018-01-10,0,0,913,False,Recommended,Extremely addictive game with so much to offer. The playerbase is booming ATM it's a great time to pick this game up. The game takes a very long time to get the hang of but after 200 hours the basics should be solidified into your muscle memory.Ranking System The ranking system is pretty weird but always works as a very quick way to rank up or derank. There are 3 ranks in each teir and 4 divisions in each rank. I do however get matched a lot with people way more experienced than me.Multiplayer A great way to play with your friends in either 2v2's 3v3's or 4v4's. 4v4's are however limited to casual play.Extras Training mode allows you to set up different scenarios for yourself and is a great way to get better with the mechanics of the game. Custom games can also be configured so that you can play private games with your friends these private servers allow you to set up really weird game modes and are hosted by official Psyonix servers in your region. Cross platform play is availableProblems There is a lack of alternative gamemodes. Lots of good cars are DLCs and require you to pay to access them such as the Dominus and the Batmobile. The game can be very repetative at times. No community maps can be played with friends without using mods.Overall Score 9/10Summary An overall amazing experience that offers both competetive and casual gameplay. A must buy for any hardcore competitive gamer or for people who just want to have tons of fun!,Rocket League®

2017-10-12,0,0,32,False,Recommended,First off I usually hate car games. and i especially HATE sports games. this is both and its one of the games Ive been playing the most bordering on addicted to it. (Addicted NOT because of gambling dynamics from microtransactions/lootcrates but actually from enjoying intense matches)I agree with Angry Joe that at launch it was a 9/10 but after it being out for awhile with all the changes and additions it is clearly a 10/10 now. It has the rare balance of silly and serious. You can play competitively with people design your car to look like a real car and give it realistic effects. OR you can add hats to your cars use silly decals use the Rick and Morty boost and do other silly stuff with your car. You can even download maps to bounce in a bouncy house or play in a toilet. What this game had to do right was make the progression system worthwhile (i.e. make it worth it to play games and also to unlock things BESIDES HIDING IT BEHIND LOOTBOXES/MICROTRANSACTIONS) camera angles and make it balanced where big bus cars could go against tiny 2 seater cars. And it nailed all of them completely. I haven't had this much fun leveling up in a long time. You can choose to look anywhere or to lock on the ball. also you can double jump and maneuvering does take a lot of practice. You will see people do wall jumps back flips front flips flips off of cars etc. there currently are casual and competitive matches. Casual usually runs pretty easy to moderate. Competitive is definitely for those wanting to fine tune their skills. So prepare to have fun in either kind of mode. Matches can last from 5 seconds all the way to noone scoring a single goal the entire game because each team is trying to score and just cannot get it in the goal at the right angle/each teams defense is too dang good. I literally have ended games sweating from the excitement. As for microtransactions/loot crates currently there are no microtransactions. Loot Crate like things exist but the items are cool but not THE COOLEST where you dont really need them plus I have only received one and you can even toggle off ANY mention of loot crates if you arent interested which is super rare. The items apparently fuel the esports shenanigans. I still dont like loot crates for any reason even cosmetic but Rocket League definitely doesnt shove them in your face. You cant even trade them 3rd party either and have all that corrupt jazz. I touched on it but to clarify more there are a lot of items to unlock. and they unlock randomly after a match. some matches you get stuff some you done. you may get a new car one game or a antennae topper another game or a new paint job. and none. of. them. are. locked. behind. loot. boxes. you can unlock them ALL. Except of course the new stuff that they made for the looty crate things. And its not something that you play for a few days and unlock everything. theres tons of car sounds and flags to unlock too. So even if you have unlocked all the cars theres still more stuff to unlock to customize your car and even its sound. There are options to get new cars and customizable items but that is through DLC. I too am sour about DLC but it isnt like Destiny and other games there they clearly chopped up a game to sell later. its legitimately stuff they added later and you can either buy individual cars for $1.99 or a pack for $3.99 that has 2 cars some new paint styles decals toppers and other boost things. Like one plays metal along with notes or another one is realistic nitrous. so it is still pretty cheap. They could have screwed us over and charged like $5 or more but they didnt. Its super easy to get into matches I get into matches faster on here than in Overwatch too. I would definitely reccomend this game at full price or even on sale. If it goes on sale again id gift it you a friend too.,Rocket League®

2017-10-13,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,I was really excited by the gameplay of Rocket League for the first couple of weeks I owned it but the problem for me is the over reliance on online multiplayer matches and the realization that little more is going to unfold from the game after those first couple of weeks play. How much you enjoy your online matches is going to vary considerably depending on the ability (and attitude) of the other players (opponents as well as team mates). This applies to ranked play just as much as it does to casual. The game could really benefit from better offline challenges.,Rocket League®

2018-04-21,0,0,6,False,Recommended,This game is a lot of fun in that visceral 'I'm playing soccer with cars' sort of way. It's a lot of fun the controls are intuitive and there's something intensely satisfying about flipping a car into a ball into a goal.That said the AI is probably the worst AI I've seen in a modern game. Even playing on high difficulty my AI teamates will drive the ball all the way from the opponent's goal to our own and then score a goal against us. Literally 100% of the goals scored against me in AI games were the work of my own teamates. o_o I'll say that again. 100% of all the points scored against me were because my own teamates knocked the ball in our goal.I bought the game to play offline and the AI is so bad that I find myself regretting my purchase. That being said if you're going to play online or if you're a kid and can overlook some bad computer teamates then heck yeah buy this game. You probably won't regret it.,Rocket League®

So i stopped cursing my teammates.After a while I find out that not cursing my teammates cause extra stress(furthermore headaches) and decrease my focus in matches.And now I'm in the 2nd divison of platinum 2.So in summary YOU PSYONIX AND ALL THE IN NOOB PLAYERS IN PLATINUM,Rocket League®

The ability to customize your own radio controlled car only adds to the multiple reasons why this is one of the best games around.

I mean those people who bought the game only to be s in online mode.you see them everywhere and they leak into every popular game like a cult of sadists in everly large town. This game is fine but if you play online be ready for these kinds of people. so far the only way to avoid them is to raise your rank to the top where they don't bother to go because they're too busy jacking off while off people who just want to play the game.

I usually stick to Hard as I found that the AI gives a really good challenge but they are not extremly accurate as in Pro difficulty.I love that the game gives you an option to take you couch co op team online and play against other online players. I feel this is where the game truly shines. The soundtrack is also brilliant cant never start the game without tapping to the music. The graphics is beautiful. The game is very colourful. Sometimes I just stop and watch as the grass sway to the wind. The cars look and feel great. Not much difference between the cars just that some feel slightly heavier and others a bit lighter. The customization is very good and there are a good amount of options.Once you get advanced and start playing online some matches can get a tiny bit frustrating due to lack of team communication or co operation. But most of the time matchmaking is done really well and it choses other players of the same level.I only wish we had a choice of playing unbalanced matches such as 3Vs1 or 4Vs2 for local multiplayer. Also it would be great if they added more arenas and stadiums. Some of them feel quite similar. Stadiums such as the Colosseum feels really good to play in. Having little ramps in stadiums can also provide more room for trick shots.I highly recommend this game to anyone. Its a must have game in you library!,Rocket League®

2018-04-05,0,0,752,False,Recommended,The great news is that the key ingredient in Rocket League hasn t changed a bit. The rules are simple two teams of cars drive really fast around over a dozen glossy brightly colored arenas doing fancy tricks and smashing an endlessly ricocheting oversized ball into the goal. The satisfying heart of Rocket League very much lives in that arcadey feeling of fluid and unrestricted movement. A game that s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit.But there s a golden layer of strategy and mechanical depth tucked inside the chaotic mashing of metal. Timing a somersault barrel roll or bicycle kick to connect with the ball and send it sailing at a precise angle takes notable skill. Those basics when coupled with expert teamplay and mind blowing booster powered aerial maneuvers solidify Rocket League as a game that s still just as easy to pick up with a skill ceiling that s hovering somewhere in low Earth orbit.At launch the content around that gameplay felt a little barebones. Since then though it s been substantially fleshed out with smart alternate modes that emphasize different skills and add variety. The Snow Day hockey mode substitutes a dense oversized puck for the bouncier soccer ball Hoops is a basketball variant emphasizing aerial play Dropshot is a two sided floor breaking mode and Rumble mode deals out power ups that disrupt players and influence the ball. It s all a ton of fun.And of course the competitive playlist for the traditional 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 shines as the great ladder system Rocket League was missing to bring some term goals to its pick up and play ease offering seasonal cosmetic rewards and bragging rights as you try to climb through the ranked tiers.,Rocket League®

2018-07-27,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Are...Are Rocket League reviews still relevant? Do people still look down here?The game's stupid in the best way possible. You can abuse the stupidity. Get good at being stupid. This is the only competitive game I have played that hasn't made me want to tear my eyeballs out of their sockets and break a controller because it's genuine fun and losing still means I get to play this ridiculous game which is all I really care about. The ranked community from what I've seen is fairly non toxic. I'd argue that casual play results in more upsetting losses than ranked because the way players get sorted does a good job of making sure the playing field is level so it always feels like you have a decent shot at winning. My biggest complaint with the game is casual matchmaking. It can often result in having people that seem like they gave their controller to their little brother and let him have fun. I can't complain too much because it is in the casual mode I see it not in competitive but I've come to enjoy playing competitive in this game more than casual because of it.,Rocket League®

2018-07-25,0,0,33,False,Recommended,"Only 16 hours in and while I'm not going to say ""Hurr durr it's basically soccer with cars!!!11!!"" I will say that the simplicity of this game makes it so that all you have to learn is how to use the physics engine to your advantage and that can take YEARS possibly. I used to play Rocket League on PS4 all the time and even then I thought it was fantastic. Shooting goals and scoring is SUCH a satisfying feeling it's borderline ic as you pump your arm yelling out a war cry of victory as you... bumped... a ball into... a net... Anyway did I mention that this game is fun??? *sweats nervouslyThe visuals are amazing in this game and while I do get the occasional visual lag every so often (especially on the menus) in game it's BARELY noticeable. Furthermore the smooth metallic textures are awesome. The gameplay is simple. Drive boost shoot score. Nuff' said. Master these things in a team based or 1 v 1 format and you're in for some fun. By the way EVERYONE sucks at this game. Literally anyone can play this game get into it suck and RIGHTFULLY blame the physics engine. This game was made with realistic physics in mind and granted if you suck you suck but I can guarantee it's gonna take a LOT to master the physics. Also CUSTOMIZING YOUR CARS OMG IT""SSOFREAKINGREATILOVECARCUSTOMIZINGOMG!!!!1211!Seriously and even if you lose even in ranked you get some kind of micro reward as if the game is saying ""Hey it's not so bad "" and leaving you on your merry way. Also all proceeds from the microtransactions are going towards their esports league which is fantastic. Also the premium car bodies this game has are... Amazing. I love the futuristic aesthetics this game on offer and the arenas are so much fun to drive in. Also Psyonix are constantly adding new content so they're costantly updating the game and fixing issues. I LOVE these guys. Unlike Hi Rez they actually give a damn about their games even 3 years later and the addition of new content is a great indication of that.Overall 10/10 would bump balls again",Rocket League®

2017-03-15,0,0,569,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a great game! RL is actually my first every multiplayer game. First I found the game interesting so I spent a lot of time into it. I use a Mac which is horrible for high graphic games. If you are using a mac consider at least twice before purchasing the game. You want to lower the graphic settings in order to let the game run without lag.Somethings that annoy me when I play AQUADOME LAG You will get frames lag if you play in the aquadome map. If are in Mac then you can barely play this map.Hard and bad language by the players You may think that saying inappropriate words is fine when playing a game but here in Rocket League you can actually be depressed and angry from the language that your oppenments or your teamates.Somethings that I like the most when I play this game I don't have actual friends to play rocket league with but the steam allows me to make internet friends to play Rocket League together. I am 200 hours in and I met a lot of good friends. I met only 1 teammate that used harmful language to me. I met some really helpful player from all over the world. We played together improve together and the most important have fun together. This game for me is a really relaxing game. I recommend this game!!!,Rocket League®

As of writing this the ranked games have no use but I have hopes for a future ranking system like counter strike global offensives ranking system.My only major complaint abou tthis game that has made me go crazy when ever it happens is that is season mode the bots on your team always seem to be working against you by hitting the ball in your goal or hitting it away from the other teams goal. I would steer clear of season until the team at psyonix fix the bots,Rocket League®

2015-09-06,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Ive played this game for a few hours now and i feel like im going to be able to write a good review based off first impressions and how enjoyable this game is. Rocket league is a silly concept i mean its cars playing soccer you have to admit thats pretty silly and maybe even vaguely dumb. However the developers did quite literaly everything for gameplay correctly making rocket league insanely fun. They also made a good match making system ensuring people are in evenly matched games. This is complemented by how you cant upgrade your care only the way it looks. Overall i really do like this game so let me brake it down into a pros and cons list.Pros Insanely fun gameplayCross compatible with PC and PS4No shortage of playersGreat car customizationEasy to learn hard to masterFun from the startChallenging a fun botsSteam compatable multiplayer (no other accounts required)ConsRookie bots like to kick the ball into their own goal in an attempt to interceptHORRIBLE RUBBER BANDING OH GOOD LORD (!! actually ive read up on this and its not just me many other people get it and the developers have stated they are trying to fix it. Regardless i play on servers where i get 16 20 ping and experience the worst rubber banding of my life.)Overall 9/10*!!! NOTE the rubber banding thing only happens to a small percentage of people from what ive read and with good bots its not a reason to not buy the game!,Rocket League®

Football (thats soccer for the unintelligent) and race cars a perfect match.This game is simply for competitive online players both casual and extreme disorder.The cars have loads of customisability and if this is something you like then it could be costly but for players like myself who are more than happy to use free car styles and accessories etc. Then it wont be an issue as the customisability is only a visual/ sound modifiation and theres no gameplay benefit to the puchasable upgrades which I salute the developers for too many games have fallen down the pay to win pit and I'm glad these havent.,Rocket League®

As someone who has played a considerable amount of Rocket League I can say that the only dislikes I have is that there aren't enough stats (there are some) and I think the competitive ranking system could be better (its not terible). I just don't feel quiet rewarded enough going up and down the 5 subdivisions of each rank in the ladder.

Don't play this game for the competitive matchmaking or to get into gold division or even get the Legend nametag. You have to play it for the intense gameplay that you get when you get similarly skilled opponents. This game gives an adrenaline that isn't found in many other gaming experiences. The game has its derp moments but the more you play the more you can avoid them or use them in your favor. This game I feel is at least a must try due to it's unique play and a suprisingly large learning curve. 9.5/10,Rocket League®

As said by many this is a game that is simple to learn but difficult to master. Each game is unique and even rookie players can pull off some pretty awesome moves on occasion.Matches are short and it's easy to get a quick game in or two without a huge time commitment like other multiplayer games.Graphics It's a good looking game. Very shiny...or matte if it's your preferenceAudio This game weirdly enough has a pretty good soundtrack although it's mostly only heard on the title screen.Gameplay It's simply beautiful. No really it's really simple and it's beautifulOther Thoughts You might find that you won't play it as much unless you have friends with you but that is not neccessarily the case so keep that in mind when purchasing.

There are some physics glitches (apparently mostly related to internet connectivity) but they're not usually that bad and are pretty evenly spread. The community has both people who are toxic as I can get out and people who will give you pointers if you ask (reddit has threads dedicated to it).

2017-03-23,0,0,419,False,Not Recommended,2016 Review i love this game however i can't recomend it as the matchmaking is so broken its unfair. you often go up against people alot better or worse than you which just takes the fun out of the game and not only that but it seems when ever the game is updated or reset it gets worse. so i would say leave this game untill its fixed or you might get of with this game. It just seems that the developers would rather add new items into the game for money than fix the issue and this is a common theme with most games now. overall i would rate this game 4/10 for this game breaking issue. Also i forgot to mention that the servers are also garbage to the point where you get around 100 300 ping on some matches where the game puts you against people from africa because the game can't find players closer to you so it means that comp play get unfair as the game can get unplayable due to this issue. 2017 addition The game is still broken as the developers continue to not fix server issues or infact give us proper dedicated servers instead of peer to peer as the comp side of the game isn't fair based on the poor peer to peer servers so you still get over 100 ping or more in matches which is disgraceful. they still haven't added a in game earnable currency as i have over 200 hours and nothing to show for it as you have to buy keys to open crates so yeah more in game gambling. This game sucks compared to the original game and the developers are greedy lazy bastards. THE COMMUNITY IS SO TOXIC ITS DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!,Rocket League®

2015-08-18,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Absolutely gorgeous game couldn't think of a better idea to commend this game! (Other than you being in a car playing football and being able to jump around like a ing savage and kick the ball into the other teams goal!)But yeah.. This game is heavily dependant on the controller but you can play it with keyboard and mouse too! (It's just alot harder like Dark Souls...) PROS You play football with cars. It's physics is amazing. You can do some really nice goals (Wall shots backflips frontflips tbc.) You can play Seasons Which means that you play against a number of teams till the finale. Good BOTs that will wreck you if you're not used to the game! OKish Servers from time to time! Otherwhise the servers doesn't lag at all! It's easy to create a party to play with friends only! RANKED PLAY! What more do I need to say?CONS Heavily controller dependant (works with keyboard too but it's alot harder! And it will take a on your space key.) Bad servers sometimes because player overloading! Sometimes (When the game was launched) the servers got so overloaded and people couldn't play in their own region without lag they were teleporting towards the ball and you couldn't jump without being teleported through the sky to the other side. (This is now fixed so don't worry!)Verdict Get the game if you have a controller and love car/arcade games!,Rocket League®
2015-08-18,0,0,337,False,Recommended,Perhaps one of the most simple concepts....car soccer yet the game is extremely fun and addicting either by yourself but much more enjoyable and competitive when playing in a party with friends not to mention one of few PC/PS4 cross platform play games. Only real downfall is the game is locked at 60fps to be on par with weak PS4 processing power I suppose. Besides that amazing game with DLC on the horizon tons of unlocks and costomization options with many game modes. The lag in some matches along with community modded maps and customization items would be a very nice addition. Solid game 8.5/10,Rocket League®

2016-01-07,0,0,502,False,Recommended,Was skeptical at first considering all I saw was a bunch of cars running into each other trying to score. However the game is more than that. For whatever reason this game is terribly addicting and features cool customization on the cars as well as interesting game mechanics including boosts flips and bicycle kicks to help change the outcome of the 5 minute match. I think the selling point for me was the fact that the matches are short so that after a study session (Being a university student having a game which I can fire up and play before getting back at it) this is a game to play without taking up too much time.Overall I definitely reccomend the game regardless of the silly premise of it. Well worth the money,Rocket League®
2016-01-07,0,0,102,False,Recommended,One of the best fantasy sports games out there. Fast gameplay and excellent physics all around and even plays on lower end hardware. It's cheap to boot. The recent addition of Hocky only serves to make the game even more fast and furious (it had better stay). The only real downside is a bit of a lack of fields and game modes.

There is one thing I should mention which is the in game economy. There are crates and ways to spend extra money for decals and such but it is completely optional as it only changes the appearance of your car.

2018-05-24,0,0,399,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Have you ever played a racing game or a sports game and thought ""I want something more arcadey""? well you cant get a better arcade style of fun fest than Rocket League. Hopefully you know how to score in soccer cuz thats the only thing you need to know for Soccar. Yes its actually called that. I'd say that if you didnt know about this game then you should look it up but that wouldnt be a helpful review. As much as I live Rocket League you should know that if you want to earn anything non standard in the game you will need to pay money. The game is a base price of only 20 dollars so That isnt THAT bad and besides youd have to really like this game to have played it enough to unlock every standard item the game comes with so at that point your likely to really want to support it like i did. Ive probably sunk more than $200 into rocket league but that was my choice. Not a requirement and the crate items are NOT i repeat they are NOT pay to win. You can work your way up by trading if you dont want to spend money but it will take more time and patience. The game is also getting a new item system to match the leveling system coming out late this year so eventually you will have the ability to open crates for free with rewarded Decryptors for leveling up. Im not justifiying my outragous spending on this game becasue there should be no reason to spend that much but none the less I enjoyed it and wanted to support it that much so if anything that should mean its worht a TRY to those of you reading. But i warn you that Rocket LEague isnt for everyone so truly I'd say that if you dont like driving games you may not like this though i could be wrong. So if it looks fun to you by all means BUY IT! Thanks for reading btw. ok bye lol.",Rocket League®
2016-02-12,0,0,2251,False,Not Recommended,I used to enjoy this game. I simply can't anymore / It's very fun and addicting! I think they did a great job and i definately suggest you try this game with friends ) But eventually this game does get frusterating and quite repetitive... there's not much to do anymore once you've reached the highest rank. It just becomes a boring grind fest and there's no real motivation to keep playing / (for me at least) Instead of adding new gamemodes and interesting map designs Psyonix adds crates and random t that doesn't really do much in every update. The servers are absolute trash i'll get a good 30 minutes in and then i'll start lagging continuously every game until the game ends forcing me to end my play session and I have very good internet myself. From my experience this game has an awful community. People who just throw random racist slurs at you the whole game tryhards who ruin casual play this game is full of s all around. Psyonix hasn't really given this game any refreshments it needs and for that reason I just can't recommend it,Rocket League®
2017-11-23,0,0,152,False,Not Recommended,"This is a very fantastic game. Very addictive fun and extremely enjoyable. What I love is that it is a perfect example of ""easy to learn hard to master"". Graphics are great gameplay is smooth controls are amazing. I wish music could be listened to in gameplay but I can throw music on in the background and play it (thank you Steam Music).The one big complaint I have is the absolutely toxic community. If I'm playing on casual I'm playing to have fun not destroy everybody I play in the game. Some players will cuss you out taunt you make fun of you and bully if you are even remotely a little bad or make a mistake in the game. People will quit in casual if the other team scores a goal on them so have of the games become waiting for another player to join.It's really hard to actually recommend it but it's such a good game it's so hard to rate this as not recommended.",Rocket League®

2015-12-27,0,0,420,False,Recommended,This game is somewhat addicting even if I put it down for a while I always find myself coming back. And that's mostly because I can get in a game so quickly (not even a minute when you start the game) and have a bit of fun not only that but if you need to leave a game it's totally ok as you will be replaced by someone else or an npc. The community is nice sometimes you get a couple creeps but hey couldn't ask for a better ratio to be honest. The new DLC has been great and good selection of vehicles.The graphics are nice and the control feels natural just uses 'wasd' keys and mouse. Also I never ever see the ball (or whatever it is depending on game type) freak out object interaction in this game is very stout.Would totally recommend to just about anybody it's fun with friends and still is even if you are going solo.

Overall just a great game.,Rocket League®
2018-05-25,0,0,383,False,Recommended,This is probably one of the best multiplayer games out there right now. The game is extremely hard in the beginning and even hitting the ball is a challenge. Like any other game no matter how good you are you'll get your kicked sometimes but that's what makes rocket league so good. The skill ceiling is insanely high so the control you have over the outcome of the game is huge. Just practice and you will get better.... probably.,Rocket League®

2016-02-15,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Not a great game. The concept is excellent and the execution is awful. The graphics are incredibly overpowering for most if not any non gaming designed computers and the match making system butchers most of the potential for fun. The game certianly appears as though it would be fun after a solid 20 or 30 hours of figuring it out but for that time you have to suffer through chat spamming and getting your kicked. If thats your kind of game get this. But I certainly don't recommend Rocket League otherwise.,Rocket League®

2016-02-16,0,0,6,False,Recommended,"Pros Highly accessible arcade style gameplay with a broad depth for masters and simple shallowness for filthy casual audiences alike. The core mechanics of the game are executed so well the game is balanced for many differently skilled players playing together. TF2 style customization you're going to want to get some cool hats for your vehicle. And a better paint job. Smooth controls holy I cannot stress this one enough the game plays about as perfectly as a kart based racer ever could (even if it wasn't made by Nintendo.) Rewards multiple player styles you suck at shooting? Go harrass the enemy players by ramming or destroying them. (Soccer would be a much better sport if there was tackling involved.) Games are short and sweet 5 minute matches by default quick games quick plays quick respawn times (of a sort). Online matchmaking works pretty well matchmaking is fast and pretty decent at placing you into games where it will be balanced.Cons The music gets annoying but that's really more of a personal preference. I will say this game rocks with your own custom soundtracks. Fees like an old Xbox 1 game with custom soundtracks. I really can't think of anything else to put here. This game is pure fun GO BUY IT! At $20 you will get more than your money's worth.tl dr 11/10 would buy ""Burnout 3 meets Mario Kart 8 meets TF2 meets Soccer"" again.",Rocket League®

2017-06-09,0,0,587,False,Not Recommended,"Still a fun game but oh my god is the community garbage. From the steam forums to the subreddit of this game this game has some of the most unchecked entitled elitist band of trolling/griefing players I've ever played with online. Let's begin with the elitists who'll look down at you because they see you as a filthy unranked casual. These players will be fricken Champion or Diamond ranks hell even Platinum ranked players will have a few jabs. They'll look their nose down at you regardless of how long you've played and what your stats are.Telling you with gatekeeping logic that you wouldn't understand a thing about this game unless you've sank over 1 000 hours. You don't know skill unless you've earned a rank and even if you did like Bronze or Gold they're still going to jab at you. Because they've allowed the progression of the game go straight to their head. Now they believe they're the say of what's a player and what's not a player on Rocket League. These are probably the same group of people partaking in all of those twitch streams and championship leagues saving face because they know a few hundred people are watching.But you interact with some of them on the forums or the subreddit then they're intolerable and compensating s. Why Psy hasn't had the balls to put these people in their place is beyond me. But I'd reckon to guess it might also have to be something involving their crate system that they probably invest in. Yes this game has a lootcrate system. Each key is $2.49 a pop. Sometimes there'll be events where you have to grind 50 of X currency to exchange for 1 decryptor that can be used on any crate of your choosing. Be prepared for the draw not to be in your favor like mine hasn't because you'll be lucky to get a rare decal or a rare set of wheels. Sometimes doubles...whoopie...Psy handles punishments very awkwardly and this is a huge judgmental flaw on them as a developer. They've rolled out a system sometime ago about how they were going to ban users based on the filter of language. Guess what? People have worked around that and so the system is practically useless. Players go on banning crusades framing and instigating people with bait comments so they'd get their rocks off on reporting you. From my experience I've reported people and I get jackshit done in regards to it. But when people report me then I'm the one banned and scrutinized because I'm in the minority and considered a ""whining filthy unranked casual player"".I'm even banned permanently from the steam forums of this game because of band of trolls that inhabit there. Go on and try making a single thread about your experiences in game or what have you. Guaranteed there'll be a bunch of people at the ready to derail your thread and start messing with you. These people go off without a single punishment handed out to them. You can report them for every post and watch as the moderators give little to no damns about your concern. Because in their twisted logic you're the OP and you're somehow labeled as ""lol bait"" by several people. So for some reason you're the problem despite the idiots banding together who are derailing your thread.These people also inhabit the main Psyonix forums and the subreddit to this game so it's like you're going to be ganged up on no matter where you go. Unless you're a money sinking goodie little Champion player who's got the aura of immunity shrouded around them that waives off any consequence. Goes to show you who's side Psyonix is on.I have almost nothing negative to say about the game itself. This is entirely a community based review of this game. All it takes now for me to have my fun ruined for this game is just one bad match. Trust me I've been in about hundreds of them. One bad match where my teammates go off to be as uncoordinated and incompetent as possible. In the end though it'll all still somehow be my fault. Because that's another issue of the community nobody takes much responsibility for their own actions. Psyonix also has made it where they penalize you for abandoning a ranked match because you can't stomach a bad match for too long. I guess they've listened to all of the ""higher up"" players that have complained up and down about this. You know the same people that bombard and lambast those ""filthy unranked players"" for not being in their league? Funny how that works out!Summarizing everything up nicely here play with your friends. Play with a group of friendly rocketeers. Don't stray too far into the main community because that's hours days and months you could be saving yourself. From having to put up with the issue of this game the community itself.",Rocket League®

2017-12-09,0,0,675,False,Not Recommended,As long as you play in a fixed composition of players i.e. with your friends Rocket League can be an enjoyable and entertaining piece of game. However starting a match in casual mode with a random selection of teammates can be extremely discouraging as of several reasons When launching alone in a 3v3 setting in most cases (&gt 60 70 %) the game is already in progress and the rivals are in the lead with at least a 2 goal margin providing you with a strong incentive to break off. I would rather wait further 30 seconds for a fresh match than being trapped in an endless cycle of ongoing matches. Generally the rival team happens to be playing in a fixed team while my group consists of three independent players. Clearly this is likely to decrease my group's odds of winning the match. Players leaving the match after the first goal has been scored turning your group into a torso of helpless and incapable bots outbidding themselves in scoring impressive own goals. The server performance is horrible for several months now and I am getting sick of it.,Rocket League®

2016-02-18,0,0,1850,False,Recommended,I'm not a big football fan but you definitely don't need to be one to enjoy this game. The mechanics are tight the gameplay is simple but has massive freedom on how to play it allowing for intricate and on the higher ranks very beautiful plays. It may seem repetitive in the beginning but it has a lot of depth and is very addictive it is also specially fun to play with friends be it online or even locally since it has support for up to 4 player split screen! There's also plenty of unlockable cosmetics if you wanna make your car truly yours.The only thing bad with this game like any other multiplayer are some of the players not in the meaning of being rude although it's not hard to find 'em but you'll see more ball hogs whom will often rear end you or similar because they are sure you cannot make the shot for yourself. In casual matches often you'll see players leaving the game after 2 goals or even 1 sometimes despite the fact there is more than half time on the clock. In ranked matches this will transform in Votes to Forfeit that is if they're not willing to leave and get suspended from matchmaking.,Rocket League®

2017-10-08,0,0,4137,False,Recommended,"one of my favorite games of all time i think rocket league or it's sequel(s) will be more popular in a decade than it is today. i will probably score my 20 000th goal before the end of the year )unfortunately i do have one problem with psyonix the developer of rocket league and it's a big one. even though it's been a major issue since day one and the community has never ceased to bring it to psyonix attention they seem to have absolutely no interest in protecting a player base that includes many children from the worst kinds of sexist racist homophobic and threatening verbal abuse and harassment. racist language and culture in particular has been a major black mark on the online rocket league experience since it was released and for whatever reason psyonix seems uninterested in policing racist language in particular. with over 3k hours of online play i would estimate that the n word has been used in over ten percent of all my online matches. i see many of the exact same players with the same names using the n word to harass and abuse others in every match they play that were in my games two years ago when i first got the game.like many others i stopped responding and tried reporting these players for a few months when psyonix first introduced it's ""reporting system"" which as far as anyone could might as well not have even had a back end till recently. since a few months ago there have been sporadic reports online of people actually being banned and i even received a 24 hour ban for repeating the same juvenile non racist language back to toxic players. yet to this day i have still never seen or heard of anyone being banned for using the n word or other racist language no matter how many times they are reported. it's very strange. i've also been unable to help but notice that until this season (season 5) of the RLCS the entire casting team of a dozen or so analysts and former top level players was uniformely white male. this season they added a token minority i suspect because one of the advertisers also noticed the rather glaring lack thereof. i could just write off my anecdotal experience in game and with the esports stuff as being too sensitive to this stuff because of where i'm from but recently i have heard others mention the same issue about pervasive racism in the in game chat and on discord.hopefully we're wrong but it all adds up to a pretty bad look for psyonix at the very least they need to start banning people that use the n word in every game. there's no excuse for ignoring this problem for two years despite numerous reports and complaints. if there are any other females racial or religious minorities or just people who just need a break or a break for their kids from online communities around rocket league or other games that sometimes seem full of the worst type of people i'm here to tell you the fgc (fighting game community) loves you. pick up a copy of street fighter v tekken vii or even mvci and you'll find a very rewarding and deep competitive online gaming experience AND a welcoming community where minorities are the majority and the trash talk is mostly affectionate rather than full of real life venom and prejudice obviously there are a holes in any scene but the fgc is better than most and light years ahead of rocket league in this regard.p.s. psyonix could take a page from bluehole which is doing a lot of stuff wrong (cheating is out of control in pub at the moment) but at least they get it when it comes to policing conduct and they have even higher player counts than rocket league. here's their new rules for online conduct https //www.playbattlegrounds.com/rulesOfConduct.pu",Rocket League®

2018-07-10,0,0,631,False,Recommended,"While maintaining a charming simplicity Rocket League is one of the most re playable games I own having steadily played it over the past few years. It's appealing to all ages and skill groups and can entertain you for as little as 5 minutes to well over hours on end. Rocket League quickly became my go to game when nothing else sounded fun. Most people I introduce to this game think I'm crazy for enjoying a ""soccer game where you play as cars with rocket boost "" but everyone who has given it a chance has usually thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a concept that isn't exactly new but has definitely been perfected by Psyonix.I don't review many games but when one has carved so much time out of my life I feel it necessary.Onto the bad stuff Honestly there's not much to say here. The matchmaking system is far from perfect. You often get matched with the same exact team you just played against defeating the purpose of rotating competition but it doesn't happen but maybe 20% of the time. It's easily avoided by simply leaving after each match and restarting your search.The servers are also a bit unreliable. They are quite quick at getting you into a game but regardless of your upload/download and ping you may experience some serious rubber banding that comes from seemingly nowhere. That being said the servers aren't much better or worse than most other dedicated server games.Overall 9/10Rocket League is a fantastic well polished game with huge replay value which is the BIGGEST trait for a game to have at least for me.

Playing with friends is more fun. If you like playing single player games don't get this. There are more fun multiplayer games to go at solo anyway.2) This game is fun. It's soccer with rocket boosted cars. I mean come on that's just fun.3) It's easy to jump in and play. If your gaming time is a little more limited and you want something you can play for 30 minutes this is a great game for that.4) If you tilt easily in multiplayer games then either don't buy this game or realize that you'll straight up need to stop playing for a bit when you start to get mad.

I have purchased all available add ons and will most likely buy any additional add ons as they are released. I have not noticed any differance in the car performance but I like the option of changing out my car. This game is easy to pick up and play but hard to master.

2017-05-08,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,After playing this on a free weekend I decided to purchase but I quickly learned that even with a lot of practice I m not going to be very good at it. The logic behind the controls and physics have been difficult to grasp because it goes against real life physics and conventional wisdom.You use one button to accel forward. You jump with another button but you must press it three times to get max height. While in the air if you want to change direction you must use your rockets but you also must use the gas pedal to move forward. If you release on the gas pedal then you fall. If you don t watch carefully then using the steering wheel you ll rotate on your z axis rather than shift on your x/y axis.I m going to tinker with the controls and try remapping stuff but the way the designers have this setup does not work in the real world. You should have to use the gas pedal to stay up in the air and moving forward. Your forward momentum should be based on the laws of momentum not because a developer doesn t understand physics. Also rotating on your x/y/z axis shouldn t be controlled by the same input control as the one which you use while driving on the ground. Once in the air your steering wheel would have no input on the forward momentum or which direction your vehicle takes while in flight.I disagree with having to push a jump button multiple times to gain more height. A driver should be able to push the button and hold it until they reach the desired plane of flight. Then hit the rocket boots to maintain that altitude. If the driver runs out of boost then they start to descend. If they let go of the button and do not run the boost they will fall to the ground.I see in the game others have adjusted so I ll continue attempting to figure out my controls but as for a review I want to give a thumbs down because of the lack of understanding in the controls vs physics of the game. It is fun to play some of the other games like hockey which has less head butts or the RND games where you have special powers/items to help you play. Overall I m mixed on my review.,Rocket League®

2018-05-04,0,0,300,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a genuinely fantastic game to play as a casual or competitive gamer. The game is very easy to pick up and play and the feeling of naturally getting better over time is a rewarding experience. There are occasions where matchmaking can seem unfair for new players however this is mostly due to the game having been out for some time and it may struggle to find enough new players to math with.There is a lot of customisation options some behind DLC which is fairly priced and others may be optained by drops or in game crates. The drop rates seem fairer than your average game but you may find better deals trading online.The game works well with a keyboard or controller and is kid friendly. You may want to turn off in game chat if you are a concerned parent but the community is relatively toxic free.,Rocket League®

2016-04-22,0,0,2,False,Recommended,It's Football. With cars. Nuff said. It's a very simple game that is fun exactly because it is so simple. It's the type of game you can enjoy with friends at a party even if some of them never played it before. You just pick it up and play and you understand it within a few minutes. What makes it so good is that it is all it needs to be and nothing more. No needless complexity. No offside rule as far as I have seen. Just a football stadium a bunch of turbocharged cars and a big bouncy ball. Add in some nice and colouful graphics and simple and responsive controls and you have yourself a wonderful game.

2016-04-22,0,0,33,False,Recommended,"EDIT Original review below. I was using a steam controller with the settings reccomended by the developer. After much ing around I fixed the issue I was having. I went into advanced settings (for the left stick) changed the ""output anti deadzone"" to 50% the ""stick responce curve"" to extra wide and the ""dead zone shape"" to circle. Hurrah! Now you can actually control your vehicle! 9_9the steering in this game is utter garbage. It's either full lock or nothing so you end up trying to tap the stick left then right then left always oversteering. It's not often that I get frustrated with a game and want to throw my controller out the window during the tutorial but the controlls make me rage. I find it hard to believe no one else is talking about this.",Rocket League®

2018-06-21,0,0,491,False,Not Recommended,I recommend this game but with somewhat baited breath. (changed this)Before you go into the main reasons be prepared to encounter constant cheaters and bots. People who join the game and refuse to play just to annoy people. Dont get angry because you will get banned for it. You will lose ranks and dont leave either because again.... you get banned. This makes the game so un enjoyable. Ive given up with it and deleted it from my active games. Overall its a fun little game to jump into when you have a spare 10 minutes or want to sink a couple of hours into it. However there are a couple of negatives.1. Smurfing the act of a high ranking player going into lower leagues just so they can 'batter' lower ranked players for fun. to give a comparison its like Cristiano Ronaldo joining an under 11's league at a local school and scoring 20 apast them.2. Ranking The ranking system would be great seriously it would. Were it not for many unranked players playing against ranked players. IE. I played 7 games in a row where i was on the verge of promotion to gold when those 7 games 6 of them told me they are platinum or above ranked and are just playing their 10 unranked games. This meant I dropped down the division. Its basically unbalanced.3. Cost Ive never been a fan of in game purchases however this game doesnt require them at all to play. But if you want a load of non basic customisation options without sinking countless hours in then this may annoy you.Saying all the above there are positives.... wait... I forgot to mention ping. Yes you will occasionally be hit with ping no matter how good your internet is the ping will hit you which causes your car to act like it has sunk vodka instead of Petrol.Anyway the positives are.1. Great graphics2. Great customization3. Great for single player or team playing4. Great for competetiveness and casual play5. Easy to learn not overly difficult to master.Pro tip get a controller and avoid PS4 players like the plague (you occasionally get placed with them in your team and 9/10 tiems they are crap).,Rocket League®

If you have a wired controller this is a wonderful game but if you dont you might want to look at controller proces before you buy this game to see if you really want to buy the game and the controller cause all together it would probaly be around 30 35 dollars depending on what controller you are going to buy,Rocket League®

2016-04-22,0,0,10,False,Recommended,This game is a soccer like arcade game using cars. It takes abit to learn and get decently aquainted with the controls(keyboard+mouse). However it is a great game that promotes car bombing(send help). You like being a terrorist ridden version of the pixar Cars movie? Play this game. Fair warning however making a 180 degree turn in terms of score during the game and losing is still fun(no it's not kill me please),Rocket League®

2016-04-22,0,0,29,False,Recommended,Whats not to love about this game? ITS GREAT!!! But honestly i recommend (if you have a console) buy it for PS4 or Xbox. Why exactly? Well because for the people who have a not sooo good computer they could experience some lag BUT notice that you can change your graphic under video where you can tick/untick some stuff like motion blur bloom and weather effects. If you still experience some lag then you can change the quality but try to avoid that! But a PS4 or an Xbox can handle all this easily! But all in all its a great game!!!,Rocket League®

The game is incredibly addictive and super fun to play with friends or online with other players.The only minor bad thing is that it's super easy to get cheap shots straight into the goal at the beginning of each round! Makes it fairly easy to win every time while playing the AI cars but with other players in the mix it rarely happens.Definitely 5 stars best sports game ever! ),Rocket League®

2017-10-25,0,0,15,False,Recommended,This is a game that I can seriously get addicted to. It's fun it's colorful and most of the people online aren't complete jerks. In all seriousness though this game is worth the buy. Bots are good and the soundtrack in perfect for the game. The reason why I love this game so much though is because it changed me from being a singleplayer person to multiplayer person. I used to hate havin gto go up against people who were better than me but in this game even when the players are 20 levels ahead of me I still feel like I have a shot of beating them. Definetly worth the $20 for me but that's just my opinion. If you like it you like it and if you hate it you hate it.,Rocket League®

The developers treat their customers like kings giving out free levels and customization items constantly which is so refreshing nowadays (they have paid content too but you don't need to buy it). All in all definitely pick this one up regardless of the current price. Just make sure to rope one of your friends into buying it for maximum enjoyment!,Rocket League®

2018-03-27,0,0,235,False,Recommended,I love this game its extremely fun with a lot of room for skill growth so it doesn't get stale. The games are fast paced exciting and quick so its easy to just play a few games when you can. The game feels so satisfying when you're doing well and when you're not you'll just want to improve instead of giving up. The game also looks great and getting cosmetics in order to achieve a certain car aesthetic is cool too. My only major grievance with Rocket League is that its matchmaking feels rather all over the place and frustrating at times with matching groups or skill levels together. Such as matching rookies seem to actually be fairly new against masters or legends. Or putting 3 randos against a trio with clan tags and everything so it can feel a little lopsided sometimes. Also the AI that replaces teammates that leave is kinda trash like sometimes it seems like it doesn't even know what team its on. In all I would still highly reccomend this game to any friend that likes fast paced games with interactive mechanics.,Rocket League®

I remember the day we first met I was so young and niave playing with my keyboard and mouse not even understanding the inbuilt controller support. From there I grew my skills and my general game sense increased. I was falling and fallling hard. As we spent more time together I knew she was the real deal everything I was looking for. Casual enough to have a laugh with and competitive enough to really get the juices flowing. Rocket League has given me something not many things can a sense of purpose.

2015-08-05,0,0,204,False,Recommended,"Well this game took a couple years to make and 101 hours for me to finish the storymode so I think it's justified to give it a detailed review. (Hopefully free of spoilers.)Having carried my save through from The Witcher 1 to Witcher 2 and finally into this game I can very strongly say that this was the best game. And here's why Firstly the story. The Witcher 1 and 2 were both very depthful incredibly immersive worlds with a solid storyline to back it. This story wasn't just solid however. It was surprising serious sad funny happy. The flow of the game's story takes you to familiar places and completely new lands you've only heard about.The plot itself is awesome Geralt's quest to locate Ciri caught up between a war between the North and South. This makes for really tough calls that Geralt is charged with making and sets up for heavy concequences down the line. A game with a potential of 36 end game states means that there's a lot of areas you can go right in and some where you might go wrong. However the thing I truly loved about this game can be summarised in two words I heard somewhere ""Moral ambiguity"". Where other RolePlaying games such as Mass Effect Fable or Fallout have a clear ""Good Karma/ Bad Karma"" ""Good/Evil"" ""Paragon/Renegade"" state The Witcher lacks this and it makes it all the more challenging on a mental level. You don't simply click the 'blue text' or the 'option that has a halo glowing on it'. You have to think about it give it some foresight. Think ahead. I like that. It highlights the distortion between right and wrong and shows what The Witcher series has always shown Things aren't black and white.The quests aside from the main storyline are also extremely well written. There are a few real golden ones and as not to spoil anything I won't betray their endings because they really are beautifully written. And if you're afraid you'll run out of things to do in this game don't! Because my my. There's too much. Like really. Too damn much! I'm never going to be able to explore all of the ""Points of Interest"" on the map nor complete every contract side quest and billboard mission. I think coming to think of it this is my only issue with the game. And it's the most ""First world issue"" I've ever made there's too much! Haha and it's a good thing for some people some people can sit down for maybe 300 hours and collect every collectible and 100% the game but for me I felt as if I was obligated to complete them all and felt a little bit of a slacker if I didn't complete them all. It was only when I nearly doubled my ""Required Level"" for the main quest did I feel I might be subtracting from the challenge of the real plot and dedicated vast amounts of concentration to it.The characters are all brilliant in this game too. Old friends such as Dandelion Zoltan Triss Vesemir Eskel Lambert all make a return and there's plenty of quests you can do that include really great chemistry and dialogue between them all. The characters that make their first appearences in this game such as the much awaited Yennefer Emhyr and Ciri herself. Other smaller characters such as Vernon Roche and Ves also make a come back but did forget some characters.For one (WITCHER 2 SPOILER ALERT) ......... If you let Saskia live at the end of Witcher 2 she never returns. And is never mentioned despite her very useful ability of being able to morph into a dragon. Also Iorveth who I was pretty good friends with in The Witcher 2 completely dissapears. There's one mention of him throughout the story and it's from a NPC who speculates that he heard from someone else that he might have been shot and killed. Great. Good to know?I digress however for the rest of the characters in this game really do compensate for the lack of a few.The gameplay which comes as a bit of an afterthought for some reason is stellar. The clunky fighting mechanics from The Witcher 2 have been fixed and every sign of the god forsaken awful fighting mechanics from the first game have been completely erased the combat is fluid immersive and realistic. Like one of the loading screens says it's no button masher. You've got to learn to block to pivot to roll and maintain your stamina properly otherwise you'll faulter and most likely lose a lotta health. This is great as it means there's a nice learning curve that just about any dedicated RPG player can pick up. The skill tree is also vastly simplified but retains its nice statistical focus on numbers in combat.The exploration in the game is quite like none other. Unique scripted dialogue will appear in the most obscure caves imaginable and it makes it feel like you really can just do whatever you want and Geralt wants to too.Alchemy and Crafting is also a little simpler but I did prefer the Alchemy system of the Witcher 2 where each substance and herb was seperated into individual catagories and you could mix and match at will but this system works too.As for the aesthetics hooo leeee shiiiiiiieeet. Beautiful. I heard a quote from Adam Kovic from Machinima (at the time) state that ""Graphics only matter for the first ten minutes and then they kinda don't matter"". But I have to disagree with that. 80 hours in I arrived at Kaer Morhen again and was blown away by the realism of the forested mountain ranges. It was truly astonishing. And Projekt Red maintain that level of astonishment all the way through the game even in the bloodiest muddiest battlefields they look astoundingly good.I'll finish on a little feature most people forget The Soundtrack. It's really good. Like really really good. It's epic cinematic intense. Like I said it's really good.If you've got a PC and you want to play this game do it. But I honestly do recommend buying the first two games as well. That way you know the plot you know the characters but you can also appreciate the Witcher 3 more when juxtaposed with its ancestors. Even if you don't you'll love it anyway.You're not supposed to give things 10/10 but if IGN can give GTA V a 10 then damnit I can give this a 10.",Rocket League®

2018-07-06,0,0,72,False,Recommended,A fun game about driving a car and playing soccer at the same time. It will take a little time for you to learn to drive your car correctly and to fly but then you should be able to enjoy your time here with the numerous types of games.You should also learn to use the ball cam correctly as it can be hard for some people to feel good with it.Howeover this game suffers from major connections and servers problems which can be really frustrating sometimes such as if you team up with some friends some of you might join the game and the others will be excluded.Casual play is also pretty bad as people will often disconnect if they feel like losing the game or take an early goal. Some people also spam and get violent a lot in the chat so you might want to turn it off.Basically you can play this game for fun but the experience is only better if you hone your skills and get better on the ladder. It's also suggested to play with friends together as it is more enjoyable to talk to your teammates about the position and strategy you will perform. Isn't it a sport game involving team spirit anyway? So you should find good partners to train and play with to fully enjoy the game.,Rocket League®

I tried Exibition games and also games on line and while i enjoy and have even gotten better at the exibition games than i ever expected to I was shocked and disheatened to see just how fast pqaced the online games were. I was completelyu out of my depth and still I felt the desire to improve to get better to keep going. On my 28"" screen the graphics were amazing and with a full range of key remapping available Rocket League proved to be one of the most accessable games for disabled players Geek Gimps like me that I have found.Add to that one of the first sound tracks in ages that has been engaging enough to encourage me to turn off my almost omnipresent stream of audiobooks and this one scores as a complete winner! I look forward to scraping together enough money to allow me to permenantly add this title to my library.",Rocket League®

2018-08-12,0,0,87,False,Recommended,This is a must have game if you like soccer and car games!!! Its very unique by the way soccer works with cars! Its takes a solid amount of time to get used to the game such as controls skill and lvl. The game has a very good ranking system and has casual play to team or solo competive modes. Its constantly updated with new stuff and dlc and even in game earnings. Rocket League gameplay uses alot of physics on how you hit the ball or dribble the ball. It has a crap ton of ways to play the game by being fast and airborne ect! I give it a 9/10 it way to unique of a game combining the car and sports genres. Its a game for everyone!,Rocket League®

2016-09-12,0,0,776,False,Not Recommended,"This is a very fun game especially with the new game mode release Rumble. It can be very challenging as well.Be wary though if you leave a Comp match early better expect to not be able to play in ANY OTHER PLAYLIST for the next 15 minutes.... I mean EVERY SINGLE GAME MODE... 15 minutes... you get to stare at your main menu screen.This is a mixed review from me. There is so much broken in this game... most of it i'm sure can't be fixed as it's very minute details. (i.e. Managing a 110 deg angle into the goal without actually physically touching the ball. all the lag issues and clipping. Problem where it look like your teamate isn't there but he is resulting in a ""Leave Match"" option in the game menu instead of a ""Forfeit match"" option (btw that's how I got my 15 minute ban from the entire game.))Once you get the dynamics down understand the different playstiles of cars and figure out how to do proper aerials then you're all set.EDIT (4/17/17) I've decided to stop playing this game as i've had issues with Rubber banding for the last 3 months and NOTHING I do fixes the problem.",Rocket League®

2016-01-22,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Better than FIFA. 10/10. But seriosly this is a great game with fun and very competitive gameplay. The DLC is cheap and and completely optional (Not like EA with their Battlefront game). There are heaps of customisations you can make to suit you and you'll spend a good amount of hours on this game because of how good it is. Rocket League is not a cheap cash grab like alot of other indie titles (I'm not saying indie games are but I'm looking at you Stomping Land). I reccomend this game to anyone who wants a reasonably priced game where don't have to worry about 12 year olds F*cking Their Mums and who are just looking to have a good game to play. This game is a solid 10/10 (For real this time). To those who read my review Thank you and I hope it makes consider getting Rocket League.,Rocket League®

How many games can you say that about? Yes the game is simple (maybe not gameplaywise) but endlessly fun.

Some (but not many) of the servers suck Sometimes you can play with/ against the same players multiple games. Which usually means you will win all or lose all. This can be quite annoying.
