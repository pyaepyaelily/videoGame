2018-12-14,0,0,116,False,Recommended,Good game but wouldnt recommed if you don't have like 3 other friends that will help you with heist and selling stuff like weed. Also they need to low the prices of some of the stuff when you have to save for like 2 weeks playing like 4 hours a day to get 5million to buy some of the stuff its not fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-08-09,0,0,76,False,Recommended,Honestly a modern classic that by this point almost everybody owns. While I didn't personally care for the actual storytelling I understand why it was there and it certainly doesn't detract from the expierience I just found multiplayer way more fun. The multiplayer is constant chaos where most people are hacking or 100 levels above you which may sound terrible but is actually incredibly fun with friends and addicting.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-22,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,I played this a lot on my xbox back in the day. I bought it on PC for the campaign only. The campaign is great and if you want to get the game for 20 on sale and put 30+ hours into the game for the campaign I would say go for it. But here is why I bought this on PC for campaign only. The multiplayer is basically pay to win or hack to win. Some may disagree but that's what I believe. This game is about crime yet over the years and I mean this in all serious ness it has become a military simulator. The game has flying cars with rockets and an A 10 fighter(really rockstar...). And all the OP vehicles and gear will take you dozens of hours to get which is why many just waste hundreds on in game money or just hack or get hacked. The game used to be fair and reasonable but now it is just a money grabbing game. The good campaign which is very good is the only thing keeping me from giving this game a 3/10.6/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-13,0,0,170,False,Not Recommended,"A geniune example how company can turn spoiled and greedy. Durring the times of its existence the Rockstar went for many restrictions and forced paywalls to make the full experience not worth any time. PC version is overfilled with hackers so if you paid for this game more than expected sucks to be you. Its a solution for the company to force players on buying shark cards nothing else. By letting hackers roam free ruining the player experience even more. If thats not enough the option of being unable to share money to the other player helping you with businesses such as CEO Biker gang or army thing is a laughable matter. Lets be honest here your friend has to be someone with a heart made out of gold if you are making a run for 900k+ and the helping hand gets 10 15k at MAX. All the nerfs been ""brightly"" made to lower the income from any activities yet once more encouraging people to spend more of the real money just so you can get penetrated from behind by Rockstar and hackers combined.Protip for 2018 if you did not bought it by some amazing accident dont bother buying it now. Just dont. You will save your nerves sanity and money.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-11,0,0,109,False,Recommended,Great game regarding online though be warned take screenshots of your stuff. Game definitely has glitches and rockstar won't give you back your stuff if you can't prove it (even after sending gamefiles that should of done so)Other then that awesome game great with friends. Having a headset helps some of the heists would be impossible without communication. I'm hoping the consoles don't slow this games progress down they still have plenty of room for more contact after doing the same missions over and over for that 20k makes you want some new ones.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-06-15,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,Im a long player of the GTA series but as old as this game is it is not worth $59.99. Though the release of free DLC is constant you have to spend several hours to afford any new items. Its nowhere bit proportional. Instead it invites the options to pay to play or pay to win with the purchase of shark cards. The only time I recommend purchasing this game now is waiting until it's $30.00 or lower.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-06,0,0,448,False,Not Recommended,I purcheased the collector s edition for the xbox 360 on its release the 17th of september of 2013. Played the main story and spent over 200 hours on multiplayer before migrating to the pc version.The story is very compelling. A tale of 3 anti heroes developing in a cleverly crafted and satyrical representation of LA.The world is huge and alive. The gameplay is very fun and it has improved a lot since those days almost 4 years ago. Its been a best selling game and i have to admit the level of production is huge. A good improvement.However i feel the game is stuck. 4 years have passed and no single player DLC has been released. No news of a new installment. GTA Online has resulted to be a mine of gold and that has affected both the story and the future of GTA itself.It is a grind. There are lots of things to do but it is heavily inclined into making the player purchase online currency. Like a mmo or a f2p. And that has affected both the kind of content and its delivery. I cannot reccomend this game because of what has been done with it,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-03-03,0,0,457,False,Not Recommended,Was a fun game now it just has toxic online community. Lack of real content ( single play exspanstion) is sad. Just because they make it free online content dosent mean its good. Story mode is great (but after you 100% there is literly nothing to do). But drive around and shoot people or mod cars. If you can pick it up super cheap do it. But dont bother with online its a JOKE!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-01,0,0,419,False,Not Recommended,The story is nice.But the online play and such is so bad and it could've been entirely avoided.part of it was when they pulled the shark card bundle thing and tried to make it look like the game had a 50% discount when it was full price. also made it so you couldnt refund the game afterwards because shark cards are nonrefundable.Not only that everything in this game can be cheated. Easily. Because of online modders rockstar is filing lawsuits against singleplayer modders too. Modding is forbidden. Completely unless you want a ban. I don't see how rockstar isn't capable of making better anti cheats. Games like warframe are pretty much non cheatable ( as far as I know I've never heard of someone cheating in warframe. ) A lot of the content in this game requires you to have friends or hire people in your server ( most of the time don't even join you. ) so you're required to do these impossible online missions online because they put you in impossible scenarios.Example I had to get a package by myself in the middle of the ocean I took a boat but soon as I got in the water and grabbewd the package helicopters came flying at me immediately instantly killing me. Spawned me all the way back on shore. In addition to that players can also target you and destroy your goods.Theres just too much cons in this game for me to consider it good. If you want to spend 60$ on that gta v singleplayer do it my guy but don't expect to have fun if you're a modder.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-05,0,0,52,False,Recommended,This is a great looking game with loads of fabulous graphics and superb soundtrack as usual with the GTA series. Having completed the whole series of games I can say this is a great addition to the family. The only problem I have with the game is that I can't actually complete the first driving mission (PC with controller) and had to give up after a couple of hours of trying.... so I had to (hanging my head in shame) SKIP THE MISSION! Now I'm no spring chicken and I guess my reflexes aren't quite what they were perhaps but it does seem to start tremedously hard for me ( a veteran of the GTA games) and so I will probably have to give it up early on after spending 30 on buying the game and I played a bit too long to make a swap for something else. Fallout 4 next I reckon another super game series.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,457,False,Not Recommended,I loved the game. I can fully understand the ban of multiplayer modding HOWEVER. Single player modding is a different story. This has gone too far and banning OpenIV is just absolutely insane.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-24,0,0,1244,False,Not Recommended,"Despite the big red thumbs down this review contains I actually think Grand Theft Auto V is a good game. I waited for its PC release ever since it was announced for older generation consoles. When I finally got to play it I enjoyed it very much. The story mode is fun though a bit repetitive at times. It looks sounds and controls phenomenally even to this day. As to GTA Online specifically it was probably one of the better multiplayer experiences I've had in a video game when I first got my hands on it. However even with all that in mind I cannot recommend this game. That's because when you buy it you don't get what you pay for.In short GTA Online single handedly ruins Grand Theft Auto V for me. Regardless of the fact that the game has probably the most toxic community I've ever encountered GTA Online is plagued with hackers and modders. They can do anything from continuously blowing up every player on a server simultaneously to turning themselves invincible to damage and teleporting to players only to shoot them. From all my time playing it I've seen it all. The worst part of it is that Rockstar pretty much allows this to happen. If they have any form of anti cheat for this I have not seen evidence of it working. I'm pretty sure the option to report players is useless to. Instead Rockstar issues the suspensions and bans to players who have never hacked or modded at all. For no reason and with no evidence. You can see countless negative reviews on Steam from people who have been locked out of GTA Online permanently because of this. Cheaters have absolute control over servers while honest and legitimate players essentially get screwed. It's unfair. People get the game solely to play the online portion and when they get locked out for no reason they're stuck with a game they can't play or refund that they paid $60 for. That alone should dissuade anyone from buying this.The other problems I have with GTA Online aren't nearly as massive but I'll list them anyway. It's a grind. You can't do anything without money and it takes forever to earn it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but even though there's no ""winning"" GTA Online the system still somehow manages to be pay to win. The offers of microtransactions consistently haunt you as you and your vehicle get blown up in the streets by some rich guy in a tank or some other rich guy on a rocket firing hover bike. It's next to impossible to fight back and protect yourself if you haven't been playing long enough to buy anything remotely powerful. New players are basically fed to the lions. Aside from that every mission to make money is repetitive and doesn't feel fun after the fifth or sixth time you do it. It's always either drive somewhere or kill someone. Sometimes both. No matter how many times they disguise it that's what it boils down to every time. And while I'll admit I've had fun my first few times doing some of the missions like the heists you stop doing it because it's fun after a while. You do it for the end goal of owning a military jet so you stand a chance in public servers. Partially due to the player base GTA Online is ""kill or be killed."" It's not what an online Grand Theft Auto game should have been.So looking back I don't regret all the time I've put into this game. I don't regret buying it. I've had fun with both the story mode and the online mode in the past despite all of this. I'll even go as far as to say Grand Theft Auto V was my favorite game to play at one point in time. However I can't recommend you buy it. In its current state it isn't what you pay for.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-13,0,0,375,False,Not Recommended,"True reason for Rockstars banning? *Read below*Firstly I would like to say I am not a modder nor have I been banned for any such thing. However from past present and how the future of rockstars decisions seems to be set it leads to the conclusion why Rockstar really have no care banning innocent players while risking everything to a automatic system which is obviously flawed without the ability to appeal. Welcome to ROCKSTARS NEW money making scam!Mhm Rockstar an over reactive automatic banning system no care in appeals or reports of unjustified banning not even considering the post to look into if there is something you missed or a glitch causing innocent players to be banned?! Come'on R* you know what you're doing How can Rockstar make money on free DLCs when players have now grinded for years building up their money its very rare to come across low levels hardly any new players to grind or buy shark cards... DING DING ""Rockstar new 100% perfect automatic ban scam"" Which 100% does it intended purpose. Ban people... not for specific reasons just when it feels like it or you just rub it up the wrong way. **YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED FOR X DAYS!** Oh look now guess what X amount of days later rockstar has a new player. Freshly wiped and ready to go sooo... are you going to grind all of those years back? Or... BUY OUR NEW SPECIAL OFFER SHARK CARDS TODAY!Rockstar are reaping benefits from the ban system money stupid players who are hooked on playing GTA and used to having their stuff at their will will not want to grind back even if they have been unfairly banned. So this means they will have to fork out for sharkcards. This is why Rockstar don't respond to appeals because SOOO many players are banned and rockstar just have no interest just incase like previously they are proven wrong and have to refund all of those effected players again and have to sit in the corner with their own dunce hat. If rockstar don't accept appeals they cannot be proven wrong and they know even if you say you won't you still will buy the next in the series and again and again. I am not one of the effected Rockstar but if I should become one I have purchased 3 legit copies XBox360 XboxOne and PC now I have also brought SharkCards a wipe would be theft of every and any shark cards I have brought over my systems aswell as the hours and time invested into them. I would write to you formally that if you have taken back the product sold to me I would be entitled to a full refund of any money I have paid. Sort this out Rockstar you have messed up this time learn from your mistakes and make sure it doesnt happen again in your next series instead of ruining your reputation over something that AAA producers like yourself should be able to avoid. No other game suffers this greatly from modders and no other games fail this bad at resolving the problem.

2018-07-28,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,This is maybe the worse purchase I've ever made. I wanted to like it. I really did. I put 58 hours into online. Everything about the game is a tedious grind. It is never ending. Everything is designed to make you want to buy shark cards. The game actively is frustrating rather than enjoyable to play early on.

2018-08-06,2,2,685,False,Not Recommended,Ok so I have been a huge fan of Rockstar....until now.My friend was suspended after being teleported by a modder I had taken a break for about 12 months and had come back to the game wanting to play with my mates so we waited for our friends suspension to be lifted.We jump in to a closed friend session and go about doing funny random stuff and recording it in game with Nvidia's Shadowplay tool.All was going well we played for a few hours then jumped off for the night the following night we jump on again and once again recorded or session only this time my friend gets kicked and a message comes up telling him he has been permenantly banned.I jump on GTA the night by myself and I am met with a message stating that I have been suspended naturally I am because I don't cheat nor do my friends.I buy a new account and I tell my friend that I am going to record the whole session so if I get suspended again I can use it as proof that I did nothing wrong.I play for an hour and log off 2 days later I try to log into my new account and I am once again met with another suspension notice WHAT IN ACTUAL FUUUUUUUK!!!You are going to laugh........I buy a 3rd account this time I have a suspicioun that Rockstar Anti cheat is flagging ShadowPlay as running a script or mod maybe because ShadowPlay is an overlay when you start recording.This time I told my friend that I am not going to record at all I even close Nvidia on the system tray just to be safe.Wouldn't you know it! I have been playing for a month with no ShadowPlay and no suspension I put in a support ticket detailing everything that had happened and I have had no response.I think people that have been banned for no reason such as this need to sign a petetion to have their accounts and characters retrieved if need be take Rockstar to court for their ant consumer practises.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-26,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,GTA V has one of the most memorable single player narratives of any game released in the past 10 years. The GTA series is beloved by many gamers all of them understanding references to the story and gameplay mechanics in any context. This installment is a cultural landmark by all accounts but I cannot recommend it if you're looking for an enjoyable online experience. The vast majority of my hours played of this game were spent in online grinding for the money to buy an apartment then a motorcycle club then a business only to find out that it was a waste of time and I'm no better off in the game than I was before. That experience was not a neutral experience it was negative in the extreme. So much so that even with the fantastic singleplayer experience I must give this game a thumbs down. I'm basically just venting at this point because it seems a lot of people are into this sort of gameplay. If you are one of those people or you don't care about the multiplayer definitely buy the game Otherwise beware.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Only buy if you like having s have the freedom to with you and also have the freedom to kick you at will for no reason. Rockstar needs to have a meeting and fix the damn game ive been on since day one and have seen nothing but negative s have freedom while people who just want to have fun realize that they have no ability to just play because modders run rampant and others feel like its okay to ruin a game for people who pay good money just to realize a few days later that most others will NOT let you make money and sabotage you at every turn. In short this game and 70% of the people who play it mostly nothing but rage inducing t.

And I can say that I had a lot of fun playing it but sometimes it was the complete oposite.If we have to analyze this game it has to be done as we are talking about ""two different games"". In one side we have GTA V the ""story mode"". The game is great. It isn't something extraordinary but it will give you a lot of entertainment. It is a large open world with a lot of things to discover and a lot of things to do. Missions are OK but mostly they are really good. And you can play with 3 different characters and progress a lot with them which is great. And in the other side we have GTA O the online mode. Probably it is what most of you are looking for. I think this will be easy to analyze if I make some Pros and Cons.Pros This mode has a ton of content. Races of all kind with all kind of vehicles shooting agains other players coop missions business of all kinds etc. A lot of cars buildings or things in general to buy and administrate. And they keep updating the game with more and more content. The progress you manage to make in your character over time. You can fool around as much as you want. In general it's hard to get bored and it will give you a lot of hours of entertainment.Cons This is what it ""weights"" more for me doing this review and what made me uninstall the game. 1. It's really hard to make progress or get money in general specially when your character is in a low level (&lt 100). But it becomes easier as you scale through the levels if you invest it right. 2. The game has an overly aggressive form of advertising some features like facilities bunkers or other business. Some characters will call to ""your"" phone non stop every 10 minutes offering those things until you buy them. And some of them will call you if you don't use those features. So you will buy those things just to stop the annoying calls. And they are not cheap what it makes it even worse.3. Most of the ways to make money are super repetitive (Go to this place get this thing and come back). This becomes really boring after some time you are making the exact same thing every time and you are getting little to no progress. Obviously this 3 points are made on purpose from devs so you have to spend IRL money in the game to purchase the things you want with no efforts. But for me it's ridiculous the game already cost 30 USD (I think 15 on sales) and yet they want their community to spend more money in the game.4. There is no punishment for people griefing. I understand that this game is made to kill each other but it becomes so annoying when a player kills you with a plane flying car / bike or bullet proof vehicle non stop as soon as you spawn every time. And then they kill them selves if you are about to kill them so they can raise their KD. It's worse when you are in a low level and you don't have that much to defend your self.5. Their anti cheat is non existent. They can't detect obvious things like cheaters moders or hackers (whatever you want to call them) spawning money cars objets or entities in general out of nowhere. Some of them can change the weather or make you fly with a guitar stuck in your character or even change your head to an UFO. They might look funny the first time but after sometime it becomes super annoying. Some of them are low level players (&lt 10) with things that they can't afford yet. Or players with levels that can't be obtained in ""humans ways"". And sometimes for example they can win races in 5 seconds when a normal player can make it in no less than 5 minutes. Nope they can't detect those obvious things.The last two points were the deal for me especially if you are trying to make some money and some of those ""players"" come and destroy everything you made with a lot of effort in just a second.If you are in a server with more than 10 random players there is a high possibility that you will experience griefers or cheaters. What is the point of having an online mode if you will suffer playing it with other players and therefore enjoy playing it alone? TL/DR The game is OK but really far from perfect. It will give you a lot of hours of entertainment but sooner or later it will get super boring and annoying.",Grand Theft Auto V

Everything costs a stupidly large amount of money to buy and the ways to get money in game without forking over truckloads of cash to them is just pathetically slow and ultimately a waste of time. Add on to that the CEO (or whichever higher up said it) said they arent getting enough money out of their consumers...on a $60 game.....thats 4ish years old....that is STILL at $60....with content that is ONLY being added to the microtransaction ladent online instead of single player cause they cant charge ya money in single player to get the new content now can they? It is blatantly obvious that Turn 2 does not care about their consumers and that they view us only as a blank check to try and take as much much from us as possible. Was seriously considering buying a copy of this game on my console to play with a friend who doesnt have a PC to run it but now im seriously thinking of avoiding this company all together. Ya hear that Turn 2?

2017-10-22,0,0,2310,False,Not Recommended,Spending hours on heists and messing around with races stockpile etc i can say it is FUN but don't be a SUCKER or should i say dont get too sucked in. Rockstar have a great formula to make you spend real money on fake money! Being constantly reminded that i should buy property and vehicles on Warstock Cache &amp Carry that cost $$$$$$$$$ millions which equals a lot of time online on heist and other jobs or you could just pay real money to get fake money. Loading screens and repeating dialogue during heist seem questionable how much can you tolerate them when you fail a heist and have to redo them over and over again waiting for the dialogue to pass before you can replay it again? Or you can spend real money to get fake money instead of wasting time on heists etc. are we suckers are Rockstar insulting us (even the dialogue during heist suggest this) To be able to develope an online game of this magnitude they failed when it came to saving time for the user or succeded in delibrately wasting time to make money on fake money( shark cards). When in an online session accpeting an invitation to Heist will take you away from that session to load the heist. But what really is either stupid or genius depending on where you stand on this is there is no guarantee you will be part of the heist since the it could be full or the heist is no longer available which means you will be rejected then sent back to an online session which means more tedious loading times. Why waste time with all this BS when you can buy shark cards SUCKERS? Any good programmer would know that this is deliberate. It would be logical and sensible to inform a user in a current online session a heist is full or no longer available BEFORE loading a heist which takes time a lot of time.To sum up GTA 5 ONLINE It kind reminds of the time i went to the yearly fair where there was that one game where you had to knock down the three stacked bottles by pitching a ball at them to win a prize.. It looked so easy but for some reason one bottle would always remain standing. You would end up playing and paying more just to win that made in china cheap teddy bear.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-02,0,0,544,False,Recommended,"If you want my honest opinion Grand Theft Auto Five is a misunderstood and mistreated masterpiece. Because of the dedication and brilliance over at Rockstar North they where able not only to recreate the entire world of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in a stunning and captivating manner but were able to tell you a great story along with solid gameplay and the apparent graphical beauty of your surroundings. Following three derranged and homicidal lunatics each with their own flavour of unique backstory personality and quirks GTA 5 mocks our current societal norms in such a creative yet slightly maniacal manner that it works. Everything from politics economics consumerism and even the very genre it is in pop culture and video games are satirically portrayed and mocked at every turn while the three unlikely heroes of this epic adventure try to simply clear their names and to go back to a ""normal life"" (or as normal as supercriminals have it) going through gang violence goverment hijacking and even internal conflicts to reach an ending (if you keep all three protagonists alive) that really does feel satisfying even if short lived.This of course describes the games singleplayer and when all this is compared to the games multiplayer the problems with GTA Online become apparent. Despite putting over 100+ missions into Online mode which has no story aside from Lamar helping you start up your crime spree and brief jobs with the likes of Lester and Trevor from story mode very few have any substance if any. Almost all (like CEO work VIP missions bunker supply runs and biker/nightclub jobs specifically) are going from one destination to another killing a group of enemies taking an asset like weapons or drugs and bringing them home. The few good missions are fun first time around but most get dull after repeated playthroughs and offer very little variety. The gun combat is modest at best but rewards very little skillful usage of mechanics like in other more competitive shooters like Counter Strike or Team Fortress 2 and instead just incentivises grinding for more money for better equipment. And this highlights the biggest problem online has grindiness. Unless you have a good group of buds to talk to whilst on missions this game become unbearbly tedious good for a few hours but after repeated sessions it really makes you comtemplate why everything in this game is so overpriced. Even the most basic of vehicles like decent sports cars or bikes are around one million dollars generally and the prices just skyrocket for the ""fun"" vechiles like the many weaponized cars and airplanes the game has. For example the newest superbike added in the afterhours content update the Oppressor MK II costs a whopping 3.8 million by default and 2.9 tradeprice if you did 10 missions with the Terrorbyte a truck similar to the Moblie Operations Center that costs 1.3 million. So basically to stand a chance against the plethora of cheaters and modders in this lawless land which are plentiful due to Rockstar's horrible anti cheat and apparent disregard with taking action you need to waste many hours just to get a fake bike in a virtual simulation of a crime ridden Los Angeles.So in closing I love this game and will forever remember it for its countless hours of fun first starting out in online and the brilliant story it provided in singleplayer but until Red Dead Redemption 2 releases or future multiplayer franchises i'll just have to wait for a fresh online Rockstar game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Very sad how little effort they put into RPG effect at all in online mode.

PEople are always look to say F U CK you to company and its odd that this company chose this grief causing game of all pieces to start there battle.I can tell you the EXACT amount of return for each business including the newest update and TRUST ME theyre all a joke. if you spend 450K dollars on supplies for each of the 6 business (bunker coke meth weed cash ids) and you deliver everything 100% to the furthest destinations you will make 650K thats barely 200K dollars over what you spent to get the supplies. IF you have a squad of three it will take you generally 1 stealing supplies run to fill up the bars completely and then you can yield a pure 650K return or more if you try to fill up the business completely. it is a VERY LONG grind to run all the supplies stolen on average for a complete fill and complete sale youre looking at about 4 hours of grinding for a 650K return in game. and most of the cool missile shooting is well into the millions which is fine. but the MOST SOUGHT AFTER upgrade i think is the turbo for the car which isnt costly but negated by levels. SUPER LIMITED ONLINE EXPERIENCE. its truly an insult but its very difficult to find a real AAA title today that isnt garbage it seems. i can think of 4 additions to GTAV online that would change the community forever.1) Emergency Services Ambulance Police Firefighters.2)Romantic Relationship it could be 100% scripted and every player has identical gf or bf. people would love the chance for that immersion.3)better options for online games its already EXTREMELY time consuming to grind and i think a lot of gamers would be happier if they felt like they had the choice to gring reasonably with ONLY themselves or friends VERY EASILY. right now it is a step that is taken in the system.4) The choice to Join or Start a CEO Organization or MC as more as a semi permanent clan allowing associates or body guards to make good daily payouts from in game sources for doing well as either. nothing insane but just enough for the idea to seem appealing to those who perhaps did not want to be MC captains or CEOs themselves or ones that coudnt afford that stuff could apply to an in game or in Social Club section and other Crew leaders that had the appropriate stuff could accept people to there MC or CEO org for maybe a week or a month at a time and during that contract that player would be awarded maybe 10k a day if they did some work so max they could make would be maybe 500k or 750k for literally 7 days of RL time or 30 days of RL time. if you left the contract you wouldnt make as much so incentive would be there and players would buy sharkcards to be able to start MCs vs out of resentment just one time. I dont know who they hired for marketting and game design but they are F u ckin G D umb.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-24,0,0,525,False,Recommended,The long wait has been worth it. If you re a PC gamer who s spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest GTA then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. Sure the Xbox One and PS4 versions were amazing delivering GTA 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects (see our full review below) but the PC version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the PC s strengths. In doing so it adds a few more metres to one of gaming s towering achievements.Having covered the game twice already we won t go too far into the detail of what makes GTA 5 so good. Partly it s a question of experience. With four previous 3D GTAs under its belt plus Red Dead Redemption Bully and assorted DLC packs Rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems and GTA 5 has the best driving the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series.It s also a question of structure. Dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from Michael s ageing career criminal saga to Franklin s ambitious hoodlum story to Trevor s crazed amoral brand of mayhem where the dumb cathartic slapstick violence we all deep down love GTA for finds its natural home. With repeated play it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with Rockstar s savage satirical take on the Californian dream.,Grand Theft Auto V

I felt that this new development required an entire new review instead of an edit that nobody would see. Allow me to explain . Last week during e3 take two the greedy ing horrible publishers of this game filed a cease and desist against openIV a necessary modding tool for the past 2 games in the grand theft auto franchise. This doesn't seem like a big deal right? The modding must have been hacking in online or doing something against their TOS. NOPE!! The sole reason behind this c&amp d is that the modding tool allowed people to access online content in single player mode that wasn't previously accessible in single player (depending on how it was used) and in the online you would be able to purchase in game money using micro transactions to get these things. So basically these super rich publishers with the highest selling adult game of all time decided that they weren't making enough money and decided to instead of actually improving the game or releasing new content for the game like story dlc they decided to force a completely free and community friendly software developer out of ""business"". I'm not gonna buy another rockstar game or another take two game until they stop this. Here is my old review which I recommend you to read because it also involves micro transactions ruining the game &gt mod singleplayer literally never touch online&gt have the mods set up so that even if i tried to play online it wouldnt let me it would crash it before i joined&gt play for a year&gt friends want me to make online character&gt play for 40 minutes&gt meet hacker&gt gives me a ton of money&gt i try to stop him he refuses&gt first strike permabanned&gt no problem ill just contact rockstar and clear it up&gt no ban appeals lol you buy our game again&gt keep trying because i spent 60 dollars on a product&gt contact support&gt ""sir we noticed that in the past you've had modified game files""&gt yes but it was single player&gt ""oh well still you accepted the eula so if you mod then you can get banned""&gt but i paid 60 dollars for this&gt ""oh well technically you were paying for singleplayer online is a seperate item that is conveniently packaged with grand theft auto 5 tm""&gt right well i was modding gta5 not online which is seperate&gt ""are you giving me backtalk""&gt permanently ing banned from not only gta online but also the rockstar support&gt i paid 60 dollars for this&gt ACTUAL ING HACKER STILL NOT BANNEDsingle player is alright but honestly just get it on console or just dont get it at all because this is ing t they only care about shark card microtransaction dollars and making sure nobody hacks in money because that takes away from the money.

2017-06-14,0,0,1513,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend buying this game right now if you aren't willing to pay 60 bucks for a mediocre story mode. Online has become a severe victim of greed and underdevelopment as well as the site of one of the most toxic communities in all of gaming. It's not worth paying for in its current state.The singleplayer mode however is still as good as it was... circa 2014. The game has been constantly updated to add new content but that content has been locked to Online since before the PC edition even came out. The reason for this is that you can easily earn money in SP but in Online the fastest money making methods are gated behind multi million dollar buy ins or else require an extremely competent team of 4 (which you can't find in today's community). The in game economy makes no sense the majority of job types offer so little cash for your time that they're not worth playing and of the work that is worth it the majority is in freemode and is vulnerable to trolls screwing you over with the Oppressor Mk.2 a flying rocket bike that can fire homing rockets more accurately than any other vehicle. The only reliable counter that also allows you to actually continue grinding is to use an exploit that puts you alone in your own session defeating the point of Grand Theft Auto ONLINE.It's an okay game if you bought it when it came out but trying to jump in today is nearly impossible without fronting large amounts of additional cash for Shark Cards or the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack. Prices for nearly every item added after the Heists update are ridiculously inflated requiring entire day's worth of grinding just to afford one item business or upgrade. This is of course to make the Shark Card purchasing GTA money with real money shortcut more appealing. Short version 2K Games and Rockstar are a bunch of greedy shitheels.

2017-06-21,0,0,1414,False,Not Recommended,WIthout mods it's very limited. It's pretty but there's not a hell of a lot to do. The main story is engaging but is quite short and doesn't vary (and locks up sometimes.) And GTA online is a soulless grind all work no reward. It's a carrot on a stick and doing the work is arbitrary and boring not to mention impossible when it crashes literally every few minutes and takes up to 15 minutes to get back on to a server and sometimes hours to find a stable one. I don't know how a Grand Theft Auto can be such a source of frustration and misery after all the great things the series has done. Single player mods kept it kind of interesting but the blanket mod ban means it can be nothing more than what it started as which is mostly a pretty but boring rigid sandbox. It's an aimless driving simulator basically.,Grand Theft Auto V

Online is the best part of this game. The game performs VERY well on any hardware made in the last 6 years.People in the reviews section are blasting this game for ""false bans"" and as far as I've seen or heard these claims are absolute BS and they 100% did something in order to get banned. False positives seem to be very rare with this game and you should not ever fear getting banned out of nowhere.The online is (ATM) riddled with modders so you should be a bit wary of that.The singleplayer is nice and easy to mod and it makes a great sandbox.I recommend the game.EDIT (5 months later) I've been in *several* games with modders/hackers and STILL have no been banned from the game EVEN after being given money by said modders on three occasions.People that say they were banned for ""no reason"" are completely full of",Grand Theft Auto V

I've been playing since it released on consoles 2013 and made the jump to PC a few months ago and now I've been suspended and my character is gone forever why? Probably because some lolrandom modder dropped money on me at some point or froze my character in the air or spawned a bunch of cougars or literally anything else because the PC version of this game is full of modders and it's almost impossible to avoid them and now Rockstar seems to have banned anyone that has ever even come into contact with a modder.This is lame. This game is a massive grind and I've done it multiple times of my own volition because the game is fun as heck but this is just blows. I have 226 hours on PC and I still drive a Bravado Buffalo and cheap motorcycle because everying is so expensive and it takes forever to make money. I've been saving for months to a Deluxo (Flying Car) and now since I've been randomly suspended despite being a legitimate player since 2013 I have nothing. I can't even play the game for a month.

2018-05-12,0,0,329,False,Recommended,If you want to buy this game for the Online mode then maybe think twice. I know Rockstar pretty damn well and I can say that they'll most likely false ban you for no apparent reason. I personally have not been banned on this account for now but I keep on hearing that more and more people keep getting banned for no reason. Also if you really want to get the most out of the Online mode for this game then you're gonna have to buy shark cards (like credit cards but for GTA V cash) because let's be honest it's gonna take YEEAAARS for you to get enough money to get the new content they're putting in Online. Why? Because usually the updates cost millions of in game cash.If you want to buy this game for the Singleplayer mode then go on. I personally think the singleplayer has been greatly done by Rockstar. I don't want to spoil the story for you so I won't describe this too much. Also this game supports mods! (EDIT They have been banned OpenIV. Sad.) That means you can around with the world as much as you want! So the Online mode is not that great but the Singleplayer Story is good. I'd even say 'awesome'. My ratings are 8.5/10 for Singleplayer6.5 7/10 for OnlineSo the final rating is 8/10. Not bad nor fantastic but good.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-13,0,0,188,False,Not Recommended,If you plan on playing this just for GTA Online I suggest you play on a PS4 or Xbox One. PC servers filled with angry child modders ready to ruin your day while rockstar just casually does nothing and sits in their offices raking in the cash. If you plan on transfering to PC from a console like I did think twice. Rockstar used to have a system for transfering accounts but they removed it and will most likely never bring it back. So the thousand hours you ginded out online will all be a waste. For those who just want to play just the story mode this may be for you. I play with a Ryzen 5 1600 and RX 580 and I can play high settings 1080p at a silky smooth 60fps. The only other complaint i have is with the controls. They feel very clunky at times and I would recommend playing with a controller. To sum it up this game is fun and addictive but the online servers are riddles with modders dropping money and making the game virtually unplayable for others. The single player experience is masterfully crafted and is a must play if you have never played it before.GTA III and Vice City are superior games,Grand Theft Auto V

To report players in game Pause the game and navigate to the ONLINE tab. Select Players and choose the name of the player cheating. Select Report and confirm your report with the Exploit category.Also I would like to inform you that Bad sports pool is a server oriented program and once you are in it you have to serve that particular amount of time and once the duration is over you will be able to play the game normally.If you face any problem regarding any of our entitlements please feel free to contact us back.

2018-10-23,0,0,598,False,Not Recommended,"First off I only cared for the online part of the game so the rating is not applicable to the offline mode which I never played. Also I tried very hard to love this game and in a way I do. But it's online mode is terribly broken.The game is beautiful. It's open world is a real looker and I totally enjoy the many different things one can do. Play missions race aroung the map or even on special maps that can be pretty insane fight deathmatches run businesses go on heists etc etc. Sounds like my kind of game.So why would I consider it to be broken?First it's freemode is essentially a big PvP arena. That's a huge downer for me. While it's possible to run invite only sessions or go into passive mode shielding you from aggressive players many activities require you to be in a public session fully exposed to others. And in many cases you are helplessly exposed to other players who made it their goal to blow up you your cargo or your business.PvP should be limited to dedicated arenas. But most so called griefers only care about fighting other players many of which would rather just mind their own business. It only takes one ""griefer"" to ruin the gameplay for everyone in the session. While I was able to talk to some of these griefers in a normal manner most of them rather insult you and seem to have a screw or two lose.Which brings me to another problem. GTA online attracts some really bad company. The amount of bad language in there and the way some people behave is just staggering. It often feels like a trolls nest.Bad players aside Rockstar isn't innocent either. They want to sell shark cards. Fair enough the online mode is free and shark cards are sort of the only way for them to make money. This explains at least in part why the whole world of GTA online is essentially a big deathmatch. You may grind hard building and selling you businesses. If a griefer comes along and blows all that to hell in a matter fo seconds you may be more inclined to buy one of these cards.This is frustrating at best. I'd rather see them charing a monthly fee or offer lifetime packages and keep hostile players from ruining the experience for everyone else.Everything in the game is expensive. It takes a lot of grinding to get ahead. Especially when you're a new player it's very tough to get anywhere. Money talks and I'm OK with that except for the fact that any avenue to make some significant money is bound to exposure to griefers.There are also many technical issues. The game is littered with cheaters and modders. Rockstar doesn't like them but they are all over the place anyway. Modders can set you on fire blow you up and worst of all ""bless"" you with modded money. This is really bad news as it could potentially flag you as a cheater even so you had no hand in this. This may even lead to the account being banned even if you've done nothing wrong. Whenever you see a modder run.I don't understand how it's possible for people to cheat and mod in 2018. Rockstar really needs to get it together. The latest ""attack"" went so far as to allow cheaters to attack player in offline mode! How is that even possible? Really really bad security concept there.Another tech problem is the integration of different platforms. The game is obviously designed for use on a console. It's UI is less then ideal for PC users same as the controls. Annoying but managable. But there seem to be slight differences in the gameplay making crews ""platform only"" crews. So if you want to choin a crew that's PS4 only you're out of luck using a PC version.I've also ran into some very strange synchronization problems. Like the car you stop on the motorway suddenly changing from the target super car to steal into a completely different one that has nothing to do with the quest. My buddy I was playing with told me he saw that other care all along. In other instances I started driving a motorbike only so that I fall off a second later and the bike goes on it's own.These aren't major bugs but just glitches that add up.As mentioned above I'd love to love this game and I would very much like to play this game. Yet it's full of so manny downers that I have to give it a negative review. It has fun moments but the frustration usually outwighs them. That's not how I want to spend my time. The main reason I'm about to quit on GTA online are the griefer attacks. This makes them win the game but some of these individuals seem to be in need of some serious therapy in real life. These are not people I want to hang out with.Griefers/trolls killed this game for me. I can only hope that Rockstar will rethink their online design for the next version of this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Let me give you guys a little background iI bought this game 3 times now om ps3 at launch on PS4 When i upgraded then on PC when i upgraded further.PS3 this was the glory days with easy amd enjoyable money making methids you could do with your friends everyone would whine at R* for the heist but the game was still ridiculously fun with all the gamemodes and reasonably priced cars (the OG Bugatti was the mist expensive at the time.PS4/PC I didn't pay much on PS4 or else i would've known better then to buy it again with the criminal starter pack for a ""Boost"" I have 150+ hours into the game and im still broke with all the businesses you can own it's still pretty abismal in returns especially when doing them with your friends... I.E. Exporting a car (the best consistent way of making money if you import a car you don't make any money neither does your friend (no incentive for them to do it) pair that with NPC's amd players hunting down your car you are sure to pay to repair it if your friend is driving it although he is making $0.00 he gets charged for repaira ridiculous. Alright but exporting makes a lot of money right? Yes and no here is where we get to the Free2Play characteristics of a $50.00 game more if you bought the so called ""DLC"" after exporting which you make 100k per car if and only if you pay 20k per car to ""upgrade it"" driving through an onslaught of NPCs causing damage and reducing your pay for the car (Lets say with a friend) you might make an okay sum but your friend after all that grinding of importing might make 20k maybe on top of that you have to wait a 20 MINUTE COOL DOWN before you can export again. What a joke and it's like this for most aspects of the game combine this with everything being way overpriced always over $1million usually above $2mil. And to obtain any 1 thing you want in the game is a GRIND sort if a Free2Play... Pay2Enjoy type game. All incentivice the purchase of sharkcards which during ps3 era wasn't too bad as most items where reasonably priced so you could get a lot with $20 so i used considered this good for brand new players who didn't want to grind 50+ hours but with these overpriced items a sharkcard can maybe buy you a plane or a single car depending how much money you drop which is insane no 1 item in a paid game should be worth $20 USD. This system has gotten way out off hand. Now and days you should buy this game for single player but multi playerPREDICTIONS FROM A PROPHECY This game is almost following the path of DC Universe Online which was initially pay to play now its Free2Play which i believe will be the cass when they drop a new multilayer experience this game won't stop receiving updates by what I've seen. Instead it'll move into a Free2Play standalone tittle while you will still have to buy the single player experience. Conclusion Buy only for single player as Online is a Free2Play game by all the accounts from low profit GRINDING to OVERPRICED ITEMS to Ridiculous COOLDOWN Timers. All of which sounds like recipes for a Free2Play &gt Pay2Win tittle.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-15,0,0,150,False,Not Recommended,This review is abit different than the others i indeed was a hacker i played the game since it came out on Xbox 360 and got about 1100 hours all legit when the PC version came out i started using hacks and spawned in money for myself (Mind you i never used the hacks for anything else i didn't antagonize other players didn't spawn in money for anyone else) then one day i get a 1 week ban fair enough i admit that what i did was wrong and stopped doing it.But that's not where it ends i stopped using hacks and continued playing the game the real way no hacks no exploits no way to help me get money then one day as i logged on just to play the game i saw that i had been permanently banned.Now i know that everyone thinks i got what i deserved that's not the case though i stopped using hacks and played the game normally but still got banned (that's not even adressing the fact that i should of at least had a second warning ban). I would of accepted my permaban had i first of all cheated and had i used up my second warning ban both of theses things didn't happen though i got banned for absolutely no f***ing reason i then opened 2 different support tickets both of which were immediately closed without support even answering with a single sentence.So all in all think whatever you want that i deserved it that i didn't deserve it however i think that what happened to me is unacceptable and a load of bull****.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can simply enjoy the story line and get trained. For the online mode with high degree of freedom there is a big differences between competitive games and GTA5. You can build your own world make money in any way you want or simply just go sightseeing when you're down. For me it's a more relaxing game than a contesting game sometimes you would be killed though. But in this game you shouldn't think too much.

2017-10-27,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I started playing GTA back when I was a lot younger. Vice City is what got me into the series however none of the other games caught my attention quite like 5 did. I played GTA IV a lot but never completed the campaign because I always got bored halfway through. GTA V on the other hand... I COULD NOT PUT DOWN. I love every aspect of it. (Other than the story not including more heists.) The 3 protagonists are thought out very well. They each have so much character and soul and rockstar packed in a great story to go with it. Just from the prologue I got instantly HOOKED! I would recommend this game to everyone and anyone no matter what games they're into. It's worth finishing at least once. (This is my 3rd time owning the game!) Rockstar did a great job with map design and their attention to detail is INCREDIBLE. So many little obscure details you wouldn't find in any other game that makes GTA V so unique. From the different sounds from cars squishing of wet shoes water only going up to the spot where you actually got wet. There's a lot of people who are whining about the game not getting campaign DLC. Would it have been nice? Sure! Who doesn't like extra content to their favorite games. HOWEVER for the longest time. When you bought a game that's exactly what you got. Despite that Rockstar did a damn well job with GTA V. It'll go down as one of my favorite games.,Grand Theft Auto V

I've hundreds of hours on both platforms but as the years went by the game went from an actual fun game to just adding sharkcards and multimillion dollar supercar DLC's now it has gone down the with all that it ever was. I'm not gonna say anything about the whole Take Two modding thing becuase I don't think that is relevant if you're are not modding it. The game is just now based on luxury 4 million dollar supercars owning a big organizations and buying shark cards. It has left behind the GTA feeling that it started out with. GTA now is about living the rich life with bikes that can fly and expensive yachts. The feeling from GTA SA Vice City GTA 4 etc is now gone. This just don't feel like GTA anymore with all these new dlc's containing the exact same stuff over and over again. They need to move on from this game and go forward now they are just milking money from it. Adding expenisive stuff or flying bikes is not gonna rescue or make this game better by any chance. Just move the on.Writing this on christmas 2k17 atm there's a new free car wich can be collected for FREE. But when people try to get the FREE car rockstar charges them 525k.

Pay to not grind system and the in game money costs waaaaaaaaaay too much to even be reasonable. It's basically preying on people with addictive personalities for profit. on the modding community probably so that Rockstar can sell mods themselves. you OpenIV was one of the main reasons people still played this game. It's clear that this was an attempt at eliminating free content. After all if you want to have fun in GTA 5 you'd better buy some Shark Cards only $49.99 a pop!As a final aside this has seriously damaged my perception of Rockstar as a company.

2015-12-22,0,0,330,False,Recommended,Grand theft auto 5 is a game that offers so much for just sixty dollars. As you may see i spent many hours playing this game most of it has been online but i also enjoyed the single player. To me the story was interesting because it provided three different perspectives and pretty much three different life styles. Aside from that the multiplayer is great sure it has its weaknesses. For example the server load times are abysmall and it can get painful to wait and wait for it to load up. Furthermore i hope you find some friends to play online with you because playing it online alone will get fustrating very quickly. All in all i love this game and its integration of races which in my opinion may actually be better than some dedicated racing games.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-06-04,0,0,1073,False,Not Recommended,"Wow finally ready to submit a review 890 game hours later... For a game that has so much potential Rockstar has wasted customer's time and money in making GTA Online more about PvP. I used to see it as a great overall open world ""build your empire"" semi realistic simulator but now with rocket flying missile shooting bikes off radar stealth helis flying DeLoreans shooting missiles... it's honestly just become stupid as he**. Too easy for some chump to steal a Laser (faster airplane jet in the game) and troll on random people flying faster than heatsinking missiles albeit susceptible to FMJ/explosive rounds. It's just mahem. I guess TBH I used to mainly play the heists to make money and force 4 player co op player but people get killed easy over and over and don't listen to tips and suggestions. If I'm lucky enough to get 3 or 4 players to work for me as a CEO or Motorcycle Club owner we just got trolled nevertheless and easily get 5 10 hour jobs blown up like it's nothing. Again the game has amazing potential. Patching up the game to reduce the constant boat load of hackers and taking away the excessive weaponary is a start. Rockstar why do you still sell this game full price? Greedy jerks. Starter packs and shark cards don't get you that much in game... not with all the hacking and insane weapons and weaponize vehicles folks have.",Grand Theft Auto V

Yeah I can spend even more hours on the game tirelessy grinding game modes and missions that make Bad Rats look like the Citizen Kane of gaming or I could buy sharks cards to further line the already billowing pockets of the employees at Rockstar. Overall the only fun thing that this game offers is driving about the city before being blown up by a man in a jet with a pp the size of a Orange Tic Tac. If Rockstar ever offers a reasonable sale which is rare you should buy it maybe you can use the money you saved from not having to pay the full price to buy in game currency so that you can actually have a decent time.UPDATE The great people of Rockstar decided to ban me without warning and explanation from playing online. I thought to myself ""Well it's only a month ban I doubt they pegged me for cheating or anything like that I should be fine."" This assumption however was the polar opposite. Upon logging back into the game I found that my online profile was completely wiped everything that I bought is gone and I now have to start over.

2018-04-03,0,0,1445,False,Not Recommended,Pros Single Player has a great story line with 3 playable characters with different abilities and personalities. The world is amazingly detailed especially with animals that can be found on either mountains desserts or ocean. (Animals are available only in single player). Good replayability. Handful of good cars available. Multiplayer has a lot of good and fun content (if you can grind the money to buy them). Multiplayer can be fun with friends or a crew.Cons Long loading screens (Single player is not that bad but Online often have long loading screens). Multiplayer has a lot of modders hackers or just griefers that will disrupt your gameplay. Faulty Anti cheat system by Rockstar. I got affected by the banwave that happend on March 23 2018. I never modded (either single player or multiplayer mods) used exploits / glitches nor messed with other players (all bannable according to Rockstar). So playing online can be a gamble. 600+ hours playing online legitimately only to be suspended and reset for unknown reasons can be frustrating. A lot of grinding for money to be able to buy cars buildings and items for online multiplayer. No animals available for multiplayer which imo makes the world feel less alive. A lot of cars clothes helicopters/airplanes etc. that can be bought online are not available for singleplayer (unless you get them through mods for singleplayer).Conclusion Play this for the single player experince but play online multiplayer at your own risk since it can be frustrating with all the modders/hackers long loading screens large amount of grinding to get money for items and random suspensions / bans for your account.I also do not recommend buying shark cards since the most expensive one ($ 99.99) can only buy you 3 4 good item purchases (that is not a lot value for the money). Update April 8 20182 weeks after the ban wave on March 23 Rockstar did not make any acknowledgement that there was any mistake on their part that people were unfairly banned by their faulty anti cheat system. A lot of people (both players that have 500+ and &lt 100 hours playtime) are still unfairly banned while online multiplayer is still plagued by hackers / modders. I recommend staying AWAY from playing online.,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't have time for online but will give it a try some time. The story line felt a bit short and ended too quickly. Other hobbies and features keep it interesting for while longer. I did not feel the urge to play all over again. One short coming that I did find was that the random events of hitch hikers should not stop. I did not knew that they could be fed to cannibals so I have no way to experience that part of game unless I start over. Making money on stocks is only useful at the very end. Would have been ore interesting if players had to purchase properties during the story line rather than at the end.Overall I would give it a 7.5/10.With moderate settings I was able to play it on a Dell laptop with i5 7th Gen and Intel HD card and 8 GB RAM.

Rockstar not actually supporting mods.Remember GTA SA or IV and the easy mod manager?Well forget that now even installing a simple car requires 5 or 6 steps and changing scripts/adding lines etc. which is a huge bummer.Seems to me they have an ego issue with their game being ""good enough to play without any mods"".It s a large problem because the modders are the soul of the community and not supporting them is killing your own fanbase.So to sum it up Definitely get the game if you are a fan of previous games of the series especially if the game is discounted.I bought the game twice (first for PS3 full price) and now discounted and it was worth every single penny.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,1,9,1218,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a meticulously crafted open world sandbox title by Rockstar Games. The constant delays and hype of the PC version was laid to rest when it finally saw its release on the 14th of April. As for the review I shall be brief so as to be as less time consuming as possible. GTA V offers vibrant visuals a modern yet enjoyable plot consisting of a mixture of reality and satire. It also offers replayability due to its vast counterpart GTA Online and a living breathing environment in the streets of Los Santos and Blaine County. Aside from the main plot the game maintains its entertainment standard by offering its players with a variety of tasks missions random quests and activities.PC users that may not be as up to date can also try this as the game itself is optimized in a way to deliver utmost performance while maintaining its graphical fidelity. I must say this is pretty much the only AAA game that deserves a praise in the recent scenario as minimal bugs have been found and those discovered are being eliminated by Rockstar. As said before I've been brief very brief in fact. It doesn't matter as to what kind of games you like. This is a must buy and shall remain one for years to come. 10/10 indeed!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-30,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,Cannot comment on the game although I would have to say that after a month of waiting for Rockstar to reply to initial issues involving Social Club login no response has been forthcoming 'one month on'... According to Steam I have played 3hours (not so) more like 3hours trying to gain access to game. This appears to be a very common problem but easily resolved by Rockstar such as unlinking your account login however the issue would appear to be trying to get in contact with them other than via a web ticket (THEY ARE IN NO RUSH). Other comments via the web state that although its a fairly common but simple process support staff there are finding it difficult to find this 'Unlink' button which appears to be buried this merely requires a quick 'click' of the mouse for you to enable another sign in for your game... Innevitably this creates a long wait while they seek others help to find it. While I appreciate I'm partly at fault for not keeping a second b/up of Social Club login details if it were not for a major software update issue on my machine with this WIN10 spying rubbish I'd still be playing! So I now have an expensive game thats totally useless and unplayable...Rockstar and Microsoft get ready to lose another customer!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-23,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,"Take two decided to shut down a modding tool which an entire community of fans used. Many People relied on Open IV to make videos specifically Youtubers and without the software the future of modding for the GTA series look bad as the best tool to make videos is now offline and being online is the whole point. ""We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.""This response is misleading as Open IV was used by the ""Creative Community"" to make their own creations which is superior to the rockstar editor which does not include custom textures.Open IV officially does not include hacking as it actually forces your game to disable the online feature so it does not affect GTA Online in any way. The ones responsible are the hackers. This is the same as how Greece banned all GAMES to fight online gambling (Greece Law 3037/2002). To fight hacking in GTA Online they banned ALL mods. This proves Take Two is incapable of distinguishing offline modders and ACTUAL online hackers who actually use hack tools. What they should be doing is actually working with the Open IV team to improve the software and restrict the code so that it ""cannot"" be used for hacking or integrate it into all of the supported games. Most hackers use external software so should Open IV be part of the game hackers cannot utilize the software to hack thus removing a reason for shutting down Open IV.Seriously.

2018-10-18,0,0,272,False,Not Recommended,"The single player campaign is one of the greatest things out there so with that out of the way why is this review negative? TL DR the game allows the most powerful multiplayer cheats since CoD MW2 ""Liberation mod menu"" and Rockstar doesn't give a sh*t.Rockstar (the devs) make basically all their money now with GTA online the multiplayer part of GTAV.The single player campaign did not get a single update since release all the work goes ONLY into the multiplayer.So Multiplayer should be great right? Not so fast while the player numbers are at a constant high granting this game a place in the top 10 steam charts for literal years now the devs only add a bit of (questionable) content every once in a while like adding flying rocket shooting bycicles. That's it. Nothing else. 2 Years ago this would have been my main complain point how the devs ruined the expierience for everyone who does NOT constantly cruise around in a tank or a rocket bike but it has become so much worse that this kind of content is almost neglectable now.The real problem tho is the moderation of the giant playerbase. Since there are no servers every session is based on a p2p network between the actual players with one player being the host therefore doing what else a dedicated server would do.This results in a security weak spot that acually all p2p based games have host cheats.The cheater fakes a flawless internet connection to the session he joins therefore immidiately taking the role as host. When being host you are able to control EVERYTHING since you ARE the server. From simply making all weather conditions appear simultaniously over killing all npcs and players (also players in passive mode) with one click to forcing custom mods onto the game copies of every single player in the lobby or completely modifying the world map itself having full control of the editor tool BUT IN AN ONLINE SESSION with real players in it not in a custom game but in a real and ordinary GTA Online session.This is a huge problem since you encounter these types of cheaters quite frequently. As i mentioned earlier the only work that Rockstar does for this game is release a bit of content every now and then. They don't do bugfixes or security patches. It rarely happens that Rockstar ""bans"" a cheater since they have to do it manually there is no anti cheat for this game and even then the cheaters don't get bans they get timeouts of a week to a month at most if any at all.Almost every cheat program for GTA Online from 2016 still works TODAY resulting in a quite attractive landscape for people who want to cheat but at the same time want to be basically safe from any sort of punishment. And oh boy do they cheat.Just yesterday someone released a cheat software that can extract your individual RockstarID and mess with your account EVEN IF YOU ARE IN SINGLEPLAYER you just need to be connected to the internet.And Rockstar just continues to sell in game currency via their shark cards without taking care of ANY fundamental problems that their software has giving cheaters basically ""a free house while the parents are out"" but the parents are out for years now and they most likely don't come back.

2015-12-26,0,0,491,False,Recommended,10/10 would rather live in Los Santos than real life! Have been playing for 2 years on 3 different platforms.PROS Awesome game! insane graphics. Long term addicting. Ton of weapons and even more cars. Nothing better than murdering your friends with a hatchet or a baseball bat. Huge variety of special vehicles with guns and armor. You can rob stores. No more Roman and obsessive conversations about s. Lost and damnned get bullied. Amazing costumization options for vehicles. Like neon lights and gold and chrome paints. Ton of different game mods. Some even similar to horror movies. You can do anything you like from deathmatches to parachuting racing and heists. This game is like a dozen games in one. There is more than 15 huge DLC available for free in this game. The DLC updates continously being realeased at no extra charge and absolutely free. Your progress really saves including level cars money and posessions. If there are any game bugs rockstar works immideatly and really hard to fix them. Really fun game for a while to kill time and get entertained.CONS Rockstar pressures you into buying their game money with real money on a very unfair exchange rate. Apparently gta money are printed with golden bills. Because $8 million dollars in game is priced at 100$ real money. That is a rip off. Considering the fact that you need 30million to really get set up and buy most of the fun things in the game. Rockstar put a small payout to missions and heists that makes the game incredibly boring and really hard to get the money. That is a crafty scheme for you to give in and spend real money on their money. SOME THINGS IN THE GAME COST MORE THAN THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF IN REAL MONEY. Certain pricy possessions in the game are more expensive in shark cards than the actual game. I think these really ruins the fun in this game. I see a lot of people get depressed and bored of repetitive missions and heists that pay you pennies. They simply stop playing because the outcome is not worth the effort. So game money is the biggest issue. Lamar and Simeon take the cake on being annoying. They are really cool and independent people as portrayed in story however they cant live a minute without calling you and needing to show off in front of you. Conclusion Must buy! Even full price of the game is worth it. If you didnt buy this game when a sale came up than no one can help you. For you are the C.O.D brained kid.,Grand Theft Auto V

I must admit that the multiplayer side of the game has been at first quite confusing but as the time moved forward I have really enjoyed it. I'm leaving a negative review for this game as I have started to come back to this game less often due to the lack of its excitement and the true meaning of GTA online the development team has focused way too much on adding new content that honestly makes me even bored wanting to even check it out Multiplayer is mainly about ruining the gameplay experience for other players and for the biggest part me as well as other players on steam community has left a negative review for this reason as well the company focuses on new content to invite in game purchases such as 'shark cards'.If you are hoping to purchase this game mainly for its multiplayer feature please find an other game you will not experience a cooperative multiplayer experience however it will only force you leave a negative review like this one.Best part of the game in Single Player campaign which has an interesting and immersive storyline with stunning graphics however my overall experience of the game which includes MULTIPLAYER is poor.,Grand Theft Auto V

The online game constantly glitches in and out of matchs and good luck trying to find anyone willing to do any of the content as the name of this game should be TROLL until you can t troll anymore. The community is toxic as heck and no one wants to do anything with you. Not to mention the amount of cheats and hacks taking place in random maps. This game has more hacks then a Russian Trump election cycle! Think toxic Reddit on crack. The online gameplay is cancer just do yourself a favor and stay far far away from it. The game itself the story play is actually pretty good and I liked how the in game controls feel much better than GTA IV. The characters are much better and much more things to do in the game then in the past. What Rockstar was thinking when going against single player for the cancer known as online I have no idea. I just can not recommend this game at all not for full price maybe 75 percent off but that s it. Replay value is very low in story mode and just doesn t offer anything outside of that. Where online was suppose to keep it going its just reddit toxicity on roids. If you like trolling this is your game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,377,False,Not Recommended,What started out as a quality game has rapidly degraded into a cash grab on the part of Rockstar. The single player was excellent and I was looking forward to the announced DLC. Online microtransactions were unobtrusive and content was accessable with reasonable effort. However the game has gone downhill from there. No singleplayer DLC was released and content released online began to be restricted from singleplayer. Prices rised on items online to the point you would assume the game was free to play as the focus clearly shifted to selling in game currency. This was frustrating but not a deal breaker. However the final straw was rockstar killing the single player modding community clearly in an effort to drive more players online and to buy in game currency. The modding community was what made GTA V such a fun game worth sinking hundreds of hours into. I bought several shark cards (the in game currency) to support the developers who at the time were creating more content in addition to creating a sandbox for modding. Unless somthing changes I will never buy a Rockstar or Take Two product ever again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-25,0,0,116,False,Recommended,"My review for Grand Theft Auto V Ah where do I begin for GTA V? Final score will be on the bottom if you don't want to read my review. This game offers so many things to do endless replayability and not exactly the best online mode.I will not talk about the online version in this review since I have not played it much and I really don't like the concept but again this will not be rated.First of all I'd like to address the graphics. The graphics in this game are quite impressive for a 2013/2015 game (due to pc and console releases I had to put two dates) and they still hold up quite well today. They have good textures on most things but I did find a few issues like very low poly textures and just overall bad textures but that doesn't mean that the graphics aren't impressive. The graphics are quite good and my final score for them will be an 8.8/10.The gameplay is just something that I absolutely adore and I can just jump into a game of GTA V whether I'm happy sad anxious etc. It is some of the most fun that I ever have and every single time I boot up the game I feel the exact same excitement that I felt when I first booted it up. This gameplay is top notch and I would go for this game only for the gameplay if you want some good fun. I give this a score of 10/10.The world is a great with 81 km2 (31 m2) to explore with every little nook and cranny detailed to the last bit. There is wonderful greenery to an action packed city and it all comes together very well. There are so many unique and interesting locations to explore it's crazy. There's even an altruist camp in the hills! The world is very good and detailed so I will give this a 9.5/10.The story wasn't exactly my favourite thing but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It had some very odd funny and memorable moments to it. I enjoyed completing it with it involving quite a few hours of content. The ending was cool provided you chose the good one. A thing that the story could have used is multiple choices because the only time that those appeared were during heists or the final mission. Story could be better but was memorable and had some very good moments to it the final score for it will be a 7.5/10.The side quests were a little bit hard to come across but I found that most of them were very interesting but at times they felt quite typical. I remember that one of the missions required you to knock down some politician's signs for whatever reason . They were interesting and some of them included some sort of side story line you could call it. The side quests gets an 8.5/10.The amount of content in this game is huge and the amount of things to do also is. You can infiltrate military bases become the flash with some mods just about anything! This is one of the reasons why I love this game so much. The content for me is a 9.5/10.And for my honourable mention director mode. Director mode allows you to use cheats play as different characters (i.e gang members story characters road workers etc.) and even though that mods allow you to do this you can just resort to director mode if you don't like installing mods don't know how or just don't want to. The director mode is the first of its kind in the series and for me I would rate it 9.5/10 I think it could have used some more cheats like drunk mode.And for the bugs. I usually dislike talking about bugs but I didn't come across any game breaking bugs the only ones that I experienced were some lighting bugs and a police officer constantly getting in and out of his car. The bug optimization was good and I'd give a 9/10.The optimization for this game... it may be one of the best that I've ever seen apart from the witcher 3. You can run this on a very old machine a potato but it may not look too good. I recommend that you have at least a semi high end build for this game to run stably and look really nice. The optimization for me gets a 9.5/10.I do not have any major complaints other than the story being a little bit lacking compared to the other GTA games a minor one would be how much Rockstar focuses on online and really tries to get your money by telling you to buy their ""Shark Cards"". They are constantly releasing dlc and new things for online though which is a very good thing and most of the dlc is a lot of fun from what I've heard.I love this game so much and I cannot recommend it enough to someone who loves to have fun in an open world action game that is jam packed with content. The final score for Grand Theft Auto V is 9.7/10 I decided to bring the score up because of how much content this game has and just how much fun it is and I cannot recommend it enough.",Grand Theft Auto V

My current thoughts on the game is that I'm glad it is getting long term support. I can always respect a game with a long lifespan. I got around 500 hours of gameplay out of this. The thing is I am the type of player that would rather slowly grind than to pay for content. So due to my dislike for microtrascations I ended up relizing that my solo CEO warhouse farming strategy was not a ""fun"" experience. Therefore I simply stopped playing the game. So when I found out that the modding commnuity was beeing negativly impacted by Take Two I used the situration to express d my discontent with the payment model of this game.

There are plenty of players though so thats not the issue but its the loading times and the awful match making system that disconnects from the entire mission if just 1 crew member left.Then you will have to start all over again with loading 2 3 times again before you can retry a mission perhaps because someone disconnected.Come on Rockstar I know you can do better than this.Also about the hacker problem online I havnt noticed as many of them as people like to claim there are. Im sure it has been worse before I started playing it recently but really I can't see where all those hackers should be. (except for in people's minds) pSo all in all a very decent time killer. 85% approval.Both multiplayer and singleplayer and of course... I can't wait for the next one to come out!",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,1,2,961,False,Not Recommended,Good stuff A lot of references From Kubrik's Space Odyssey to Austin Powers. (only for GTA Online)Living world and interesting characters in a nice but short singleplayer story.Bad stuff Loading screens (as've been mentioned by many players). You'll load in/out of your house/office/garage/life. Any mission requires you to load. TWICE. first in lobby then in mission itself (loading can crash/host can leave/any player can leave and you'll be kicked back to freemode (if you're lucky enough) or back to singleplayer (because all roads in gta online will eventually lead you to singleplayer). With every of those loadings taking from about 4 to *distance to pluto in cm* minutes.Bad netcode. You can catch desync at any time. When racing with other players someone may crash into you and kick you off the road but it'll happen only on your side means even the player that crashed into you won't know about it. During pvp match you won't hit other players. That's it.. you just won't be able to kill anyone (but they'll be able to kill you). Even in freemode you can get your kicked by that exasperating netcode Riding in freemode ? Be ready to see cops civilians spawn/despawn in front of you smash into your car client side (means even your passengers won't know why you just decided to kiss that road barrier on your left). Sometimes they may even start to f****ng fly dance around you like someone is dragin' them like a folder with their mouse.32 slots servers which makes (even when full) servers feel empty. No anticheat (AT ALL) they can monitor players activity but there's nothing that can stop players from using immortality aimbot(it's just pathetic) speed hacks (whyy?) spawn things in/around you spawn money (for themselves as well as for you (spoiler you'll get banned for this)) kick you back to singleplayer or just crash your game and in fact do pretty much anything they want to without even getting banned after all (because they can remove all the reports).You want money? You'll have to grind for bloody days/weeks to get good things (exception owners of shark cards or cheaters).Ridiculous pricing You can buy an underground super evilish (bald cat is not included) facility with auto aiming orbital cannon and your own death squad for a price of a sport vehicle or buy a coat for a price of a house. Lazy/silly design solutions huge villa with pool has the same interior as a cheap in town apartament (there's about 5 interior designs for about 50 different buildings). Fiddly interface and drip feed dlc every time. Not to speak of character customization which is just awful.PVP balance issues you are either using rocket launcher sticky bombs and M82 with explosive rounds.. or you are dead. If you are a peaceful player (just as i am) then you'll suffer penalties/limitations for being in passive mode Inability to use any weapons (self defence/PVE missions in freemode forget about it. Any NPC will still be able to kill you but you can't even use your own fists). Any MC/CEO/VIP missions (which is the main (if not the only) profit in freemode) will be locked for you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-30,0,0,234,False,Recommended,ENG Singleplayer/Story Well who knows Rockstars gangster epos series knows what a great job they do on this. Who ever played any of the Grand Theft Auto games will agree that the games create a great atmosphere around the well produced story.To the graphics I've already played GTA V on my good old Xbox 360 and I loved it. When the next gen console versions came out Rockstar Games had done a beautiful job on renewing the graphics from the first person FOV to the overall textures of the city. When the game finally released on PC they've made a even more fascinating work. Every detail was worked out well and even not that good computers could easily beat the console graphics with *drum roll* stunning 60fps.To the gameplay We all agree Rockstar Games had always a good eye for a good story. But in the former games there was not that much to do well apart from doing the missions or beat up some cops until GTA San Andreas and also GTA IV brought in new activities. From casinos or barber shops in San Andreas to ordering a big number 9 with extra dip at YOUR nearest Cluckin' Bell. Grand Theft Auto V brought in even new and I mean a whole bunch of new activities to do. From hunting over playing golf or tennis to having some fun at Del Perro's Pier or even tuning your favorite car. In total GTA V offers a huge world with a bunch of stuff waiting for you.To the story Without wanting to spoiler you I can make it a bit shorter the story is a gangster epos of the best class. The developers spent their pocket money well (amazing $265 million). I can recommend the game for everyone it doesn't matter if you have played the previous games or not apart from some nice references to previous games is the story in GTA V a complete own one.To modding There are amazing mods out there that you should try. From simple graphic mods to complex additions with new story elements. But watch out You should never use any mod in GTA Online yeah some are really impressing but some can really take the fun from other gamers.GTA Online As the story mode is a great produced story GTA Online is bringing in a whole new perspective you play as a by your self created and designed character newcomer to Los Santos just waiting to work your way up in the gangster hierarchy. Compete or form crews with other players. There are as many activities as there are in the story mode but you can also buy yourself a nice and tidy apartment from where you can at the end start heists to complete with your friends. Fill your garages with cars and motorcycles as you want to and improve them at your favorite Los Santos Customs! Then use them to let your friends eat dust in diverse races across the whole map. Later on you can buy yourself businesses to make even more money.The only frustrating parts of GTA Online are that there are many hackers on their way on the servers and during the last year the game has turned a very frustrating way in where you need much more money than you can make during a fair time. This is what we call making money by Rockstar by forcing the players to buy sharkcards a way you get ingame money for purchasing with real money. Doesn't sound fair? It isn'tIn total GTA V with GTA Online is a nice package with some really good spent money and a whole bunch of game hours to enjoy.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,691,False,Recommended,GTA Five is a game in which you can do things that mimic real life. For instance you can play Tennis or ride a bike or drive a car. The game heavily encourages players to partake in a number of criminal activities such as gang turf wars and robbing convenience stores. However I have found it personally rewarding making my money legally like winning car and parachute races! No matter what kind of lifestyle you choose GTA Five has got you covered. 10/10 Avoid this game at all costs if you don't like wonderful things.3 years after I wrote this I still feel the same. It's one of the best games you can buy on steam. Rockstar has continuously updated their game with new content throughout the life time of this game. If you don't pick this game up I don't think we can be friends.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-02-23,0,0,268,False,Recommended,It's a good game for sure. First of all the story mode is amazing and the best story they've had in any GTA game (can't quite compete with the non GTA Rockstar games though). The multiplayer although very problemtic is still fun. Even if you don't have friends to play with you can still play online with random people as long as they aren't modders or killing you for no reason. The biggest con for the game are the modders. They will ruin you experience for sure. They will blow you up teleport you around and just cause chaos in general. The best thing to do in that situation is change to a different session or if you're playing with friends make a private session. Get this game when it goes on sale and you can't go wrong. The story mode alone is worth the sale price even if you don't want to play online (I recommend it though. Don't let a few modders ruin your fun of the game).,Grand Theft Auto V

Until you get banned for no reason whatsoever. Let me explain.After newly acquiring the game i invested 3 hours into the Online part of the game . i created my character edited it made it just fine.after that the tutorial played out. i did it and joined a session with 6 or more players experienced a bit of lag with one of them . decided to do smth else like shooting range ( to rank up the characters aim ) and to get a personal car .i was all set .time to makes some money i joined a TDM just to see what maps it got. finished it . decided to take a break .15 minutes later i recieve a message on my e mail from rockstar in which the company claimed that i modifed the game files and altered the game experience for others . Got banned for 30 days because of just playing the game . decided to do smth about it . i said to myself it would be easy just a missconception . went to R* support.So just to sum up everything up until now downloaded 66.9 GB of a game i can only play half of for a month . the game had some fps stuttering i fixed that up too.and then after the game was playeble and it finally reached that glorious 90 fps i decided to play it . rockstar didnt like that their new customer decided to use their game for which he payed for and banned him.After getting on the R* support forums i made a ""ticket request"" as they like to call it .gave some major info about my computer trough a DxDiag file wrote a complaint letter in which i stated that i wanted to be informed when a solution was available and waited. 1 Day later I recieved this Hello Thank for your recent contact to Rockstar Support regarding reporting a cheater or a ban appeal.

2017-06-22,0,0,398,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is both a pretty solid Singleplayer and Multiplayer game. The gameplay is fun the storyline is alright (a bit cliché and cheesy but not cringe worthy) there's tons of content constantly being released for free. Overall GTA V is a pretty amazing game. The Multiplayer aspect is quite enjoyable (for the most part) it's fun to get to hang out with your friends beating missions/heists/or just ing around. Getting content is quite grindy though and in order to have the fun and unlock stuff you have to grind for hours just to watch that money disappear in half a second buying a few small items. It's quite clear that the multiplayer economy is designed around the user buying shark cards. The mission menus and loading times are hell at times. Waiting to get 4 people to do a heist for example can take a solid 15mins at times just to fill the lobby then is someone quits or disconnects during that time the heist is failed and you go back to the lobby to wait again going back though all the loading screens. These problems do make the game not enjoyable though. I feel like it's still a very solid game and with all the new content that keeps coming out there's always new stuff to play and the game stays quite fresh. The Singleplayer aspect is pretty fun but once you finish the main story and start finishing side missions it starts to get stale quickly. There's also a lot less content coming out for Singleplayer than there is Multiplayer. It's still fun to muck around and do stunts and muck around but it's a lot more fun with your friends so you may as well just play online. However you used to be able to use mods to extend gameplay enhance your game update graphics. That is until Take Two Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of the modding tool OpenIV. OpenIV is a modding tool that does not affect Multi player in any way. There is pretty much no reason for it to be taken down as it only affects Singleplayer and that person's enjoyment. They really shot themselves in the leg with this one I hope they actually give the community a good reason to change their reviews.,Grand Theft Auto V

On top of the random kill streak players who will randomly kill any player just for a laugh The rest of my problems are a load of hackers/modders using trainers to with a game I was hoping had vastly improved.I would have not bought this game even for the discount if I knew how bad the cheater situation was and the only reason I am not asking for a refund is that I still like the single player. However I will not change my opinion on this game until Rockstar does something to fix this hacker situation in this now shoddy game.,Grand Theft Auto V

They got lost in all the money idiots were spending on the multiplayer scam. Only recently have people realized that the mutiplayer was just a scam to bad it is to late. The idiot players set the tone since they spent so much on shark cards not realizeing the scam they were buying into. Any and all singleplayer DLC was scrapped because of this.

2017-12-05,0,0,1205,False,Not Recommended,This game has a great single player. If you are going to buy it do it for the single player. The online mode is one of the best online games I have ever played. It has an RPG like leveling system built around how much money you have or can make ingame. If you play the game fairly there is always incentive to get more money and to buy more stuff. Making money is also fairly easy.However.... do not expect to play the online game for longer than an hour as the cancerous tumor known as online modders will destroy any fun you would have had. If you even think for one second you can kick them or report them your are sorely mistaken. Rockstar has no intention of protecting its players from online modders. If you really want to play it online. I suggest you play it on another platform.Or purchase this game and download your mods and have fun toiling in your insignificant existance if the only thing that gives you the slightest bit of sexual pleasure is griefing other players with your 'god mode mod'. You will die alone. P.S. Don't worry about the micro transactions. Even if the shark cards are probably the best way to impliment mictro transactions into a game without breaking the balancing. Just get a modder to drop you money. Ofcourse that would ruin the whole purpose of the game but it who cares right ?,Grand Theft Auto V

Single player mods are doing absolutely no harm whatsoever to your game I think that these modders are making GTA V a much better game because the truth is I don't really enjoy story mode so much so single player is just boring without mods. The world you created in Los Santos is so detailed and so well made that I think it should be explored more but without mods it just gets really damn boring. I'm sorry but that's the truth.

2015-12-18,0,0,388,False,Not Recommended,"tl dr game was great but newer content raises price of admission and stagnates rewards forcing you to buy shark cards. If grinding isn't your thing and you only play online stay away.Grand Theft Auto V had the recipe for long lasting success literally smacked across its face 1. GTA Brand2. Award Winning and experienced dev team3. Biggest game yet both in single player and in multiplayer4. Made a billion dollars in 3 days of its releaseThings were going great yet corporate greed and community ignorance has sucked the enjoyment and grind of its amazing online multiplayer and brought it to its knees.Don't get me wrong if you buy the game now and put time into it you'll still have boatloads of fun. But when you're 40 hours into the game and see the scummy Rockstar has done to suck more money out of you you'll quickly notice the many flaws this game has adopted with 5 years on the market.To give you an example when my buddies and I first started playing the game on PC in 2015 we used to do everything Deathmatches Survival Racing free roam fun etc. It was great fun. With so many hours though things get stale and you start looking forward to new content. So what did we get?1. Adversary mode (Which is a running joke at this point poor martin)2. Motorcycle Clubhouses CEO Clubhouses Bunkers Hangars and Facilities.3. Recently the addition of the After Hours content.All of this is free which should be great right? Wrong. The main thing all of these 'free' additions have in common is that they are all there to in a sense ""Spend money to make money"" and basically grind hours upon hours to earn next to nothing. Not only that they have skyrocketed the price of entry with everything they add basically forcing anybody who doesn't have the time to grind or want to hack and risk getting banned to buy OVERLY EXPENSIVE shark cards.So now the main thing my friends and I did was grind for money. That was always the goal keep grinding for more money so we can buy a singular digital cool car and grind more so we can customize its incredibly expensive modifications. No more fun no more hijinks all work.When the game first came out the Adder was recognized as one of the fastest supercars and it was worth only $1 million. Now the tezeract (DLC Car) is worth $2.8 million and other kookier vehicles go much MUCH higher than that ($5+ million).It's ridiculous. If you have a job and can't spend 10+ hours a day grinding away to get a car you want this game is no longer for you.But who am I kidding it's GTA V and people are gonna keep buying it anyways.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-26,1,2,46,False,Recommended,"The game is a timeless classic by the world famous and renowned developer Rockstar Games who also brought us games like Max Payne 3 and L.A. Noire.This game is a great value if you get it for its complex well thought out campaignwhich is rich of interesting and remarkable charakters be it the protagonists or the people of Los Santos you will meet in the streets and outskirts.You can't go wrong with this game if you get it for the aforementioned things it sure is worth your money( especially on it's quite frequent sales it has )A quick little rundown as to why this game is not just worth your money but also your time of which it approx. costs 50 70h depending of how invested you get into the story and all the little appearences on the side of which there are plenty.The game stands out due to the following Well made vivid world which feels immersive and alive the city is your playground 3 main charakters all of them with interesting stories interweaving in a mix consisting of Trust morale drama satire self irony and a whole lot of absurdity. The world feels reactive and responding. Rich of details reaching from realistic car mechanics to flopping flip flops. Well made vehicle engine cars feel diverse and responsive to drive same goes for bikes motorbikes planes helicopters jet bikes and everything else this game's fleet has to offer. A vast arsenal of guns and tools at your disposal The game's graphic engine still holds up 3 years later with potential to even improve it further by mods. The game is full of complementary side stories and random encounters that make the world feel dynamic and satisfying.Modding If there is one thing that is inseperable bound to GTA then it surely has to be modding.Modding has a long lasting and quite far backreaching history with this game starting with it's earlier iterations.Not too loing ago Rockstar had the stroke of a genius a true brain wave to disallow the tool (Open IV)that allows mods of all kinds to be integrated in the game files which resulted in a public outcry and Rockstar eventually coming to senses and re allowing it.Modding gives this game a new sense and way of replayability it allows for even more endless hours of fun in a game already packed to the rim.The story itself is starting of by introducing Michael once succesful bank robber now in a witness protection programm living his remaining years together with his ungrateful family in a big house in the hills of Los Santos.Soon problems arise due Michael loosing his temper all to quick. A debt has to be paid forcing Michael back in his old life he thought he once and for all left behind. At this time the second main charakter Franklin an afro american who wants to stand at his own legs but struggles with the people he is surrounded by is being introduced .The situation becomes more ludicrous and unpredictble as Michaels wingman Trevor once partner in crime appears back from the supposed dead at his doorsteps.Soon Michael and his partners in crime see themselves confronted by problems bigger than their capabilities and that is where they must start an up hill battle against the odds. The game is well animated runs great on mildy aged systems and is a worthy succesor to its predecessor.This is just a small excerpt of my thoughts about this game and I hope I was able to convince you to ""give it a shot""See you in Los Santos don't get lost in it's swamp of crime and corruption",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V like most GTA games is a lot of fun while the story lasts. Unfortunately though GTAV continues the trend started in the previous title of having little to no additional content once the story is completed. There are properties and businesses to buy but no additional repeatable missions mini games or other forms of income you would need to actually buy them. The heists were interesting at first and the idea behind having a crew that increases in talents as you do more heists is interesting. However it's all smoke and mirrors there are no more heists once you complete the few ones available in the story and the game punishes you for picking any but the most expensive highly skilled crew members regardless. Rockstar instead focused on the online Multiplayer which features a highly exploitative business model. For $60 the singleplayer isn't enough as there is no post game content. From here on out singleplayer content which has been the best part of the GTA series is officially dead in favor of the online multiplayer and appropriately named ""Shark Cards.""With an interesting story but very shallow content otherwise GTAV doesn't have anywhere near the staying power of older games in it's series and similar games such as GTA 3 GTA Vice City GTA San Andreas Saint's Row 1 3 etc. Add to that that the Publisher Take Two has declared that singleplayer modding is illegal it can be expected that the GTA series and likely anything else produced by Rockstar will continue on in this manner. To conclude GTAV simply does not provide the same value as should be expected of a modern AAA $60 title. There is no interesting content outside of the story in singleplayer the online multiplayer is designed in a way to only be enjoyable if you pay extra the most interesting parts of the singleplayer are built on underutilized mechanics it will not keep you entertained for nearly as long as other similarly priced games and finally the publisher will not allow members of the community to contribute their own singleplayer content as anything that deters it's players from the online multiplayer cannot be accepted.

2017-10-18,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,Hi I have had gta 5 for some time and just wanted to write a review on my findings in this time. I played the story which i found very appealing however as soon as i went online i realised that Rockstar went the completely wrong route with the game. The whole idea is to bring updates and content specifically to the online side of things instead of improving the single player campain. I WILL NOT fork out more money for something i have already paid for and considering i already paid around about 60 for the game i can say now its not worth it. I would not recommend the game to anyone as all they want you to do is get hooked online then fork out all your hard earned cash on shark cards i can honestly say until such time as rockstar stops trying to trick people with crap i will never again buy a Rockstar purchase! Alot more focus needs put into the Main story campain and not focused purely on Online time to get a grip Rockstar and realised you have mucked up. Make changes or your fans will not remain by your side!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-24,0,0,213,False,Not Recommended,This game has done some pretty questionable things and left some fans like myself to wonder why this/that are not in the game why it's buggy why can't they change it ETC. Campaign was fun until you reach the point of boredom. You would have moved on to Online or played around with mods. I've always wondered why Online had so much more content and was never added to Singleplayer. It would make their DLCs better with some sort of new story line of Micheal Franklin and Trevor doing more. Even more I want to know why most DLCs items (Vehicles Clothes Weapons ETC) aren't in Singleplayer. At least with the help of mods they can be added.If we move on to Online. It's horrible... Sure you get all the DLCs make your own character and mess around with friends in fun mission modes. You will end up dicovering a bad side of Online. Hackers rule GTA 5 and innocett players are banned permeanently for no reason! It's obvious that moderators can't patrol all of the Online servers but that doesn't mean you have to have a buggy anti hacking system ban you for 30 days or permeanently. If you have mods on Singleplayer it could potenially bug out and be brought to Multiplayer for 1 second. Of course the system will pick up on it and you will be guilty of modding/hacking. Rockstar Support can't even say anything about it. You ask them your problem and what can you do they will brush it off as if you were a immature hacker.For right now Rockstar need to do better on moderation than new content.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-12,1,2,285,False,Not Recommended,Regarding GTA Online A toxic community a slimy business model and a complacent developer come together to create a giant pile of garbage. This game is set up like a free to play game. Except it costs $30 to play. ALL players look the same Rockstar allows hacking is allowed in this game so long as it doesn't have to do with money (aka Rockstar's profits). All vehicles and assets are overpriced. The entire economy is clearly designed to screw you over as hard as possible as to coerce you into buying a Shark Card (buying in game cash with real cash). While it's a massive struggle to make any appreciable amount of money it's very easy to lose it though purchases or player griefing. Missions where you sell produced goods can be intruded by enemy players and destroyed. Note that you make essentially nothing even in ideal conditions. Players are both endorsed and equipped by Rockstar to grief one another. The only way to have a somewhat enjoyable experience is to deny GTA internet permission long enough for you to be pushed into your own server alone. New vehicle additions are more and more overpowered. Coupled with some other points this is the most beginner unfriendly game I've ever seen since Rust (primarily due to player griefing and being ill equipped. Unless you have a reliable group of friends to play with you have NO incentive to play this game. Customization is confusing and in some instances absolutely broken. As a player of GTA you will be advised constantly to play Online alone until the rank of 100 if you want any chance of survival against over players.

2019-01-30,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,I'm going to review the singleplayer and multiplayer in two different sections as I feel they are two very different experiences in this game.Singleplayer The singleplayer in this game was pretty good. The feeling of progression as you complete missions harkons back to when I played GTA San Andreas somewhat. The story was pretty average as far as a R* game goes and the immersion you feel when exploring the world was quite good as would be expected from a R* game. The replayability is so so due to the linearity and lack of choice in most missions. However I had good fun playing the singleplayer back when the game was new and I was looking forward to what they would do with the multiplayer.Multiplayer It #%$&amp ing sucks. The multiplayer in GTA Online is anti consumer and anti fun. It feels like the game design is built around you getting bored of grinding and buying some overpriced microtransactions. Charging 100 real life dollars for 8 million dollars in game seems like a bad joke especially when you take into account the fact that 8 mil really isn't all that significant and can't buy you much. The immorality of this practice is also amplified by the fact that gta online's playerbase consists of little kids who wouldn't know better than to drink R*'s Koolaid. My recommendation is that if you *really* want to buy this game avoid the multiplayer like it's the plague.,Grand Theft Auto V

LOL and than as i stated i do not mod nor cheat nor do i play with them as 99% of the time i force myself into solo session which allowed me to do my drop offs without others interfering...When i was suspended i contacted R* and 1st i asked IF i force solo session will i get ban or suspended ( force solo is sure most know couple ways pulling ethernet cord for few secs or goin into task manager suspending gta 5 for 5 secs 10).... R* said NO we will NOT ban u for force solo session... so i ruled that out and also since i know i dont mod can rule that out.. so left me stunned cause now im lost and suspended from GTA 5 for ....nothing...seriously nothing..they claim i did sumthing that flagged my account yet i cant figure it out...and R* by no means wants to help or assist with the removal of the ban or even help to find the prob that is flagging my account...so wtf R*... they told me best thing and only thing they can tell me is delete all trace of GTA5 and reinstall...i did and once i did i checked the integrity of the files.. all seemed good... suspension ended ....during the suspension i only played story mode very lil...but logged bak into online andplayed alil.. bam...its over for this account .....wow literally did no wrong i solo session 99% of the time i do not hassle others in any way and i dont ever atk them when they do missions or vip so im done and ...all i can say is when i got to play it was fun ..lots of fun i would stay up all hours but i honestly wish R* would change the way they r dealing with these bans and such its nonsense...,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,1145,False,Not Recommended,Well i used to love gta 5 i still play it all the time but they just banned modding for singleplayer. btw hackers still run rampant all across online so the ban on modding had 0 effect at all on hackers or (modders) as some call them in online. all it has done it ruin your freedom and immersion for singleplayer.as for multiplayer since the ceo vehicle update they've added some cool vehicles however most of them are utterly useless with how much they're nerfed or just plain broken. 1st the Phantom Wedge a diesel with a metal ram on the front to flip cars over and away. sounds awesome right? except it dies after running into and flipping about 50 cars. which isnt a lot especially for what the vehicle is supposed to be. in fact the normal diesel can run into more cars before it dies. and the ramp buggy is in the same boat except about half of that. it's a buggy that is literally just a moving ramp.2nd The Technical Aqua was released months ago with a fatal bug. the driver of the vehicle has little effect from this however everyone else in the session including passengers and gunners will see the vehicle desynced as hell. now what i mean by this is the drivers can be driving through the streets and on everyone elses screen he'll be teleporting all over and running into walls for 5 minutes straight pretending to drive then teleport across the map becuse it sync's every so often. this bug has been out for months and then rockstar releases the new gunrunning DLC and add a vehicle with the EXACT SAME BUG the new APC has it. so not only have they not fixed the bug but they've released another vehicle with the same issue that they already knew about. making the vehicles completely useless unless you just want to look at it and say it's pretty without ever getting into it.3rd i do have to mention that the new jet bike (Oppressor) they've added in the gunrunning update works like a charm and is by far the funnest vehicle you can ever have. however the machine guns on it are useless and only server to stop you from using and real weapons. atleast until you unlock and equip the rockets which btw it gets 20 rockets before they run out which is a plenty. especially when the night rider car only gets 8 or so.4th the rocket voltic is waesome in the missions and races and is fun for a bit in the open world however in the open world the cooldown on the engine is over doubled for no real reason so you wont get anywhere faster then a normal super car.5th the wastlander (flatbed russian style truck) can't hold vehicles. enough said.6th Armored Boxville so this vehicle is a armored rv essentially with a snowplow on the front. and it doesnt take any damage from ramming vehicles head on. WHAT?! so the diesel with a giant 20ft metal cone the flip and push cars can hit a few cars and die but a rv with a snow plow doesnt take damage from ramming? WTF ROCKSTAR way to make the Phantom Wedge Useless along with the Ramp Buggy when they had so much potential.7th The Anti Aircraft trailer well it counts as a personal vehicle so you can't call it in and have a personal vehicle to tow it. so you get some pickup truck with no additional armor upgrades so well that's .oh yea and if you're in any public online session with any players then there is always atleast one hacker in the session.,Grand Theft Auto V

Grinding missions all day can usually net you 200k to maybe 450K for heists (which by the way the've never added a new hesit) and they charge $99.99USD for $8mil in game currency. Do you see what's wrong with this picture? This AAA title is treated like a F2P money grab and it's disgusting. With their new movement of banning modding in all forms they are effectively ruining what life was left in this game. This game isn't worth a dime anymore spend your cash on a game who's created by a company that can actually give a about their player base. I'd reccommend Player Unkowns if you don't have it yet.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,349,False,Not Recommended,"Before you dismiss my negative review on basis of OpenIV or my 300 hour+ playtime I'd like to start by saying GTA V used to be good once upon a time.The online was really fun and all the DLC has been ""free"" so far. The problem is that after Benzies left they abandoned their best feature the heists. They just kept pumping out lower and lower quality content that required more and more grinding to play. It's like playing an MMORPG that you can only upgrade in by putting in 10 20x the normal time for an MMO or by directly spending real life money on the game. They only care about money at this point. Which is ludicrious as they would have made a boat load of money with a single player expansion or two. The content could be intergrated into Online too to give them some extra cash on the cheap. But they do the opposite they intentionally don't put any new online content into the single player as they want you to grind/buy shark cards online and it's much easier to get money on singleplayer through mods and stock market.Gunrunning DLC and the OpenIV debacle pretty much sealed the deal for me in the end.",Grand Theft Auto V

I expected a better delivery from what people call the most expensive game of all time but still theres an great game here anyway while they could have improved the singleplayer mode a little bit with some updates among other things like bringing some more depth to it and adding the content from the online part like cars or such to buy its still a good singleplayer mode anyway but sadly after you finish it theres nothing else to do and it feels so dead this definitely is not the best GTA game its not even in my top 3 gta games but its still a great game besides all the hate it gets here what I like about V's new mechanics is the 3 characters system it was a good addition and at least it tried to innovate the series by being a new concept the biggest problem here is with the Online part it started as something so promising and good and become an absolute chore grindfest where you either have to spend more than 200 hours just on it to get good or spend your money on sharkcards to ''get all the fun'' Im not going to lie theres still some enjoyment to find on Online all you need is some dedication but hey no one is looking to find a secondary job on a game looking what the Online mode has become all I need to say is its good ??? yes but it never reached its full potential and became worse as time passed and now it left a bunch of customers fearing what would be the future of the next Rockstar games that now they've showed their greedy nature BEWARE!Get this game during a sale. Gta V is great but there was room for more improvement in the series than this especially in singleplayer Online mode is not as good as I was supposed to be its mediocre at best but works as an extension to the singleplayer.Would I replay It ?Yes for singleplayer as for multiplayer I'm done with it.,Grand Theft Auto V

The singleplayer part of this game makes GTA V one of the best games that I have played so far. The story is really good and most of the missions are really fun to do. You grow to love the three main characters.The multiplayer is much better if you have friend to play with as you need three other people to do most of the heists and you often need other trustworthy people to employ in your criminal empire that you try to create online. However the multiplayer experience is not without problems. You could work hours or days to build up a stock of illegal gods in your business and all of that can be easlily nullified in a second by a greifer with a homing missile. There are lots of griefers out there and the game balance is heavily tilted towards the people who want to wreck your progress just for giggles. It creates a paradox where people in a multiplayer game tries to do their best not play with other people. And then we have the ""modders"" people using cheats to ruin your experience. At least you can just go in to a new session if you see them.Anyway the grinding progress online can be very addicting as you work towards your individual goals and you might find yourself investing hundreds of hours trying to make money to buy all the cool things that is on offer online.Even if you find that you hate the online aspect of this game it is well worth the price to pay for the single player part of it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-16,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,"So after playing GTA 5 at a relatively constant 60 FPS (with a few unexplained frame drops here and there) I put the game down for a few weeks. Yesterday i picked it back up and it turns out a few people out there have been modding the game. Threatened by the constant downpour of killer whales (look it up) Rockstar decided the best course of action for this game was to kick it repetitively in its gonads till it ran at such a poor framerate it could have been mistaken for a power point presentation. Blissfully unaware of the situation I loaded up the game and switched to franklin. Right off the bat i realised something was wrong what with the floating health packs and unfurnished rooms in his house. That and the abysmal frame rate of the game varying from anywhere between 30 and 2 FPS. I presumed that it was because I had just loaded in and it was going to jump back to a non potato framerate immanently so I headed out of the house into the street. Here the frame rate dropped back down again and the pop in was so bad that segments of the game looked like they had been taken from the original GTA San Andreas. Again segments of the map failed to load with invisible walls left right and centre. The driving was even worse since i was traversing the map at a higher speed leading to larger frame rate drops god only knows what flying is like! Threatened by the 1% of modders that might decide to use their powers maliciously ""sexually assaulting"" other players (again look it up) rather than spawning in a playable Elizabeth Comstock from Bioshock Infinite Rockstar have gone on some kind of banhammer crusade against all those that attempt to change their .ini files for a non headache inducing FOV. How dare these players enjoy the game enough to start programing assets and making adjustments to the code in their spare time! It seems strange coming from a developer like Rockstar to reject the incorporation of steam workshop mods since they themselves add content updates to the game every month or so to ensure some kind of guaranteed replay value. Games like Skyrim show that handing over the keys to third party modders can breathe new life into older games and ensure that they remain relevant it would make much more sense to allow mods in the single player story mode which can be turned off online. Anyhow in this latest update Rockstar have decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater to make sure that neither player nor Modder can actually run the darn game properly.The sad thing about this whole affair is that if you'd have asked me a few weeks ago I would have wholeheartedly recommended GTA 5 to anyone with even a mild interest in the genre of open world crime games (at full price no less and we all know how hard it is to justify selling an older game on PC at 39.99). And to top it all off you know what the turd flavoured icing on this metaphorical cake is? I like many other users don't really use the online feature. The one time I did a friend and I just went round stealing jets from a military base we weren t hacked or griefed at all. Sure it s pretty unscientific to take data from one guy and his experience of the game at one point in time but you have to understand that from my point of view this latest update of the game was utterly pointless and downright insulting to the consumer. In its current state I cannot possibly recommend this game to anyone.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-16,0,0,401,False,Not Recommended,The current state that this game is in over the past month or two are just disgraceful.

I've verified and reverified but no results. I've tried to get my money back for this utter disgrace of a game but Valve said no (I kind of figured as much since I have so many hours on it). Before the problem posted above there was the rampant problem of the hackers ruining the online portion of the game and Rockstar doing next to nothing about it. The only thing they'd do is just blind ban anyone involved and call it a day. Now there's less people who can even play the game which in turn decreased the amount of hackers.I would not recommend this game to anyone ever!

I won't even go into whether its too much grinding or trying to get you to buy microtransactions I'm not here to complain about balance or about what is or isn't OP. The problem here is simple there are WAY too many cheaters. If you play for more than an hour or so chances are good you'll run into at least one cheater in the lobby (for whatever reason called ""modders"" in this game). These are people whos idea of fun is to ruin your experience with exploits such as but not limited to spawning objects/invisible walls into the world randomly forcing the cops to attack you (giving you 5 stars) pulling you out of your vehicles (even helicoptors and jets mid flight) spawning cages around you even in passive mode they can still grief you easily and your only recourse is to leave the game.This type of cheating makes upgrading feel futile. It begs the question as to why you should bother investing lots of time into the game to purchase better equipment. After all what does it matter how well I upgrade my tank is if a hacker can just force my character to exit the tank and then spawn a cage around me.Cheating was always a problem in this game and Rockstar's response has never been adequate. For example even if you identify a hacker once they leave the lobby you cannot report them for hacking through the in game system. If you send Rockstar a personal email about it they tell you to use the in game system but the in game system doesnt work if they leave the lobby first. What a joke. A majority of the negative reviews for this game are complaining because almost nothing is being done about the cheaters hackers exploiters modders whatever you wanna call them.TLDR an excellent game a great idea but it is ruined by a toxic community and no support from the developers to adequately moderate their own game.

2018-03-24,0,0,1159,False,Not Recommended,This company Rockstar just falsely banned a multitude of accounts for 30 days and deleting all progress of those accounts. Given that Rockstar Support is completely ignoring this matter. The best way to attract their attention is to dump a bad review on steam. Here's mine Rockstar. Enjoy your bad rep.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-04-07,0,0,193,False,Not Recommended,Online is funny but there is so many things that i just hate for bottom of my heart. First Loading times are just epic... Second daily missions are mostly fun to play until there comes capture or something where you need to get some other players to play with. You are unable to complete daily if you cant get any player to join and play the mission with you. So i had enough to day i dont care and i wont play it anymore.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-05-14,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,****UPDATE****Lets be honest. There is a extremely high chance that Rockstar even got the idea for the gun running update is through mods made by the passionate community. But in the end the poor treatment of mods is utterly disgusting thanks to them shutting down OpenIV with a cease and desist order despite it having NO interaction with the online portion of the game. A software used for modding in the GTA community for a long time.TLDR you rockstar and take two interactice. You greedy pieces of Bring back OpenIV. You could not have ed up more majestically and reduced the value of your game by a ing landslide. My opinion? Don't support the Devs any further in anyway. If they take our freedom to mod the game in order to enhance our playing experience they in NO WAY deserve our hard earned money and support. Enjoy watching your already dying game die further with its falling player base. No one wants to play vanilla.*****ORIGINAL REVIEW*****Don't. Just don't bother unless its HEAVILY discounted.You're really gonna have a great time with the single player. Its fun with 3 interesting characters and supporting cast and a really well held story with a living breathing open world with fun side missions to keep you interested. Story mode is amazing.Then comes the multiplayer. This part of the game is why majority of people buy this game. And to save you DON'T. I personally have had more disgust than fun with this mode.The servers are ing ABYSMAL. It consists of peer to peer connection time that gets you timed out during the PAINFULLY long loading screens (Takes me atleast 15 mins to join a server and even more to join a friend's server). And if you are lucky and do end up joining there is a chance that you will be disconnected by every player in the server leaving within the next few minutes. And even if that doesn't happen prepare to experience the most annoying rubber banding and lag in your life.Matchmaking is terrible as well. It mostly connects you with players that are much more privilaged than you. This can be from over powered armoured vehicles to weapons of sorts. Instead of just matchmaking people of our level and experience. This also occurs during soloing heists. People with unbalanced weapons just keep taking all the experience leaving none for yourself.There is no region selector so most of the time you can enter a server where the players dont speak english/ your native language. Not only that giving a terrible amount of latency due to this. There is no Anti cheat system in the game so hackers and modders (which is something im greatly opposed to) can run around lighting you on fire at critical moments and all happens to them. Majority of servers are RIDDLED with them. Leaving ligitimate players of the game to feel no satisfaction due to their hard work and grit. The modders and cheaters will get a ban but it isn't strict enough. Its usually for a month or 2 months rather than a permanent ban.Out of my 60+ hours in total 30 hours has been dedicated to the online portion of the game. And for those of you who say that 30 hours isn't enough to experience online as a whole and that you havent experienced any of the issues mentioned above know that majority of the player base have come across these issues and 30 hours is MORE THAN ENOUGH to get a full idea of it. Because you haven't doesnt mean that said issues doesnt exist. So to conclude Story mode 10/10 ( Masterpiece)Online 4/10 (Trash)** If you want a good open world multiplayer experience play the online mod for GTA San Andreas. You'll have miles more fun than this trash.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-11,0,0,458,False,Recommended,Product received for free. WARNING Might contain Wall of Text. Does NOT contain spoilers.First of all I want to say I played this game only solo and with randoms. If you have 3 more friends to play with game experience will reach nirvana. So I got this game from a prick friend 3 years ago. He doesn't own the game so I also gifted back but he declined so I was alone in gta online.Singleplayer It's awesome. 3 playable characters you probably heard and know already. If you haven't played you should try immediately. I played and finished the story 3 years ago and thinking to go for it again nowadays. It took me 40 hours to finish singleplayer.Multiplayer GTA Online. I played solo and I want to tell you about my experience. What to expect? Lots of non english speakers and boxes (chinese/asian letters might appear like this in your game)&gt Harder communications mean harder heist missions (most fun part of multiplayer but ruined with randoms)&gt P2P servers. Which means the people on the other side of the planet will cause major lags.SOLUTION Add ppl who are good which is very hard to find. Once you added around 10 good people your game will get better. Chaos. It's a total chaos&gt You wanna buy some new clothes? Cool someone will get in to shop and kill you. For no reason at all&gt You wanna drive your new cool car? Well it's not cool anymore because someone who has a t MOTORBIKE WITH A ROCKET destroyed you. And as if it is not enough it can F*CKING FLY! So griefers are everywhere.&gt You wanna get rich so you will be doing supply missions for your business. Don't try it on a server with players. You have 0 chance of succeeding in it alone. Someone with a flying car with rockets or a flying bike with rockets or a plane with rockets will eventually find you and you know the rest.&gt HACKERS! This is the saddest part. They will cage you. They will spawn weird stuff on you. Sometimes give you a lot of money which is bad because that money will be taken back by rockstar might even leading to your ban if you ask for it. Best thing to do is leave the server immiediatly.&gt Kids. GTA without kids is nothing. God bless their voice their microphone and their parents' credit card.SOLUTION Solo Public session (or invite only session some actions are not available here so solo public is better). It's the only way to play alone and feel the immersivity. You cut your internet for 5 7 seconds and everyone dissappears. You can search google for more info. Loading screens (I have SSD and GTA is intalled in it. Samsung 860 EVO)&gt Launch the game LOADING. Try to find a lobby and get kicked LOADING. Find a mission eventually and get into the it LOADING. Launch the job LOADING. Finish the job LOADING. It's just too f*cking long. SSD is not helping since it's the problem with rockstar and you. Randoms&gt Heists require 4 people. If you are solo like me there's no chance you can complete a heist under an hour. My last 8 attemps were ı&gt I was able to find a lobby play a setup mission host dissappears after completing so no final mission. (20.000 $ gain)ıı&gt Get into a heist lobby not enough players host quits (0 $)ııı&gt Launch a heist. But guess what a chinese with 0 english quits and we are back to the loading screens... (0 $)ıv&gt Get into a lobby host is afk (0 $)v&gt Finally found a finale mission but ofc randoms have no chill. 8 times we had to restart because they keep dying. and eventually someone quit.

(1000 $)So in 3 hours my total gain is 21.500 $SOLUTION Find good people or call friends.AS A RESULT Fun singleplayer. It's fun to play multiplayer and grind or do weird stuff with friends. You can earn a lot with 4 ppl so you will grind less for things to buy. But if you are a solo player you'll be cancer in no time. You'll lose time and money. Try to hold on and do not buy sharks.I recommned it because there's a lot of effort in this game. Voice actors are awesome missions and story is well made. Gameplay is fluid. Multiplayer is fun in the core but ruined by worst community I've seen so far.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-09,0,0,181,False,Not Recommended,Single player is A+ freaking spectacular.Online is pure cancer and a disgusting cash grab by R*Single player is like GTA IV but better in many ways lacking from 4 in a few but overall it's great. Online is riddled with modders who your game up people who stupidly paid for Shark Cards. Which doesn't sound bad to each their own but the overwhelming majory of the cool stuff you just simply can not buy with ingame money without buying Shark Cards it's just way way WAY too much. So the peopel who bought the cards and cool in game vehicles will just royally you up non stop and you can't do anything about it but log off. While the online mode can be fun on the right server chances are low and so much is literally unobtainable it's just not fun. For example a good mission will net you about 20K this is before spending a million plus for a heist worthy apartment. That missing will take about 5 10 minutes depending on the mission. Well an apartment to run a heist is about $1M a sports car that has good speed will be well over 1/2 Million. The cars with armor guns etc well over $1M. Bunkers hangers and such start at about 1.5M and it's trash location. Good ones are 2M+As you can see if you want to get the max experience out of online and be able to play while the lords are playing you are talking the longest most stupid and repetitive grind in nearly any game. And this is without buying normals guns a regular car a first apartment clothing tats and all the other stuff that makes your character custom. TL DR Single player is just as good and what you expect. Online whilehaving awesome content utterly sucks due to how much crap costs in game and the pathetic methods to earn that money leaves you grinding for 100's of hours just to buy an apartment... which leads to heists which pay no where near what you would think or should.

2018-04-22,0,0,285,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is a really fun game for singleplayer the comedy is good characters are fun and it's a good way to kill a good chunk of time. My only issue with singleplayer is the seemingly empty end game once you've done the main story there isn't much to do. As far as multiplayer goes it was pretty fun the first time around I had an mc and some decent vehicles and all the guns I needed. One day I was doing a solo mc mission and as I was running I got a random message saying I'd been banned for a month. Go back on about a month and a half later and all of my stuff is gone I had to start completely from scratch. The second time around everything seems like a chore (first time did too but now it's repetetive) and it isn't really fun without friends. Online could also be much more fun if it wasn't so hard to get anything in the game especially when the missions get super boring.My final advice would be to not get the game for online purposes it isn't fun after a while and even though you haven't run into ban problems like all the reviews say you will and you'll come to the same realization as the rest of us.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-23,0,0,311,False,Recommended,"This game is fantastic. Let's remember the positive things first guys. The story is extremely good. Very immersive and there is so much to do in it.Rockstar pumps out FREE DLC every so often (I haven't been paying attention to their patterns) it's always giving us new things to do with our friends.Let's talk about the story for a bit The prolouge starts off with Michael Trevor and Brad robbing a bank in North Yankton after successfully robbing it they their car gets rear ended by a train while escaping. This makes them travel on foot where a police officer shoots Brad and Michael. Trevor then shoots many of the cops but flees the scene. This then transitions to Michaels ""funeral"" Michael takes his wife and kids and moves to Los Santos leaving behind Trevor. The main story starts out with Franklin a repoman who lives with his aunt he is friends with a wannabe ganster. Then one day he ends up meeting Michael in a weird place. The two keep in touch and end up pulling a heist off together. Soon after Trevor Michael's old best friend finds him. Trevor ends up hearing about the heist. He then storms to Los Santos from Sandy Shores in search of Michael. He ends up finding Michael and all three end up going on many heists and being put through many situations.Let's talk about GTA Online It's very fun you get to make your own character and spend time with your friends messing around blowing stuff up whatever. The free DLC makes it more interesting you can find more creative ways to save money you can become a CEO and deliever drugs etc.Overall this game is pretty good. it has it's flaws like it's awful global community but I usually just play in invite only if you want to avoid idiots I would do the same if I were you.EDIT The community has straightened up as Rockstar has been tough on modders. There are still modders out there though just not as bad.EDIT PT2 The community really hasn't made much progress but rockstar has just gotten to the point where if you say ""money drop?"" they'll ban you. They've added so much more that it's insane. If you still don't own this game for some reason just buy it already. It's not going down in price anytime soon.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-12-22,0,0,724,False,Recommended,Despite terrible microtransaction practices and a toxic online economy GTA V offers more content then you can ever finish on both multiplayer and singleplayer. The story wasn't exceptional but it was enough to get me to complete it. If you find yourself bored start modding. There are incredible mods that offer even more content and/or change the gameplay.

They're never going to do it because it won't make them money. Sure they'll get a one off payment of like $50 because odds are that they'd charge that much but in the end it's not enough.

This game has something for everyone whether you like customizing your character's style or wreaking havoc on the citizens of Los Santos. My friends and I have been playing consistently for 2 years now and we are amazed by how far this game has come since its launch in 2013. With superior hardware accelerated options the PC version is the true successor of the original console versions. The graphics are beautiful the music is catchy the controls are intuitive the world is immersive multiplayer is a blast with friends and the game continuously receives free updates that surprisingly make the game even more enjoyable than it was before. Rockstar Games did a phenomenal job creating this masterpiece and I must say that for me at least this game has set the bar really high for all future titles.,Grand Theft Auto V

The Single player is good i would say rly good but that's about the only thing you can truly enjoy. what rly annoys me is that they keep releasing new DLC's with new cars boats houses ect but only for multiplayer. If you buy this game for single player only you kind fell forgotten because R* wont ever add new functionalities to SP.Now if you do go to MP thats where the real trouble begins.First you have to wait about 2 3 minutes to enter a session after that you can enjoy the open world with a maximum of 30 players usually 10...Next you need money and for that you have to do ""activities"" the problem is you have to go trough a loading screen too 1 Find a new seasion (2 min)2 Wait for players (5 15 min if they ever show you have to choose popular ones or forget it you cant do it alone)3 begin the mission (2 min)4 end the mission and return to the open world (2 5 min)You can waste about 15 min in loading screens and sometimes you dont even play that long.Apart from this they dont seem to give you new ways to make good money the DLC's keep getting more and more expensive but you are still left with the same tools to make money which means grinding times are now impossible if you have a life.If you want to try the game buy it in sale and dont expect R* to care about your experince the only thing they see is money.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-22,0,0,452,False,Not Recommended,i know this game is years old but have to say some thing. the single player is great the idea for the gta online is not bad overall the online for content is bland nothing but grind added over the years for the most part. yes we have gotten new cars some ways to make money. main problem is all the new ways to make money other than the racing is limmited to public servers is where the issue lies. they love to add content to make people work together but do nothing to stop the cheaters and greifers that run rampit online. the one time i got some onew to join gotr banned the first day he got to play after his install jey from the dev site it self failed to work no help from devs. we finallly got a copie working but only after buying a whole new key from steam. got about 6 hrs of game play in a a privet server just grinding out some money and they ban. yet people still roam free forcing people in to sport lobbies spawning items from the rock star creator in and trapping people in them. i have the seconed happen to me sitting in my own appartment after just logging in in stores. they cannot be bothered to fix glitch spots in the map witch you can get in the mesh. From personal experiance the online is trash and the devs do not care to actually fix it. All they do is slap a quick die if you walk in this spot instead of fixing the mess issues. The other main issue is you can set it up to play with friends only but you have to give up on 3/4 of what they aded as content to only open public servers. this last fact is the main issue alnong with the fact they have done little to nothing to stop people who hack the game to their advantage agenst others. I would not have a problem running bunker mission on line if they did not encorage people to blow up other peopls work for no gain. take out a raivals sipment a few grand in cash wooo. yet the person targeted is out hours of grind to even try to sell and loose it all. all in the name of pvp i guess. Most of the time the poeple who do this are the ones who rock start like because most do not work for what they have. Most are people who dump real money into the game to buy the nice toys prob $50 us for most based on what the in game curreny costs to buy. theis game would not have a negitive review if it was not for the last few things i mentioned. i would gives this game a positive review if they would let a group of people play in a invite server but not limmit them to 1/4 of the acctual content avalible. i may considercanging this review if the devs acctually start to care about the people who play to earn what they get and not just dump money in their pockets. the devs are gready and dont care. false bans are ignored and they refusee to talk at all about it. they do not care if you get banned on a game you just bought just want your money and that is it. At this point they have gone to all greed never buying a product they put out again. Later rockstar maybe one day you will car about the people who like your game and not just the money!,Grand Theft Auto V

The times of annoying tedious monotinous and deathly boring grinding? Well that's the entire game.

You'll grind to get buildings to get more money to get cool stuff to get new buildings for more money and to be able to get the cool stuff. ""But what about all the game modes!!"" They can be fun but you don't get from doing them. Maybe 20k if you mess around doing an hour race look i did 3 hour races on Forza but GTA? Don't waste your braincells.

2018-01-15,0,0,193,False,Recommended,GTA V is a mix bag for me. The main story is fine nothing really special or memorable for me except for the torture scene. The game clearly did not go a realistic apporach like GTA 4 and went for more of a San Andreas approach (with it taking place in Los Santos and stuff). This game is very optimized it can run on a lot of platforms with a solid FPS. Looks like Rockstar learned from their mistake of that disgusting GTA 4 port. If you're getting the game for singleplayer/story mostly then definately get it. If you're interested in this game because of the online (say friends are playing it) good luck. The online is hectic and honestly unfun without friends if you're new. Like I feel like the online is only fun with friends and still hackers are gonna up your Sure it's amusing at first but soon becomes frustrating. Then hackers spawn you ton of money to either be nice/ban your account. And the hackers my god so many of them. Every session I have been on has a hacker it feels like. We're at to the point where sharkcards are too overpriced because of the hackers giving everyone so much money. My final thoughts GTA V is a very optimized and beautiful game and the story is enjoyable enough I guess. Stay away from the online unless you have friends because you can do heists together. Without friends you have to trust random people who usually just troll you off. Be careful of mods if you go into Online and have any still active you will be perma banned.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,1043,False,Not Recommended,I decied to change my review (which was written only for the purpose of getting the daily objective on Steam Winter Sale) in the light of recet update. I'm writing this review with almost 1000 hours played which obviously around 90% was spent in GTA Online. I'll barely touch singleplayer and story focusing more on multiplayer. Story is enjoyable and is decent enough but can't compete with either GTA VC or GTA SA. Heists random events three characters spreading havoc between mission out of boredom big map large variety of weapons and vehicles it's all great we know what to expect from GTA. As I mentioned story and side missions are rather good my only complaint concerns objectives for gold medals which is something that game completionists like me pay attention. While playing mission for the first time you have no idea what to expect you can check the objectives only after finishing the mission. And then it hits you no matter how well you're doing while either playing the first time or replaying SP after long time you can't get gold after the first try whithout skipping every cutscene. Most of the missions require from you skipping cutscenes simply because otherwise you wouldn't make it in time required for gold medal. Other than that in SP you won't see any weapon or vehicle added in GTA Online update.Now let's talk about what we love/hate in GTA V the most Online. Long time ago it was basically loading screen simulator as each heist mission and heist preperations took place outside of the lobby. Back then doing heists was the only good and rather profitable activity in the game. But without group of friends don't even come close to playing heists playing with randoms is as enjoyable as dragging your balls on a grate. Besides who is even doing heists these days? Do it for the first time for fun and a little bit money and forget them. Right money.GTA O have a long history of smaller and bigger updates. First noticebale thing was Lowriders Update but soon turned out to be a cash grab because you won't even see players using tuned cars anymore maybe they still keep them in garages or simply sold them for more money to buy thing from next updates. Next thing was Executives and Other Criminals update adding VIP and bodyguard system allowing for lobby missions along with the biggest cash grab ever 10M for yacht which totally serves no purpose right now.For a long time heists were the only good source of income in the game. That thing changed with one of the biggest updates Finance and Felony which added offices warehouses for VIPs and most importantly earning money in freeroam lobbies. Sad thing that this update became the point where GTA O started going downhill. Every damn thing in that update was expensive af after playing only heists you could've had saved money to buy everything to get things going. From now on we got the same thing but in different colors.So next we got Bikers Update with clubs and factories fake papers weed money meth and coke. Then there was Import/Export with warehouses and stealing cars to sell them later for further profit. Then we got Gunrunning with bunkers Mobile Operations Center weaponized behicles and upgradeble weapons. Lately we got Smuggler's Run hangars with variety of planes.Do you see the pattern? We get center of operations (office/club/bunker/hangar) where we start missions for stealing supplies/cars/cargo to deliver it to our base (warehouse/factory/car warehouse/bunker/hangar). Do I need to remind you that starting playing each update is associated with spending at least 6M to get started and around 10M to get comfortable to enjoy every new asset of update? Prices of new vehicles are not included oh no no. Every better vehicles costs about 2 4M with 2x that much for further upgrades. Fun.So basically this is what earning money looks like in Online right now you get the best plane in the game which ironically isn't the plane at all Oppressor and go steal supplies for bikers factories and bunker then you go for stealing cargo for warehouses in the meantime when you have cooldown you steal cars. Then you try to sell either cars/coke/meth/cargo/whatever and then hacker in lobby destroys everything. So you start playing in lobbies with small number of players where everyone keeps doing their own thing which of course is the same thing that you do because everyone has to make money somehow. Or just get lucky get lots of money from hacker spend it immediately on immovables. So after the endless cycle of grinding you finally come back to play in normal lobby and then you realize that there is nothing left to do. So you wander around map trying to find anything else to do but you can't so you stop playing for another 6 months and forget about GTA O untill the next update comes which requires another 10M from the start and while you are loading the game you see Shark Cards being on sale what a coincidence right?Those are my impressions I believe many players feel the same way. For the new players if you are looking for fun in Online don't even bother. Playing it requires tons of money from the start and by the time you get it new update will come out and all the stuff you bought won't matter anymore. And getting everything from hacked money will deprive any purpose from playing this game. So either way you're bamboozled.I have one last question WHO THOUGHT THAT RIGHT CTRL WAS THE BEST KEY FOR DROPPING BOMBS FROM PLANES? SERIOUSLY,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-16,0,0,1351,False,Not Recommended,This hands down used to be my favorite game series of all time since III. I got the collector's edition of this and then got it again for pc. I regret the purchase so much and I'm way past my allowed refund time.Story mode It's pretty damn good. Action packed thriller and non repetitive. Plenty of easter eggs for anyone's liking too. Of course there's the famous R* satirical humor which is nice too and boy is it ever present in this game.Map design What a in letdown! I was expecting a vast rolling desert a massive city plenty of small towns super dense forests and at least some kind of multi island city kind of design. Instead the desert is extremely tiny and not wide open at all. There's telephone polls guardrails traffic buildings boulders benches and random fence posts polluting the whole countryside not just the desert. The main city ls is dwarwed by the previous game's living and breathing cityscape. There's only 3 substantially sized small towns that offer next to no variety from the next small town. The forests or just forest has trees so sparsely placed that you can easily fly a cargo plane sideways through most of it. There are tons of islands but they're just tiny rocks with grass and some trees on them with nothing to offer aside from a pretty view. There is one island with a shack on it which gets pretty neat at night. Otherwise boats have absolutely no purpose in this game. Subs are in the boat category but they have far more use than boats themselves do unless you want to get across the lake for some reason. Though by the time you get to a boat you could've made it to the opposite side with a car and not have to deal with finding a car after reaching shore.Sound It's great. The audio in this game is an art form. Really helps set the ambience for where you are and what you're doing. I'm especially a big fan of the sounds helis make when they go down and the sound of the ufo above fort zancudo.Controls First off if you're a pilot like me switch away from using the mouse controls. Otherwise the keyboard layout is beautiful. All esential controls are in easy reach and even secondary controls aren't much of a stretch to get to and they're all in very memorable spots. Doesn't take long to get the hang of at all.Graphics Sometimes you just have to stop and look around to take it all in. Even on lowest settings it can be quite stunning at times. I've yet to see the game at 4k but I hear it's a magical experience for any game.Online N...no j...just don't even think abo... just no not a chance. If you're a big multiplayer fan and plan to spend most of your time with GTA Online DO. NOT. TOUCH. THIS. GAME!!! I can't possibly warn you enough.End game After you've completed everything ls has to offer this is where it takes advantage of it being a sandbox game comes into play. Stunt blow stuff up challenge yourself and the physics engine explore tiny details just to see how deep the dev's work goes and play with the ai. There's also tons of easy to install mods to further extend the gameplay or just general ery you can get up to to the poor citizen's dismay.Overall If you like story mode and sandbox games like Just Cause and don't plan of playing online with it yeah I'd recommend it. Unfortunately for me I love to play with my friends and even just random people and this game just does not offer the kind of experience I was anticipating out of such good devs as R*. Though I've dumped so much of my life into this game I'd gladly throw it all away or throw the game back at their faces if it meant I could get my money back. But no I'm stuck with this garbage. All I have left to regret now is how long it took me to stop being a loyalty blind fanboy to see the mistake I've made. The last bit of positivity I can possibly suck out of this heap is that I can finally start playing some other games that have been sitting in my library collecting dust that I get over 60 GB of space back on my HDD and some great lessons on what to and what NOT to do when I make my own games. This has been a valuable learning experience on a multitude of points for me.TL DR I regrettfully must inform you that what used to be a name known and respected by most has been dragged through the mud with little hope of getting cleaned up.The most possible thing I see recovering the GTA name is if VI has all previous maps in one big open world.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-21,0,0,180,False,Not Recommended,Pros 1. Game looks beautiful2. The missions are fun unfortunately nobody really plays them anymore3. The DLC is free and they update the game regularly with cool new ways to make moneyCons 1. Community is vile and will kill you just for fun with no legitimate repercussions for killing innocent players2. Nobody plays the missions anymore so you end up playing the same 5 missions over and over to try to make cash3. You have to have cash to make cash which makes sense only the way to make cash is either by playing the same five missions over and over by playing in public lobbys tor un your businesses and get killed by other players or to spend 45 minutes in waiting screens trying to find an empty lobby.4. The heists are impossible to finish because you're playing with random level 5 players not to mention the time it takes to set up and finish a heist is comparable to playing the same five missions over and over5. Microtransactions that pressure you into buying them so you can begin to make money is embarassing.6. Hackers both good and bad. I've been flown up into the air and spun in circles until I fell into the ocean because I didnt let a guy get in my car. Not to mention money is so painfully hard to get in this game that there are even nice hackers who will generate money and drop it off for people which is a problem in its own right but proves that this game is so horribly balanced that people would sooner use hackers than enjoy the game.TL DR A visually beautiful game with great concepts only the community is filled with hackers and angry children that want to kill random players just to get some sort of gratification in their life. Also money is hard to get in the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,576,False,Not Recommended,Unfortunately Rockstar Games and TakeTwo have now decided to attack their huge modding community by throwing OpenIV which is a big tool used to mod GTA with a Cease and Desist letter.This appears to be an attempt to crack down on people cheating in GTA Online but shutting down a tool that has done so much good for their game is not the way to go and OpenIV can't even be used in GTA Online. It's a really bad excuse from TakeTwo and Rockstar Games. I think it is a stupid attempt to make people pay more for GTA Online to buy special vehicles and such that you normally cannot get in the singleplayer mode in Grand Theft Auto V but the people attacked will never go onto Online so it is all just a big loss.So they are not attacking the players who are cheating they are attacking their biggest fans that love their games so much that they've decided to actually ADD ON more fun stuff to their favourite game(s).Thanks to this I can no longer recommend this game. Keep away until they realise what a big mistake they've made.It's a big shame because the game itself is actually really fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-27,1,2,271,False,Not Recommended,"Wow. Does this game ever have a nice single player I gotta say other than the tediousness lack of check points sometimes it's very very good! However the thing that I bought this game for! Online! The iest servers in the ing universe D! Boy do I ever love trying to play with my friends! To bad it takes 10 minutes to do so! Please don't give me ""You probably have internet or a crappy computer"" because I have very good internet and a very good pc. If this isn't good enough it's not my above average hardware that I use to play games with daily it's rockstar... They managed to optimize the game super well I get very good frames but to bad it takes 5 minutes at the least to start playing the game I understand it has a huge world but if I use an example say skyrim (a game that came out 2011) has a giant world and Gta came out 2 years later with a smaller world by the looks of it to me skyrim takes about 2 minutes to load in for me...Now here is my biggest issue. Every ing heist Lamar missions and anything else that forces 4 people. I know that rockstar wants you to play with your friends but if one of them time out boom you just wasted another 5 30 minutes depending on how far you are and if you're like me half the time you don't have 4 friends to play with so it's a random who is either nice and will understand your mistakes and his mistakes or you get mr. who judges you for dying once then goes ahead and runs into the battle field with the ing OP enemies and gets killed in 2 seconds because it's on hard and you actually want to play the game for the good parts of it so you try to make money. But he decides to leave and you're stuck here having to do the tedious heist setup or what ever again... all to make a 1/5 of a 100 thousand dollars which is about a 1/10 away from a good car! 1 good car! THE THING YOU PLAY GRAND THEFT AUTO FOR! FUN IN VEHICLES! Hacking the game is the best way to go about this btw you only get banned for 2 weeks and keep all your stuff for some mentally challenged reason... Also the 5 10 million dollar things!? Buy a couple $100 shark cards and you can afford them oh btw they're just for looks you can get something that functions the same for a quarter of the price ).This one hit me personally. All the tediously hard missions I've never understood why game devs do this... I know half of these are completely optional but it's still money that you really want and need if you play legit like me... Like flight school... jesus christ I've never played something so hard in my life it's boring hard annoying and it over all made me angry and that's why I'm writing this poorly done review... because the game is me off. Trust me if you got some good friends there is fun to be made out of the grinding if you have some time just hack the game and you'll also have a ton of fun if you have money buy shark cards on top of the $60 game you can spend an extra $100 to have even more fun than the base game! Oh and by the way a shirt costs $14000.

2017-12-22,0,0,133,False,Not Recommended,THIS REVIEW IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR GTA ONLINEIt was quite astounding at first with heists missions many vehicle races great and interactive open world with full of things to do.Characters has lots of great customizations(E.G. clothes/costumes). There are many options to customize your vehicles as well. Rockstar brings out free updates regularly and very often which is good. But as you progress you will realize that it s totally a Pay 2 Win game that rockstar made to suck up lots of money into their pockets. You will always need to pay a lot to buy any property or vehicles(weaponized sports super cars) every upcoming updates releases very expensive content. The recent Doomsday Heist vehicles costs at least a million GTA$ and some even goes up to 6 million GTA$ without even any customization at all. The IAA Facility from Doomsday Heist also has a ridiculously expensive cost if you want to customize some parts.This game has enormous potential to become the biggest and most played open world game but Rockstar is putting out too much expensive content and it became a pay 2 win game. This game is unfair to many players that does not have extra real money to cash in and have fun. I hope that Rockstar would change a bit maybe give out real free content for all players to enjoy or give out a higher amount of free money regularly so that new players or poor players can enjoy paid content like weaponized vehicles and properties without the need to cash in a lot of real money into it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-31,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,This game by gameplay standards is great and fantastic. It all feels very engaging and I have a great time playing it. It was also one of the smoothest PC launches I have ever witnessed ran like butter on day one.The online portion which in my opinion is a bulk of the gameplay time for most players has been stripped of every last shred of fun simply because of the currency system. It puts this ridiculous gate infront of people who simply want to mess around and have their own fun and good times if things were simply behind a Level barrier I would not be so sour about this.With the currency system and level system working in tandem to ruin any potential of fun you can have in multiplayer you're forced to play very mundane and samey quests and in order to really make it worth while you need to notch it up to hard which makes enemies ungodly tough and you weaker than a sheet of rice paper.The biggest red flag though is the microtransactions. I'm not mad because they are there I'm mad that the in game money that you buy with REAL ACTUAL DOLLARS is still subject to the daily payments ingame. I don't care if its realistic if I wanted to pay a mortgage I'd sooner go buy an actual house than have my money be taken from a virtual shack that has 1% the usability of a real life home.This game's online mode is a pure scam and its not right for Rockstar to get away with this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-10,0,0,306,False,Not Recommended,Pff.. Good game but its massivly let down by the amount of people hacking.. There seem to be more hackers than legit players. Gta V staff seems to not care at all.. Tonight I played for around 6 hours and must have met 8 hackers. Now I'm not claiming people are hacking because they killed me I know their hacking because they teleport into my car and teleport me else where on the map.. Or maybe its the time they teleported all players to the same location and started throwing us around the sky. Or maybe its when they spawned like 1000 motorbikes throughout the map.. oh or maybe its the time I just went and done a heist when I was level 64 and the hacker spammed me with EXP and bosted me to level 81... I have reported the majority of these players but sadly I know nothing will happen to them.. I have requested my player level to be returned to what it was before the heist but I know they wont bother... This game is been ruined and its only getting worse and worse every day... If you have a bunch of friends to play with then you should be ok if you join a private lobby but then you cant do and bunker supply runs which is a great way of making legit money.. My advice for anybody thinking about buying the game right now is to either not bother or wait until they sort this cheating crap out... How their anti hack software doesnt notice all this stuff and istantly ban is beyond me... If this is not sorted soon I will be demanding a refund as its massivly game breaking.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-30,0,0,878,False,Not Recommended,"500 hour review edit GTA V is the only game that I will give a thumbs down to despite the amazing times I've had. Most of this review is about GTA Online. The single player game is definitely fun but GTA Online is what keeps people coming back time and again.GTA Online is a train wreck from a multiplayer perspective. The menus are needlessly complicated. Load times take seemingly forever. ""Modders"" (GTA's version of hackers) are everywhere and almost every public lobby has some 12 year old kid screwing it up for you. How can they screw it up for you? They can actually spawn a giant cage on you or blow you up endlessly or kick you out or even (occasionally) crash your game entirely. The lobby system is terrible as well. There are no dedicated servers for lobbies it's all player to player. Thus anything goes. Rockstar's anti cheat attempts are like trying to use a sponge to drain out the ocean. It just doesn't work.Here's my typical GTA Online experience 1. Load the game2. Make a cup of tea3. Come back and the GTA Online lobby is still not loaded4. Spawn in my house5. Get a car and go outside where a modder promptly blows my car up teleports me 5000 feet into the air and turns my arms into traffic cones.6. Report said modder through Rockstar's hilariously ineffective reporting system (get this competent modders can actually prevent reports or bans from going through)7. Modder sees me submit report kicks me out of lobby8. Wait another 5 minutes to join a different lobby9. Find out that this lobby is being hosted on a PC built in 1998 and run on a 56k dialup connection10. Quit game in frustrationOn top of this great experience GTA Online is MMO grindfest. Want to spend hundreds of hours or hundreds of hours to be able to afford the stuff you want? Then this is the game for you! Meanwhile every modder has a bank account with a dozen digits. Oh... and the best part...ROCKSTAR SUPPORT(you guys deserve your own shoutout for how bad you are)Rockstar support will manage to give you a canned answer to anything no matter if it fits or doesn't. They'll somehow blame you for everything no matter what. Remember those modders that I was talking about earlier? Yeah those guys can force you to get cash that you don't want and then Rockstar will ""adjust"" your account to remove all of your money. Some people even get their accounts banned because of the actions of modders. If you try to contact Rockstar they'll blame it on you.In summary Rockstar is almost as bad as Comcast. If you buy this game prepare to deal with modders who will try to make your experience as bad as possbile. The menus are terrible load times are terrible and everything is ridiculously overpriced. Try not to get banned because Rockstar doesn't care about you. They care about selling more copies of this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-29,1,16,21,False,Not Recommended,I have been looking forward to playing GTA V on the PC for some time after seeing all the rave reviews. Now i have the game I have been so disappointed. The good point is the graphics they are stunning one of the best looking games i have played.The bad point. The game play is very boring and repetitive and has not evolved from any of the earlier GTA's. There are next to no interiors which takes away the realism of the city. There is very limited interaction with other charactersIf you look at NPC's in say Skyrim they work during the day then go home in the evening or to the tavern. It's a neat touch to give the environment some realism but in GTA the characters don't do that they have no homes or daily routine. You can't pick pocket or break in to peoples homes collect things or steal things to create your own adventures All you can do is drive and shoot and that gets very boring.Even the cheat codes are boring so limited as to what you can do. They could at least have made the game more interesting.I hope when Rockstar makes GTA VI they at least look at and include the innovations that have been made in other games such as Skyrim or Witcher 3 to make the city an exciting vibrant and realistic sand box city to play in instead of the pretty but boring game that is GTA V,Grand Theft Auto V

The Online is a whole universe...Of rage and hackers.The Online is very dissapointing. So far after a lot of time wasting I've reached rank 108 and did a lot of heists and other activities and here's the list of what you should know about this Infinite loading times.It takes about 1 2 minutes to sign back into the world if you completed a mission OR even refused it because whenever you accepted a job you will drop from online world into lobbies and theres nothing to do about that. Same is about activities like golf or tennis and etc (Which is required to level up your stats and skills). Just sit and look how you are wasting your time. Matchmaking systemIt's broken. You will be dropped to play with low rank newbies players very often rather the players with your level. Also mention that you will get kicked a lot from almost every sessions both connection issues with 1 player or if host is a d1ck and he decided to kick you for no reason. So you'd better get a good friend or even 3 to fully enjoy your game experience and get maximum rewards and profits. Griefers trollers nolifers leaversOfcource in each game session you will encounter a s in hydra jet planes or psychos in armored truck with machine gun who wants to prove anyone else that they are the alpha males with toothpick but that's not even frustrating as the players who love to destroy other player vehicles in heist mission (you have to pay a lot of money on ensurance to recover them) and drive alone OR even kill everyone after the heist and steal their money (around 15k per player). Sure you can report them however this will have no effect because R* gives no f0k but thank God the CRockstar developers figured out to put passive mode to prevent any player damage but that feature blocks you from using any weapons in freemode as well as gang attacks and other activities. And finally leavers whenever you are close to win the mission or complete the heist one of the s will leave. This will automatically trigger the mission failure and you will get nothing for your 30 minutes spend looser. Stats and skillsHoly Im not even telling how much sadistic you must be to fully fill every stats to max level it will take an hour to raise one stat to the max. Also the stats like strenght will slowly decay overtime so you have to watch yourself.The rank leveling system is pretty too for example imagine that you have rank 5 with 999 out of 1000 points to level up and you've just completed a hard mission and earned of cash and 15000 Reputation Points. And you are probably thinking right now you will hit more than rank 10? no you will stay at rank 6 with 0/1500 RP. Congrats on leveling up kiddo. The hackers and balanceOne of the reasons why you should be afraid of the cheaters is because YOU can get banned as well as they are because they can transfer you a lot of money even if you didnt asked for them and so the R* anti cheat system will trigger you as a hacker. And if you sent a message to R* the only response you will get is that they don't give a shet. Just swallow it and wait 1 month. About balance in case if you didn't know your max health depends on your rank each 20 lvls of rank gives your 20 more HP which explaines why low lvl players is actually ""so newby"" and dies a lot. Im not even telling about the invincible armored cars that you can buy for 525K$ and be totally immune to damage if you're inside (even if the other players shoots you form RPG). Hello easy heists!So afterall like i said the singleplayer should be enought for you to enjoy the game experience and you should play this game in Online if you have a friend(s) to play with and more likely in private sessions because you can't even imagine the situation with cheaters right now.",Grand Theft Auto V

I did not save my local files as I never do since I have steam. With any other (steam) game I expected my game progress to be stored in cloud. It is 2015 after all. But oh boy have I ever been so wrong about Rockstar. After starting up the game I saw the very first mission popping up on my screen. At first I thought it was just some sync issue maybe I needed to load the files explicitly through Rockstar Social club or something. But no it is confirmed that this garbage does NOT save your progress in the cloud.It does use cloud for storing your achievements character progress and some other static data like that but it seems that Rockstar games was so ing cheap that they did not want to store a few megabytes of binary data per user.That's what you get in 2015 from a game's steam release (where they could simply have used steam API for cloud storage) for 60 ING So no don't buy this game on steam if you expect this version to be better than a boxed release or any other digital store's release. It is the same just more expensive compared to some other stores. This was the last time I bought a rockstar game.PS Also shame on steam for not enforcing game developers to either implement their own cloud sync OR use steam's built in features.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-09,5,46,181,False,Recommended,"IntroductionGrand Theft Auto V has just been not surprisingly chosen as Steam's Platinum level Top Seller game. The Grand Theft Auto franchise has been highly successful since back in 2002's GTA Vice City in PlayStation 1 up until 2015's GTA V. If you are not familiar with GTA it's a crime based open world game that is mostly popular for letting its player do anything they want. So if you are considering if it is worth it or not the answer is definitely yes. Epic graphics high attention to detail interactive environment tons of activites etc. But as you can see in other's reviews the online part of GTA has been bashed by major and numerous complaints. As a $60 game these negative reviews might make you feel worried about purchasing the game. I will provide an in depth review of both single player and online. Read whichever concerns you the most.Single PlayerStory is much better than its predecessors. You might quickly notice that it's well written and well thought not just some mainstream gang drive by betrayal bad cop plot. I personally love stories that does not brand its characters as good and bad. As we all know the real world isn't black and white it's all gray. Both kindest people and the worst lowlife on the planet have their reasons to believe that their actions can be justified. In GTA you'll play as a retired criminal Michael a gang member Franklin and a small criminal overlord Trevor. Story can sometimes be a bit cliche but the amazing voice acting made up for it.As for gameplay it's classic GTA. You can release your inner demon at single player by shooting everyone you see running over jaywalkers shoot down a blimp for no reason at all etc. This is why GTA was put in the spotlight on ""video games teaching kids violence"" protest. But hey my friends &amp I have been playing GTA since we were 10 and we don't pull people out of the car and hit them with a baseball bat. Well it's just a video game but you don't want your mom to see you stabbing hookers on the street and stealing their money. You'll activate the story by visiting a certain place using a relevant character.In general I love the single player. Some people say that it's not their niche and prefer to only play the online part. I personally love story rich games so I finished it. It took me around 50 hours to finish the entire single player. The only bad thing in single players is that the devs no longer offers too many options of legal cheats. Cheating (legally) in GTA SA was one of the best experience I've had in gaming. I know a lot of people might disagree about this point but there's really no harm in activating no cops mode for several minutes (or hours) in SP and do whatever you want without SWAT teams dropping from helicopters. My point is cheating (legally) for fun is not for everyone but lack of options of legal cheats is a minus for me.GTA OnlineGTA Online's gameplay is very broad. You can choose to free roam PvP or Co Op PvE. Each missions have their background story but similar tasks. You mostly have to kill a group of enemies steal something from them and get the items you stole to safety while being chased by black SUVs or motorcycles. They also have heists mode which is kind of similar to PAYDAY 2 as a choice of grinding. As for PvP you have the choice of classic team deathmatch juggernaut mode tank PvP and many other options. Free roaming allows you to bounty hunt players rob stores steal and sell cars be a crime organization CEO biker gang president party on a $8 million yacht spend all your grind money on modding a Magnum Opus car etc.In my opinion the highlight of the gameplay is just the randomness and the grinding process. You can get a very clear results from the effort you put into grinding because you basically would be able to buy what rich people IRL buy. There is a very clear difference between new and veteran players. They reward you well for your effort (or for your support in the form of Shark Cards). The randomness is the result of the free roaming activity. There is a bunch of random fun waiting for you especially if you play with friends. You can I don't know have a bunch of your friends follow a person around the city and point creepily at him/her whenever he/she stops while wearing a terrifying costume?As for the community do not expect anything good from it. Like all other popular games GTA Online has a really sh*tty community. But as long as you have friends to play with you're good to go.Now the biggest concern False Bans. This is a highly controversial topic since there are a ton of claims made around the forum coming out from players with a very high amount of hours in playtime. My friends were afraid to purchase GTA V due to the false ban rumor and I'm sure a lot of others are very concerned about this right now. Here's what I have to say about this This is both the dev and the player's fault. For the devs remember that they are a team of humans. Humans can make mistakes even Gordon Ramsay accidentally cut his fingers with a knife on The Ellen DeGeneres show. If you've learned computer programming you'll know that the dev's 'sweeps' is a program that filters out cheaters and honest players most likely by calculating the difference between the value of assets and cash you own with the amount of money you have received from missions and other legitimate activities. Of course they'll have a lot more complicated design than that it's just a probability of how they can sweep out cheaters (GTA players prefer to call them modders). These 'sweep' program are designed by humans they might have made a mistake in the past or today that accidentally bans innocents. Ever heard of the normal distribution theory? Even with extra human supervision innocents can still get caught in the net. Even the most extreme events does not have a 0% chance of happening (M. Medina Evaluating Evidence lecture 2016). Devs should be more communicative and transparent instead of treating every single players as a delusional modder trying to appeal their ban by acting as if they have never cheated. The ""We will give you no explanation for your ban"" policy is definitely not cool. Our status is as Rockstar's customer not a thief that's begging them to forgive us. We bought their game we deserve an explanation.For the players there are a lot of claims saying that they have never touched any mods never touched any trainers or never picked up any modder's money intentionally etc. Again players are human too. Do you know what's one of the most prominent mistake in human's thinking? Faulty memory. Yep. Memories are reconstruction of the past not a recorded movie. Your brain can manipulate the reconstruction result to however you like it (Kida 2006). This is why delusional modders are everywhere and it's almost impossible to differentiate legitimate false ban report and a delusional false ban report. Some people truly force themselves to believe that they have never cheated even though they did. The longer your brain forced to reconstruct something to your liking the more distorted that memory is and the more you believe in the truth of that memory. So do false bans exists? Maybe. We'll never know. As long as you steer clear of mods &amp trainers both offline and online not pick up dropped modder's money (if by accident you're fine the 'sweep' will delete the money even if you have spent it) and not being abusive you should be good. Discord Skype etc are good to use too they're not illegal. Just to be safe delete any cheat related apps from your PC. Don't be too afraid of being falsely banned. Play honestly avoid co ops with hackers and trust the devs.I hope this can be helpful!References Kida T. (2006). Don't Believe Everything You Think The 6 Basic Mistakes We Make in Thinking.

Also the FOV is way too low.This is a rather odd issue some people with Nvidia cards are reportignthe same thing but while using a 7970 I get graphic artifacts while any from of AA is on or Vsync is enabled. I've been keeping my drivers up to date since the game luanch and even using the Beta ones. I've had this problem on WIndows 7 and 10. And I'm 100% sure my GPU isn't dieing because this is the only game it happens on. BF4 and CoH2 all play fine with no artifacts.Fast foward a bit incase you can't tell Online seems to be nothing but an overhyped grindfest maybe you like that but most people I know don't seem to enjoy it. I'll admit I modded online and I'm banned now but I never spawned money or messed with any one. But it also seems that rockstar doesn't like FOV mods. Or Mods at all. There is a reason I'm playing GTAV instead of Sleeping Dogs The mods. I have over 500+ hours on GTAIV all because of Mods like LCPDFR. To me there just isn't enough to do in GTAV to bother looking at it with out mods.It seems that R* is deliberately trying to cripple Scripthook. You can look up info about that from the creator of Scripthook and the LSPDFR team.However in the process of trying to kill scripthook they also seemed to have turned the game into an unplayable state. as the 1.28 patch basically made the game unplayable for a good 2 and a half weeks. And even then it was still not up to the luanch day optimization quaility.And While the summer sale was going on they pulled the most greedy shady move. Even scumbag steve will think you are a ing What did they do. Well at the Time the Game was $60 when the sale came around R* Increased the Price to $80 and threw in some Grindfest Online Money. Which may or may not have been bigger then the preorder bonus. THEN IN DEFIANCE OF BOTH GOD AND MAN THEY PUT THE GAME AT ""%30 OFF."" Just to make it look like you were getting a sweet deal. There was no way to buy the game seperatly if you have a seperate GTAV in your cart while the sale happened Steam would return an error. The only way to buy the game was at $60 bundeled with something else like the previously mention Sharkcard GTA SA or Max Payne 3. Now thats a really move.Now there is a mod out there called FiveM what it does is allow users to host their own private servers seperate and in no way connected to Grindfest Online with Mod support. R* has seemed to banned the devs Socialclub account from doing litteraly anything even playing unmodded GTAV singleplayer or Maxpayne 3. Why?Because it works* with Pirated copies. I can tell you from a buddy of mine trying to get FiveM to ""work"" with a pirated copy is just a Nightmare and the devs don't even officially support it you try to tell them about a bug in a pirated copy and they will ingore you.UPDATE 1 1.29 Patch THEY FIXED THE OPTMIZATION! And also added new content to Grindfest Online. However from what I have seen all anyone wants is either Singleplayer DLC or New Hesit. Neither of which were added. Just some crappy side activities that you have to be in a public lobby to play. And With all the rampant hackers it will probably be no fun.UPDATE 2 Nov 9 2015 Rockstar/TakeTwo have shut down a mod known as GTA MP GTA MP is an alternative to Grindfest Online just like FiveM except it was built entirely from the gorund up and doesn't use any of the GTAO code unlike FiveM. Obviusly this was done to make sure they can keep pumping out those shark cards. They have also threatened legal action against FiveM why these people just don't come up with a fake russian name and get a Chinese Domain is beyond me. But TakeTwo and RockStar are still being A holes about it. Seriously just make an unranked MP section for Mods. Its that simple. That why all these MP mods kept showing up. But Why buy a T20 with sharkcard money when you can spawn one in. Screw you C* and T2. R* has shown that they don't care about the community but only their bottom line. EA has pulled some shady douch bag but I've only boycotted 1 company and that is Ubisoft (Remeber Watch_Dogs) but I will now add R* to my shitlist. I will update this review as they pull more If you HAVE TO play this game. Go go the the site with the privateers in that harbor with the shady ads.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-07,3,21,57,False,Recommended,Needless to say this is a great game. The best GTA? That's debatable. Trevor is great fun but Michael and Franklin were boring. Also I absolutely hate Michaels family. I get they are supposed to be annoying but they are too real if you get what I mean. The only downside perhaps is this game holds your hand tight unlike other GTA games. You will never break a sweat or worry for a second as the game will let you start right back where you left off.

I discovered Rockstar are now banning players because of modifying the game WHILE PLAYING OFFLINE! What a disgusting way of treating thousands of loyal customers and the PC community. Work with your customers not against them. Utterly disappointed in this company and can and will promise never to buy any games from them again.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-27,22,246,156,False,Recommended,NOTE I am actually going to review the game not the 3rd party extras for it since you putting your review under GTA V not insertname mod.So first of all I was extremely late to hop on board the band wagon for this game. I was never allowed to play it before I moved out of my mom's a year ago so generally speaking my reviews are on the game as it stands now.Summary An open world crime sandbox game with a detailed well scripted (although short) story mode and full featured online mode with a full fledged online mode. singleplayer follow the story of Franklin (an up and coming thug from the hood with strong ties) Michael (an ex criminal who is trying to stay on the downlow with a faked death coverup by the government a daughter a loser son and a B***h wife) and Trevor (unique phyco who litterally is not able to stop suprising you) as they go to pull of their greatest heists. online full featured open world with a light weight immersive story that is designed for multiplayer gaming where you custom make yout character.PROS Detailed graphics A online mode that is constantly getting updates and new features. Highly advanced online character creator Comercial and shows that are more honest and real than real life Mock internet that is amazing Tons of comunity created as well as first party missons that expand every day Well developed protagonists that each one has many things that make them unique Heists in online mode and singleplay that give you multiple outcomes and payouts depending on the crew and way you chose to do itCONS Ever since the introduction to shark card the payouts for online mode over all is terrible (with the exceptions of Heists which has been planned and developed before the game released) Online hacking is terrible (because of ileagle mods which is why Take 2 took drastic mesures in the first place). It is good as long as you stick to playing with friends and don't join open freemodes. Generally does not integrate well with Discord (this is actually just a con of personal prefrence and as long as you don't care about game overlay is not a problem) despite requirments for the game This game will run okay on most of your current everyday PCs (modern and with optimization)NETURAL Cops are extremly unrealistic. It makes the game playable and beatable. But really flipping the bird to a cop sitting on the side of the road causes same outcome as robbing a bank. Terrible flying controls when playing with keyboard/mouse (controller fixes this)OVERALL an amazing game and well reccomended,Grand Theft Auto V

Lag is so bad half the time you get disconnected from a lobby the second you join it.You will spend half of your time in the game loading that isnt an exaggeration it is just that bad after all online is peer to peer.Singleplayer Half decent story but the narrative is very lame because it has insightful and meaningful dialogue that has actual meaning followed up with 'raunchy jokes' so much so that any serious stuff in the game is made not so by a or fart joke. Has several unskippable minigame missions some are annoying others are just very long.Gunfights can be very very tiresome because there will be thousands of enemies coming at you and it just becomes a game of whack a mole with the enemies in cover.Overall Game Awful port I use a GTX 970 and I cannot even run full High settings without frame drops down to 15 20 fps.

I must say its fairly clever how they give you a shark card so you cant get a refund... wrong I know but still not a bad idea in terms if marketing.The other thing people are upset about is all the hackers online.

So maybe the male role models are not so good either.GTA online is also great it's full of cutomization options missions and it's regularly updated with new and free content so it stays alive long after it's release date.TL DR single player is a new iteration of the GTA formula with a few great new additions and the online game is the free mode every GTA fan always dreamt of.If you enjoyed previous GTA games this game will blow your expectations.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-07,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,Great game. The best open world game ever with the best character development and the best story. BUTRockstar Games you have shot yourself in the foot fo banning ALL modding. GTA IV was the game it was not because of the base game but because of the mods which were developed for it. That is what kept it alive all of this time GTA V will (after the initial craze and story completion) die. Because lets face it unless you bring out some really GREAT free DLC people will not want to spend 40 on a game they cant mod. That was one of the primary reasons i purchased the game in the first place. In summary Rockstar Games are cowards They allow people to fawk out their hard earned money then only tell them some weeks after. What i find the most shocking if you didnt even release a PreNote to tell everyone to remove their mods before the next update. No instead you just banned people outright.

2018-05-19,3,25,1927,False,Recommended,"Age 18+ Game Take it From Someone Who Actually Played the Game I'm going to start with saying that the game was very well made a masterpiece if you will. However that is not what this review is about. Most of you reading this are here to see if this is ok for your child. The straight and honest answer is entirely not. Unlike most who have made a review I have taken the time to play this game. Now I don't mean I played it for an hour or two hours or even five hours. I have played the game in full and have experienced all of its content. Some reviewers before me say that Common Sense is only telling half truths and that they are overreacting. If you took the time to play the game you would realize they are not. I'm going to debunk some of reviews before me. Nothing personal just the honest truth. A lot of parents on here say that they trust their child to stay away from the optional sexual content the game provides. Good for them. Trust is a good thing. However we've all been teenagers and did you ever do something that your parents told you not to do? Think about it. We've all done it. A lot of reviewers say that all the sexual content is avoidable. That is NOT TRUE. Some of the material is avoidable like the strip clubs which offers topless dancers or the fact that you can pick up prostitutes on the street and have intercourse with them in your car (it does show the scene without an option to skip). However the story does have sex scenes that bare all. One mission in particular you are working as freelance paparazzi taking pictures of celebrities. Next thing you know you're actively taking photos of an outdoor sex scene (again without the option to skip). Some say that it has an educational value in the form of a stock market. There is in fact an in game stock market but let me elaborate. The stock market is in place for you to abuse it by killing the oppositions customers and employees to raise your stock price in turn making a ""killing"" on the stock market. Oh and I can't forget about this. Some time into the story you play as Trevor and to continue on you have to actively take part in torture. You pull some teeth break some kneecaps and apply a bit of electricity. This is unavoidable and must be done to continue on through the game. Now I've only grazed the surface here and take the time to read some of the kids reviews they did give a higher age rating than the parents on here after all.

2017-07-22,1,3,130,False,Not Recommended,"I would first off like to say that if this you are about to buy the game for about $20 $30 and are mostly interested in the singleplayer then go right ahead because the singleplayer mode is actaully not bad. That being said the main draw to this game is the multiplayer which is frankly a joke... I got this game on sale for around $60 and that included a megalodon shark card with the game. To put that into perspective that means that I entered into this ""groundbreaking"" and ""revolutionary"" multiplayer with a $100 real world boost and I was still unable to fight against the tide of griefers nor was I able to even establish a way to make real money. The entirety of the game feels like it designed simply for you to buy shark cards which are uproariously expensive (I mean c'mon $100 for 8 mil GTA$ is nothing when considering that 8 mil gets you nowhere). Doing any kind of legitimate money producing activities will take you about an hour to earn 200 000 GTA$ and feels like a chore like you're going to work. Video games are about escapism and this is quite the opposite. Now to support the analogy about this game being work I'm gonna do some math here (scary I know). If 8mil GTA$ $100 and working in this game for 1 hour gets you 200 000 GTA$ then it would take you 40 hours of ""playing"" this game doing nothing but grinding out bunker missions or CEO missions (assuming you have ammased the minimum of 1 mil GTA$ is takes to aquire the cheapest of those things). To clarify this is the equivalent of working for $2.50/hr. Moving on from that note apart from being designed to make you buy shark cards it is designed for you not to be able to play solo. No not designed for you to play with other people but simply to be unable to play solo. Most things in this game have tight time limits and lots of AI enemies to deal with but nobody has the incentive to help you out because the only way to pay them is by hiring them as associates which still pays them MINIMAL amounts. After all is said and done you buy that car you've really wanted or you buy that new apartment or warehouse or whatever only to finddddddd that the car feels and sound just like every other that the apartment is interesting for only about 10 minutes or that the warehouse is only useful if you spend more money to do something with it.TL DR The game feels like a chore and takes forever to get anywhere when you finally do get somewhere it is painfully unrewarding after the first 10 minutes and there is little incentive for anyone to help you out whilst playing solo simply isnt an option.",Grand Theft Auto V

The latest incident I have come across is a lobby in which someone to say the least nuked the entire map causing lag and killing all players. Despite the cheaters and greifers the game is pretty amazing and fun to play with friends. As for story mode of the game it never fails to suprise you with its many activties you can do from different prespectives. I've played the game across every platform and watched it grow both in online and offline mode.

I didn't spend full price on this game but I am considering what I did spent to have been to much. I have turned it on time and time again with the mindset of ""I bought it I might as well play it"" but at this point I refuse. Unistalling process initiated. Like everyone else is saying the game is okay it is a fun time with friends and to screw around in single player but the story is repetitive you can play for an hour and feel like you haven't progressed at all. Some missions feel forced and sometimes don't make any sense and to me the whole story mode feels like it is stalling to make the game seem longer like missions where you drive a car for like 10 minutes to get to an objective why not put me closer to the objective. I am all for realism but every mission? Online is boring because no one plays probably because no one likes to play. As of now this is the last game of their's i will play they go on the list of companies I have lost respect for cuddled up all nice and cozy with ubisoft.Edit I decided the give the game another chance and for a while it was quite fun with mods it ran perfectly before the last update. Now i cant even open it due to a ""scripthook error"" I removed all mods and even replaced the scripthook with a new one that I know worked and it still wont run. Amazing. At least before i had the option of playing it now it is a useless turd that i spent 40 dollars for.

2017-03-29,1,3,246,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. I booted up the game for the first time in 3 months and joined a private lobby with several friends. I followed a Canadian around shooting people (as ya do) and we ended up getting 3 stars each. The Canadian friend decided to call his Mobile Operations truck and he'd hopped inside (which apparently gets rid of the wanted level entirely for some reason.)Messing around in his truck he realized it had a cannon started shooting that for a while waited for his next wanted level to go away and then the Canadian walked out of his truck while I stayed inside for my wanted level to go away. I hear him laughing hysterically and I decide to step outside to see the police shooting at the roof of the truck. ""What the hell are they even shooting at?"" We both said laughing.He then decides to move the truck about 10 meters forward to see if the cops were just shooting at the truck itself.It gets weirder.They weren't shooting at the truck. Instead an Asian man fell through the bottom of the truck. And the random Asian guy was in every sense of the word ""Indestructable."" After about 10 minutes of watching the cops shoot at this completely unresponsive man two other friends came over to try and kill the Asian a Redneck and a Pothead. We had 4 people and the entire Los Santos police force. What could possibly go wrong?Well apparently everything!The Asian man had been shot so many times within the first minute he'd probably had more metal in his face than a cashier at Hot Topic and just as many scars too. Eventually we had to improvise a new strategy to face this thing. A tank with a mounted railgun? Sounds like it'd work wonders doesn't it?Nope. We ended up shooting the guy for about 20 minutes with the only results being a higher wanted level.We didn't give up we tried running him over with a tank. Several times.""WHY WON'T THIS GUY DIE???"" All 4 of us had yelled.One of my friends suggested using the Orbital Strike. A risky move and also costs $500 000 to use a single time. The Redneck being the only one with access to one goes back to his facility and the Pothead is used as a sacrificial target. The shell lands directly on top of him the ground shakes violently and all the cars within a 30 meter radius are blown to smithereens. Chunks of hot metal and rock fly into the air with my friends eagerly waiting for the dust to settle. Once the dust clears we find 40 charred cars at least 20 corpses and a completely unscathed unharmed and perfectly healthy Asian man.""Are you f*cking kidding me?"" the Redneck says knowing he wasted $500 000.The very same person decides to bring out what he calls the ""Weeb Wing"". A carpet bomber with a bright pink paint job and several ridiculously large anime decals on the wings. Coming out of the Zancudo hangar and down to the western bays the Weeb Wing drops several clusters of bombs and after I told him that the bombs just didn't do anything he decides to come in for a kamikaze attack. He barrels down towards the Asian man and directly slams into him. The Weeb Wing explodes in a shower of shrapnel and fire. My other 2 friends and I go over to the crash site to find the Asian man lying dead underneath one of the wings. ""WE DID IT!"" I yelled. For a brief moment we were all celebrating the achievement of ""Killing an invincible Asian in a video game"" but a thought hit me.I say ""Wait no he's not dead he's just stuck under the wing.""The Canadian rams a car into the wing to get it out of the way of the Asian and AS SOON AS HE DOES THAT the Asian just casually gets up brushes the dust off his shoulder and just stands there. This cycle continued for the next 10 to 20 minutes as all of us are laughing hysterically in the Discord server. Eventually we decided to throw in the towel and let the engine fix our problem. The next strategy was to wait for the man to despawn.For the next hour and a half we completely forgot the man existed. The occasional joke about him would come up only to be swiftly forgotten. I then decided to drive back down to ""The Area"" to see if he'd despawned yet. As I slowly pulled my car up to ""The Area"" I heard gunshot after gunshot.""No way..."" I whispered to my self trying not to laugh.I sped up and whipped around the corner to see 8 cops shooting at the Asian.""NO F*CKING WAY!"" I yell laughing hysterically shortly after.I hear the Pothead say ""What's wrong with him? Why's he laughing?"" As I try and calm myself the Redneck sees where I'm at on the map.""There's no way... There's no way..."" I hear the Redneck say followed by more hysterical laughter.""The Asian is STILL ALIVE! GET DOWN HERE!"" I say trying to keep a straight face.After about 3 minutes of shooting at the Asian we decide to push him into the ocean with the help of a car. After slamming into him at full speed he flies into the water and casually swims back to shore.We then decide to think about how we can dispose of the Asian for the next 5 minutes and I had the perfect plan. ""Here's what we need. A tugboat a bulldozer and a cargobob. I know where to get the cargobob I need one of you guys to watch the Asian and make sure he doesn't ACTUALLY despawn.""The Redneck buys a tugboat and brings it to shore. The Pothead stands on the tugboat while watching the Asian making sure neither of the two despawn. The Canadian and the Redneck move up to Paleto Bay to grab a bulldozer while I'm making my way to the docks to grab the cargobob. The plan is to pick the Asian man up in the bulldozer pick the bulldozer up with the cargobob and drop the bulldozer on top of the tugboat. The tugboat is then supposed to be taken out to sea and blown up.Once all the vehicles are taken back to the shore I force the Asian man to sit in the bucket on the dozer and I grab the cargobob gently align the hook annnnnnddd.... Nothing. It was at this moment all 4 of us simultaniously said ""Oh no..."" I then say ""uhhh okay. Move the tugboat over to that pier and I'll try and dump the guy on the boat.This didn't work. At all. The bulldozer got stuck on a set of stairs just before being able to dump the Asian over the railing. Eventually the Canadian had to bring his flying car over and punt the Asian over the railing and onto the tugboat.""WE DID IT!"" everyone yelled. We then took the boat as far out into the Pacific ocean as we could while another friend we simply called ""Nevada"" brought an escape boat. All 3 of my friends jumped off the tugboat and onto the other significantly faster boat. I pulled a grenade out from my pocket stood next to the Asian and said ""See you at the shore."" before blowing myself and the boat to smithereens.Once it finally sank the others in the escape boat had said the Asian guy was just floating in the water. Not dead just sitting idle in the water.It was finally over the Asian man was finally at sea away from civilization and from that day forward Los Santos was slightly more peaceful than an Irish pub.After all of this the Asian survived AT LEAST 40 000 bullets of various calibers200+ cars (both hitting him and exploding)A god damned kamikaze attackAn Orbital StrikeA carpet bombing90 Rail cannons to the faceGetting hit in the face by a flying carA grenade to the face10/10 a hilariously accurate portrayal of combating China's birth rate crisis",Grand Theft Auto V

These missions suck already because Rockstar wants you to spend a ton of money buying a small garage so you can acess those missions so if you're a new player it'll take a lot of time just to start playing the ""new"" content.Got this in 2016's last sale and I don't recommend it now (1 2 years after launch would be fine) unless you plan on wasting an additional $200+ buying in game cash with real money to instantly get everything.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-14,0,0,1045,False,Not Recommended,Been playing GTA for years now and I'm glad I can finally put this game behind me. Single player was a lot fun but all development is focused on multiplay. Which is fine if it wasn't for all the Modders/Hackers. People talk about wanting mods for games To do what? They give you some innocent perfectly legit reason for a game to have mods. What ever good comes from the modding community is over shadowed by the sheer number of people that make it a point to ruin the game for everyone else. So...1) I'm done having to leave a session because a modder is god killing everyone in the lobby.2) I'm done losing money because some modder is ruining everything in the session.3) I'm done hoping Rockstar will take responsibilty and fix this probelm. Which I've been told that it's not Rockstars problem It's my fault and I should just join another session when there are cheaters.4) I'm done with all the excuses.5) I'm done with the drip feed cash grab and underhanded tactics.The genre has been run into the ground and I don't care if there is another GTA or anything else coming from Rockstar. I'm putting this game and everyone invovled to rest. There plenty of other games and developers doing more and striving to be better. I'm done .,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-20,0,0,878,False,Recommended,gonna give you an honest opinionthe games run smooth and the city is alive some story mission and their conversations are hilarious and there are some missions that feel like they are pointless.there are lot of cars which you can customize they handle very nice and it improves based on your driving skill. there is a semi decent modding community.online mode with some heists and few decent racing tracks and lots of filler content. they become repetetive eventually.you can spend lot of time in this game and have fun even after beating the story but the more you play the more obvious flaws become.speaking of flaws my major giref is the cops. they will ram your car and you get wanted level for their fault than they start shooting you. they spawn right in your face endlessly and they always know who you are and where you are even if you teleport from franklins house to top of mount chiliad the cops will be there in 5 seconds. helicopters appear out of nowhere and the cops on board will aim bot you to death. bullets dont travel in air to hit you but the game spawns hits on you reducing your health.sometimes make me wonder why this game take so much time to develop when cops are so broken.another problem is in the online mode the dummies among us running around with cheats (ironicaly they call it mods) and ruining your expirience. if you dare to complain about what they do they will involve your mom and other members of family in the argument they may even put your sexual interests up for debate. you can do nothing about it. they will kill people in your name they shoot money at you and blow you up in your own garage and apartment.after all this i am still going to give it a thumbs up because i played single player twice and put decent hours into multiplayer which it was very fun at times.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-14,0,0,186,False,Recommended,The story mode is interesting but the real draw here is a lifetime membership to the MMO Grand Theft Auto Online. Create a character steal a car. Make it your's or sell it for some cold hard cash and play the entire game on foot. Rob a store. Team up with other players and rob a bank. Do missions for shady NPCs. The choice is yours as long as the choice is morally wrong. It's a wide open sandbox for criminal wannabes of all types. If there's one thing I'm disappointed at is that there's no internet criminal path. You're stuck with physical crimes like theft street racing and heists. There's no way to do online scams or just hack NPCs to steal from their bank accounts. I suppose R* doesn't want to cross over to Ubisoft's and Introversion Software's turf (and I suppose the game is called Grand Theft Auto for a reason) but it would be nice to be able to commit anonymous crimes aside from physical ones.EDIT I've been just been made aware about hackers and R*'s hijinks at punishing the wrong party I'll just relay a piece of advice I got on a friend create a private crew or private friend session so only you and your friends will be in the entire session and no one else. Of course therein lies the minor rub you can only create or join private sessions by logging into Story Mode first not directly from the main menu. R* would do good to offer a submenu to choose a session type (join public session create/join private friend/crew session and create/join invite only session) when the Online option is chosen in the main menu instead of just dumping people into a public session. Also I can see this being a problem to those who don't know any friends who play GTA O but it's not like you can't enjoy the world solo in fact a large number of tasks in the world can be played solo.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-22,0,0,313,False,Not Recommended,"This game can easily be compared to a rich spoiled kid that got everything they wanted considering that this in a lot of ways was a step down from its predecessors. San Andreas and GTA 4 had much better story designs for the campaign and it was really fun to play which was never dragged down from how realistic the game wanted to act like however GTA V tries its hardest to be good and realistic as possible but it never had that much effort put in it to actually give it the GTA feel it feels more like a game that's only ""good"" from its popularity and was fun for the first 100 hours I put into it.GTA online has to be the worst possible experience from any Grand Theft Auto game I've ever played. Right from the start they force you to do a lot of really dumb missions in order to get any money at all and if you aren't playing with friends then you have to learn everything basically by yourself. Playing with 90% of the strangers if a ing nightmare and I'm even surprised some people can actually deal with the overwhelming amount of cheaters trolls micspammers and people that are just trying to ruin the experience for the rest of the people. 50% of the lobbies I've been in have consisted of at least 1 cheater and someone flying in a jet that's almost impossible to destroy but they have homing missiles that can destroy any vehicle under $1 500 000 instantly. Along with this there are the VIP people that have a whole crew that mind their own business sometimes but will gang up on people just for the sake of it. Doing missions and heists are the most frustrating. There have been people in my heist lobbies that will literally do the whole mission and leave at the last second which STOPS THE ENTIRE HEIST TO RESET. Most of the devs have given up trying to add material that aren't cars and more melee weapons that are extremely overpriced not to mention that loading time of eons that'll make you wait which is where I even got most of my hours from.If you have no friends don't buy this game go use it on something better.",Grand Theft Auto V

If you didn't preorder you're up for a grind initially because heists don't become available (unless invited by others) until level 12. Even then it's a while to rank up which is good for the long term bad for those that want to just get in there and f*** s*** up.There were inital issues graphically (AMD R9 290 lots of stutter) however after upgrading the drivers there were no issues and it runs smoothly at 50fps at 1440p.TLDR Great graphics if you get them to work MP is great fun but may initially be a grind if you didn't preorder.,Grand Theft Auto V

Random cars that are not even powerful fast or armoured cost 1m+ if you are level 100 or higher it is hard to tell if you are not modder because rockstar bans legit players because some random kid in your lobby dropped you 2k... I would say 5/10 because online has something that singleplayer doesn'tIs it worth paying 60 for GTA V? No but it is worth to buy GTA V for 20,Grand Theft Auto V

Finally as of April 13th we are able to get the game. The first thing we all experienced was that the launcher wasn't working for some people and online wasn't working for everyone until 2hours later.Preloading the game was a pain for people who had installed the game on there SSD Rockstar why didn't you tell us the game was 120gb when extracted?

Today its a f*cking yacht for over 10M and your payment is still the same as in 2013. Each update adds more cars that are over 500k and its rare to see a car thats below 500K today. They're just forcing you to buy Sharkcards that are more expensive than the base game... This is the first time I saw the P2W mechanics in a 60 game. I had to grind money for 2 months to get a yacht. From 10 AM to 10 PM doing VIP Jobs. The worst thing is that they want to add more microtransactions into RDR2.

The game demands that you grind for 100s of hours that most of us do not have. You can't progress because cheaters will remotely explode you or mess with you in some way. The single player is great the graphics are great the game could be great but the online mode is absolutely abysmal.Why not just charge money for DLC?

2018-02-18,0,0,455,False,Not Recommended,I d watch mission impossible if I wanted this gay dlc that makes me feel like I m playing payday 2 but even that would be preferred over the state of the online in this game.The singleplayer is good for what it has on offer though pretty much everyone knows this by now. A good cynical plot which mocks capitalism and big time corporations as well as popular media moguls that are popular for no logical reason. It s good for how self aware it is in the story it presents to the player and a simple story plot you d expect from the synopsis of one of Michael Mann s big screen masterpieces is translated well across into this game medium. Michael is easily the best character out of the three on offer with a backstory and overarching character line that feels like welcoming straight homage to old noir films of the 40s and 50s with the charm and anti hero aspect like that of a character from Apocalypse Now you re not meant to like him and what he does but you can t help but feel enticed by his quest and view him from a humane point of view.Franklin is the character that changes the most throughout the singleplayer creating a narrative to show his rise from a two bit gangster to big time crook though what s disappointOMG is the seemingly evident tunnel vision with his interaction with other characters despite the good execution of the cutscenes and what they have on offer overall it appears that not much thought was given to show Franklin s relations with other characters outside of Michael and Trevor (and Lester at a stretch most clear towards the end. Lamar is only present at the start before the jump to Michael is made also).Trevor is the typical mad case and comic relief to the sometimes dark tone that the narrative heads in but if you look past the aspect of humour you see a poorly executed and shallow written character. Apart from the one mission on your journey to LS I remember nothing else of Trevor s backstory that was told other than the bank job at the start of the game that he feels the need to remind Michael every interaction (and the player too).Gameplay is solid driving is responsive and satisfying and the combat is requiring some work (most clear in online) but good for the most part to keep the player entertained but also on their toes when the formula for mission gunfights and sometimes changed up. Chop is annoying as the little side interaction for Franklin that he is but thankfully avoidable for most of your larger gameplay. Devin Weston s missions are tedious and nothing else gathering cars for his financial gain feels nothing but than to increase the length of the singleplayer and in a map with little subtle terrain differences it grows boring to speed the tarmac of LS over and over again for the six or so cars you have to gather for him. Overall however the singleplayer is fun and worth a replay once completed.I only give this a downvote because of how shockingly the online is and it s incredibly slim in chance that it ll ever be fixed so my rating won t change.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-15,1,3,219,False,Recommended,This is an all around great game that will make you spend countless hours messing around with cheat codes mods crime and much more.PROS. So many things to do making the world insanely immersive GTA Online has people competing in all different kinds of missions races etc. to make it rich The console peasant race has nothing over the PC master race anymore MOD SUPPORT Well written story with many interesting characters Rockstar editor can be used to make some EPIC action slow mo clips movies montages etc. Too many things to do (You will NOT get bored)CONS. The game had some performace issues when it first came out (FPS dipping way too low when driving fast lag when cops showed up etc) GTA Online can take AGES to connect to The game requires an entry level graphics card if you even want to run the game on low settings The clumsy gunplay (which is fine) is sometimes annoying to use with a mouse so I definitely recommend a controller to play (this is what i did) Random game model glitches which kill your FPS (I was driving through the mountains when a tree glitched out and its branches shot up into the sky infinitely long and killing my fps. Other things like this have happened multiple times and require a game restart.) The game is more than a 60 GB download so if you don't have super speed internet get ready for a long time waiting and a lot of bandwidth used up.FINAL VERDICT.This game is huge and immersive with countless fun and interesting characters and missions. Rockstar really didn't blow this one off. The PC port of GTA 5 could be better but at the moment it is not bad. The game has some beautiful graphics which will kill your PC if you don't have one that is good enough but the game now runs smooth and I rarely run into issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-04,0,0,252,False,Not Recommended,"With GTA V being my most played game of all time (over 900 hours across all platforms) I can't deny the fun factor of this game. But the business decisions that Rockstar and TakeTwo have made over the past 3 years is honestly sickening. Rockstar is a company GTA V is a product the goal is to make money. Me compaining about microtransactions in 2016 is pointless but to see this game fall so hard from grace right before my eyes makes me sad.The updates from 2013 to early 2014 were great they encouraged a healthy balance of grinding and buying shark cards (I even bought a few back in the day) the problem I have is the economy and how inflated it is. 79.99 will get you $8 million in game that would get you far back then but now that will barely get you a few cars and an apartment.My issues don't end with the ""ugh muh microtransactions"" rant the community is a whole other story. Iirc the game was rated 18+ by the ESRB so why is every server populated by 12 year olds swearing like sailors? Free roam is just an endless onslaught of chromed out supercars and sticky bombs it gets boring fast. Heist are nigh impossible due to the randoms who love catching bullets with their faces. Contact missions feel meaningless spending 10 15 minutes for a measly payout after putting up with AFK farming ""team mates"".I haven't even mentioned the infamous Rockstar support team but there are plenty of stories about them for you to read. The current state of GTA V (or more specifically GTA Online) make me fearful of Red Dead Redemption 2 I have no doubts that the gameplay will be as awesome as the first but the inevitability that Rockstar will make the online component a souless cash cow is why I'll probably avoid it.

2017-06-14,2,3,628,False,Not Recommended,Take Two Interactive have figuratively shot the heart of what makes this game good and keeps it alive the modding community. People mod this game to get the crap you have to either work tens of hours to obtain the money to buy what you want or pay for in game money by way of an overpriced microtransaction and that's just for GTA Online. In singleplayer vehicles like the Hydra aren't available and don't spawn anywhere so people modded the game to get these vehicles without having to go into the microtransaction ruled world of GTA Online. It was announced today (at the time of writing) that Take Two sent a cease and desist letter to the publisher of the largest modding tool in the GTA V community OpenIV used for 10 years for every single mod you can imagine go onto any modding site for GTA V on the first featured page will 100% be a mod that uses OpenIV to work. Do not buy this game or any game at all from Take Two Interactive until this terrible decision has been undone. People already bought this game 3 times once for PS3 and Xbox 360 again for the Next Gen release on PS4 and Xbox 1 and finally the PC version which people specifically bought for the modding that would come out. If you play GTA Online you have to pay a grand total of $99.99 USD for $8 million in game cash and this amount of cash isn't even enough to purchase a superyacht which can go to $10 million. This game was already a microtransaction wridden piece of but now they've killed one of the largest sections of this game's community it has become the biggest piece of I have ever seen. I am appaled that Take Two have the gall to send a letter stating that modding is against their rights and illegal even when the majority of mods made for GTA V are for SINGLEPLAYER and not for GTA Online which has anti cheat systems in place anyway preventing modded games from joining GTA Online. I say again Do NOT buy this game or any Take Two Interactive game until this decision is completely reversed.

I've played it about 11 times already and there's so many things to do in the world that each playthrough feels a little different each time. Unfortunatly Rockstar has decided to never touch singleplayer again so that's quite a bummer. At least the mods on PC are there to make singleplayer worth your while. And do you know why Rockstar has not decided to touch single player? Onine. That God dang GTA Online.ONILINE MODE When it came out in October 2013 GTA Online revolutionized the online experience. A whole new economic system where you can have a traditional Grand Theft Auto experience while doing missions and jobs to earn GTA$. I'll always remember how I grinded for a whole night on rooftop rumble just to get myself a Turismo R. super car. Those were the days. Everything was reasonably priced and you felt rewarded for your grind to show off your new merch to your friends. It was a simpler time as there was no complexity within the system about making money.Fast forward to 2017.The thing Rockstar realized is that they can release any form of new content in this game and people are gonna buy it one way or another. The shark card system is absolutely stupid because of the fact that $20 for 1.25 million in game is gonna barely get you a new car at this point (Back in the day it was gonna get you like 3 4 fully upgraded nice cars). Hell it's not gonna get you a freaking garage to store all the new vehicles in from the ""Import/Export"" DLC. If I can even call it DLC. People are going to defend Rockstar by saying ""Oh stfu it's free content that Rockstar is giving you be thankful."" No. I will not be subjected to this obligation of praising the company due to the sheer fact that I can't afford anything in game anymore. I realize there are CEO missions and biker goals. But here's the thing those cost tons of money to start up. I realize it costs money to make money but in a game with an economic system in mind the way that Rockstar is making you earn GTA$ is ing ridiculous. You wanna make a million? Yeah sure! Spend about $5 000 000 (which is about $75 in shark cards) to buy yourself a CEO office and some crates and grind till the day is done! Then you're gonna barely make profit because we want you to expand your business and in order to do that you're gonna need another $2 000 000 for a bigger warehouse!This whole sytem is ed. As I said earlier. This is not ""free DLC."" Rockstar implements mandatory updates so that every sorry sucker can see what they can spend their hard earned money on inside the game. I think this game has the highsest highs and the lowest lows when it comes to experience within the game. You want to get a new rocket car that you've wanted in the game since launch? Sure! Spend $2 000 000 to become a CEO. Then spend $1 000 000 $4 000 000 on an office. Next spend $3 000 000 on a vehicle warehouse. And then...ONLY THEN can you spend $5 000 000 on the car. It's like some sort of ed up pyramid scheme triggered by Rockstar to scam people out of their money and to make them think that the whole process is well worth the reward at this point. I'm done giving in to the stupid crap that Rockstar implements. Either fix the game's value or just move on. I'll still play this game because I still enjoy playing around in freemode with my friends but this whole system of nearly forcing people to buy shark cards is just not making me enjoy the game as much as I used to 3 years ago. So thanks for making such an awesome open world game Rockstar. But no thanks on the constant attempted cashgrabs you are trying to scam me and millions of others out on. Gonna still play the game but not reccomend it until Rockstar gets their god damn acts together. I hope this whole system doesn't inspire Red Dead Redemption 2's online to become just as bad. Plagued with microtransactions. The main premisce of GTA is no longer about stealing cars but who has the most money to fork over. Thanks for reading this review. Have a good one.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-21,0,0,344,False,Not Recommended,Its fun to play with friends but it went to since R* became greedy fagg.0ts and started ramping up the price of everything to unimaginable heights ($10 000 000 for a gold airplane which literally serves the same function as the basic one) to sell shark cards (cards you buy with real money to get in game money).Its a 60 game yet they still feel the need to make EVEN MORE MONEY. There's literally a shark card which costs more than the base game at full price. The job payouts are total trash if you're not doing a heist/the leader of one. Car exporting payouts are also despite being the 2nd best way to make money in the game. 100k (with 20k costs of modifying the car) for a top range car that's worth 2+ million on the market. Also its in freeroam so either NPC s are gonna keep spawning everywhere trying to damage your car which will make you get even less money or other players will straight up blow your car up. Its a fun game with loads to offer but it got swallowed by microtransaction hell until something is done about that this review will stay negative.Oh also the story is pretty good i guess,Grand Theft Auto V

OpenIV started out as a tool for Grand Theft Auto IV (Henve the IV in OpenIV) to allow modders the ability to create more complex mods (such as Iron Man's suit the DeLorean etc.) in the Singleplayer portion of GTA IV. In comes GTA V with Online and nothing was done to keep Online safe from hackers. The tool that they thought caused the hacking? Turns out it doesn't even touch Online and actually prevents you from going online.

2016-08-30,1,3,341,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstars latest release. A game filled with action fun and comedy from time to time. GTA V takes us back to Los Santos where GTA San Andreas was set. From the last installment in the GTA franchise we see some improvements and some letdowns. But of course this is just me comparing the two and giving my own opinion. Also I will try keep this as spoiler free as possible.Pros 1. You now have 3 charcters to play with. Franklin an african american who lived his life in the hoods and now wants a change. Michael a criminal who faked his death in a bank job in front of his best friend to make it out with money and then move to sunny LS after living in the cold hard conditions of North Yankton. Which brings me on to Trevor a psychopathic drug addict who is hunting down for his best friend that faked his murder.2. Adding on to the first pro is that now during missions containing more than two of the protagonists you can switch between them whenever you see fit. During missions heists and whilst roaming about!(BEWARE YOU MIGHT FIND TREVOR WEARING A SKRT OR SLEEPING ON THE EDGE OF A BRIDGE)3. Better graphics and optimization in gameplay than on GTA IV.4. Little touches that make you appreciate the game more such as Improved gun sounds (Compared to IV) Car makes beeping noise when door open whilst engine running car engine makes little cracking sound when enine turned off and many many more.5. Online. Now as I see it online is its own game. GTA online is its own little experience meeting new players racing doing online heists and deathmatches are a thing. 6. Rockstar have decided to keep the DLC free in fear of ripping apart the community. The downside is that the stuff they add is usually like duper cars or other expensive vehicles. The problem is that they cost way too much and you would need to invest in ingame currency.7. The modding community. The modding community is awesome and very helpful.Now this part I hate doing. But here guys are the cons.1. Online modders and hackers dropping you money you try leaving before uts too late. But you still get banned.2. Shortest story in the franchise. The story mode is amazing. But it is the shortest and some saying that it is the worst in the franchise.3. The physics are flawed. Anyone who has played GTA IV and GTA V will see and acknowledge the differences between the two games in the way the physics work. In GTA IV you felt like you actually had a heavy or a light car which hanles differently. Also the collisions are a lot more realistic than in GTA V because you can actually see the damage on both cars. Where as in GTA V you can bearly see any cosmetic damage. Also you cant get by 80mph. I dont k know why but you cant. Though there is a semi realistic physics which brings back some of the GRA IV physics.4. The price. I bought this game on 25%off sale. And i dont think its worth full price. But I guess if you really want to go agead. You know what youre getting. Cough* Cough* no mans sky.ConclusionDo I reccomend this game? Yes. Although ot took a long time too decide I think its worth it. Although the physics arent as good and the story isnt that long I still believe it is a good game. I think people like me were too pretentious after GTA IV which wasnt perfect itself but yeah.Btw you think i dont have that many hours on GTA IV. But i played it on the ol 360 a while back.I hope this helped ),Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-17,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,"Good(ish) Enjoyable single player missions but unfortunately have no option for online co op. Most all customizations are satisfying in game until you look at what is available online.This game is enjoyable while playing privately with friends but this does make the online session feel extremely robotic and void of life but is made up for in the ability to have a private heist with your friends... as long as you have enough players to fill the REQUIRED slots even though some missions don't seem to need that many people.Custom game matches are for the most part enjoyable but again the problem with them being public is hacking idling and intentionally ruining gameplay for other players. There seems to be a lack of ability to kick players from your game or party.The season switching and events are particularly enjoyable but when the event or season is over the items are no longer buyable and vanish from your inventory or weapon slots when you run out of ammo. Ex Winter allows you to pick up snow and throw snowballs at people fourth of july gave players a firework launcher and other masks/clothing available.Bad Let me start off by saying I only harshly reviewed this game because of the recent problems that seem to be occuring more often in online mode. I was given without asking or knowing every gun in the game and I believe my account has been flagged as a ""Hacker"" account and now when joining sessions I seem to be put into laggy hacker sessions full of people harassing people without hacks. I wouldn't be surprised if I logged in one day to have everything I have and my stats completely wiped.Filled with hackers and punishment is given out to innocent players cought up in a session with someone cheating the in game currency is also geared towards pay to win in that its easier playing alone to buy shark cards instead of go through the painful process of finding the required amount of players without them failing the mission. There is an incredibly inbalanced rank difference and starting out especially while playing alone it is very hard to rank up past 50.I'm no security expert but I can tell you Rockstar's team that works on security has no idea how to properly implement authentication algorithms. Rockstar needs to fire whoever is in charge of software and server side security they have no clue what they're doing and don't deserve what they're being paid.The inbalance and problems that plague this game are endless and keeps me questioning whether I should even bother playing online anymore and single player is just no fun after it is complete. The ""hack"" or movie mode giving you the ability to change in world weather your characters etc requires you to unlock things through online play and is fairly unenjoyable as is with an extremely limited select amount of options (You would be better off playing offline with a hack mod in single player and have much more fun and be able to record more entertaining content than the vanilla movie mode even with everything unlocked).Conclusion This game looks great and runs extremely well on most hardware but I only have 60 hours clocked in game and a large part of that was waiting in lobies and campaign/movie mode. The above stated bad reviews are why I play this game so little and don't find myself excited to play alone or even with a few friends.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,340,False,Recommended,This game is by far the best game I have EVER played. Let's start off with the story. The writing is movie quality for starters. The characters are people you end up caring about and you want to know more about them and what happens to them throughout the story. The overall plot is amazing with twists and turns making you feel excitement fright sadness and so much more. And with three seperate and unique endings the story mode has a lot of replay value. The story would make this game a 10/10 on its own. But then there is GTA Online. A part of the game where you throw logic and morals out the window and just do whatever you want with friends. You can invade a military base take part in multistage thrilling heists go sightseeing drive insane speeds in races go on a murder spree (with friends) play custom game modes or do many of the other things online has to offer.

2015-06-25,0,0,91,False,Recommended,"This game is so much fun and I have enjoyed it a lot. Unfortunately it has some crashing issues that need to be worked out. I've played for 50+ hours and have updated drivers and waited for game updates but neither have helped. The game always crashes due to one of two things either a ""failed initialization"" or I need to sign into social club again. This problem is not occasional either it seems to be able to happen anywhere from game startup to at most three hours of gameplay before I have to make multiple attempts to counter the problem. However this does not ruin the game for me since this is simply a bug that can be fixed. The storyline is fun and being able to switch characters adds to the experience. Each have their own ""perks"" that make them fun to use. My favorite is Trevor because of how similar he is to a friend of mine. The speech that Michael gives to him shortly after you meet Trevor makes the game for me. The vastness and diversity bring it to a new level of open world gaming. Yes much like the other games the cars are all very different depending on the region you are in and some can be found customized already. But what impresses me is that no two NPCs in the world are alike as long as your PC has the specs for this setting. I don't care too much for the first person view something doesn't seem right about it but there are the occasional times where I enjoy it.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone it is plenty of fun and can easily keep you entertained just like many of the previous GTA's.

Accordingly PC version will provide you with high resolution graphics and detailed environment. You will have the option to mod the game just like previous titles new missions vehicles skins weapon skins but that belongs with the modding community so I m going to leave it behind. First GTA game that lets you control several characters (3 as a whole) at the same time by interactive switching between them during gameplay main story missions or not. + intuitive design for the switching character interface Biggest map in GTA universe + all the map is open from the beginning no restricted area before playing character X nor doing mission Y. Mission that involve one protagonist two or all the main story characters together bringing chaos on the island of Los Santos Each protagonist has its own special ability that you will discover during a little tutorial Beside main story there are also another activity that you can perform such as tennis golf yoga races with bikes jet skiing hunting and a few more You can now use your phone to take pictures text friends and browse internet + afferent activities There is now an actual stock market that you can play and invest your money and at least in single player activities in the world will inflict in the evolution of the stock market There is wildlife in the world of Los Santos such as dogs birds cougars fish Weather system is complex and together with the world of the game creates a beautiful experience and immersion during missions or free roaming Customizable experience such as new clothes haircuts and tattoos Cars are customizable both single player and multiplayer armor breaks paint jobs bumpers chassis engine exhaust hood lights spoilers roof skirts suspension transmission you name it and you ll most probably going to find it there. Big variety of weaponry can be bought and also customized at the Ammu Nation store There s a big variety of missions + a very big amount of events and interactions on the side of the game the will let you feel that the world of Lost Santos is pretty much aliveAnd now from the multiplayer point of view Multiplayer lobby on PC and current gen consoles xbone and playstation allows up to 30 players There s a nice introduction to multiplayer after creating your personal character (creation and customization) that teaches you some of the basics of the game seen from multiplayer point of view Players can buy cars bikes tanks planes helicopters and so on and store them in specific places cars for example in garage that players own by buying them or buying a house that has a garage. Different services that are available via phone such as mechanic for example that can deliver a car from you garage anywhere on the map near the road in a few seconds Different online game modes such as deathmatch survival capture race free roam and more Different jobs that after you complete you get in game money and rank points that will help you increase your rank and build a budget so you can afford things. Also completing missions and going higher in the ranking system will unlock new missions weapons clothes car upgrades and different vehicles that you ll be able to purchase afterwards from stores in the game world or via internet browser from your in game phone or computer. Jobs can be accessed from your phone or from the menu while you are in the lobby. There is the passive mode which you can activate if don t want to be bothered by other players in the lobby while you are moving through the world You can heal equip armor and other quick things from a little interaction menu while roaming or while in mission Pretty good variety of missions jobs and activities as you can drive your cars ride your bikes or ski dive fly planes jets and helicopters dive in the ocean with the submarineI know that not everybody likes this game and it can get bad with a lot of modding and people that will make your experience not so pleasant but there always the option of moving to another lobby.The part of the game that will make you like it/enjoy it less People bagging modders for free money Modders bringing hell to the lobby by exploding/killing/ everybody Modders taking away all your weapons for the current lobby as you ll get them back when joining another game Lagging lobby or players Cheaters like in any other multiplayer game with a decent player base After you get rank 100+ you already did all the jobs/races/ almost everything at least twice Limited number of heists which had a very big potential when announced that will be available for multiplayer If you don t have at least a friend to play the game trying to play harder missions with random people can be frustrating General voip that will give you headache but there s always the option to turn it offThe good thing though is that the games receives updates from Rockstar. You ll see different activities added through the game also alternative things that you ll spend your money on if you want to own such as cars yachts and different organizations. Community support is there people create races and jobs. Not all of them are great and all but at least it can provide a little bit of variety.The game is not the best game ever but it s not the worst either far from it from my point of view and from the other big majority that is still playing the game even in this moment. I know lots of other things could be fitted in but feel free to try it it is not that bad.. D,Grand Theft Auto V

NO MODS! Mods are the lifeblood of PC gaming and if you take that away it harms the longevity of the product and limits the fun the players can have. It's ridiculous that you don't allow mods in singleplayer.... I THOUGHT that you would embrace the modding community this time because of all the great things that the modders did with the s*** port of GTA 4 and often created mods that made the game more stable and mods like LCFR that gave a unique view of playing the game through a cops eyes.Overall rockstar i love the game i've loved ever single GTA but how could you disgrace your PC consumers by delaying the port almost 2 years after release and now banning mods....,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-12,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,Thoroughly overrated title with lopsided focus on multiplayer. I don't care about multiplayer for a second. I mean who wants to voluntarily surround themselves with a horde of teenagers trying to shooting each other? There are plenty of games for that already.What was great about GTA IV (the best of GTA by far) gripping story awesome protagonist realistic gritty setting attention to details cool physical model with actual weight and inertia affecting all interactions (walking/fighting/driving) and much more.GTAV lost much of that charm. I am especially disappointed with lackluster story with the three main characters who are all truly repulsive. The graphics and gameplay were done very nicely but at one point I just could not continue playing story mode as I could not care less about these clowns. And who in a right mind would... Anyway further to that the next big disappointment is severely simplified physical model most obvious with purely arcade driving style.In short GTA IV was more a game for adults. In comparison GTAV is a pre school entertainment gimmick. Yes it's beautiful and has its use but the experience is disappointingly shallow.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-14,0,0,48,False,Recommended,I've already played this game on console so the hours played are not correct... With that said. The game is way different from console. I mean... it is the same game. but it feels and plays much better.I max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps. if I ever do i get like 55 fps... not a big deal. So Rockstar did a great job porting the game. It seems people are having issues logging in to the social club. I never had that problem. My friend did though. His steam name had a dot at the end (name.). Once he removed that dot he was able to log in. It has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols. The game The story is crazy and filled with even crazier people. The longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes. I love the characters though I think rockstar did a much better job in Red Dead Redemption when it comes to personalities. The world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored. If you somehow get bored there's always the multiplayer. I've not tried it yet on pc... but I can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes. I am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,Take Two killed the OpenIV mod software for GTA V in order to save Online from cheaters despite OpenIV could not modify the multiplayer files. Honestly it takes a special kind of stupid to outright claim that modding isn't allowed for your game. Mods are part of the PC gaming experience and allow for people to enjoy their games in new and fun ways or sometimes fix issues the devs have not with unoffical pattches. Yes some people will go too far and use mods to gain an unfair advantage and cheat in the game but killing off modding won't stop that. You can't just flap a legal document around and think everyone is going to stop. There are still going to be cheaters and honestly banning mods is going to make more people cheat to spite the publisher. Rockstar has nothing to do with this they've openly showcased mods and said that they enjoy the community created content. The blame for this action falls with Take Two. I will however commend Take Two it takes guts to do something so stupid that is bound to off the community. 0/10 for killing the modding community. 10/10 for their balls for doing this however.https //cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder859/500x/34373859/this is not your regular darkness this isnt your average everyday stupid this is advanced stupid.jpg,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-07,0,0,144,False,Not Recommended,"So how to begin?Was the ban wave last week some kind of alpha version for a more specific one? At least it's a free DLC with no internet connection required.I'll start over. Rockstar had to deal with a huge general steam review drop due to an uncontrolable and automatic ban wave. They fixed the issue promptly and the banned accounts were restored with a ""apology"" bonus. Oh if you used the words ""ban(ned)"" or ""suspend(ed)"" the ticket would be automatically closed giving you no chance whatsoever to see justice if you were unfairly BANNED by the algorythm. Wait... Is being banned the reward for good behaviour during online play?You might be asking ""Wasn't this issue solved? Why is he on about this?"". You'd think they solved the issue but you'd be wrong. The random bans continue and Rockstar's response is ""Your account has been suspended. ticket closed "". That's it.That IS fu(king IT!Rockstar listen to your playerbase! AT LEAST try to show EMPATHY. FIX your incompetence fire whoever needs to be fired and as Morty says ""get your $hit together"". You made billions of dollars with this game can't you hire someone who reads the tickets answers them with humanity in their souls and actually HELPS the players?My friends and I wanted to play this together. We did until the first ban wave came along. The issue was solved sure but two days ago another friend of the same group was banned for no reason. None of us use third party programs or cheats or whatever the algorythm thinks we (the players) are using so don't just reply with ""Your account has been suspended.""! ""Suspended"" is a FORBIDDEN word for us it should be for you too! FIX. YOUR. $HIT.It's sad this still happens...What? Do we need to have Angry Joe come here and show you how the community feels? The most of the playerbase bought the game for the multiplayer aspect and it's not happening at all. After a ""ban"" you can still play singleplayer sure. You just cannot SAVE!

2016-05-29,0,0,574,False,Not Recommended,"This game in a nutshell it's only for the brand lovers here's my pros and cons list Pros Best story I've ever played on the saga of GTA full of content and wel built up story Nice and intuitive editor they made it easy for the community to create maps for online or recording good for people that have no confidence with video editing programs Great variety of vehicles and better customization options for the cars than the previous titles I played Animals in single players wildlife it's a nice add. Cons It seems like game has been designed only for GTA Online since until now single player story has not encountered new DLCs or expansions while they put snow in winter on the online game they don't add it to the single player giving the user the feeling they completely abandoned single player to focus on Online Infinite loading times on Online sometimes you have to wait 1 or 2 minutes to let the game load the next screen even on SSD and with a nice video card Lots of disconnections make the Online experience frustrating since you often ""abandon"" the session with no sense at all even if low in ping disconnections happen. Playing with your friends sometimes it's hard since you have to reconnect to the same session twice before to start anything or you may start a freemode boss mission... and subsequently see your friend abandon the session Lots of cheaters 100% of the times you change session because of one cheater or one modder you will always end up on another session with a couple of cheaters minimum people constantly ask cheaters for get money. And that's not even the real problem sometimes cheaters let you play... sometimes instead they make you explode all the way around or block your garage preventing you from exiting sometimes they eject you from vehicles in TDMs. Add the very slow loading I talked about in the third point and you will lose a lot of time by changing session only to find a worse session Sometimes events like x2GTA$ or x2RP attract all the other people on doing for example races or TDMs or any other gaming mode wich apparently is nice... if you don't get stuck in the clouds. personally I needed to alt f4 a LOT these last 2 days to play this game Still the same four heists since one year the patches are nice since they added up the boss missions and they will add new stuff on the upcoming patch hoping in a new heist.In conclusion it's a wonderful freeroaming game but on the current state it's almost unplayable on the Online side and since they seem to ignore completely the single player the user is actually buying GTA V Online. The game itself has a very long storyline wich is nice but it's not enough to enjoy the full product. Buy only if you have friends to play with otherwise you will soon regret the purchase. Personally I hope they fix all the things but the game floats at the same level since a lot of time making me wonder if they really care about Online play health.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,72,False,Not Recommended,"I was planning on posting a resoundingly positive review especially regarding Rockstar customer friendly policy about mods (though no mods in any online setting even private ones felt a bit ridicilous.) But now T2I (Take 2 Interactive) has put a ""Cease and Desist"" on one of the biggest and most important mod out there. A mod that makes the creation of other mods into Gta 4 and 5 so much easier and fun. Without it maybe over half of ALL mods will not longer be available. It will also kill huge segment of the modding community if pushed through. What does ""Cease and Desist"" mean? Well in essence it means that the company contacts an independent operator(s) and ""asks"" them to stop doing whatever they are doing because their actions go against the agreement this independent operator made with company when they installed and/or bought their product. Cease and Desist is used when done for the right reasons when a 3rd party is using a company's product (or part of it) to either gain profit of that product after minor personal changes on it without the company's consent be those changes/modifications large or small. It can also be used if the 3rd party is modifying your product in ways that go against the product's license agreement or contracts of similar nature. Why did I mention that last part? Because T2I is trying to push C&amp D on the modders by claiming that they have somehow broken their license agreement's rules about the product... a probable lie if T2I headquarters are located in the US as by the law there (*IF* memory serves!) they are required to push C&amp D on people infringing their agreements the moment they are aware of the breach of contract.But since Rockstar and T2I have been aware of this mod and the 3rd party developing it for a quite some while (This mod is around 10 years old) this should not be possible if I am remembering right that infringement that the company is aware of either needs to be reacted to relatively quickly or allow everyone to breach those rules in the same way they do.",Grand Theft Auto V

Out of that time only 2 hours was spent online and that was enough for me I don't think I need to expand on the reasons for that. I've played the story through a couple of times doing the scores different ways and different endings to the main story I've added a few mods and now only have three installed Police everywhere No Helicopters and Insane driving maxed out. What I get is an absolute blast of comedy shootouts pile ups accidents ped wipouts fighting cop chases that can last for hours gang bashing incite cop/gang shootouts etc etc. always a situation that can be exploited for entertainment. With the mods doing the missions adds another dimension for instance driving to a specific location and you can get taken out by other vehicles and of course the police usually get involved.I'm no reviewer but can honestly say that in twenty five years of playing games no other has ever held my attention for so long with the glorious visuals attention to detail entertainment immersion fun and comedy.

2015-05-14,0,0,102,False,Recommended,Racing shooting stealing planning accessorizing. Grand Theft Auto V has it all. Easily one of the best games on Steam right now this game features the first ever multiplayer mode in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Even though it bears a hefty AAA price tag this game is worth it. It boasts hours upon hours of replay value with an in depth singleplayer and an even better online mode. On top of this the rockstar editor adds mountains of community jobs to play through and the recent addition of heist adds even more content to play with your friends. The game has run smoothly so far on medium graphics settings with my 750ti but I would not recommend this game if your do not have a good machine. I would also not recommend this game if you have less than 8GB of RAM or are short on hard drive space as it is a 60GB download. Even though this game has a great singleplayer and it can be fun just to hop onto pub servers to hang out for a while I would also recommend rustling up some friends to play it with. Unfortunately Rockstar does not seem to want us to make mods for this game and they are frequently pushing out new updates to stop modders in their tracks. For now there is not much community content on that front but I anticipate more of it in the future.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,0,0,148,False,Not Recommended,Overall grand theft auto is a great game One of the only games I've bought on release day three times (360 PS4 PC)I thoroughly enjoyed my time in GTA.I expected that rockstar would include the ability to mod. For me it was a major selling point. I have to say if you have never played GTA V then get this game cause its amazing but If you are looking for a modding experience this isn't it. I tried to fix this with a simple mod in singleplayer Now my online account is banned without warning for an unspecified period of time. (Guessing two weeks)If you are looking to get a upgraded GTA V experience then I would recommend you wait until rockstar changes their policy.,Grand Theft Auto V

And dont even try to call Rockstar because obviously they will block your cell call or they wont pick up at all because do to the fact they dont want to hear your BS which its not BS. do to a fact they dont know that there are 3 year old playing this game which by far should not be playing this game at all. and oh yeah right Rockstar also doesn't give a flying if you spent $60 on this game.

2017-07-14,0,0,246,False,Not Recommended,The GTA Online experience is just tedious grinding with no real reward at the end of it. The gameplay is pretty much pvp with nothing else in it. You might enjoy it with friends but even then it turns old pretty quick especially now when helicopters can be sniped out of the sky in couple of shots and everybody is armed to the teeth. All in all there is no real goal to progress through the grind other than to get better stuff to kill and grief other players. The online portion of the game had potential before but that seems to be no longer the case. Singleplayer is good and recommended to play through. That is also the only reason you should ever get this game other than that stay far away from the grind and mindless pvp.,Grand Theft Auto V

Multiplayer is a waste of time don't even bother playing it because you'll get flagged for playing online. Then you'll email Rockstar then they'll send you the SAME MESSAGE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. No help whatsoever. 96/100 on metacritic I think is a bit generous.. Because of the multiplayer issues I'd give this a B rating. Maybe even C+. I've currently got 188 hours in game I loved every hour of it. Wait until rockstar support stops caring about this game so they won't ban you for just trying to enjoy a game. One final you to Rockstar Support. you.****6/14/17 EditSince Take Two has declared modding the game illegal there is now officially no reason to get this game.

2017-02-17,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,Sadly I know I'm not representative of the average gamer nowadays. I personally like games where your decisions matter but GTA doesn't let you make any. In fact it forces you into some pretty horrendous situations. I can't play this any more.I think the game has great combat great game mechanics excellent character design and is a real masterpiece as far as most criteria go. When you're killing people by shooting them it's not too graphic. They take a bullet or two and they drop there's no screams of pain and it feels relatively detached. This is good for this type of game because it is supposed to be light and fun. You're a criminal. That's how it works.But I have to draw the line somewhere. I can't play this anymore. I can't get through the torture scene. It's graphic it's unwarranted and it's unnecessary. The person you're torturing even tells you he's willing to talk. As far as you know as the protagonist the person you're torturing hasn't done anything to justify this conduct. He's just some guy. What you do know is that there isn't a time limit on what he's telling you. The guy you're supposed to kill doesn't have nuclear launch codes or is killing babies. He's at a party and even his crime isn't known.Basically the game forces you to violently torture a guy while he screams for mercy. You don't need him to talk right that second or for any reason made known to the player but rather just because. The game should offer the ability to skip this kind of scene because I can't imagine how anyone with a conscience could get through it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-22,0,0,1269,False,Not Recommended,This is a great game for every part except for when it comes to money. This game is a lot of fun but to get any money you have to grind to get it which over time gets boring and then people start to hack. Hackers can give money to themselves and everybody else in a lobby so most of the time when there is a big update where everything added is super expensive you are going to get 100 times the amount of hackers. So I have received money from these hackers and in return I got banned for a month and now my characters are now reset back to level one and everything is gone. The community is ruined by the hackers. And no matter what rockstar does they will always have hackers in the online mode and that leads to many problems.

Two any lobby I go on I either get dogs humping on my head or DDOSed by some hacker wannabe. Third is the worst. Rockstar has a habbit of making their own little cheat systems like from GTA IV. They say that they'll catch any hacker that is hacking they are wrong I was playing GTA V on new years eve last year (2016) then I went offline and ate dinner with my family then when I got home I was banned until the 31st of January. This is total bullsh*t. I had never modded in any game before I dont even know how to mod. So then I was calling Rockstar support here is what they said ""We have a very sucure anti cheat system the system never failed once it dectected you modding since this is your first ban it'll be temporay (I cant spell right) and you will see when you are unbanned when you go into storymode.

It's pretty much ruining the game experience as it randomly kills you out of nowhere and they're able to appear right next to you.

GTA V is the best game in the series and has the largest map and overall everything is better and upgraded. if its your first grand theft auto game (what is your problem?) then here are some things you need to know * if you dont like violence and just want a free roaming game go away.* if you are faint of heart go away.* if you are hurt by recism cursing nudity go away. like the other games from the series you are a guy (in this case 3 guys) that walkes an open interavtive world that you can do what ever you want and you choose to play the story or go on a killing spree (or both). GTA Online is (by my opinion) the best part of the game and is always updating. it is alot more fun when you play it with friends. to close it off i do not have anything negative to say because after all it is gta and if by now you still have a problem with the bad parts of the game you have nothing to do here.i love GTA and i recommend this game to everyone.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-27,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,"So the game does look nice but thats what ill say. The main story is very slow to get the the good parts but the characters are well voiced and interesting But after youve done it once its will feel like a litteral drag to do it again. Gun play is very nice as is driving but airplanes and helicopters have the most litteral learning curve and i unterstand that but you should at least put in a training mode But there is flight school which is more like ""you've never flown a plane so you get to join the Blue angles"" litterly made me rage quit at one point. There is zero replayability its just so lackluster to do it a second time.So the single player is overall above average horrible moments ruin it like the Yoga segment or just down right stupid side or main missions. Prior to this Take2 banned mods all together why? because some people used cheats to get pass the grind that is Online but mods are still allowed after a huge backlash. A problem is some players have been marked cheaters even though doing no wrong Take2 or Rockstar really need to look into this problem.Now Online...It is just a slog a utter grind. All you do it play the same mission over and over to get set amount of money to get somthing and yes the online is updated alot.....but its more for the rich players rather than getting new players with something its like they do not care about the people just getting started because it is very boring i cannot count the amount of times ive done the Drug mission just to get to level 30. SO rockstar says ""Hey want to skip the BS and get to the fun part? well card sharks"" Yep you pay real money to get money in a game. Yes you can get 5.8 million to get a item BUT you could just buy a card and play the game on easy mode little to no thought went into this making microtransactions work with a game you paid for let alone a triple A game.Heists can be fun but it takes 1 guy to mess it up or just being boring you want a heist game play payday. The side activities are lacking when you compare it to GTA SA Gun range Tennis Races either on foot (only in singleplayer) or car darts and thats all i can really say most of those are 1 and you are done you probable wont play it again. Skills comes back from GTA SA but not that great dumb down so its more simple kinda makes me a little sad since all weapons and individual thing was their own leveling like Pistols SMG Swimming ect. but now its all combined.

2017-07-23,0,0,6289,False,Recommended,State of the Game July 2017PerformanceThe game performs well on hardware that was popular at the time of release it's entirely possible to maintain 60fps with very reasonable graphics options if you avoid some of the GPU hogs. The Audio engine contains bugs that cause the GTA to crash on a wide range of hardware due to discrepancies in settings some Audio hardware allows for high bit rates GTA runs at 16 Bit 44.1KHz. Higher settings will make the game crash after some arbitrary amount of time.OptionsMany only notably lacking direct support for extended mouse buttons which have to be configured by mapping to keys in some instances.Relevance &amp DLCGTA V has remained semi relevant with help from its online multi player updates some have been excellent some interim fluff. Notably story mode has been neglected with the exception of adding a few cars here and there.Overall Game playThe mechanics and physics are excellent when they work often humorous when they don't. Lag between players can cause a host of physics anomalies especially with traffic something dedicated servers would help fix.PvPWith the latest update comes in my opinion the death of PvP in GTAO Explosive rounds have positively affected the ability to get rid of Hydra Trolls but also transformed how cancerous players now spread around their play style. There's little to no skill in a normal gun vs thermal scope and explosive rounds battle. An alternative could have been airborne Merryweather strike called in by phone with the precision of the jet that attacks by the airport. GTAO Lacks any credible ranking system or ability to enter sessions with rules sets such as disabling near blips if tracking people down meant completing objectives for brief intel on peoples activites vs simply looking at the map &amp throwing explosives at them during PvP missions the activites would perhaps be more satisfying for all parties involvedExploits netcode and controversiesThe Achilles Heel of GTAO. There are few that will tell a truthful story about the modding scene as it relates to GTA. In essence the netcode is essentially born of a lan game further developed from how it was in GTA IV that now routes player actions through a server acting essentially as a router to hide actual IP addresses and coordinate basic session duties. There is still no in session detection of exploits only RockStar's feeble attempts to scan the many stats they collect combined with reports that can be cleared/blocked. And a system that attempts to scan memory for known exploit code. Yet with each update the hacks return in just a few days. Many who blindly support modding leaving negative reviews on all Rockstar's games will state that TakeTwo's action against OpenIV was wrong. Supporters of the OpenIV community who have developed software to catalogue game assets and function hooks fail to understand that this knowledge is a large contributing factor in the creation of the mods by less responsible developers subsequently used for creating an unfair advantage in PvP or generally being abrasive. Thus what we really have is an awkward situation for Rockstar. We have OpenIV who don't make software that affects online play and we have people who build on that work to be asses. Resulting in people who actually play rarely playing in open sessions with random people this further amplifies the remaining pool of lavatory waste in the remaining open sessions who actively want to be in open sessions to cause chaos. Having said that I'm not against the modding scene if GTAO had a place or specific sessions modders could do what they wanted I'd welcome that. Combined with better team building tools (max members &lt 100? team chat when not in session team events team session settings in team factions/gangs.Lastly perhaps the worst of the modders are not those who blow people up without engaging and attach eggs to your head but those who subtly add a small amount of weapon damage regenerative health or targeting / bounding box aids to give skill free advantages.PvEThe standard cash grinding missions while plentiful at launch have been neglected in favor of multi player missions that still offer little cash reward but offer some entertainment value.Recommended? yes definitely play with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTAV is a huge step in the modding community bringing people together to work on new things and giving the game more replayability.My best guess is that what you want to do is get rid of the modding services and implement your own modding system through Rockstar like what Bethesda's doing with their premium/paid mods. And I swear if you do that I will send a refund request on this game every single day even though it's literally impossible to refund it. If you think GTA Online is fun as is no. Nobody wants to do your ing heists and nobody wants to do jobs for twenty grand. Single player is dry with a storyline that's already finished and it's time you let the community have what they want for once even if it's limited to just single player. OpenIV alone isn't the problem when it comes to modding online. It's because your GTA Online is flawed there's no motive anymore and you barely even try to make it right you just keep on blocking hackers.

Will you actually want to play the game's multiplayer for a long duration?If you answered no to one of them I wouldn't get it if you haven't already.1. Rockstar social club has an ""offline"" mode... It does... But what the actual flying is the purpose of having an ""offline"" mode in the R* launcher not Steam's offline mode if you're STILL gonna need an online connection to ""authenticate"" your purchase pretty much every 1 2 times you turn off and on your computer.Sure you just need to go online on Steam launch the game online then close it and disconnect your internet then relaunch the game without internet but really? The R* launcher has an actual ""offline"" mode option but it's not even usable.2. Here's my problem. The game itself constantly updates with multiplayer content that I DON'T want. Whether you actually play the multiplayer or if you just want to around in Single player it doesn't really matter. Still gonna be forced upon yourself to download the GTA O content. And no I'm not writing this ""review"" on his behalf. I'm just baffled as to how it is objectively better to own a pirated version of this game if you have no intention to play the multiplayer content. You don't need an online connection to play SINGLEPLAYER content it takes up less disc space.

What I mean by this is money bags here money bags there ""Couple million for you and couple million for you!"" Do you know what happens if you pick up this money that hackers give you?

But if anything the single play side of this is enjoyable and the director mode is good for those who love to roam and goof off without worries of wasting in game cash.Online is the more tricky part. Since reading all the ""Rockstar manipulates prices"" and ""Hackers force ban players"" which I can see being true since Rockstar is seen as a strict and stubborn company no matter what degree of graphic swapping or being chucked bags of money for no reason. It makes me stay mainly in my own little private server with nothing but robbing a store or two then spending 20 minutes on a job that only takes about 2 5 just so I can grab at least 15% more dollars it tends to get boring. Racing with people can be a drag (pun intended) when you will most likely come accross some that will run people off the road mainly to have you so far behind where you DNF and get less money.I can't really give you any more opinion on the gamemodes because I'm not the type who likes PvP only because of past expirences of people using the ""low level bad player"" stereotype so that usually ruins all that fun.The whole sellpoint of GTA Online was the Heists. The nightmare of them all for a soloist. Not saying I won't work with people. Hell I'd love to do teamwork and cooperate. But spending all day repeating the finale of the Prision Break with people constently failing. I'm not talking about 2 4 hours of playing but try spending 10 hours with so many different people failing crashing getting blown up dropping out wanting more money when you spent more than the payout amount redoing the mission over and over and over. I just want to finish the mission please!...So yeah. this is really a on the fence review and an opinion from a person with no friends or group. It's a good game in single player and worth watching at least. Online is only fun when you have friends.It's times like this when you wish steam would have a ""maybe button"" but since the game was designed for the friends side of gamers I'll have to give this a no.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-13,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,This game is an absolute nightmare. Sure the story is fun and offline is great. But we all know why you're here you want the beef the juice you want GTA Online. But thats exactly why this game is a tumor.TL DR Online mode the one thing we all buy this for is only getting worse hacking is almost encouraged and be prepared to get banned for the actions of others. Don't buy it even with nostalgia glasses its sh*t.No matter the lobby you'll get spawn killed over and over until you stop spawning. Go passive mode sure now you're a ghost who can't even draw a weapon. You cant mind your own business and the only way to play online is with trusted friends in an invite only server. But then you'll find out your friend has a mod menu and he's part of the enormous cheating problem. Don't worry though he won't get banned unless he spawns in money because Rockstar is simply a greedy mess of a company that only cares about your wallet. Okay whatever at least now you can play with friends in peace right? Nope little Jimmy pressed the wrong button on his half corrupt mod menu and spawned in $12 on the ground which you ran into. Sorry kiddo! Rockstar sees that you spawned in that money you cheater! Now you're banned for a week due to the actions of others. But finally your ban is lifted you found new friends played with them for years to be sure they're cool and everythings good but you still don't have the money to have fun. Good luck doing a heist as you only have 2 other friends now that random toxic a**hole you're forced to play with as you need one more person to play a heist will ruin your entire gameplay and might even leave half way through because he got sick of greifing you. Now you'll never get that bonus for all four players completing the heist together which is the only reason you did the heist the little money that you'll be barely rewarded if things run smoothly and the game doesn't just decide to break. Then there's the ads oh my god the game has all these online characters which call you all the time. There must be a dozen or two which call your phone to bug you for no reason over and over even though you answered and listened to the call again and again they don't stop! Its almost as if the game has actual ads in it its cancerous! But only if you could actually play the game in the first place which is nearly impossible due to the extremely long loading times to get into a single lobby. But you and I both know you're gonna have to do this a minimum of 3 times before you just restart the game and make a private lobby for yourself play for 12 minuets then realizing you're playing a multiplayer game alone. But hey at least you can pay for stuff in singleplayer. As to get anything in multiplayer you need such a high amount of money that you'll be playing hundreds of hours or buying sharkcard after sharkcard with real money. Heists are the best way to earn cash in game but if anyone leaves you've gotta restart and find all the players for it again. This can take up to 40 minuets to just get a lobby ready just to probably loose it again.I love GTA I always have but its just not worth it anymore. It honestly makes me kinda sad because the older GTA games such as San Andreas give me such nostalgia. And the idea of playing GTA Online again with a friend who just got the game or a new update to give me false hope that Rockstar may have actually fixed or maybe even tested their own online mode for once all of this to get me to join a friend's game again just to realize that it has somehow gotten worse.This game has a lower rating of No Man's Sky and I can see absolutely why. Because this is exactly what's wrong with the industry Rockstar your company has become a disgrace. And now your corrupt mods are probably gonna ban me from online hm?,Grand Theft Auto V

Then I got into GTA Online and that was fun for a few minutes until I realized that the prices on everything in the game are accomodated to those who have been playing for quite some time and or for people who would just buy game currency with real currency.

That was almost a month ago. I know because I submitted the ticket shortly after my ban in which I seriously still have no idea why I recieved it.I used to be a diehard fan of this franchise I got sucked into it with GTA 3 back in High School and have continued to support the franchise with several of their other games but then GTA Online had to it all up.

2018-07-26,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,TL DR If you only now think of buying this game don't do it because PvP with leveling in an open world destroys the whole experience.If you don't already have a considerably higher level account from you consoles to take with you to PC good luck trying to make any progress in the open world. The beauty of an open world PvP game with leveling whose player base consists to a noticable amount of toxic try hards is that you are very likely to be killed by someone who wants to ruin your fun in a way that you can't compete with unless you reached the needed level for weapon countering said ways. Try to use your beginner weapons to counter being carpet bombed by an airplane that can take several rocket hits a fighter jet flying cars bikes or jetpacks with rockets and miniguns tanks or people with full armor and weapon that shoot incendiary bullets. If you could avoid all those people and their overpowered gear and only play with friends on a private server that'd be nice but some functions are only accessible when one is playing in open lobbies for no other reason than to make the game more frustrating and indirectly persuade one to buy Shark Cards.The new update MIGHT make things a bit more bearable as for the first couple of days a lot more people who aren't taking the game as serious as a national emergency are attracted to playing it again but after about 2 to 4 weeks that update only meant that the level 400 players have new gear to completely obliterate anyone who hasn't yet reached the level to feasibly fight back.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,1,15,64,False,Not Recommended,********ONLINE REVIEW**********First heres a note. The people that get banned are those who use mods in online play. If you mod in single player you have little chance to be banned as it does not effect everyone else in the game you are in. Those complaining about being banned are ignorant to the fact that they mess up the servers when they change their files around. This isnt minecraft.I don't recommend this game for online play currently with the amount of modders in the game right now the servers can get laggy. Not only that lots of the content can't be accessed because of the community. People give up after 1 failure in a heist which means you have to look for 3 MORE people to do the heist with again while losing all the progress you made on ur first attempt. It wouldn't be so bad if the load times weren't abysmal but having to wait another 2 mins after some A hole ruins ur fun and leaves is not worth the wait. I rate GTA Online a 4/10 It's great in theory but the execution is no where close to what it should be. Maybe when they fix the game up a bit I might recommend people play online.,Grand Theft Auto V

It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem.

This game amazed me well the single player did anyhow I remember the first day online started It was awful laggy as all hell and everything you did was repetitive. We waited years for heists just to learn that they are awful and that was a very big thing for online for years was the wait for the heists. Then GTA5 came out on next gen I bought it again and then it came out on PC and then I bought it again. $180 I spent on this game because I loved it it was fun to play with friends and the single player was amazing. Online however is all Rockstar thinks about because that's where all the money is so they constantly release new cars and some other stuff which of course makes people buy Shark Cards instead of grinding the money out. Instead of fixing the awful servers or the hackers for that matter they just add more and more pointless Oh wait about the hacking thing you've banned thousands of players who have done nothing wrong. Someone joins with Discord open.... BAN HIM someone breathes too loud while playing the game.... BAN HIM. Yet you've done nothing to fix the actual problem hackers still fly around untouched killing players in servers and getting other people banned because they feel like dropping money on everyone.

2018-03-30,0,0,332,False,Not Recommended,ENG I don't recommend it if you want to play Online. In my opinion Online is too boring and too simple and for me it doesn't have enough features. I can only recommend the game with Mods in Story Mode. Besides you can easily make a server in Story Mode where it is much more entertaining and where it is your choice to what your game is about what you can make. (etc)Rockstar is only addig more and more features to Online but they just make the game even more Boring.It would be great if they maybe began to focus on GTA 6 instead of adding the more and more features to the same game year after year. DK Jeg anbefaler ikke spillet hvis du køber det for at spille Online. Jeg synes at Online er for kedeligt og for simpelt og der er for få ting man kan i det synes jeg ihvertfald. Til gengæld synes jeg at spillet er rigtig sjovt hvis man spiller det i Story Mode med Mods. Desuden kan du sagtens selv lave en Server til Story Mode der er meget sjovere og hvor du selv bestemmer hvad der skal være og hvad det skal handle om. Det eneste Rockstar gør er at de bare bliver ved og ved med at tilføje flere ting til Online men de gør det bare endu mere kedeligt.Det vil være sådan lidt lækkert hvis de kunne begynde at fokusere på måske at lave GTA 6 istedet for bare at føje flere ting til det samme spil år efter år,Grand Theft Auto V

All legitimate money!!I had an open support ticket prior to the money confiscation about multiple transaction errors. It is a Rockstar anti cheat code that prevents legitimate players from actually earning money. I don't know if it is retaliation for my open support ticket or what.WHAT I DO KNOW IS Rockstar does little to nothing about hackers/modders.Lobbies are full of modders/hackers/people that have modded money and those people make it intollerable to play legitimately because these people have NO REASON to play legit and they do not share the common desire/goal to do the activities to get the money. The people constantly attack you some of which have God mode and you can't even kill them or mod items in that make it impossible for you to complete your desired tasks/work.When there is a level 10 with a bunker and an Oppressor motorcycle you know you are going to be ****** by him/her.

2017-10-26,2,3,172,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a great game in general however there are some problems as there is in everything. The story mode is extremely fun and is still fun even if you replay it from the beginning. I have completed this game around 8 times already one time getting all gold medals accross all missions (some missions really got under my skin such as the first mission with trevor as you need to kill all runaway bikers in order to receive the gold medal and it was pretty challenging as mostly all of them ran away before you could even get to em). Even now I still enjoy the game even though I have replayed it a lot of times. I used to play GTA 5 on my playstation 4 and now just recently I moved onto the PC platform as I finally got a PC which could run it smoothly and at high graphics too. There are around 70 missions in total for singeplayer all are fun in their respectible way. Even post game once you finish the main missions and complete the game there is still heaps of stuff to do. One being to complete all of the strangers and freaks missions which are also relatively fun. If you want to fight for the 100% completion you will have to put yourself under imense pain as it will take a lot of time to complete all the stunts and flying under bridges which can be VERY frustrating. However attempting all golds in singleplayer is a blast and should be tried.The storyline is pretty interesting and engaging. My first GTA game which I have played thoroughly was actually this one I played a bit of gta san andreas however dont quite remember the storyline of it. Mostly everyone says that the storyline of GTA 5 is pretty bad however I believe they are just sad that rockstar has improved the game so much it doesn't feel like the old games.Most of my flaws for this game come from the Online section. First of all you cannot do anything without an immense amount of money which does cost quite alot if you translate it to shark cards. However rockstar does give players gifts of small amounts of money from time to time (most I've received from rockstar was 300 000). In order to gain money you have to grind day and night and that can get boring as there is only such an amount of ways you can earn money.Secondly the GTA 5 Online community is toxic and unpleasant as you will most likely get insulted if you kill someone. There is my viewpoint on the game. Hopefully this was somewhat useful.If you love the game from the beginning you can't hate it even though there is a bug or a glitch inside the game. Deserves the award.,Grand Theft Auto V

Story is completely fine but the OpenIV situation that happened about a month a go was pretty damn stupid. I don't use OpenIV but There should be no reason at all to punish players who mod single. That just ruins the fun. As for online. Im gonna write it below.Online has multiple problems. Mainly modding. Not Singleplayer Modding Im talking about Multiplayer modding. The modders who don't ruin online or making online more entertaining and enjoyable they're perfectly fine. But I'm talking about those modders who give themselves god mode explosive bullets teleporting the whole lobby to somewhere stupid kicking players out of vehicles randomly killing the whole lobby with the kill feed saying another person did it. Yea. I was with a group of friends trying to sell our shipment. Mostly Gun running. There are so many times that we had to search for a new session to either find a empty lobby or find a lobby without a single modder. Because 1. They destroy our shipment. 2. They constantly kill us trying to make us mad by saying ""owned (Wtf? who says that anymore) every time they kill us. 3. Randomly Teleporting us. We Reported them so many times and even voted to kick them. Of course nothing worked. So I sent a email to ta I mean rockstar about the modder with video proof. I expected him or her... or it.... to be banned by next week. Got online the week after. Found the same damn modder in my session.I don't think rockstar cares about the reports they give. They just ignore it and try to ban obvious modders themselves. WELL ISNT EXPLOSIVE BULLETS AND GOD MODE WITH TELEPORTATION OBVIOUS ENOUGH? For rockstar no. The thing is. It looks or seems like rockstar bans people who mod their money and rp. If you want to get GTA 5 get it. I'm not saying the game is bad. No this game is fun as hell. But multiplayer can be a bit of a pay to win. Without money multiplayer is pretty boring.

This is absolutely worst i've ever played better to f*ck a goat than play gta online but much much better to f*ck the creator of this sh*t. I never saw before such a matchmaking system you cant play with your friends as party mode you cant play some simply missions without random f*ggots yes random animals is a really big problem there (The game says that you must play it as 4 what the f*ck should i do if i dont have 2 or 3 more friends?) you cannot hosting new missions and above all its ing infinite loadings.

2018-03-07,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,absolutely DO NOT GET THIS GAME. It is lots of fun with friends but hackers are EVERYWHERE. ive had this game for 2 weeks now and ran into a hacker at least 1 time each time ive played. ive seen invulnerable players changing all pedestrians into railgun wielding s a hacker was kicking everyone out of vehicles (super frustrating when you are on a times mission and in a helicopter so you plummet to your death) the most recent hacker ive experienced is a hacker who just sat near our delivery vehicle and caused an explosion to kill us and was just killing us to troll. If he just destroyed out vehicle he would have earned money instead he jsut sat there hidden from the map and not even displaying his display name killing us with a hacked weapon. THE BEST PART You can't report hackers. If you buy this game get ready to be trolled. you will have fun between someone just trying to you off but you will find hackers guaranteed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-25,0,0,636,False,Recommended,Introduction Being the fifth installment in the series this can be either a good bad thing. Either the devs are recycling or creating genre changing games. Hopefully the game itself a unique monster. Nothing else on the market like it but unfortunately they didn't execute the launches and community the correct way. Pros Great graphicsSerious ImmersionHuge open worldQuite long story with good plotA lot of customizationGreat physics in every aspect (driving flying on foot combat etc.)Optimized and works Nvidia for graphic settingsFun interactive heists online and offlineCons Many hackers onlineSerious issues with online net code after months of releaseMessed up economyRepetitive missions onlineConclusion Overall I'd recommend the game but not for full price. There are few cons but they are quite crucial to a good gaming experience in my opinion. This is definitely a good choice of purchase and a good future of mods like previous games.For more reviews check out Original Curators Group,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-18,0,0,1077,False,Not Recommended,This game had a great start and a great potentional. It's still one of the best games if you want to explore an active city based world or if you just want to go on massive killing sprees against unarmed NPC's. However I have not been able to truly enjoy GTA Online for a long time. This is for a big part because of the weird included in the updates and in general a very unbalanced game. Free roam is absolutely terrible for someone who does not want to use tanks and flying rocket shooting motorcycles. if that's your thing this game is perfect. That is if you're willing to put hours and hours into grinding because items in this game are extremely expensive.The singleplayer is pretty acceptable. Far from Rockstar's best. For me it lacks depth and it's way too easy (difficulty setting please?).The performance started out to be pretty decent but I'm convinced it has decresead quite significantly over the years through updates (without upgrading graphics or stuff like that).Ultimately for someone with my interests in a game I would not recommend (besides for the exploring and killing against cops but that gets old).

2015-08-21,1,3,569,False,Recommended,It's not very often that I write a serious review as I'm not too good at it but being the most played game on my Steam library and honestly one of my favourite games of all time I thought I probably should. I really enjoyed the story so much so that I have finished it several times and 100% the game back on Xbox 360. There's not really any point in the story that sticks out for me though it's definately still worth it. The rest of the single player is great interesting side missions and the whole shebang (I've never used that term in my life). This brings me to the multiplayer. So GTA Online can be a whole lot of fun especially with friends however I'm not a fan of the grinding for money and RP just to buy a house/car to have a good time. I'm much more of a fan of GTA IV's Multiplayer where you could pretty much do whatever you wanted without limitations. With that aside GTA Online is still a heck of a lot of fun.Now the only down side I have to say about GTA V is rockstars take on modding and the modding community. If you'd like to mod GTA V you're free to do so as long as it's in Single Player only. I would like to be able to play around with mods with friends in say like a private session but that's against R*'s rules and will send you off with a nice ban which not only stops you from playing GTA Online but also bans you from GTA V Single Player and on top of that any other R* game that uses Social Club (Max Payne 3 LA Noire). That fact that R* bans you from their other titles is quite noong and I don't see the reasoning behind it.Anyway that's my 2 cents on GTA V. Defiantely one of my favourite games if you can put aside R*'s modding policy.9/10 Would get rid of my Yee Yee Haircut again.,Grand Theft Auto V

BUT NO If you're expecting the same don't even think about it because instead they keep adding stupid skins masks clothers new vehicles (which is pointless) and etc. This is ridicilous and i guess most of the players are disappointed with that fact as well.

2017-10-20,0,0,179,False,Not Recommended,"Alright lets get this straght I LOVE GTA 5 with a passion I think that the game is fantastic with plenty to do and is amazing at least the singleplayer mode is. What really brings this game down for me is GTA Online. To prevent this from going into an endless rant I'll put down the problems in the list below 1. Shark Cards alright lets address the elephant in the room we are all painfully aware of Rockstar's and Take two's terrible idea of Shark Cards overpriced microtransactions that make my blood boil. And what do they do to the progression system you ask? They turn the game into a grindfest where it can take you days to get a portion of the money to get a single new dlc car!2. Modders and Random Banning sence these two problems go hand and hand I'll address them both in one take their are an ungodly amount of trolling modders and unfair banning of innocent players who were banned for no reason. I have heard horrer stories about how players profiles were wiped for seemingly no reason. All the while their were still trolling modders everywhere. Only play with your friends avoid public games like the plague. (p.s. does it seem to me that Rockstar is letting the auto ban system do that so they can encourage the purchase of Shark Cards? I can't be the only one who thinks that right?)3. No singleplayer dlc and the final nail in the coffin no singleplayer dlc at all (and no I refuse to consider those new cars as actuall real dlc that add something good to the game) this never made sence to me why work so hard in making not one but THREE main characters that are fleshed out wonderfully and a bunch of interesting side characters only to forget about it and add a ""dlc"" that adds gunrunning into the game? That is the most stupid thing I have ever seen a gaming company do. They have real potential to create a brand new fantastic story dlc but they never even mention it anymore. Anyways to sum everything up the Singleplayer mode gets a 9/10 from me while the online portion gets a 2/10 from me.

I purchased luxurious suites and vehicles for the mere purpose of telling people ""I'm too rich to kill"" and ""**** you $ 1 kids I got more than that"" and ""Money means skill"". I was about to buy something from Downtown Los Santos when a crazed player killed me and a lot of other people in thirty seconds with a sniper rifle. Note that I was in an enclosed room and everyone else are in different districts of the downtown and no one even knew where he was. We all teamed up to find him but no. He killed everyone looking for him. After a few days I had the sh**iest encounter of my life. I WAS F***ING BANNED. I didn't even do anything for the past few days and I was banned from Online. After waiting for more than a month I joined the Online Mode once again. Tomorrow F****ing banned again for no f***ing reason. Also the loading screen the LOADING SCREEN.

Why not repay the ""Cargo"" money that was destroyed by modders just because it's fun? How many times did I had to restart my game (sometimes the computer) because I had perma fireplaces that wouldn't be removed from inside of my character until I would restart the game memory.Is this what they call Justice? Is this the kind of Justice you want for your games?If you can give me a Refund for the game really do it because I really don't want to play your game any more and I will be on my watch about future Titles of Rockstar just like how I do with all EA Games. I'm just one person but if everyone starts doing the same you know it will hit you where it hurts aka your pockets.And yes you can go and check the money I received and since you are on it also check what I wrote before looking for a new server. And since you are still on it see how these 10 Million were put into the account in a matter of seconds through CEO Reward spam (I wasn't even in a CEO).Also take the opportunity to see how long I've been on that server.And More Take the time to check that I left 12M at that time and that you removed them however you are always removing at every single update as if I have my account permanentely Flagged to get all my money stripped away at every single update.Thank you for nothing Rockstar )Português Venho por este meio demonstrar o meu descontentamento com a forma como a Rockstar trata os seus clientes.Se pudesse pedir um reembolso seria o que eu faria neste momento.Pois pelos vistos estão em inclusive a penalizar os jogadores que jogaram de forma legítima. Cada atualização que sai toca de sacar o dinheiro da conta.Então pergunto Porque não removem as mortes também? Porque não repõem o dinheiro dos ""Cargo"" que foram destruídos por modders só porque é divertido?Onde está a justiça? É esta a Justiça que pretendem para os vossos jogos?Se puderem dar me um Refund por favor façam porque a minha vontade é não jogar mais o vosso jogo.Podem ir verificar o dinheiro que recebi e aproveitem que têm a mão na massa e verifiquem o que escrevi antes de procurar um novo servidor. Aproveitem já que estão com a mão na massa e vejam como esses 10 Milhões foram colocados na conta numa questão de segundos através de spam de CEO Reward (eu nem estavan uma CEO).E já que estão com as mãos na massa aproveitem também para ver quanto tempo estive nesse servidor.Mais Aproveitem para verificar que eu deixei 12M de parte na altura e que vocês os removeram contudo continuam sempre a remover ou seja colocaram alguma Flag na minha conta e retiram me o dinheiro todo o tempo todo.Obrigado por nada Rockstar )",Grand Theft Auto V

GTA online could have been so much better if it wasnt a grind fest and you werent forced to stay in public lobby's with complete s who's only goal is to blow up everything you just spent hours acquiring you rockstar and take two for killing a beloved francise and for turning your playbase into a cash cow.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm able to play it on a 3 year old GPU so thats another good thing. It's well optimized and does not crash I played the game for 12 hours straight with not one crash. Online is fun and you unlock new things with your level and to level up you can do a bunch of missions. This game will continue to have updates from the developer so it has a long life infront of it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-08-24,0,0,780,False,Not Recommended,Single player is good but multiplayer has become more of a grind than some f2p games. Every update they add more stuff thats fun and really OP stuff aswell but all of it is behind a massive paywall. so massive in fact that their most valuable shark card wont even get you a decent chunk of whats in the game. They basicly encourage their players to hack money into the game because its etheir that or do ludicrious ammounts of grinding or pay for it. to give an example of how bad the grinding is. it took me 100 hours while doing tons of high paying jobs (which you need atleast couple mil just to unlock) to make roughly 1 mil. even with the best jobs the grinding is still insane. its sad to see this great game get destoried by P2W items. online is nothing but a f2p style game on a game that is still 60$ where they use psychological warfare to make everything seem out of reach to make you give up and buy their shark cards.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-27,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,A great game spoiled by a horrible attitude from the studio. The Online servers are riddled with modders spoiling your day and throwing money at you. Do the modders get banned? No because there are way too many of them for the anticheat to be relied on. Can you get banned for recieving modded money? Yes you can and you WILL be. Can you apppeal the ban? No because it's their policy. You will lose all your progress too. Basically the game is full of cheaters yet innocent people get banned every day with no way to appeal the ban. They never specify the reason either. This great experience is ruined by a studio too cheap to hire support staff after the game sold millions of copies across many platforms and still sells incredibly well three years after it came out. I seriously regret supporting this studio with my money and unless things change this is the last game from them I played.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-30,0,0,747,False,Not Recommended,At October 1st the online game is full of griefers tryhards and modders. If you ever join a session one of the three will be with you. There's no escaping them. Making money is nearly impossible without replaying heists or grinding all day. Until you're level 100 you'll never be safe. In every lobby there's a least some dude with an oppresor mk2 or hydra that'll happily blow you just in case you needed to die. Besides all of those downsides the content is amazing the heists are so good all of them. Some are like a real challenge and once completing them you feel like you've accomplished a goal. Being able to have so many illicit businesses makes the game feel like the best version of a gta game.Story mode is amazing I'd give it a 10/10 if only rockstar added more content at it's current state it's a 8/10 once finishing all the heists and the strangers and freaks side missions there's absolutely nothing to do nothing.I definetely wouldn't recommend the game to any new normal gamer unless you're willing to spend a lot of money or a lot of hours in grinding simply.Unless you never finished story mode which few people didn't.In the last week there's been a huge increase in modders and cloud lag more than 5 times in an hour i've had to shut down the game because i was stuck on the clouds or saving on a black screen.Arena war update as of december 19th the state of gta online is devastating the new update has 1000 levels to unlock discounts all the upgrades/car/clothings are estimated to cost around 250 million and you earn 100 points per game which last around 15 minutes. You'd have to spend about 2000 hours grinding only grinding to buy everything. It' abusive. Worst of all the new cars suck.

I mean literally you cannot find a session with 10+ players without a cheater. Sadly not only the freeroam session are filled with cheaters. I bumped into cheaters a lot in race dm heist survival. Every gamemode filled with them.You have 3 options. 1.) Play alone on a public solo lobby which is probably the most boring thing you can do. Basically you are grinding money nonstop.2.) Play with friends on a public ""solo"" session and kick everyone who joins as fast as you can. This one is fun. Not the kicking everyone part. You can do anything with your friend. Missions help each others do sale/supplie missions or just get in a vehicle and drive around town.3.) Play on a public session and get killed by cheaters/griefers/script kiddies.

2017-06-29,0,0,490,False,Not Recommended,The single player is fine especually with mods but the online section (the game at this point) as some issues. For the most part this is one of the better games to have come out in the past few years. Having said that they still haven't fixed a lot of things. Connectivity and loading issues that have been with it from the beginning are still there so enjoy the five minute loading screens (if you don't get stuck in one) and good luck playing with someone for long durations of time as staying in the same lobby can be difficult if not impossible at times. Money too is an issue as prices have gotten to a point where you are unable to reasonably buy new DLC items without paying actual money. I ve put in 300+ hours and have bought most things in the game this latest DLC is to me a blatant money sink designed to bleed out any modded money that was to be left over after they began the mod purging as it coincide so neatly. Also after you reach level 100 you no longer unlock anything so leveling past this point is worthless. Vehicles too are locked to a single characters so you can't even start over without more money even though the money shared between all of them. As fun as this game is you can't do much without ingame money and you can't make much without buying it. So if you have nothing but free time and have 3 other friends that have the same it's for you but not me.,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't be fooled by the negative reviews those were given due to the publisher's actions and not because the game isn't great.The only not so great part would be the online thing which is used by the devs to milk a ton of cash from players.

2017-11-09,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,"I am not one of those types to write reviews on steam but I think I should write one because I've been a fan since GTA 2 If you're buying this for SP Don't pay this full price wait until it goes on sale. This four year old game isn't worth the full price that you're expected to pay. It's good and it's what you expect for a typical GTA but again the storymode is four years old at this point and getting certain things is bit of a grind that'll take forever to get (movie theatres and golf club). If you're buying this for MP Unless you have a gang of friends to play with and have fun or a part of a invite only server don't buy this game or the shark cards. This is the most asinine attempt of making an online MP Sandbox game. The payouts are so low compare of wanting to buy the stuff you want you'll have to spend hours just to make a million (which a lot of items are more or less priced at). The grind and cooldowns are so bad you might as well call this a MMO. It's impossible to join any of the fun modes because people only wanted to just mess around in the free word. There's always one or a few modders and script kiddies in every session because there's no real active moderation on these sessions. Before you can even try to report them they just crash the game. People don't join up with the people wanting to get rid of these guys because they might get ""rewarded with free money"" Again this game isn't worth full price when it's littered with modders and script kiddies running the place.These shark card prices are asinine as well since everything is price around a million or two you'll be shoveling hundreds if not thousands of dollars just get everything you want out of online mode. If you really need to play MP play it on the PS4. (Sadly I don t have one so I can t enjoy online mode as a lot of people do)I got this game when it was 50% off so I am happy when I got it but I would ve never gotten this game for full price. I am still amazed this four year old game is still full price while games related to this and release around the same time has their price dropped to 40% from full price.

2015-06-14,17,7,180,False,Recommended,I purchased this video game for my 10 year old child for completing his communion. At first we could not figure out how to get the game to load on to his Macintosh laptop but after some time a Windows support representative told us that we could not install the game on Macintosh and had to purchase a Windows computer. I did not want to disappoint my child as I was afraid that he might question his faith if he did not reap the rewards of his hard work for Jesus. We purchased him an Official Dell Windows computer and started to install this video game for him. This is where things took a turn for the worse. When purchasing this game I was under the impression that I was buying my child a Police game where you would stop criminals as the title mentioned who were stealing cars. This game is not what I thought it was and I was appalled to learn that this game was the exact opposite of stopping criminals. You ARE the criminal. I stood there in horror as I watched my devout Christian child steal a car and shoot an automatic assaulting rifle at civilians. I then watched as he took this stolen vehicle and picked up a working girl and took her to a remote location and received favors in return for cash. What horrible person would create such an awful game where the main goal is to sin as much as possible?? This game should be called Grand Theft Satan. I would not recommend this game for any human to play. I had to go to church every day to help me forget the things that I witnessed in that game. As a proud conservative Christian mother I would HIGHLY recommend that this video game gets taken off of steam and the developers are sent to confession. If you want your child to have a soul I suggest you do not purchase this game. 1/10,Grand Theft Auto V

You have to create a Social Club account and log in with it once then the game will be tied to that account because Steam is not enough DRM already (btw their game client account creation form is bugged. For me it simply hung when I tried to create an account good job! Use the website instead). I'm not even going to start about their shark card ripoff.If you're turned off hang on things briefly get better from here The options menu is quite decent and even on my 4+ year old or so hardware (Lynnfield i5 and GTX660 Ti) the game performs well and looks good. Production quality is high. What I don't like though is the overall feel of the gameplay and the controls. They stepped even further away from the arcadey madness of Vice City or San Andreas than GTA IV did... which is not what I hoped for at all Sluggish and slow.

2016-08-24,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,Here some points I disliked from this game Long loading times using a GTX 970 (sometimes up to a minute) almost 60% of my GTA V PC experience is just loading even if I get killed online or a network issue I just get the loading screen for everything I can t stand waiting for this loading screen so consecutive and for long I understand the map its big and detailed for justify this loading time but I guess there could be better techniques for map loading that doesn t makes you to wait and look at that darn loading screen There is a weird network issue in GTA Online I get connected then everybody disconnects except me I thought that was my network settings or internet failure but it was working right it might be a special UDP port or something to configure in my PC or modem but I couldn t find solution Rockstar customer service is awful for this I have played other games such The Crew without no network problems. This issue gets every 20 minutes of online playing. Also there s another similar problem of a unknown error which automatically takes me to the campaign mode and again that darn loading screen Even after the loading times and network issues it s just the people there are so many rude people online unfair playing I mean I just get killed for no reason I can t conform explore the map or get everything done right because others wants to mess with you by killing or doing other unwanted things I don t want to do with them there should be a peaceful online mode in free roaming maybe just driving different vehicles planes etc without dying or losing your money for no reason killing people for no reason it s not funny even with all the problems with the network and again that darn loading screen The only worth thing to do it s the campaign I did it on my Xbox360 back in 2013 then I bought the PC version which I m criticizing in this review for the purpose I bought this game for online playing and to see the differences from the xbox360 version visually it s a great improvement but what I really wanted was some sort of map expansion or more exploring the map which was my main interest for this game there s no difference in map changes (expansions) between both versions of the game except some minor graphical changes and props/assets for missions. Even if the only worth thing here is the campaign the price it s not fair maybe should be around 30$ for just campaign and another 30$ for online playing I ve expend like 80$ of the original deluxe version of xbox360 and another 60$ for the PC version total of 140$ and still they want more from me by micro transactions that s a greedy move but so common nowadays no surprise and again that darn loading screen,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-21,0,0,1082,False,Recommended,At first I was angary at this game. Very angary. Until I realized that the point of this new kind of online game is not to be fun but just to keep you playing.Since I have understood this I have simply bought a couple of shark cards and just farm gta$ from my nightclub while my friends go broke. This is my first advice to anyone.Ok now to my review.There are many theories what GTA 5 is. Some say it is the greatest game of all time. I found it is many things at the same time 1. GTA is the best loading screen simulator on the market. Since I own a SSD booting Windows now takes less than 10 seconds. For whatever reason however booting GTA5 takes around 10 minutes and sometimes goes on infinitely. (But the loading screens are updated every couple of seconds and some of them are the nicest you can imagine.)2. GTA is machine to transform lots of your precious time into ugly supercars that look like sanitary rags. (This one is the answer when I apply the scientific method when I just consider what I put in and got out of the system.)3. GTA is a garage space simulator. There are now over 500 cars in the game but you can only have 6 garages so much of your time is spent driving from one to the other. This is actually fun because you must really think hard how the garage system even works when you have 10 cars in all your garages and want to exchange 2 cars (but without being able to take out more than 1 at a time). (Tip the accepted solution is often to drive them in front of the garage and destroy them with a handgranade until you have enough space)4. GTA is consolified popamole with the worst input scheme on the PC ever. Sad but the input on PC makes no sense and almost made me quit the game. I can however guarantee you that after ca 300 hours I had learned the combinations by heart and can now put them in effortlessly like a piano player. Since then it has no longer bothered me.5. Going by the number of disturbed millenials you will encounter it will also be the future cause for a great many broken off university careers suicides and psychotherapy but that's a characteristic of all good games isn't it?6. GTA is a cheaters heaven in which hardly a session passes without a modder placing you in a cage or setting you on fire or some Russian kid with a totally impossible 8000 level terrorizing the whole lobby. (It's kind of helpful though too because if someone is better than you you can just accuse anyone of being a cheater and get away with it.)7. GTA is a futuristic battlefield. This one is funny because everyone expects a game about stealing cars but it's actually a deathmatch arena type game with most people these days using flying motorbikes and armed helicopters and if you want to stand any chance you should at least drive around in an armored tank.Last and most of all GTA will be your new second job! If you want to spend time in a game lots of time then look no further! Everything in this game costs lots of money in order to make money you need to play missions until your index finger will hurt from pressing the W key. In fact even killing yourself costs 500$ in this game!! When you have done missions for some hundred hours (and realize that you earned less than a shnuck) you will realize you need to buy the facilities which cost millions. And then you need more money to upgrade the facilites. And so on.Lastly it's strangely addictive because the graphics engine is one of the best on the PC and the city simulation is pretty darn great (although Rockstar intentionally disabled most features in GTA Online). I also met not only autistic millenials but eventually made some really good friends in this game and overall had a great time.My advice Just don't get angary if someone kills your level 1 character with a rocket salvo from the sky. It happened to all of us and you will get used to it with time and secondly those level 500 players are usually not that good from playing nothing but GTA for the last 5 years and you will soone be able to kill them too.Highly Recommended!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-28,0,0,152,False,Not Recommended,The first player is good but much much much too short. I pre ordered thinking that the DLC would be worthwhile but NOTHING adds anything more to single player. It's like a long tutorial. Everything else Rockstar did for this game was for online. GTA Online has a ridiculously clumsy menu and settings and many in the community frankly suck at humaning and are painfully annoying to play with. I beat it relatively quickly and enjoy the single player as a walking simulator now. If they could make GTA Online suck less make it easier to just play with only your friends might be worth more but can't really recommend it.The online play you can start with friends and only friends but the map is like a loading zone you can wander around but the actual events you WANT to do as friends completely disrespects your initial online settings throwing you into a random server with strangers who more than likely suck at being decent people. Then once you complete the event it throws you back into the loading zone map all alone. Friends who started out with you now loaded onto their own map. It's pretty craep.,Grand Theft Auto V

Cars to steal guns to shoot crazy people to collect some celeb's panties for less crazy people to massacre in the street... It's GTA what did you expect?What this one does above and beyond compared to the previous titles is the atmosphere Liberty City was great butLos Santos is so detailed and vibrant you can go for a drive and look at sunsets for 6 hours straight.GTA OnlineAll of the above minus the voiceacting. A character creation that's on par but after while leaves you wanting.Tho the abundance of clothes and such to find your character's style helps a lot same goes for the cars.Free content updates shoot people with friends or shoot your friends as well.Fail heists in dumb ways thanks to random people who are at an all time high of cluelessness.BUT..Except there is no acceptable way of making money in Online. The price that Rockstar puts on all the items with the updates is laughable considering how slow and unreliable all ways of making money actually are.And above all else the community is one of the most rotten and going into public sessions will bring you nothing but greifing players and toxic chats.The attention to detail in visuals physics and practical little things is so above and beyond that you will still be surprised after hundreds of hours.What was missing in GTA IV is now here with some green wilderness character creation and full customization of vehicles.Remember to stop shooting people and go for a slow cruise a walk on the beach or a bikeride in the sun there's always something to look at.Do you like shooting things?

The fact that Rockstar Games the developers of GTA V are money grubbing greedy over reaching boundary pushing line crossing slimy Weasel like !!This is a company that will try to suck EVERY DAMN PENNY from your wallet! They will LITERALLY take away ammunition you've purhcased clothes you've bought and money you've earned fair and square JUST to make you buy those damn Shark Cards so you can buy it back. They will literally make earning money in game IMPOSSIBLE without the use of those damn Shark Cards. They will ACTUALLY STRIP GAMEPLAY MECHANICS FROM THE GAME AND MAKE PLAYERS PAY FOR THEM JUST TO SLOWLY FORCE THEM TO BUY SHARK CARDS! They made BILLIONS of dollars with the sales of this game yet they STILL feel the need to milk all the cash they can from it! And what's worse?! They will HAPPILY oppress harass and just make life hard for their playerbase to make it that way! There have been people who were BANNED because they made too much money from GENUINELY playing heists and earning it! They have deleted players' characters because they got too much cash without buying those ING SHARK CARDS! Now when I see people hacking and modding to make money I can't even ing blame them! At this point I'm considering it too! And perhaps if Rockstar at least cared about their community SOMEWHAT I wouldn't be as but they genuinely couldn't give a Their customer support inquiries NEVER get answered and they will happily let their players suffer and be abused because hey answering complaints doesn't get them ing money now does it?It's a real damn shame that a game that had such effort time and care put into it is owned by such heartless corporate pinheads like Rockstar! The game is GENUINELY fun but making money is SO ing hard that you'd need to spend HOURS replaying heist after heist to earn anything. And when you've FINALLY got money and your hard work will pay off you'll lose it in an instant because everything in GTA Online costs a ING FORTUNE!!! That is if Rockstar don't ban you first. If you're listening to this review Rockstar you. I will NEVER buy those greasy dirty dignity destroying Shark Cards. And if you ban me for it joke's on YOU because that will just PROVE that you're nothing but self centred cold greedy bastards. Don't buy this game. It's a great game but don't ing buy it.

2015-04-25,1,3,243,False,Recommended,Okay my review is based on playing the PS3 version the Xbox one version and now the PC version so I can safely say that I have had my fair share experience with this game. Graphics yes the graphics are improved significantly compare to the original PS3 version or Xbox 360 towards the Xbox one the graphics are pretty nice but now it was a PC they are huge step up I am currently using 4.7 GB just for video RAM for this game that is quite a lot there is a nice detail everywhere with some beautiful surroundings and I cannot really say anything bad about the graphics. Audio this is GTA what type of audio do you want you have car sounds gun sounds people screaming with some weird sound as you're driving around is basically is nothing special to do with the sound of this game. Controls I personally use an Xbox 360 controller with this game because I cannot use keyboard and mouse when playing GTA on the PC. I just find that this game is easier and better played and enjoyed when using a controller for this game the controls otherwise I'll bit weird and a bit slow at times but you get used to that because it's an open world game. Features when you have played GTA five on the PS3 the Xbox one and a PC there is nothing special yesterday to the graphics yes they've added to more animals few cars and weapons but that is about it. Nothing major or special. Only first person which was on next gen only improvement is the graphics and I see no key feature improvements. My personal view on the game is that it contains more bugs more issues more connection problems and any other game I have ever played and I have played many games that have had not nearly half as much problems. The developers I've noticed seem to ignore the main problems of the game and would rather fix a micro transaction that would affect their pockets (money glitching) than actually fix the connections issues. There is a constant problem where it will be timed out from server disconnected due to unknown error creative mode does not load it just loads of the clouds kicked off the lobby due to unknown network error the list is pretty big one playing online there is a constant problem so far to date I am yet to play a full game online without being disconnected and having to reconnect to my friends this is a massive pain and this is only the start of what problems lie within the game yet writing this review nothing has been done about these problems yet These problems what also present in the PS3 version and Xbox one version which still today contain these problems and still today I am an able to even play the Xbox one version online but the PS3 version has more promise... it does work to a degree. If you have friends to play with and you do not mind this connecting disconnecting connecting disconnecting connecting disconnecting connecting disconnecting connecting disconnecting connecting disconnecting connecting connecting disconnecting and connecting disconnect and connecting (literally that is the experience I have had since Xbox one and now on PC but the PC is not as bad as Xbox one but it is still bad. Remove 3 disconnecting and that is in) then you will have a lot of fun in this game provided all your friends are happy to wait for this as well it is a lot of fun with your friends messing around having an open world shooting driving flying swimming activities and many more. Overall would I recommend this game Yes if you have friends to play with otherwise it's not really much fun sadly with all the issues that are in this game I would also like to say a massive no because it is nothing special to the versions of other consoles. Rockstar has now added a better hacker ban system which is good but their servers are still the worst I have ever had too the point they care more about the money than fixing those problems and adding content than fixing the problems.... The game for many is just a plague to play online and Rockstar support are just and I mean... They will say anything about you and their services are not at fault how thousands of people complain about the same thing and yet rockstar say it's not their fault when it is. They even said to me that 8ms in my ISP line is terrible jitter in the line and that's the problem yet I can join American ping servers games with over 80ms and play perfectly fine... So be warned that online is not as smooth with their connection issues CONSTANTLY and the support is a bag of I am angered at this which you can tellI have had what fun I can have with this game with all the problems that are that lie there. I hope in a few weeks or months of these problems are fixed but then I do not hold my breath because these problems were never fixed on previous versions of the game on the console.

Yeah there's a HUGE caveat online is fun if you have a bunch of friends to play with so you can avoid the open sessions if not then forget it.Why are open sessions such a problem? Because of how laughably easy the game is to hack people with godmode enabled modded weapons and vehicles etc free money and so on. As if this is not a big enough problem it seems the Rockstar team have their heads firmly inserted up their collective arses their ham fisted efforts to stem the tide of hackers has resulted in a LOT of collateral damage to their customer base with innocent players being banned or reset arbitrarily with little to no room for appeal.Seriously Rockstar don't seem to realize this is not the way to treat your customers but hey ho I guess they are taking a leaf out of EA's plenty more saps in the sea play book.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-23,1,3,47,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ONLINE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HEED THIS WARNINGGrand Theft Auto 5 s story is one of the best ever written. We all know that by now and it s safe to say that most people do and have so what we are really interested in is gta online. Well then it s too ing bad. Don t you dare buy this game for online don t do it please I m warning you. First off the amount of modders are insane they re everywhere I have not been in one server yet that doesn t have some it s bull especially when someone unloads a ing ak at you but its goddam rounds that the fighter jets in the game use! Or better yet all of their weapons do one shots and are you still convinced? No? How about the ing fact that they can blow everyone up in the server with a press of a button! Not to mention some don t like doing all that so they fill their stats give themselves all the guns and a ton of money on their new character meaning low level characters are running around with goddam 50.cals and rocket launchers it s pandemonium. Second the community I once was in a server with a modder and he was abusing his power I warned everyone to kick him no one believed me until he blew everyone up and kept killing them in an infinite cycle of dying and respawning! Then everyone said something along the lines oh if you not modding you re a ing moron WHAT THE he s terrorizing the server including your dumbass and you re defending him? Then I got vote kicked. Bottom line is 75% of people are using mods and the other % have their heads up their trying to defend them with the SMALL exception of people who came from console who are scared to do anything because they modders are hackers and their going to steal their credentials or get them banned. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ONLINE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HEED THIS WARNINGI was off so my grammar might suck balls excuse my borderline autistic writing just don t buy the game for online.,Grand Theft Auto V

You make your money off of shark cards and modders can give out free money what does that mean to you?Modders also like to ruin the experience of others which means less people on your playerbase which means less money that could be made from your shark card scheme because there is no point to play your game online if it's being ruined.Don't be like CoD and leave your game in the dirt just because you're releasing another game soon that looks bad on you and shows how you don't care for the players of your game.Revisit This game is even worse now than when I wrote this review,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-29,0,0,364,False,Not Recommended,"Well once again here we are years after launch and RocksTARD still hasn't figured out how to Online I got this game in order to play with friends and family and HAVE FUN. It's been anything but that. * If you join Invite only You will be placed in an existing lobby with 5 10+ people you do not know.* If you Join Friends You will be placed in an existing lobby with 5 10+ people you do not know that are ""not your friends""* If you Join Crew Memebers You will be placed in an existing lobby with 5 10+ people you do not know that are not part of your crew or the crew you belong too.* If you Find New Session If does exactly what the 3 selections above do. &lt one of the advertised features BTW that work as intended.* If you are wanting to buy this game to play with friends because it says ""ONLINE"" somewhere. DONT you will be let down because joining them in an enormous time consuming task.* Example If you buy a Motorcycle Club you need to know ahead of time you need to make yourself President every time you log in or change session additionally you will need to re invite all your MC club members EACH TIME YOU LOG IN OR CHANGE SESSION. Then of course rank them up assign rank privies etc. If all your biker buddies are in the clubhouse and you walk outside to get some fresh air....it kicks all your MC club members out. If you go offline it kicks you out of president possition (You do not lose the club) and removes them from the MC club. I haven't checked yet how that affects their bikes stored in the clubhouse i can only imagine it either locks them out of their bikes or kicks the bikes to the curb. RocksTARD really needs to fix the online mode too. You can't do 80% of the ONLINE solo missions in a solo session. OoIf you join a session...oh boy what a treat that is. Got 2 3 hours to burn? Want to get a couple supply runs in for your counterfieting business? HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH Not online you don't. &lt Oh wait that is the only way you can. You will be hack killed hunted and killed killed teleported and killed teleported too and killed cars will teleport to a rooftop and kill you planes will fly backwards and upside down at the same time and fire rockets and kill you. Everytime you die you lose money...even if you don't have money on you. In every session you can Actually see where every other player in that session is. So this eases the burden on trolltubers who are literally just there to kill you and not progress in the game at all. To hunt you down and kill you while you are trying to experience and complete content that is ONLINE ONLY. Anytime you actually get to a supply node the entire server is toaster notified that you are returning supplies to your hideout. This means any player can come get your supplies....Well at least prevent you from getting them. When everyone has ESP and knows your exact location knows what you are doing and where able to hack and kill at leisure Well TBH if all i wanted to do is log in with the full intent to simply hunt downand kill other players for no reason other than pulling wings off flies. I'd just go play PUBG or SQUAD. At least there you aren't a blip on the radar and your intentions aren't advertised to everyone. Great graphis great gameplay great car mechanics. Don't waste your time on aircraft RocksTARD more or less abandoned that feature and you are on your own. But ONLINE...Unless you want to play the single player campaign only. Don't bother. I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend because my friends all play in games together something Rockstar needs to work on.",Grand Theft Auto V

Can't join friends cant play online for more than a couple of minutes before the sessions crash. Cant play heists or quests cause the GTA Online connection is lost every 5 mins.... A normal day of playing GTA V with a friend consists of spending half an hour to just get in the same session and then in the same quest lobby. Then we start a quest and after 5 10mins I get booted from the session and have to waste another half an hour to back online. If he invites me to a Heist most of the time I'll get a message that the session is full and that I'll be sent back to the previous session which never happens.

2019-02-10,0,0,57,False,Not Recommended,"Quite possibly the worst AAA game I own put simply. As terrible as the business practices of Rockstar have been regarding the game I just want to point out how insulting the ""Labor of Love"" award is to everyone on this platform.Grand Theft Auto Five launched without its multiplayer mode available and still sold at full price. Granted the single player is amazing and the world building the graphics the audio and the utter vibrancy of Los Santos in the single player are far beyond even my highest expectations. Despite this single player experience the game was distributed without a large part of its content included.To make matters worse Rockstar have done little to improve upon this. While yes the online mode was eventually released it was not only a shell of what was expected but was an echo of the single player mode where the team behind it went so far as to release the online mode with similar issues to that of the initial launch. The most notable example of this is once again missing promised content. Heists a source of massive hype and element of the game that had amazing potential were no where to be found. Quite a few pitiful excuses for ""DLC"" were released before Rockstar even mumbled the word ""Heist"" again and when they eventually got around to it they came up with five minimalistic at best embellished missions that do not offer a fair reward for one's time.While the world we were allowed to explore in the single player mode felt immeasureably smaller despite existing in the exact same space it was also missing much of the uniqueness and vibrancy that could be found in Los Santos and its northern neighbors in the single player. While these are only a few issues I find with the game and focus towards the early days of the game's release the fact that these issues are still pertinent is what makes the ""Labor of Love"" award so terribly undeserved. There are other issues to regard such as the fact that all the development this game has seen in 2018 is less than laughable and (when taking ""Labor of Love"" a bit more seriously) the point that this game has become so much less than a passion project. Whatever the team felt whenever making this game it has since been buried under a mountain of micro transactions and money making ""development"" that can't even compete with the modifications that smaller teams are able to make. The same modifications that Rockstar refuse to allow to flourish and have since stamped out further shortening the lifespan of this once promising product.Of course the game does have its fun moments but no where near enough to justify any of the Steam Awards of 2018 especially not the ""Labor of Love"" award. Of course the award is meaningless compared to the above issues however it was the target of this review as it is what has motivated me to write it.TLDR Thank you for coming to my TED Talk fix your Rockstar.",Grand Theft Auto V

Such money Bella fantastica... Ok ok you can get more money from this... just invest another 1 5mln ) then you can sell you 75k invest and 2h of real time (you must be in game ))) ) for a 200k ok thatst pretty nice )Yes there is another way! You can resupply your resources doing mission instead of moni. So lets go lets do mission!HAHAHAHAH poor boy hehe you see... the objective is exactly on the opposite side of the whole map hehe... so go... 7 minutes in one way and back for another 7 minutes. Cool I can handle that.HAHAHAHA poor boy this will resuply your resources but only in 1/4 of full stock xDSo is there other way to make moni? Sure. You can do a missions for car steal (ofc you need to buy office for 1 5mln and then special garage for another 1mln ) ) then you will just go to the point with a car and take it to your garage but there is one thing... you can not damage it. Ok so I will drive carefully...HAHAHAHAHA poor boy... game will spawn enemys with guns and they will shoot you more precisely with mashine gun then you ever with sniper rifle xD And you will just lost money with every shoot in the car.Then you can sell it. You must deliver the car in specific place and... the game will spawn the same opponents )Brilliant idea to add shooting enemys to mission where you need to deliver car with a specific value that you lose at any damage ) What about other players?HAHAHAHAHA poor boy...*boom boom boom What was that?Other players on flying bikes with homing rockets. They will destroy you your cars with supplys or literally everything you want to do. Just for fun. You will learn quickly how to make empty lobby... Hey wait it was supposed to be a multiplayer game...HAHAHA... poor boy What about a game time?

2018-01-10,0,0,1320,False,Recommended,Great value for single player alone. Online is also enjoyable with frequently updates despite the game has been released years ago ( obviously dev also get benefits from p2win players ) however it lack so many crucial features that would totally affect online experience. Firstly language of preference since this game has a lot of players worldwide 9/10 times when I get into a session or join a job nobody communicate in English ( except for 'noob' 'hacker on ? Money pls' and other fancy words' which sucks because it's like you're talking to yourself and it's a disaster when people in the team can't coordinate what to do in a mission. So letting us choose session with people who can communicate in your language should definitely be add Secondly the infamous loading screen. It takes FOREVER every time to start playing online and after completing a mission to return to free roam. Same thing when you try to join a mission then it happens to be full another 5 mins wasted along with opportunity to join other missions.Thirdly split for PVP/PVE free roam. Dev looked over the fact that there are a lot of players with different play style. Either you play solo or suck it up and play with psychopaths unless you're lucky to find a friendly session.Finally hackers everywhere. Most of which were there to ruin others gameplay experience such as turning you into a random object teleport you in a locked area or make you fly around as a rag doll or blow you up inside your own safehouse. Worst part is that they do it openly like people who are level 6666 or 8000 for instant and dev doesn't seems to care at all even though there's a report button. Best to have a group of people you know personally to accompany you as you might not find a lot of people who communicate with you. And certainly the chance that you will find a random civilized person is even less.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-20,2,24,153,False,Recommended,Coming from someone who has played the PC port of GTA IV believe me this is a GREAT port for the next instalment. The price is still pretty expensive and I would recommend buying it when it drops lower unless you can't wait to hijack a military jet or you are a hardcore GTA fan. I would also suggest playing this with a gamepad instead of a mouse except in some instances of shooting in moving vehicles. Ok now time for the pros and cons PROS Good balance in gameplay time and character development between the 3 characters. Graphics is very good and I would strongly recommend playing it at at least High settings Try limiting the drop to Normal settings as it can really make a whole lot of difference. Story is great and interesting except for a few loophole plots. Nonetheless it really got my attention most of the time and future DLCs will definitely make it better Voice acting is superb I love the voice casts in this. They really suit their own characters bravo R* Director mode is pretty fun its a PC exclusive and it enables the players to create their own settings (there are limitations though such as dialogues etc) and place characters that can be unlocked during story mode. I usually use it to wreck havoc in the game lolCONS Online. As with many others I find it hard to play an online mission without meeting someone who uses cheat. Sometimes you will spend so much time looking for a party to play in and the missions ends in a blink of an eye. Garage bug. Yup I am one of the many victims who lost their heavily upgraded vehicles in their own garage after exiting the game. It doesn't happen all the time but you do get the fear of when this bug will strike next on your beloved carsAll in all this game is still great on its own. I would suggest GTA fans to get this. For neutrals maybe get at a lower price.,Grand Theft Auto V

I personally was able to find MULTIPLE easy use hacks with a simple google search. The games online features are disgustingly unprotected making playing it too easy as there's people shooting millions of dollars in with their guns yes that give you 40k when picked up and their unbelievable use of god mode explosive ammunition weapons that aren't even available in multiplayer or for their version like the rail gun the tommy gun the fireworks launcher etc. What the rockstar put some security on mp that isn't utter that people will put out hacks FOR FREE.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-11,0,0,136,False,Not Recommended,Awful game. Modders on every server so you will be extremely lucky if you don't get fu*cked by them. Pretty much impossible to get any money at the start so you'll have to grind forever doing boring missions to gain little money. The only easy way to gain a lot of money are daily objectives and what a pain they are. Rockstar made dull and useless game modes that no one wants to play that's fine though. What itsn't is that they included these game modes in to the daily objectives to make them practically impossible to accomplish. Getting someone to join your lobby is hard enough but the chance of them not leaving in 10 seconds is closer to 0 than an anime character's body pillow appearing on your bed due to quantum fluctuations. If you somehow manage to get to the team screen you will be kicked out because there were apparently not enough players and you will then be stuck on a loading screen forever so you'll have to restart. That however doesn't really help as it takes over 10 minutes to load online. Also it has very little to due with skill. The more money you invest the more over powered vechicles/weapons you'll have. That is all multiplayer though the singleplayer is great. Everything is balanced fun and you don't need to torture yourself to gain money. However singleplayer can only last so long therefore you will have to go online eventually. All in all it's punishment for anybody who comes in raw.,Grand Theft Auto V

I swear there was a mission one half awake annoyed morning where the characters were on some kind of roller coaster half heartedly saying ""woah woooah wooooah wooooah "" over and over again. It's the same GTA you've had since GTA III and that was a long long time ago. It just has current graphics. It got old to me after I overplayed GTA IV.

(Being able to see more at either side is an advantage for any of you 'slow' in the head people trying to defend it)Anyways onto the main review I'd never played any of the console versions of GTA V so I've come along as a fresh newbie.So far I've been completely wow'd by the whole experience. The city feels so alive with the pure density of NPCs and some of the views are absolutely breath taking.The story is in comparison to GTA IV about just as gritty. It's however dampened by the amount of humor piled in with a lot of help from the amazing acting work. I'm not quite sure how long I've spent on the story mode alone but rest assured there's a lot of content to ensure you're playing it for a good while.Online mode is simply amazing. Granted some people on there seem to be blind to the fact that this isn't GTA IV Freeroam There's so much more to do cooperative missions and activities alike are very abundant. When you're tired of shooting things up stop and play tennis with a friend or arm wrestle some random dude who's way stronger than you for a laugh. Heck go skydiving with your buddies and take in the amazing views as the Sun begins to set.This game has far exceeded my expectations especially in comparison to GTA IV.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-01,3,8,458,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a game which takes place in the fictional pacific oceanic city of Los Santos and has two primary game modes. Storyline and Online. I'll give a review for each type as the two are profoundly different and impossible to review as a collective game(They even have two different titles GTA V and GTAO(Grand Theft Auto Online)Grand Theft Auto VGameplay There are three main playable Characters in Grand Theft Auto V Michael Trevor and Franklin. Michael is a former bank robber from the East Coast who's got a sweetheart deal with the FIB(GTA speak for FBI). Trevor is a sleazy trailer park criminal and Michael's best friend. From South Los Santos Franklin is an ex street gangster.The storyline switches between the three and you get to play as each one in segmented instances as the story progresses and tends to lean between the three in alternating levels of importance(Meaning when Trevor becomes more valid to the story than the other 2 you'll play as him etc. ). However it is possible to switch between character after you encounter them allowing you to have one as a 'main' and only play as the others when the story requires it.It is a new type of GTA gameplay and frankly I enjoy it but I don't enjoy it as much as I did with San Andreas. In San Andreas you were stuck with playing an african american street gangster true but you could change and customize him as you pleased making him fat thin muscular weak swagalicious clothes or a bum. You had options. In GTA V you don't get the same level of personalization in the Storyline and instead have 3 generic unchangable characters to choose from. That 'would' be a problem for me but GTA Online fixes that right and proper which is why I don't mind it in the slightest.If I were to give Grand Theft Auto V(Storyline) a score? I'd give it 8 stars out of 10. Above is all of the positive but what about the negative?Grand Theft Auto V has the problem as every GTA V game has and that is that the Storyline is always the same Generic issue. It's people doing crime to get money because money is great. That's it. The story is paper thin and irritatingly simplistic.Grand Theft Auto OnlineGrand Theft Auto takes everything that Storyline has and personalizes it. You get to create and name your own character and you then get lumped into a game session that can each house 30 players max each. Everything is 100% public even the voice chat(It'll either be deathly silent or it'll be an ear deafening cacoffiny of people talking/yelling at eachother. At least it's easy to leave/join other sessions to find one more suitable for your preferences.StorylineThe story behind GTA Online starts right after you make your character. You fly into Los Santos on an airplane and meet with one of the main characters from the Storyline who takes you through a tutorial to show you the ropes after that you're essentially on your own and are cut loose to make your own way in the world will you be a racer? A bankrobber? A sports nut? Or simply a psychopath who kills everyone in your path? It is entirely up to you to make your own story! GTA Online just gives you the means its your job to make it work.GameplayGameplay in GTAO is much the same as in GTAV but its much more brutal! If you're simply driving down through the street you might suddenly find yourself exploding for no reason and dead instantly only to realize that you'd driven over another player's sticky bomb and they had remotely detonated it when you were close. GTA Online is a merciless dangerous place far more dangerous than the single player because almost every player wants to kill you! Especially if you get a bounty put on you then everyone wants a piece of your There is a way to fix this though and that's in the form of the Passive Mode. After you die or during a game you might decide that you've had enough of PvP and don't want to be killed by other players. You can activate the passive mode! After doing so you get a ghostly appearance and can no longer take any kind of damage from other players. Even the vehicle you enter will get a ghostly appearance and will be impervious to any player interaction. You'll even drive straight through other players!The game mechanics is separated into 3 different obtainable 'currencies' Reputation Points(RP)GTAV's answer to experience points. Like in every other MMO style game out there you gain RP(Experience) until you get a certain amount which then levels you up.GTA$The game's actual monetary currency. This is by far thee most important thing in the game as it allows you to buy cars apartments planes helicopters food(for health) ammo/armor/weapons and everything generally required to increase your utility and ability to adapt to any situation the game will throw at you. It is the only one of the 3 currencies able to be bought for real life money but it is exceedingly expensive! GTA$8 000 000 costs US$100!Job Points(JP)The least important obtainable currency. It is not really a currency but more a means to choosing a winner in Player Vs. Player scenarios. Say two people kill the same amount of enemies but one maybe has a higher accuracy rating/fewer deaths than the other? That person will get more JP for the mission than the other and thereby win eventhough they both killed the same amount of people/crossed the finish line at the same time. This currency resets to 0 after each job.Cons The community can be extremely horrible full of angry russians and asians who can't speak a lick of English or #MLG420BLASTURMOMM9 worshipping whom are also abound. Trolls are EVERYWHERE and are extremely obstructive and irritating.Hacking is a risk. There are still hacks that are unfixed such as infinite money and invulnerability. People 'ARE' getting banned but not fast enough and it's a growing issue.Bugs/GlitchesYou get stuck a lot and the only fix for this is to force exit the game through the Task Manager and restart the game. This has happened to me 3 times in a week once when entering my garage from outside once when entering my apartment from outside and once after finishing a versus mission. Sometimes if the internet is lagging a bit someone might become invulnerable while being able to kill you because the damage doesn't register for them.Loading Screens are CRAZYThis is an issue I hope they fix soon. There is a loading screen literally no matter what you do! Even if you join a lobby for a mission and then leave right after? You don't just go back to where you stood before no you have to go through a SECOND loading screen and these loading screens take longer if you go into the Steam overlay meaning you are forced to sit there and wait for MINUTES at a time to actually play instead of being able to sit and chat with friends in between!Universal Stuff(Stuff that applies to bothGraphics are extremely demanding. If you don't have a top of the line PC? Expect everything to have to be on medium(Medium is GTA V's name for 'lowest' ) and still have some problems with lag.Physics are WAY better in this game and driving bikes/cars is far more realistic. This can be both a positive and negative experience. Driving in heavy rain is extremely difficult and takes a lot of practice to get right. I find it a positive thing but I've heard a lot of complaints that it's actually 'too real'.All this considered? I still recommend the game as it is despite the occassional issue an EXTREMELY fun game and more than worth the price tag! If you enjoy the GTA franchise? This one is a must have ) LEAGUES better than GTA IV!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,1,8,181,False,Recommended,An absolutely amazing game. The port was amazingly done the graphics are just amazing and the controls are easy to get used to which is what I feared the most. A wide variety of computers are able to run the game which is why they made the game delayed for many months they fitted the game with all sorts of things that would help people run the game even on toaster computers. The gameplay is designed so that you would be able to spend whole days on end completing missions for NPCs and the story itself is quite long.As for Online it's amazing what Rockstar did with it. Sadly there is no co op campaign but instead you can live and roam Los Santos/Blaine County as any type of person you'd be. I suspect there to be quite a lot of roleplaying although more people would rather kill each other like the sociopaths they all are in game. A great option that I love seeing in Online is that I can transfer my character directly from previous versions of the game (PS3 PS4 XB360 XB1) and retain all of the stuff that I had on him. You can also have the option to edit his/her appearance one more time if you don't feel comfortable with the way he looks.Overall score 11/10 would buy again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,33,313,2981,False,Recommended,The best game ever. If not 100% it should have overwhelmingly positive reviews. I'd give it 10/10 in every single aspect.For the best ending. If you want to keep all the three playable characters for free roam after final mission choose the third option called Deathwish. If you choose to Kill Trevor or Kill Michael those characters will become permanently unplayable in free roam after the last mission.Because of Grand Theft Auto V somebody went into trouble of hijacking my Steam account just to put several dozen if not hundred hours into this game that person never touched anything else except it as long as my account was in his/her possession. Hijacker even contacted me on my old Steam associated Email which I luckily recovered just to try to scam me into giving him my Social Club account(And he'd buy me GTA V if gave him/her my Social Club account so he/she could keep playing in online) after I contacted Rockstar and unlinked my Social Club account from Steam in order to prevent the hijacker from playing GTAO with my account.Also huge thanks to the Rockstar for trusting and supporting me with an amazing speed!(Unlike the Steam support which took few months to reply to my support ticket though it's understandable since the incident took around the big sale)I personally enjoyed every single second of reaching 100% completion and still do plan to continue in future. Singleplayer becomes even more fun after completing the game.Most of the negative reviews are complains about Online please ignore these reviews every single game has problems as such. And of course they'll dislike my review but I don't really care because this review is for fans and great people who love and enjoy this amazing masterpiece as well as the previous series. Though it is very true that you might do encounter a hacker which ruins the experience in online however it's rare of course it isn't most pleasant thing but it cannot ruin the awesomeness of what is Grand Theft Auto V. Besides keep in mind that if you do not want to play with other people you can create a private invite only session. Posting a bad/negative review just because of it or loathing is total disrespect to the whole game and isn't the right thing to do in my opinion.Tips about what to do if you encounter hacker mostly they'll try to give you all weapons/ammo and cash 1. Get away from them.2. Do not pick anything they drop.3. Always deposit your cash from missions or whatever into bank to separate hacked money from your own.4. If they still manage to prevent you from doing 1. and 2. immediately get rid of hacked money by quitting the game using Ctrl &amp Alt + Delete &gt Task Manager End Process method.5. Relogin all your hacked money and weapons/ammo now should disappear only your original weapons/ammo will remain.6. Optional but highly recommended. You can start recording a video immediately whenever you encounter a hacker until the second you get away from him or take screenshots if you can't afford recording video just in case so you'll have a proof. The best would be reporting it directly to Rockstar support.Thank you for taking your time and reading my review have a great day!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-18,97,143,241,False,Recommended,April 14 day when I quit my job April 14 day when GTA 5 was released for real xDApril 14 day when I stop having xXx &lt 3 with my wife couse game have so much thrill !Ok now about review Grand Theft Auto V is a spectacular third person free roaming game which does well in portraying everyone's guilty pleasures whether that is slaughtering innocents exploding cop cars with RPGs murdering hookers or taking a trip to the local strip club. Grand Theft Auto has always been amongst the greatest free roam shooters of all time and it continues that legacy here with GTA V. The online experience and racing have been greatly improved and the story features three playable protagonists rather than the traditional one.In the story of Grand Theft Auto V you play as three very different characters with three different distinctive personalities. First is Michael a retiree from the illegitimate business of bank robbing and a family man with tons of family problems. Next is the young blood Franklin. Straight outta the hood and looking to make a living without having to look over his shoulder every step of the way. Lastly is Trevor the truly psychotic man with no regards for human life. Everyone that plays GTA V instinctively chooses a favorite character whether it is Michael because you want to see him get his family back on track Franklin because you want to see him create a future for himself or Trevor because you too enjoy killing drunken rednecks. Regardless you must play as all three and the greatest feature that separates the campaign of Grand Theft Auto V from all others is the bank heists. Plan and execute heists whether you choose stealthy or an all out blood bath choose your crew which ultimately decides the payout you receive from each heist and enjoy every detail and heist you can. The story is well worth the price of buying the game but it comes with an added bonus. GTA Online.Although GTA Online had a rocky start with several issues it is for the most part fixed today and a very fun experience to play with friends. In the beginning their were terrible servers problems involving created characters being deleted and now the mission payouts being much lower than early release and replaying them pays out even less. Along with most others I am still awaiting for heists in multiplayer which very well may never come but regardless GTA Online is still fun. You still have the ability to run around and kill others as well as civilians but instead of that simplicity you can now customize your character his vehicles and even where he lives. You earn money through online missions and other methods that helps you pay for newer vehicles apartments weapons and clothes. You create your own character and literally choose his skills which you can later improve.Grand Theft Auto always has great replay value gamers still play San Andreas and GTA IV and of course several thousand still play GTA V. After the story is over you can always free roam and when you get tired of wandering aimlessly the multiplayer is great to play for long periods of time. Gain satisfaction improving your vehicles and purchasing a high end apartment. I only have one little note about this game NOT FOR KIDS. Seriously if you are even the least bit immature or offended by violence language or sexual content please do not buy this game and don't buy it for kids either. A great game but it's worth waiting for especially if it will traumatize you or turn you from innocent into a kid that spews foul language.Overall a masterpiece.

2015-04-14,0,0,227,False,Recommended,"I've played a ton of the PS3 and PS4 versions before PC so consider this a sort of comparison thing if you're thinking about switching. If you're new to GTA V then you might want to look at other reviews because this might not help you so much I haven't touched the singleplayer game beyond the mandatory prologue before getting straight into Online.The key reasons I wanted GTA V PC even though I've already played it a lot were graphics controls and so I could play with PC playing friends.The configurability of the graphics is pretty crazy there are a lot of options here it's not like the average port where you're lucky if you can change the resolution. The game properly supports multi (I've tested triple 1080p) monitor setups as in they've actually put some thought into how it'll look so you don't get any crazy GUI mess like you do in other games it even fades the peripheral monitors in and out if it needs to. I've got a fairly ok rig an i5 2500K and a GTX 680 and it runs great at 1080p but obviously it's nowhere near the max settings but it still looks a lot better than the console versions. There is the odd hiccup in the frame rate but on the whole it is a night and day difference coming from even the PS4 version. I haven't seen any particularly alarming bugs or artifacts either maybe the odd LOD transition that takes longer than it should (even though it's running from an SSD) but nothing you wouldn't expect really.The default keyboard controls are awful they use pretty much the entire keyboard even the numpad! The default flying controls are WASD for throttle and rudder num 2468 for pitch and roll and the mouse does the camera... I don't have three hands. Admittedly it's not all that common to need the camera but I'm going to eventually try to come up with a better configuration for all that. It would be nice if you could turn off camera auto center for vehicles but I don't think you can. There are other weird things too like cycling prev/next weapon in vehicles mouse wheel up or tab to go to the next weapon or to go to the previous. What? So that's left hand or mouse for next weapon take your hand off the mouse and look for the key that no one ever uses in games to avoid having to cycle all the way back around to the weapon before the one you were on. Still you can remap that so that's ok. Lack of analogue control over vehicles is a big deal offroading is terrible because you just wheelspin all the time it could really do with a 'slow' modifier (maybe it has one I didn't spend much time looking at the car control binds). I'm not sure about directinput controller support it definitely supports 360 controllers though so you could have one on your lap to switch to for vehicles.However for all that's bad about the keyboard and mouse controls it has one massive massive plus mouse aim. This is the biggest game changer for me I can actually hit stuff with my first shot when firing from vehicles now and the marksman rifle is actually useful! I think it would be worth hacking some sort of one handed driving controller together just to be able to use a mouse to aim while I drive it's so good. I might even use first person mode for more than just messing around now.Finally being able to play with friends. It seems like almost everyone I regularly talk to has now bought GTA V and everyone else is on the fence but holding off because it's expensive so for now at least there's no shortage of people to join. The Social Club crews feature means I can be a member of a variety of different er social clubs (i.e. a group of IRL friends a group of one gaming site a group of another etc.) and play with anyone from any of them at any time without much trouble except I did have one problem last night in that the in game friends list was saying a friend I was talking to was offline... But that's also ok because the game supports the Steam ""join game"" feature and you can also invite people through the Rockstar Social Club overlay. There's also in game voice chat with push to talk (no more being assaulted by people breathing down their mics or coughing!) but it wasn't working when I tried it three hours after the launch and global/team text chat in addition to text messages communicating is therefore much easier which is extremely handy in a game where communication during jobs is so important.Yes Online still has the long load times and flaky servers the console versions have but you can massively reduce the wait by installing the game on an SSD so there's that at least. Otherwise the game is pretty much the same same cars same guns same map etc. Snapmatic does have a meme text feature now and there is of course the replay editor but I haven't touched that yet and I don't know if I will apparently the buffer isn't very long. Oh and there's the custom radio station which I haven't set up yet. That'll be handy I was getting a bit sick of Can't Hardly Stand It.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,2617,False,Recommended,"Maybe the best computer game ever made for any system. You certainly could argue it. I've played all the GTAs each one right at release and again and again repeatedly over the years and I've been a huge fan since the very first top down GTA way back when and this is still the best GTA ever. It's so good it's almost literally unbelievable.The PC port is clearly the best version of V with an almost surreal amount of refinement graphics options control tweaks full Surround/Eyefinity support that even includes HUD movement to prevent bezel interference and the much lauded and stunningly amazing First Person Mode. The open world is alive and constantly in motion the game is absolutely beautiful the dialog is sharp and accurate and the amount of content is gigantic bordering on ridiculous. The minigames are better than or at least very comparable to the full game titles that inspired them and there's so many! The game does require a very powerful system to appreciate fully but since when is that a negative? I'm extremely pleased that Rockstar pushed the envelope of what was possible because the results speak for themselves. With the review system (specs below) I get steady 30fps through most every type of scene and location in the game and that's with everything maxed out and vsync ON except for FXAA instead of MSAA and no reflection MSAA. Everything else totally maxed out and still 30fps 6040x1080. I think that at least merits a o_0 don't you? It's not a bad port at all it's just got very high hardware requirements and people expect too much out of their old rigs. I've only played the game 13 hours so far (a drop in the bucket considering how endless the game is) but the adventures I've had already were so insane and numerous that I can barely recount them all. Spontaneous Burt Reynolds two wheeled flat spinning pistol blazing police chases. Rush hour fender benders that resulted in multiple (hilarious) vehicular manslaughters. Moody train rides across the countryside. Fistfights with angry winos. Giving anyone and everyone The Finger. The first jewely store heist that by itself makes Payday 2 look like an insulting pile of crap. And these are just the first few bites of a massive 27 course impeccably prepared banquet of video gaming destruction. So many developers getting lazy and greedy these days but like Elzar the Neptunian Master Chef Rockstar keep kicking it up another notch. BAM! Best 60 bucks I've ever spent on entertainment. I will play this masterpiece 300 hours or more... by next weekend. Truly GOTY and one of the best video games of all time. For once you can believe the hype.Review system i2500k 4ghz ASUS STRIX GTX 980 6040x1080 bezel corrected 16gb DDR3 1600 Intel 730 SSD HTOMEGA Striker 7.1 Win7 x64 UPDATE 6/18/2015 425 hours later I've beat the single player game and almost 100% it leveled up my online character to level 121... and I still love GTA V to death.Sure Rockstar has failed miserably to curb online hacking they don't listen to their own community their patches add very little the ""exclusive content"" they reserved for returning players is an insult and a slap in the face to those that have supported them for so long multiplayer is a buggy and hacker filled mess with far too little exclusive content the game itself still regularly freezes up on me for absolutely no reason at all and they've been incredibly cynical about marketing their stupid cash cards that cost a fortune and add absolutely nothing to the game... ...but GTA V is still incredibly awesome.

2016-10-10,0,0,517,False,Recommended,"alrighty thats going to be a long oneThis review is based on my personal experience from the game I have the game from the day it came out for PS4 in Israel and i've bought it on PC on the 1st of july 2016 because my friends only played on PC and I wanted a change as well. Before everything i wanna say that i fully recommend getting a modded account or modding your account to get money Rockstar made this game way too much of a grind to get stuff and made everything far too expensive. I have modded my account and i strongly recommend you to mod your account as well from Shadowchaser he offers really good packages for a really good price (and no he didnt say anything about adding him to the review his service is simply the best so i thought it should be worth adding to the review). Here is the link to his profile add him for more info http //steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowChaser X Pros If you want to buy this game for its SP go ahead you wont regret it the story is really good and funny. Graphics are nice. Gameplay is good. Characters in the SP are very well made. The heist missions are really fun to do with friends and you get a decent amount of money of them in my opinion this was the best update. Thankfully there is no roman that calls you to go bowling. Cons now this t is going to be most of the review yay! Multiplayer. In most of my time playing it with friends/alone it was a struggle ESPECIALLY when updates came out and imma explain myself.When i first bought the game my experience was good and i had no problems besides of the LONG loading times.After like a month all the problems had finally came biggest one is the Rockstar game services are unavailable right now"". Now you probably think wtf are u saying/why did u even mention that etc. Now this t is a ing big deal had most of my time trying to only get in a session (which didnt success for like 2 week or more could only enter a solo session) tried to find solutions online and all i could find is players complaining about this issue and about rockstar not giving a about it and about that their support system is crap. Now this made me think "" i just wasted 60$ for absolutely nothing!"" i was ing sad af because i thought imma have a nice time with my friends and have fun and then this happend. I guess that isnt the biggest deal because it just went away after like a month or two of struggling same for the loading times which got shorter after some time although they got longer now for some reason.False bans. basically 80% of the reviews are about false bans and about rockstar not giving a single lonely about them. Now I thought to my self that it will never happen to me or my friends then it did. 1 friend got banned for 10 days while he was having fun and driving his new car. Those 10 days had passed then another friend got banned with the same situation having fun and driving his car. These days had passed and it didn't happen again for like a week and we thought that it was just a random weird bug and we continued with our lives. Then guess what? It happend again my friend got banned for a month and a half for no actual logical reason. this month had passed same deal now before a few days another friend got banned for a month and a half with the same deal for nothing. Now it didnt happen to me so I cant actually describe how it feels but I should obviously mention that in my review.Now let's get to the stuff that actually happend to me. First of all timing out there were no days that this issue didnt happen to me where all players just leave the session randomly because i time out or something then i have to re enter the session. Oh and it doesnt just happen to me if that was the case i wouldnt even mention that that happens to everyone and i mean EVERYONE.When rockstar releases big updates you're thinking to yourself Hey thats going to be a fun time exploring the new stuff and im sure im going to have much fun! no.After every update the server just lag and whenever i try to join my friend's session (doesnt matter if its a friend session or public) or they try to join mine i get a message saying ""Timed out loading session"" or something like that.You may think right now if lag is what actually matters to you then i guess for me its not a big deal. Sure its you and if you dont get annoyed by the stuff i mentioned have fun.Cheaters. in 90% of the sessions I enter there is at least 1 cheater in it that is level 1000+ that is invincible that kills you randomly for no logical reason etc. Now this can be actually annoying if you want to do a CEO mission or a Bikers mission you can do them only on public sessions and if you will try to actually play them and have fun the normal cheater will come and destroy you. Rockstar would you please mind fixing your goddamn ing anti cheat system?EDIT BY CHEATERS I MEAN PEOPLE THAT USE MOD MENUES TO ANNOY OTHER PEOPLE DROP MONEY ON THEM WHICH WILL LEAD TO THEIR BAN OR MONEY RESET ETC. NOT PEOPLE THAT MODDED THEIR ACCOUNT FOR MONEY/LEVELS AND STUFF LIKE THAT I FULLY SUPPORT THESE.Money.When you see a nice car or whatever you will obviously want to buy it then you see the price which is in 99% of the time way too overpriced then what you would expect like seriously why does a paperbag mask need to cost 20K$?Oh and if you want to make a lot of money in short time then this game is just not for you you will have to grind for hours or days or even weeks to get the thing you wanted.EDIT 1.3.2018 New heists are added which is good and bad let me explain.The heists are fun and they add a lot to the game though they are trash because of the paywalls you get when u want to play them. You're like Oh i saved up 1M$ for a facility so i can play heists yay! nope you need a ceo office for 1 more million so you can get that etc. Another reason for it being bad is that i couldnt find anything new that costs less then 1M$. wtf is this rockstar. Singleplayer. None. SP is honestly perfect and the fact that u can use mods even makes it better.(EDIT 1.7.2017 never ing mind even mods arent a thing now lmao off) Overall Overall this game is fun if you play it with friends and i will recommend it. The amount of activities you can do with friends or random people is countless and Rockstar keeps adding more. Although if you want to have fun and recive a lot of money unfortunately heists are the only solutions for you.I will rate the game 7/10 because of the reasons i mentioned in the cons.(EDIT 1.7.2017 never ing mind mods arent a thing now in SP new rate is max 5/10. gtfo taketwo/rockstar/idk.idk why im still recommending it i can still sometimes play it and have fun i have a love hate relationship with the game i guess idk decide by yourself if the game is worth it for you.)

2017-09-18,0,0,3029,False,Not Recommended,"tl dr For PC version be expect to deal with modders every single day every single time if you are a materialist who wants to have everything but want to play legit this isn't the right game for you. By legit I mean financially cheating not modding in terms of combat advantages for PvP.Game currently has overall/recent review as ""Mixed"" I guess that is a fair representation since positive rating is going to be overrated for sure but not as bad as having a negative rating.No need to mention the good stuff here as it is very obvious to you content rich large map enormous amount of vehicles with different customization and upgrades countless ways you can have fun in this game heist race deathmatch freeroam griefing. My ways of having fun in this game is racing and there are racing crew out there.Now the bad thing for this game 1) Pay to play yet having a premium business model every item every building every feature every customization revolves around GTA$ and therefore it's all about shark card sales TakeTwo knows people will pay for these items and they exploit this priviledge to the max and push the players to their limit. The recent DLC to this game has proved this is the way they want this game to be. Grind 24/7 or pay up.2) Forget about customer support regarding anything except shark card purchase problem comparing to steam support they are actually pretty fast but just because you will not get any legit responses but bot replies.3) For PC version modder is a thing that you will encounter every single day so I suggest you to teach yourself how to make a solo lobby it is pretty much necessary. It is not worth it to defend your cargos legitimately. Because most of the time people that dare to pick a fight with you are usually modders themselves they wouldn't have any problem destroying you. And upon a chance that your business cargo get destroyed by modders with solid evidence in the form of video R* wouldn't reimburse you because in the TOS it says that selling business cargo has a risk along with it to deal with.4) Game takes a long time to load and more importantly the room entry articulation is poorly coded. If you attempt to join a heist lobby it doesn't tell you it is full until you fully loaded in the clouds then it tells you room is full and then it does not throw you back to the same lobby it throws you back to a new lobby which takes another 1 minute to load in the sky. All these loading times contribute to slowing you down from making GTA$.5) Game is not designed to be balanced don't expect every weapon has its pros/cons you will always revolve around those few weapons like Combat MG MK2 Heavy Sniper MK2 marksman rifle RPG homing missile sticky bomb minigun AP pistol. Same thing for air vehicles land vehicles it's always just those fews and you wouldn't know what they are if I tell you their names anyways. So what is it balanced for? Anything new usually will become the new meta and those will cost you a fortune usually a.k.a. more shark card sales.6) Old gen players from PS3/Xbox 360 who migrated their $9999999999 do not get justified while new gen players who received modded money will get adjusted ironically some players who play the game legitimately get their money removed as they are flagged as modded money when in fact it was R* themselves enabled a double payout for some game modes millions of GTA$ was falsely flagged and removed no was given to these players but bot replies.7) Worst thing about this game is the money making system is built upon a PvP environment in the free roam it is known that the GTA community is full of shtholes that play the game just to ruin other people's fun. All these money making system such as CEO crates Import/Export cars Motorcycle club cocaine/weed/meth/forgerydocument bunker's cargo smuggler's cargo when you sell them in free roam for GTA$ it gives your character red blipping signal all across the whole map and notify every single person the map they get paid if they destroy/steal your stuff but they only get paid a whooping 4 digits payout. Why is that a bad thing you might ask? Because those products take a long time to be gathered and produced and when the delivery vehicles that they give you to sell these products are made with cardboard which are easily blown up by anyone that pass by casually. Another thing is all these money making system were not designed to be solo'd it is mostly designed towards having 3 people total (you yourself included) if you solo sell these business products instead of delivering 1 product vehicle when you have 3 ppl you are going to have to deliver all 3 product vehicles on your own. And by playing together with another 2 persons you are obligated to help out that 2 persons as well so in the end you don't actually get the money 3x as fast but still only help to certain degree. Conclusion I recommend asking GTA$ money from modders as the method of monetizing in this game is disgusting if your ways of having fun in this game is by having every single vehicles out there but you just want to play the game legit this isn't the right game for you because I literally played this game 2000+ hours and I am no where near to be called filthy rich and matter of fact a poor player plus I'm already playing the game in glitched solo lobby with no one coming to me to destroy my business products. If you still insist buying shark cards to feed these curved nose hands bracing businessman behind the scene I can't stop you but I can tell you you are agreeing and supporting them exploiting the game playerbase. They are not going to fix the bugs and flaws in the game but will further put more and more DLC items with skyscrapper price tag just because of sucking out every penny they could before they bring out the red dead redemption dishes and the whole milking cycle re begin cuz everyone be like this game and move onto RDR2 yet they will titled themselves the most successful and one of the highest number of copies sold in the entire gaming industry.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-14,0,0,178,False,Not Recommended,I don't even know where to begin.Rockstar designed this game's singleplayer well but the inclusion of having to install social club to do anything makes the game already not worth the price. Rockstar has also been very liberal with their bans as of late leading to a lot of controversy within their playerbase. The singleplayer is good albeit short and GTA Online is a massive moneygrab designed for you to waste all of your time and money into something you'll probably see the entirety of in less than two days. All in all not worth the price tag of $60 and with how Rockstar is with their sales it would be rare to get it any lower than $50. If you do manage to grab it on sale sale be cautious.As an in addendum statement my view on this game constantly grows less and less positive. Locking content specifically behind GTA Online seems relatively scummy in retrospect and singleplayer content is severely lacking. For example the character of Michael barely has any missions to do outside of main story development while Franklin gets almost everything. Not to mention a lot of weapons and vehicles that are in GTA Online cannot be obtained in the singleplayer game. I feel the negative reviews this game has been getting are warranted but not for the reasons people are writing the reviews for. GTA Online is filled with content but most of the best parts of the game are locked behind massive walls of grinding and with the inclusion of microtransactions that everyone seems to look past it just makes matters worse. In the end GTA Online and GTA 5 are neither worth buying at all as you can get games overflowing with content more plentiful than this for basically free.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-24,0,0,44,False,Recommended,This is a review of the singleplayer portion. I was expecting more from GTA V. Almost every part of the game is done to the highest quality possible. But the story doesn't measure up. The quality of production is so high it made me expect more from it. But GTA V just isn t as charming funny or crazy as it should be.I ve seen many opinions about the writing quality. Some saying it s incredible others that it s horrible. It isn t either. It s pretty good but pulls too many punches. It points and laughs at everything and everyone in society but pulls out before it delivers anything of real weight. Every joke feels off the cuff like something they thought up at the spur of the moment. The kind of jokes you don t write down because they re too lame. It s also trying to be a Fast &amp Furious style heist story which makes the game feel like a bit of an unfocused mess. What were Rockstar trying to do with this game? It s not lighthearted enough to pass as a wacky fun comedy and it isn t serious enough to pass as a hardboiled crime drama. There s plenty of both in the game and the end result is that your brain short circuits if you try to think too hard about what s going on. Like at one point you do a heist similar to Fast Five with everyone acting dead serious while the company logos just behind them in cutscenes say Gruppe Sechs . It made something in my head crack. The mix of fun and serious is off. It's not cohesive.On a more positive note the quality of animation more specifically how characters and objects interact with each other is fantastic. Unlike other games which can have distinctively different feels for walking driving and flying everything in GTA V feels like they belong in the same world and act according to the same rules. GTA V makes other games feel stiff and artificial. Since GTA IV Rockstar have been using the Euphoria animation system and I looked up why nobody else is using it. It s because it s incredibly expensive. It s not just a middleware system that devs implement themselves instead it s a consulting package where a team of programmers work with the dev team. It seems to be what makes this feel so much better than other games. At no point do characters magically teleport between animation states. Instead it s all organic and natural. People feel like they're physical entities part of the world affected by it and affecting everyone in it. Nothing ever takes you out of this sensation. If you haven t played Red Dead Redemption Max Payne 3 or GTA V it might be worth it just to see what the state of the art in games animation is.It also nails other smaller but also very important parts like the choice of music. Every station is packed with great selections. Nothing like Watch Dogs where the radio was so bad I couldn t stand having it on. Having great music becomes one additional thing making sure that every second spent in the world feels worth it. Another good thing is that you can use gamepad and keyboard/mouse simultaneously. So you can drive with the controller and reach over to the mouse for precision shooting. Or hold down L2 to aim with a sniper rifle and do the aiming and shooting with your right hand on the mouse. Or move with the analogue stick while aiming/shooting with mouse. I kept changing between exclusively using gamepad with aim assists or keyboard/mouse to using both at the same time. Button promts change instantly and there are no issues with playing however you want. The way it should be done.The game is at its best when missions revolve around things that truly matter to the characters. Like Michael s passion for movies or his family. Or when Trevor tries to build up his own smuggling business. That s when the goals of the missions align with their interests and their enthusiasm rubs off on you. The ultimate payoff for these missions isn t money it s their pride in making something in the world that they care about deeply. Like when Michael saves a doomed movie production and gets a producer credit. He can t wait to show his name in the credits to his family and his excitement is infectious. But the game spends maybe 30% of its time on this. The bulk of the story is missions involving the most boring side characters Rockstar have ever created. It often doesn't feel like there's a point to them outside of because the game designers wanted to do a mission here . Luckily the game designers did a great job so it isn't a slog to get through them. But it doesn't feel like it's adding anything to the game as a whole apart from making use of the world they've made. And when you're making a story driven game like this having primary missions that don't seem to be connected to the story just undermines the missions entirely. The side missions don't suffer from this because you know they aren't going to be advancing the plot. You go in to them with the correct expectations. Having meaningless sideshows in the primary missions though is not ok.The end result is a game where the production quality is amazing but I went away thinking I guess that was ok . Most parts of the story don't get proper closure. A hundred things are set in motion and fizzle out just as they re about to hit home. This applies not only to the character arcs but also individual missions and the humor. It all needed just a little bit more especially in the second half of the game. That said there s no denying the level of quality they delivered here. It might be worth playing the game just for that. And there's the online mode I haven't even tried yet.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-04,0,0,33,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. It's quite hard to not enjoy a GTA game so let's review the singleplayer aspect and then touch on the online experience.Edit I understand everyone seems to be upset over the online experience right now please understand my review is mainly focused on the singleplayer experience. Hackers modders and bans do not effect singleplayer so please don't disrespect or hate on my review it's not a GTA online review. Enjoy! The GraphicsNow GTA has always been on the brink of graphic quality with every installment we seem to find a beautiful arrangement of scenery character detail etc. Which means this game is no different from the others it's ""new"" and it looks good. There's a whole section for mods in this review so I'll go over the graphic improvements that can be made over there. But to put it simply the edges ate sharp the cars scenery and characters have amazing detail (even at medium to low quality which stunned me when I had a bad GPU) and the explosions look amazing! GameplayGTA V can be played with a controller which may be essential for driving and flying as that's virtually miles easier with a controller. Normal combat is much easier with a keyboard and mouse as aiming is also miles easier with a mouse. Character development and personalization (cars your own character and your arsenal of weapons) is very abundant. They did not cut corners with customization this time. Controls are simple and easy to pick up if you've played a shooter on PC before so this should feel like home to you. StoryNow this is where GTA V excels there's so many details to this story that I seem to have missed the first time I originally played it on my old Xbox 360. The characters are extremely funny and the story progresses easily with main missions and short side missions. Rockstar found the perfect blend of side and main missions for this game it's smooth and enjoyable to progress through even for someone like me with a short attention span. Mod SupportI don't usually mod games but this is one that deserves some mods. Graphic quality is amazing out of the box but it can be improved through the use of mods. Weapons cars and airplanes etc. can all be added through mods aswell. It isn't too hard to mod the game but please don't ruin it for other players. Rockstar enjoys to bring down the banhammer when it comes to GTA Online. (Just a heads up) I've heard Rockstar is falsely banning people at the moment also so just play it safe until they get that under control. SummaryThis is overall one of my favorite GTA games Vice City used to own the throne but GTA V blows that game out of the water. I never expected so much depth and development but Rockstar knows how to please a guy like me. This is a very easy game to pick up and a hard one to put down.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-11,0,0,446,False,Recommended,"Mah mother's mah sisterQuick SummaryBuy it.Bit more detailAfter 2 years of postponement after postponement GTA V is finally available to the PC Master Race. Simply put it was worth waiting for.My main concern about this game pre release was that my laptop wouldn't be able to run it (8Gb RAM i7 GeForce 650m). However since release I have run this game at 720p with almost all other settings on high or ultra high and have not experienced frame rate drops. It seems building the PC version from scratch really worked this time around and therefore the 2 year delay was time well spent.Whilst it's difficult not to know what you're getting yourself in for with a GTA game these days such is the success and longevity of the series it is easy to underestimate the quality of Rockstar's work. That is until you've played GTA V. Nothing that I say can accurately describe the scale of this game right down to the level of detail. I have played on much larger maps in other games and found less than a thousandth of the things to do this truly is a monster game.Single player as you would expect of a GTA game is incredibly fun. I have clocked around 100 hours on the first play through and I'm still enjoying it. The replay value is also massive due to the variety in the missions and the chance to earn more and more money the next time round by tailoring the order of certain stock market missions for larger payouts etc. I really don't want to give too much away about the single player in this game or any of the missions in particular as this game is on a par with some great films when it comes to voice acting and story telling and you will be whooping with excitement at points! I should however point out that driving has been vastly improved since GTA IV and this has really added to the enjoyment of it all. The real magnum opus of this game however is GTA Online...GTA Online is essentially a stand alone game which takes the game we have known and loved since GTA III added a ridiculous level of detail and made it into an MMO game. There are very occasionally teething problems with connecting to friends due to the lack of a true ""party"" system however this has improved immeasurably since the game was released and I fully expect this trend to continue in the coming weeks and months.Within GTA Online is the usual ""freemode"" (wandering buying and customising cars visiting Ammu Nation killing randoms etc. akin to Single Player mode) along with a wide variety of ""jobs"" accessible from your phone and the start menu. These jobs include land/sea/air races heists parachuting survival modes missions darts golf tennis and deathmatches to name but a few and serve both as the primary way of making money and levelling up. With so much variety available it is feasibly possible to sit for 14 straight hours without realising it (trust me!). The craziest thing is that each of these ""jobs"" could feasibly be sold as a separate game the golf is better than the most recent Tiger Woods offering from EA the racing is more fun than anything I've played since Burnout and the heists are literally what every GTA fan has been waiting for since that mission in GTA IV!Overall it is way too early for me to say that this is my favourite game ever. But without a shadow of a doubt I think it is the best made.10/10",Grand Theft Auto V

R* failed to pick a side between their legitamate cutomer base playing fair and a bunch or cringy modders who roleplay in order to escape the pathetic sweaty reality.

Many like me will let gta5 be the last R* product they ever purchase because R* is just another greedy video game company gutted from the inside by corparatists trying to devalue the integrity of their product and sell en mass.

Gun menue you can open your gun wheel while game is on slow motion which means it's slight more easier to choose your gun except in multiplayer you don't have the slow motion but the gun wheel menue is way easier then just pressing the ""next weapon"" button to scroll between guns trying to find the one you want. The Shooting Mechanics controlling your sight is a lot easier in the new game ESPECIALLY if you're using controller it's just lot softer not too slow or not too fast Character's Special Abilities now it's a little bit odd to have a character being able to slow time but it is a little helpful to the un skilled new players. Driving not too many changes but the driving mechanic is great and all but shooting while driving is a really hard thing mostly in single player so i think rockstar should've added a aim assisstance while driving a vehicle.Realism well GTA always was a game trying to simulate a criminal's life it can even be called ""the crime simulator"" so having realism will make the game much better and fun but having characters changing their clothes between switches is really annoying like i put time to choose the clothes for example trevor and when i do a mission as franklin when i switch back to travor i see him in the deserts of Los Santos wearing a female dress so i think they should fix that.GRAPHICSthe graphics are great whether if it's the PC version or the consoles it's still great and it's enjoyable. so a TINK on that one cause you got it right.CHARACTERS &amp PERSONALITIESthe characters are interesting with interesting personalities michael a white retired thief who is trying to live a happy life franklin a slightly sterotypical african american thug who is trying to make a few bucks for living and trevor a white mentally disordered bi sexual who is insane and psychopathic and enjoys murder and causing chaos and violance there's other characters but they're not worth your and my time so far these 3 are different characters with different personalities to eachother and probably different from all of the other character in the trilogy (if the games take place in the same universe).MULTI PLAYERWell at first it was a mess in console and every one f*cking hated it after 3 years releasing the PC version had no problem... except one thing the character you make sometimes appears with weird black lines on his body and his pants or legs in order to fix this however is to download an Nvidia app (soonly will add its full name) that fixes the textures of games and you're good to go but in general the multi player is fun especially if you're playing with your friends though they're lots of D ouchies that kill you for no reason but you can still have fun there's more clothes for the characters then single player you get to play as your own character lots and lots of heist missions cars houses side missions like PvP and etc. there's also this ranking up mechanic that each job you do or each store that you rob gives you RP (Rankup Points) and if you get the maximum mount of the RP of that level you level up to a new title like ""thug"" or ""heister"" and etc each level you pass and new title you earn unlocks you new cars new missions new gun skins / modification and the guns themselve's body armor clothes and etc. making money in this multiplayer is a little bit hard and cheating will result in players getting banned your best bet is rather keep playing till you make lots of cash or buy cards from the online stores for real money to give you GTA money. you cannot use the website on the your phone like single player trading is only availible in Single Player mode and as a personal recemmendation do not download ""cheat hacks"" that some say it will give you infinite money or whatever in the game those are most virus or other programs they are mostly trolls if there is any real program that will hack the game rockstar removes it such as they did to videos in youtube that teached how to use glitches to earn money so if you find a video claiming it's a real hack don't download or do incase you don't care if it's virus and you really want to try it bad. you do you.Finally it's time to give this game a score it was a great game good gameplay but they released the game too late for the PC version when they announced GTA 6 which is why i give this game 9/10 and a BADASS badge seal of a proval rockstar i gotta tell you you did a great job at this and i say it's worth your money and i hope they add new dlc for like more clothing more cars more guns and haircuts and all that so rockstar don't let the game just die and keep it up with some good old DLC. thanks to you who read this and i hope you like the game too.Bye Rose",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-17,4,13,135,False,Recommended,To start off this wonderful review id like to remind you to MAKE SURE YOURE LOGGED INTO THE CORRECT ROCKSTAR ACCOUNT IF YOURE TRANSFERRING FROM CONSOLE. Dont do what I did and have to restart my online character all over again.But to cut to the chase Grand Theft Auto 5 is a beautiful open world 3rd/1st person shooter filled with drugs dead hookers robbing granny's of their cars and even more dead hookers. GTA V is the next segment in the GTA franchise after GTA IV which could be called a great game by some but also could be called missed potential by others. But one thing is for sure if you're a GTA veteran or you're brand new to the series I absolutely believe that this game with be an instant favorite/top game in your steam library.GTA V takes place in the glamorous city of Los Santos (Los Angeles if you wanna be all realistic and a city full of life money dreams crushed dreams and happiness. you follow the story of a retired criminal a young repo driver wanting more in life than being bossed around and the psychotic yet loving and emotional CEO of Trevor Phillips Enterprises. Follow the odd trio as they make the city their and fill their pockets as they do so. GTA V introduces a new multiplayer experience with GTA Online where you create your own unique criminal and shed havok on the streets waters and the air of Los Santos with your friends all while being killed by a 12 year old that no lifed the game in a tank. Rise up the ranks in your crew and spend hours grinding missions for cash that you'll end up blowing out your in the click of a button.Pros Very well optimized Hours of fun gameplay Free add on updates oftenCons All I can think of is other players colored cars in Online.So what the hell are you still reading for?

2015-07-09,0,0,449,False,Not Recommended,This is a HEAVILY chopped down review if you want my full thoughts click here https //www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/3cqffc/an_in_depth_grand_theft_auto_v_reviewrant/After over 300 hours of gameplay. I think I can give this beast a proper review. Since IV is my beloved in the franchise and the previous major installment a lot of my comparisons will be between the gameplay of GTA IV and GTA V. Is that biased? Very. So take this with a grain of salt from a IV fanboy.GTA V is a great sandbox game but when you compare it to the previous iterations of the GTA franchise it feels as if something was left behind. There s so much to cover in this game I think I ll go bullet point by bullet point in order to better organise my ramblings. I will be covering the three core gameplay mechanics of every GTA game. Driving combat and story. I will also be talking about the multiplayer since that was where a majority of my time was spent.(If you want a quick summery skip to the bottom of this review) DRIVING At the core of every GTA game is surprise driving. And man does GTA V really improve on driving. Cars have much better handling compared to IV Vice City and SA. GTA IV always had slippery cars that took quite a while to learn. GTA V improves upon this with better breaking tighter controls and more realistic handling. There s even some nice attention to detail when it comes to driving. Car statistics double clutch acceleration working internal gauges fuel that drains if the gas can is breached and more. The driving has improved so much there are racing crews and communities within the game. So hats off to you Rockstar.However a lot of their statistics are hidden in the game s code. The game records four vague stats about every vehicle in the game. Top speed Acceleration Braking and Handling. These stats are completely not indicative of the real performance of cars since there s so much more going on under the hood and some stats flat out lie. For instance the Bravado Gauntlet muscle car completely beats the Vapid Dominator in terms of stats having significantly better Speed and Acceleration. Yet the Vapid Dominator is one of the best muscle cars in the game. Why? Because the stats don t take into consideration torque wheel traction weight durability oversteer and understeer horsepower and so much more. COMBAT Combat in GTA V sucks plain and simple. So if you don t want to hear me whine about it feel free to skip ahead to the story and mark that as my opinion. GTA has always had clumsy melee systems but at least IV s system was functional albeit awkward. This however is a joke. If you go bare knuckle against someone you re in for one hell of a time. When you fight you spastically flail your fists and legs at the other person like you ve just taken muscle relaxers or suffer from spinal paralysis. You will brawl like none of the characters has ever clenched a fist before until someone falls down dead. For the controls there s a button specifically for your kicks however pressing the attack button (which there are two of that do the same attacks) will randomly intermix some of these weak shoves into your combo . Blocking is only really effective for using counters which is the only consistent way to look like you know what you re doing while knocking someone down. Guns are disappointing to say the least. Rockstar games aside from Max Payne 3 have always had good but not fantastic gunplay. The guns sound awful one even sounds less threatening than my airsoft gun. Fire rates on pistols and automatic weapons are also terrible. Pistols fire once every half second and the AK fires about as fast as a Civil War gatling gun. I must give props to the detailed animation work that went into reloading and firing but that cannot forgive the horrible feel of the weapons. Not only the the guns limp to fire but shooting someone is equally disappointing. In GTA V when you shoot almost anyone they immediately flop to the ground like a dead fish sporting almost no animation. In actuality they have a lot more health left so half of the gunplay is you shooting at bodies already on the ground trying to finish them off.Health is another major issue that GTA V has. GTA V switches all of this up for the worst. Your health regenerates slowly if you are standing still in cover or driving up to half of your health bar. Let s just take a moment to absorb how annoying that is. I can understand regenerating fully or regenerating a little so you don t die an embarrassing death to stubbing your toe but half? On top of this you die. Fast. And to make matters worse enemies are deadly accurate. All enemies with all weapons in all situation. I cannot tell you how many times I have been hit from an untrained two bit thug blind firing a pistol with one hand from several meters away. If you thought random shotgun cops in GTA IV was bad imagine that as the entire combat experience. STORY GTA V takes a bold step in a new direction by introducing three unique characters at the same time that you can freely switch between. This is quite a cool idea but unfortunately none of them are quite as memorable because of it. Michael is bitter Franklin is fed up and Trevor is crazy. I want to love these characters so much more than I do since the actors give such great performances and the writing is spot on. But splitting the story among three characters while keeping the game length the same means they re much more shallow. The connections between the main and side characters are less significant and as a whole our protagonists feel like the one dimensional pieces of a better character. Michael is the most relatable character among the three having a family you interact with frequently. His backstory is fleshed out the most having history and revealing that he did things to get out of his life of crime for his family. Franklin might as well not exist in the story. He s a pawn throughout the entire thing following the orders of someone else and never taking things into his own hands. He really could have been replaced by anyone. Hell Lamar is a significantly more interesting character because he did dumb things on his own. Not to mention having hilarious writing. I guess Franklin is supposed to be the player more of a blank slate that you can identify with. Trevor good god Trevor. Trevor got the best writing the best performance the zaniest missions the most unique characteristics and does everything for himself. But he s a bit too much he doesn t really have a side you can identify with as human. In fact the game goes out of the way by making him feel entirely inhuman. When we re introduced to him he confronts and kills a character that you played as in a previous GTA game. I was this character I learned about him fought through his struggles and came to love him. Seeing Trevor kill him without any sort of ceremony sucked. It hampered my ability to love Trevor. CONCLUSION I ve enjoyed my time in GTA V. Don t get me wrong despite my griping it s a fun open world sandbox and it s done well. But after dealing with it s major to minor issues for 300+ hours I ve had enough. This is where GTA V and I depart. Overall I cannot recommend this game. I felt like I ve had more of a negative experience coming out of this game than coming in. There s so much more I could talk about but I ve already outstayed my welcome and probably off a few people along the way. This rambling wasn t to complain about a product or on people who enjoy it but rather to show people that it isn t a groundbreaking flawless game like the Metacritic score may suggest. It has its faults some rather large ones and GTA V doesn t do anything better than previous installments can do. Which is why this gets my thumbs down.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-03,4,4,710,False,Not Recommended,"2 of of 5 stars the game is awesome single player and multiplayer but flying is just plain terrible and the lessons the game tries to use to teach you how to fly are completely useless. Other problems include a massive number of hackers in the online mode automated systems sometimes take forever to pick up your call and other times never connect and the worst fkn problem of all the loading times. To do anything to join a lobby to leave a lobby to start an activity to do any fkn thing it takes 30 seconds minimum for the game to load it. And the game launch takes nearly 10 minutes to load and this is on a Samsumg 850 evo SSD. The game is poorly optimized that can be the only cause. My CPU hits max 30% while loading my disk barely hits 1% I literally spend more time on loading screens than playing the game. And to top it off if you think you can alt tab away and do something elase in the meanwhile no can do the game doesn't load anything if it isnt on top. The only way I have found to bypass this is actually using windows 8's features of apps since desktop is it's own ""app"" the game then thinks it is still on top while I can browse chrome though the windows 8 mode. However chrome's windows 8 mode is limited as it doesn't have the full desktop capabilities so even that is a limited avenue. All in all great graphics but once again the big companies fail to spent proper time optimizing their code.Things to add people hack in gta online and they do it often some hackers do funny stuff others just spam kill you or decide to spawn objects to crash your game This is expected what is not expect is rockstar's way to reporting people. You have to pull up your cellphone and then there is no option for any of the ways people hack listed above... On top of that while you used to be able to just go into passive mode to report hackers guess what you can't do that anymore in while you are in an organization so have fun dying over and over again.More things to add I've seen more hackers in this game than I've seen in the division and this new DLC (the Felony one) adds the ability to waste your money with the goal of slowly gaining it back if you are lucky or if you are unlucky like me the method for selling the cargo you spend ages gathering protecting and then finally selling ends up glitched and you lose all the money and time you spent on it. I thought the game couldn't convince me even more to not spend any money on it via microtransactions. I was wrong...Even more things I don't know who they put in charge of determining key bindings but for the newest DLC all the key bindings have made no sense. Press esc to exit the gun safe seems logical until you realize that pressing esc opens up the main menu so now it opens up the main menu everytime I exit my gun safe. Also press &gt to drop a crate. Really I key in between the mouse and my other hand controlling WASD who the fk thought of that one and the stupid thing is that in the actual GTA V SP you press space to drop a crate for trevor's missions. That is infinately better why the fk did they change the key binding? Also for a game called ""grand theft auto"" a lot of people claim it's a misnomer since you can't really steal cars in online and keep them you have to buy all your expensive cars. However I think the name GTA actually stands for the fact that the story mission will steal every car away from you that you attempt to keep except for the character's ""main car"". If you get in a car switch to another character and switch back the first character's car is gone and they will be miles away. The fk is the point of buying cars on the SP if the game is just gonna steal them away as soon as you look away. No wonder why most people mod the SP game... Which brings me to the next issue GTA online banning for SP mods. Rockstar claims they don't do it but i'd be a little careful as they seem ban happy for hacking money into the game. If you hack and you don't spawn money don't crash lobbies but instead hack races deathmatches or anything else they don't care just don't hack money in and rockstar loses no money and that makes rockstar a happy company.edit it got worse now if rockstar's servers go down it doesnt matter if you spend hours trying to collect those stupid crates and then stress over flying them overwhile players from the free lobby chase you because rockstar can decide error data did not correctly match server money denied. I seriously give up on this game. Can't believe it but the divsion is now better than this game IMO",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-16,0,0,68,False,Not Recommended,I absolutely love this game. I own it on my XBox 360 and PC and I have loved every second I've spent playing it. On the PC version it is relatively easy to install single player mods so I downloaded and enjoyed the player menu mod (which I highly reccommend it lets you have even more fun messing with the game's great engine and world.) Earlier today a friend of mine asked me to play Online with him. Thinking this would be fun I went into my game's files and deleted the mod I had installed. After about an hour I was suddenly banned for the next 11 days without any stated reason. I can only assume this is because my GTA V files may still be manipulated somehow as I had not come close to doing anything interesting let alone something the game developers would consider cheating or dishonest. If not I have literally no way of knowing due to the fact that no indication of what i'd done wrong was shown to me. Great game but very poor moderation of the online service. I am extremely disappointed I won't be able to enjoy the online mode due to the overzealous ban hammer and complete lack of foresight in the developers' implimentation of control in the servers.,Grand Theft Auto V

But you're still likely to have an great/10 time with the online mode just dont be a complete to the other players and they wont start beating your down for being said .That's untill you get to the online heists then you'll start praying for patches to save you from the crashes and the bugs that can never let you win a mission sometimes and the automatic mission failures for the game disconnecting another team member and the freezing of the screen thats sometimes fixed by pressing alt+enter twice but not really and the prison heist thats an absolute long boring drawl that builts itself up as a squeaking mission but is just rambo guns blazing at the end without telling you and leaving one of your teammates with a pistol in the middle of a high security prison and the even worse connectivity issues and the issues where enemies can spontaniously go invisible and Jesus Christ I just wanted to have fun.

2015-04-15,5,83,30,False,Not Recommended,"Final edit It's still not a good deal to buy the game full price. GTA Online is a mess with tons of loading screens desynch issues and general issues. The singleplayer game runs fine looks good and is interesting story wise but is it worth 60 bucks ? I'm not convinced. The modding community is finally getting ""official support"" but I'm skeptic as to how long it will take before Rockstar actually does something to actually support modders other than ""not banning them"". Wait for a GOOD discount and for killer mods to come out. Rest of the review is older but left here for convenience.Crashes freezes stuttering memory leaks...The port isn't horrible. Far from it. But waiting two years two delays and seeing four versions for consoles come out anything that is worse than a ""great port"" is unnacceptable. We only have so much patience for one game. If you still have any wait for a patch.Edit 1 the Nvidia drivers that came through fixed most of the stuttering issues but the memory leaks and the random crashes still happen even though the game runs fine. Waiting is still the name of the game.Edit 2 23/04 still waiting for loadings improvements on GTA Online and still has random crashes associated to random actions. Game runs well and smooth though.Edit 3 7/05 there's been some improvements for some users and bug fixing for GTA Online. But there's been a lot of issues with modding with the latest patch basically killing mods altogether and forcing users to downgrade their game to keep enjoying custom content. There's been bans from the game altogether (Singleplayer and Multiplayer) because of FOV mods which is necessary to enjoy 1st person camera and not have a headache for some people.The whole affair is a mess and it's not a good incentive to spend money on the game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-16,1,9,3234,False,Recommended,"Now this is going to be a difficult kind of Review since it's basically two games in one GTA V and GTA Online. GTA V is despite it's number the 12th game of the series i played them all except Chinatown Wars and the GBC Version of GTA 1 i follow the series since it was first released in late 1997 and that makes it a bit difficult to truly give a thumbs up for the single player because GTA V is to put it bluntly the same old actually the same old if you also take in the other games that formula into account Bully and Red Dead Redemption which in itself are awesome games (RDR was one of two reasons for me to get an Xbox360 and i bought Bully twice on the PS2 in it's original version back then as well as the PC version) but if you follow the games you will see that they follow the same formula Cops and law enforcers are corrupt and will you over never trust anybody because you always meet somebody who turns from friend to foe missions always the same ""go there kill him"" formula and you might think after nearly 20 years Rockstar whatever studio it is might try to do spice things up. In GTA V's case the spicing is the Heists that evolved from GTA IV's Three Leaf Clover mission into full ""We plan you have two ways of doing it choose your crew and let's roll"" Heists that even put contemporary criminal games like Payday 2 or The Masterplan to shame in it's depth and thanks to the fact that now you not only play one character but three Meet Franklin Michael and Trevor who represent a ""Best of Rockstar Guys"" set Franklin is like CJ from GTA San Andreas the same token ghetto black guy who was a criminal tried to get away from that life just to be sucked back into it. Michael is a lot like Tommy Vercetti without the Prison stint a well known gangster who robbed stuff but sold out to the feds and lives in witness protection otherwise he is like Vercetti the moment he goes back into the life of crime. Trevor is a maniac who combines all the bad guys of Rockstar history yet is still presented in a positive light (otherwise evrybody would refuse to play as him)You would think now that 3 characters would open a whole new dimension for GTA like being able to choose one of 3 or have the missions where everybody is involved to go down different paths. That is sadly not the case. You have unique side quests for every character which are fun but in the main story quests you will be forced to play one specific character with no other choice or you're sem forced to switch to characters to survive the missions. To give examples without much of spoilers one of the more non story sidequests involve Franklink driving a sports car and challenge two other guys for an illegal street race. Trevor and Michael pose as Cops on Bike to take the two drivers down. It would've been interesting to play Michael or Trevor as cops chasing the high speed drivers down but instead you're forced to play as Franklin and only as hin driving in an underpowered car. Another example is one of the Heists where you're constantly forced to switch between characters to keep them alive and take down scripted targets. While this all is still the gameplay you expect from Rockstar you would think that after such a long time it would evolve and give the player more freedom.Also of note for the single player is that basically none of the online dlcs are released for it.Which lead me to GTA Online. While i played throug the story mode already in the Xbox360 release of GTA V i couldn't be bothered to pay a monthly fee to play online so i only started on the PC with the online mode and as my play time shows i wasted a ton of hours into it. You create your own character you start with some petty crimes after a small tutorial you rob a liquo store you kill some npcs and get their money to get into bigger things. The bigger things got delivered by Rockstar via free DLC. From contact missions which play like your usual GTA style missions to the Heists that are even more advanced than the single player heists to Races (with or without weapons in different car classes and thanks to custom options where players can create their own races with freedom even stunt races with ramps and loopings) and various co op (Survial) and PvP/Teambased/Handicap Events there is a lot to experience with strangers or friends. Speaking of strangers or friends you can join Crews or create a crew with your friends including designing a logo and defining crew colors. Another big aspect and probably also the most critisized one are the cars. There are tons of cars (around 200 i would guess) Cars available everything from the 1920's Gangster Car to the modern windtunnel designed super car in various classes. You can tune most you can enhance 11 more into lowriders (+ 1 into a donk now) with a lot of designs and elements to choose from but it will cost you a ridiculous sum which is the big critic point in GTA Online Everything is overpriced. Clothes and Accessoirces can range into 5 digits easily Lowriders cost over 1 million dollars. Apartments range from 200.000 to over 1 million and Yachts Helicopters Airplanes and Boats cost several millions of dollars. Grinding money takes a long time even w ith heists so the game has microtransactions in the form of Shark Cards but it has to be said that none of the vehicles are truly needed to have fun and even a 200.000 apartment enables you to start Heists. So it's not as evil as most other reviews make it sound like. Have some patience and see those expensive vehicles and apartments or the yacht as long term goal. The big warning of course is that Online is filled with Cheaters and Griefers who either kill you or drop money on you in hopes Rockstar bans you. In the few times i went into public lobbies i got blown up had cars spawned in my apartment had stuff spawned around me or otherwise experienced nasty things (i have screenshots of some of those experiences in my gallery here) but you can always go into a prive/invite lobby and enjoy the game there with no cheater ing you over so i don't count it as a negative after all all online games have cheaters and other lowlife scum too. Coming to the technical stuff Gameplay is the same as every Rockstar game. I'm kinda baffled that Helicopters and Planes still control as bad as they did in GTA San Andreas over 10 years ago. Cars got improved a lot over how they controlled in GTA IV where they floated around and crashing into walls was the norm. Graphics got improved a lot too over GTA IV. Los Santo is a lot more colorful than Liberty City that consisted of brown and grey. Audio is the same high standard you expect from Rockstar Great voice actors even some famous people mostly on the radio station and everybody gave their best. The Music always played a big role and plays a big role again with several songs being integrated in the cutscenes of the single player mode and the usual varied radio stations. PC also has the nice advantage of allowing you to use your own music (i would recommend anything but the Radio mode because you will hear the same ""your taste sucks"" ""this song made me nearly kill myself"" ""you pirated the songs fom the internet"" comments over and over and they aren't even funny the firs time around)So yes GTA V Single Player is disappointing if you played the previous GTA or other Rockstar games because it's just the same old stuff . New playes though certainly will enjoy it because it might be the best GTA (Vice City is my personal favourite but even i have to admit that after nearly 14 yeras it shows it's age) and GTA Online is a ton of fun if you have a couple friends on board to play it with you.",Grand Theft Auto V

This game has a storyline of course but not something that would make an impact. The GTA series always been praised for its Open World fun gameplay. GTA 5 is the best example of it. They put a story to keep the game going. That doesn't mean the story missions weren't fun. Almost every missions were different from each other there was nothing wrong with the gameplay. Some of the missions were extremely fun &amp exciting. There is actually nothing special to talk about storyline. You got 3 playable charecters &amp they're mainly crime partners. The huge open world of this game was mindblowing. It has almost every content of a open world game. I've nothing to complain about the gameplay at all. Even it's mainly the gameplay &amp rich open world elements which earned GTA 5 all the fame! Graphics &amp Optimization Playing the game in 2019 without any kind of Graphics mods I still feel this game has nothing less to offer than a recently released AAA title in terms of Grpahics. Very few PC games I experienced which has a top level optimization like this one. Thanks goes to Rockstar &amp their whole team for making such an effort! Beware of the countryside of the map if you put the grass quality higher than normal... because the grass quality wasn't properly optimized which might cause you a huge FPS loss.DLCs or Expansions I wouldn't recommend to purchase any DLC if you pruchased the base game already. But if you haven't then you must go for the ""Grand Theft Auto V Premium Online Edition"". This edition is really worth it even if you don't play the GTA ONLINE so often.Verdict Despite all the negative reviews this game is one of the best games on steam right now as we all know. Honestly I've nothing to complain about this game. This is the game which made people to build PCs to have a open world gaming taste this is the game which introduced ""Steam"" to thousands of gamer. If you haven't got this legendary game in your library already then get it as soon as possible. )",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-21,15,14,1508,False,Recommended,The Fall of Constantinople was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21 year old Mehmed the Conqueror the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53 day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453.The capture of Constantinople (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the Roman Empire an imperial state that had lasted for nearly 1 500 years. The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to Christendom as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear. After the conquest Sultan Mehmed II transferred the capital of the Ottoman Empire from Edirne to Constantinople.The conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire was a key event in the Late Middle Ages which also marks for some historians the end of the Middle Ages.Constantinople had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. In the following eleven centuries the city had been besieged many times but was captured only once during the Fourth Crusade in 1204.The crusaders established an unstable Latin state in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states notably Nicaea Epirus and Trebizond.

2015-05-10,0,0,472,False,Recommended,By far the best GTA so far. Singleplayer has a great story line from what I have played and a lot of features that aren't in the multiplayer but the multiplayer also has features the singleplayer doesn't so it balances itself. At almost the 100 hr mark. I've spent I would say about 80% of it in online. It has got to be my favorite. The heists are great if you can get 4 decent people together and I haven't encountered many trolls except in races. Buying 10 car garages and filling them with custom cars is my hobby. There are a lot of cars all with different mods and some more than others. Some have to be stolen and some have to be bought. Grinding money can be tedious if you can't get 4 people together the regular jobs and knocking off corner stores don't pay that much and doing them alone can be risky sometimes. All in all the Multiplayer is great if you got people to play with. As for Singleplayer I can't really say too much about it since I haven't really played much of it. I do recommend the game to anyone looking for fun online for sure though.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-15,3,5,3407,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Grand Theft Auto V is a game set within the fictional state of San Andreas which is based on Southern California and its developers has done a great job of replicating real world locations. The game is very well optimized as well compared to the previous title Grand Theft Auto IV which was such a disastrous game to run.The gameplay is quite fast paced gunplay feels fun and satisfying. Driving in this game stroke a minor controversy as it felt a bit too 'casual' compared to the previous major installment GTA 4. The graphics are phenomenal for an open world game and the level of detail in the world is incredible and the city feels very lively with a variety of NPC pedestrians scattered across the map . The story is fun and well written. There are three led protagonists throughout single player and players can switch between them. Each of every mission in the game's story mode is unique so they don't feel very repetitive. When the story is over there really isn't much left to do however there are a number of activities in which you can engage in single player such as racing hanging out with your friends hunting down the wild life and playing sports but they're not as fun as they ought to be. GTA Online is probably the main reason why people get this game but in my opinion it barely has any redeeming qualities and I don't know why people are buying the game just for this. Firstly the concept of playing around in a huge open world with friends just simply sounds fun and it actually is surprisingly. There are a couple of things you can play in Online mode missions heists races and adversary mode which has a variety of game modes. But that's pretty much about it for the fun aspects of Online now for the cons. Online is very very grindy and is just pretty repetitive overall. Let's just say that you have a wish to buy a vehicle that costs around 2 million dollars (just a reference) which is pretty easy to get in single player but it's different Online. You will have to repeatedly do the same missions / heists / works over and over until you get enough money and by the time you get the vehicle you will feel a sense of satisfaction for a short while until you find another vehicle you want to get. Sure there are micro transactions called shark cards which add money into your character but for the price it's not worth it at all. Another negative of the Online mode is hackers they ruin the fun of the game and makes it worse especially when the game itself isn't much fun.To sum it up I think the game is pretty good especially the single player campaign but I do not think that it is worth spending $60 USD just for it and the multiplayer is trash in my opinion but do buy this on a sale if you have money to spare.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-04,1,5,35,False,Not Recommended,"In the beginning of the release for GTA V it was awesome and had a good run for storyline. However the Multiplayer Online is not really good because of many cheaters and trolling that have over Rank Level 100 than you for the first time being you've encounter for joining random server and may have a chance to kill you just to lose your role style life and GTA money waste.I've also noticed that you can use ""mods"" to have fun and do silly stuff before but apparently TakeTwo has control power to ban your Rockstar Account if any attempt is being used for OpenIV Mod Tool in Singleplayer. What a way to ruin the game.Although I have never use mods before but from what I heard don't ever trust the Video Game Company who are changing the major rules and have the rights to do whatever they want without listening the community feedback.I would only recommend if you're much interested for playing Singleplayer to follow the storyline without using mods to avoid the ban but I don't recommend to play for Multiplayer Online as it gets boring for few hours nearly impossible to earn GTA money unless you insist to buy Shark Cash Cards to earn it faster and being annihilate by cheaters or higher Rank Level.",Grand Theft Auto V

The story is good the characters are lovable to fans game mechanics are nice close to perfect. Being allowed to mod in singleplayer is the icing on the cake for this game. MULTIPLAYER Multiplayer. Now here's where we take a downward spiral. In GTA Online it is very hard and very tideous to advance your character/experience and gain money. Many people modded multiplayer in an intent to help players and make the game fun for everyone even agaisnt Rockstars' permission. The old way of dealing with modders was perfect. Just ban them. But now T2 Interactive (The publishers) have actually made modding illegal and you can get into some serious trouble with the law for doing it. I think they have taken it a little bit too far on how they deal with modders now. Its like Microsoft saying ""You hacked on Minecraft multiplayer??? Time to sue you for violating our rules."" It just doesn't make sense. Why should you be banned for violating rules in an ONLINE community.And finally the shark cards. Shark Cards are essentially pre paid cards you get money from them. Now the problem with the Shark Cards is that they are WAY too overpriced for their value. For example I don't know one person who would pay $20 CAD for $1.25 million in game currency. It's just too overkill for many people and only the rich can succeed in this game. MY RATING Until something changes I am going to rate this game poorly. For now...",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-15,0,0,379,False,Not Recommended,"So I have to give this game a negative review on the grounds of ""Keep your stupid dirty Microtransactions out of a game you made us buy more than once at $60""The singleplayer is good. Amazing even. The story while filled with usual tropes and cliches keeps you engaged because of the colorful characters. The story the side missions all great and filled with the over the top satire we've come to love in GTA games. And this was said about the game for YEARS now.But as of writing this review Singleplayer has been abandoned. Expecting awesome spin off stories like Ballad of Gay Tony? Too bad. There's no long term money in that. Singleplayer DLC was completely abandoned in exchange for pushing out Multiplayer Only vehicles at prices so high only hackers fee to players and people with the patience of Mother Teresa can have them. To make it worse Rockstar has consistantly made it harder to earn large amount of money resorting to the extensive ""Grind"" culture that runs rampant in Free To Play games and now Fee To Play games. Don't even expect new heists the whole original idea that made GTA 5 a great title. Instead we are now being given gamemodes akin to Halo 3 custom gametypes. Gimmicks to make the people think they're getting fresh content.Grand Theft Auto 5's motives are simple. Buy Shark Cards or stop playing this game. There's no more fun to be had. Free Roam lobbies are filled with Hackers even though Take Two tried to take a hard stance against it... by banning singleplayer modding. Rockstar got that call reversed but it was a clear message to the community. ""If you want to play with the new cars you will play the multiplayer and we will dangle Shark Cards in your face as you attempt the Bank Heist for the 70th time hoping to make off with at least 2% of the money you actually need to buy anything.""It's sad. It really is sad. We can expect the same for Red Dead Redemption if not worse.

And the problems now are just too much to make the game any fun anymore.For starters Every. Single. Lobby. has hackers in it I don't just mean that you see them everyone once in a while or they kill you once or twice No I mean you litterally cannot walk more than 2 feet without being randomly blown up by a hacker. Its a huge problem. Almost every lobby not even kidding.Second its just the way they cram shark cards down your throat. I understand that games like this games with free updates need some kind of sustain so they can keep paying people to keep producing updates but its honestly rediculous you pretty much have 2 options grind for hours trying to get the one thing you want or buy it with real money now I don't mind expensive things and money being that hard to get what good is having expensive items if anybody can do a couple missions and get them? It just seems like rockstar is doing it intentionally to get you to buy cards. It's absolutely rediculous. Its at a point where I can't reccomend this game anymore.I hope to one day change this review.,Grand Theft Auto V

When Steam's Summer Sale first began the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30 but it was only at that price for roughly 10 20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale which as countless others have stated is shady business. I'm not mad that the base game isn't on sale it's their right as a company to not have to put it on sale. I'm just mad that they would use the aforementioned tactics.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-21,1,5,91,False,Not Recommended,This game is pretty much a big money grinding game to the point that by the time you finally buy that overpriced ing car all you want to do is never play the game again. The only time i play now is when new cars come out and i just sell all my old cars for a price and get one or two of the new ones and stop playing until next update. Not only that but for what ever reason i apparently have a memory leak (only in this game) which pretty much means i cant drive a car any faster than like 10mph and i drop from 75fps to like 5 and i have to stop driving. The game recommends me high everything yet it still goes to like 5 fps when driving. Turned everything down and im using less than half of my gpu power and it still lags. I guess if you dont have this problem and you enjoy farming the same boring missions over and over to get one mid end car then enjoy.

The fact that so many people who enjoy your game for what it is and plays it how you've made it get falsely banned for someone elses actions is Very Very . This is the second time on PC that i've been banned due to the amount of unwanted money spawned ontop of me or my car while hanging out in Online Lobbies doing CEO MC Stuff like that. Ive contacted Rockstar about it before to have them remove the money and Fix the changes people have made. Their response? Banned. Thank you for a great game made horrible with your lack of anticheat. Falsely Banning people and taking their money shouldnt be a thing.So as this stands. If you are going to buy Grand Theft Auto 5.

You also tend to see the 'loading clouds' very very often.Second the crashes the game is crashing very often (mainly when you almost finish a heist mission) apparently because it have eaten all the RAM available and that makes the graphic drivers crash (it get from 3 GB of RAM used after 5 minutes of gameplay to around 5 6 GB after some times it is obviously leaking memory somewhere).Third getting other players to play an online heist is a nightmare matchmaking times up to half a hour are not uncommon and the people you get matched with are mostly dumbasses which can't help but prevent you from completing the mission (viewed from the point of view of someone that have completed multiple heist missions with 3 afk/waiting players). Also with the crash rates of the game actually completing this missions even with a decent squad is pretty hardcore. To put this in perspective it took me an entire night to complete 2 heist missions.You'll tell me ""Why are you not playing with your friend then?"" most haven't bought the game because it is expensive.Also there are a bunch of details that are really annoying it's eating half of my processor's cores at full power when alt tabbed (i7 5820K mind you) the R* social club is an annoying piece of that eat an amazing amount of ram for what it is doing (it is even beating skype at this) the physic wonkiness in multiplayer is sometimes annoying the controls are hit or miss depending on the thing controlled and sometimes get really wonky random afk kick times which kick you in unexpected situations etc...Now for the positive sides The game is beautiful the customization options are wonderful and the possibilities are enormous the gameplay is also more tactic than previous iterations of the serie which is both pleasant and unpleasant (it has some good sides and some bad sides you get killed more easily but the game is more tense and interesting and trade this for fun). The Online is a great addition to the serie as well and the way it is handled (excepting the issues mentionned earlier) is well thought. Also it is fun to play mostly when not caught in earlierly cited situations.Update 18/01/2018 Crashes happen a lot less often. Loading times still very long.

2018-05-11,1,5,351,False,Not Recommended,Information Technology refers to storing processing and transmitting information and is now one of the most important tools available to both organizations and individuals alike. According to the Maryland Department of Labor (2006) many industries and virtually all businesses are using information and information technology to operate more efficiently and productively. Individual consumers use information technology as well to gain knowledge exchange ideas and opinions and for entertainment and amusement (Maryland Department of Labor 2006 p.2).According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2016) Computer and Mathematical occupations in Baltimore make up 4.6 percent of the total employment compared to the national average of 3.0 percent and 7.3 percent of the total employment in the Washington area are in the same field.Most technology jobs in Maryland are concentrated in several major locations. These Information Technology jobs are diverse in their duties and skill level as they accommodate many different roles in organizations. According to the Maryland Department of Labor (2006) the major divisions of Information Technology are as follows IT Manufacturing and Distribution Computer and IT Services Information Technology Equipment Repair and MaintenanceThe Baltimore Washington Area A Hotspot for ITNorthern and central Maryland is an important hotspot in Information Technology. The headquarters for the National Security Agency Central Security Services United States Cyber Command and Defense Information Systems Agency are all located in this area. Several major companies such as General Dynamics are in central Maryland as well.Figure 1.0 illustrates the Maryland Department of Labor s (2006) average weekly wages in Central Maryland. Montgomery CountyMontgomery County which is neighboring the national capital contains a particularly large Information Technology community. According to the Maryland Department of Labor (2006) Montgomery County makes up 37 percent of the total employed Information Technology workers with 31 248 employees and an average weekly wage of $1 751 (p.12 13). Figure 1.1 represents the Maryland Department of Labor s (2006) breakdown of Employment and Wages in Information Technology. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017) the occupational group of computers and mathematics in the Washington Arlington Alexandria area has a mean hourly wage of $50.13 compared to the national average of $42.25. This significant difference between national and local averages are also present in the Baltimore area.Baltimore CityThe city of Baltimore is another major location for Information Technology and houses many large organizations such as Johns Hopkins Under Armor and McCormick. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017) the Baltimore Towson area employees in the computer and mathematical occupational group has a mean hourly wage of $45.98 compared to the $42.25 national average. Also the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017) mentions the note by their regional commissioner that after testing for statistical significance wages in the local area were significantly higher than their respective national averages in major occupational groups including computer and mathematical (p.1). The Baltimore area is also more accessible than its southern counterparts and area around Baltimore city is likely to cost far less than areas in and around Annapolis and Washington D.C.Major Divisions of Information TechnologyInformation Technology is a very expansive and diverse field. Technology jobs are as simple as computer repair and as complex as database design and maintenance. Because of this wide spectrum Information Technology can be effectively separated into several categories. Each of these categories focus on a specific aspect of Information Technology but all these categories must interact with each other to perform effectively in any organization.Product ManufacturingThe computer and electronic products manufacturing division according to Maryland Department of Labor (2006) includes all manufacturing jobs from computer and peripheral equipment manufacturing to magnetic and optical media fabrication. Network devices audio equipment and AV entertainment manufacturing also lies in this category.Wholesale DistributionWholesale distribution according to Maryland Department of Labor (2006) includes electronic wholesalers and business to business electronic markets. IT wholesale distributers include Best Buy Dell Hewlett Packard IBM and Lenovo. Business to business electronic markets are according to Maryland Department of Labor (2006) markets which use the internet or other electronic means to bring together buyers and sellers (for a commission or fee) to exchange all manner of goods (p.2). Amazon eBay Craigslist and Tiger direct are all electronic markets.Information Technology ServicesInformation technology services according to Maryland Department of Labor (2006) is comprised of software publishers and developers as well as support specialists ISPs search portals and hosting systems. Microsoft Google Verizon YouTube and Dropbox are all IT service companies. Computer Systems ServicesComputer systems services according to Maryland Department of Labor (2006) are contractors and experts who provide computer systems expertise and assist organizations in writing testing and supporting software to meet a client s needs (p.3). IBM s IT division TEKsystems and Boeing all fit into this category.Information Technology Repair and MaintenanceInformation technology equipment repair and maintenance according to Maryland Department of Labor (2006) is comprised of businesses that repair and maintain IT office equipment computers printers CD ROM drives and photocopying machines are among the devices maintained. (p.3). Best Buy s Geek Squad Computer Market Place and Tri State Computer Service are all companies that offer these services.ConclusionInformation Technology is an expansive and very profitable field. With many different jobs hundreds of companies and many different areas to live Information Technology is a very attractive path to follow especially in Maryland where jobs are plentiful and the best locations are spread out over a wide area. The Next StepAnybody who wishes to pursue a career in the field of Information Technology in Maryland can easily identify a job that falls in line with their criteria is located relatively close by and offers a wage far higher than the national average. Using job searching services such as the Baltimore Sun s Jobs search function would provide a large catalog of jobs available. Using these job search engines employment seekers can filter search results to include only the major locations in central Maryland to maximize the number of results of jobs with high wages.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-08,0,0,61,False,Not Recommended,"Underwhelmed. That's how I feel playing the game. Let's not talk about the occasional loading glitches (although they have costed some success the checkpoints are mostly generous). I am underwhelmed by the gameplay AND storytelling.First and foremost the writing is excellent. Characters are fleshed out fantastically and while I wouldn't like being friends with anyone of them (criminal maniacs aren't my social circle) watching a movie about them would be amazing. Speaking of the game is more of a movie than a game.The gameplay is scripted. Heavily scripted. I don't have to listen to anything in the cutscenes as mission markers handold me through every single step. The game even selects weapons for me. The game makes sure I don't fall behind the target I'm chasing the game makes sure I can't shoot the driver because in this mission my gun's disabled or the driver simply isn't a hit box the game goes so far as to control the steering and brakes of my bike to make sure I don't miss that important moment. It's too cinematic the missions are scripted heavily it doesn't feel like I'm playing a coherent game but just a series of scenes with different rules attached to each other via cutscenes. Some of the cutscenes are interactive. Way too often the game has way too much padding in form of driving from A to B with another character in my car or on the phone. The dialogs are great I give Rockstar that but they're too long too much. That's just busywork. Boring gameplay stretched to make room for more writing. Way too much fluff and not enough filler. But the fluff is great isn't it?Well no. The characters are excellent the story not so much. While there is sort of an encompassing story arch there are many non sequitur missions. Meaning that stuff just happens. Way too often STORY missions (I wouldn't bat an eye about this in side missions) start with a random ""You go there another character just happens to drop by and the mission starts"". No connection with what I the player just did. Or did previously. That ""Random things happen randomly around the protagonists"" would work great in a movie. A video game is interactive however I the player want the story proggress to be a result of my previous actions. This non sequitur writing diminishes the player's achievement by implying ""Whatever you just did the next step in the story sort of would have happened anyway"". Well of course not the scripts says so.Too much scripting too obvious breaking of game rules for the sake of the script too much script alltogether. I wouldn't have bought this game had I known that the ""open"" part of ""open world"" is just windowdressing. I've never been to an Ammu Nation except once because the missions' outfit me with everything. Again scripts.Ah yeah there are the side activities sure. Too bad they aren't overall enjoyable. Tennis &amp golf were way more fun on the Wii paragliding was more fun in Saints Row meeting the occasional freak ranges from ""fun but again too much padding to fit dialog in"" to ""forced"". Why should I go hunt for mortgage signs from my freak's competitor? Ah right it's a video game with video gamey open world activities scattered over the place to give completionists a couple things more to do.The online part is grinding at it's best. Heists are fun most of everything else isn't as it's just busywork with the progress being the one and only reward. Hey I have all my perks maxed out in Killing Floor 2 yet I play the game regularly. Why? Because the gameplay's amazing. Not so much in GTA Online.All in all not a bad game but I expected more from what's supposed to be among the best games of the recent years.",Grand Theft Auto V

Your ability to make basic amounts of money is massively gimped in an effort to push microtransactions (In a AAA $60 game) and outside organised events the game is just one massive grindfest. It takes hours upon hours of grinding to be able to purchase a single decent car let alone these ""wonder weapons"" they shoehorn in every single update. This is not a practice I can or ever will support in a full price game and I am disgusted by the corporate greed Rockstar has given into here.On top of this the latest ""heist"" is just a series of missions essentially advertising the new vehicles filled with bullet spongey enemies (The new Juggernaut enemy is one of the worst I've ever seen in a videogame) and monotonous dialogue and cutscenes that consistently fall flat.The cherry on top of the garbage sundae is the loading screens... Every single time the game transitions from one part to another you will experience a loading time of 2 10 minutes for absolutely no discernible reason. This is an issue I've had from day one that everyone experiences and Rockstar absolutely refuses to address for some reason. It's been proven with mods that it can be sped up and fixed so the only explanation I can come up with is to prevent players from making too much money too quickly and if that is the case this game is much much worse than I thought.The only positive I have to write about GTA online is that it can be a fun experience if you can muster 6 8 people and put some races/derby together.However as of writing the game is little more than a corporate cash grab.

(OLD REVIEW TL DR)The singleplayer is ok but at the end I have the feeling you are just wasting time to get more money to unlock everything which doesn't feel special to me. So I gave up on that.Multiplayer/online sigh it is unbelievable bad in several ways. Loading times are quite long especially if you are trying to do a mission and somehow you are kicked out or the host left and your game loads the world again. Then you need to load the mission again and so on and on... I am using high end hardware but that doesn't speed up those loading screens much. One of the worst loading times to be honest.More about online gameplay If you have a peaceful server it can be ok and fun but most of the times you find some modders/cheaters in it spawning 1000's of exploding objects and vehicles in a place so the whole game lags. Or they fly around in cars blow you and everyone up with invisible bombs taking you out of control burn you with fire and you cannot move compete in challenges and uses cheats to be first instantly. These are the things I saw and remembered. I bought this game and enjoyed it a little but I really don't have any motivation left to play it again now (which means something is ruining it). Maybe I will try again later but there are so many other games which are cheaper and more enjoyable for me.

Especially the random framerate drops that R* claimed to have been fixed. Key word ""CLAIMED"".From 60 I randomly drop to 15. I don't even.To whoever wrote the storyline......You're an idiot. Quit snorting cocaine and getting drunk before going to work.The story is not bad but from a GTA I expected better. You had one job. Make the story as good as GTA IV's and you failed.There's 3 main characters. An idea that R* North has been thinking about while working on GTA San Andreas but never made it into production because of console limitations.Micheal The average rich nobody that no one would care about if he dies.Trevor A crazy canadian drug dealer that lives in a trailer park full of racist americans and bikers. I wonder how is he still alive.Franklin The guy that shouldn't be in the game at all. He's just there to remind us of GTA SA. To remind us how good that game was compared to this rubbish.Let's talk Online now.The online just gets worse day after day.Awful community boring missions stupidly overpriced DLC stuff (DLCs are free but the stuff you have to buy in game ain't) just so you either buy shark cards or grind the same mission over and over again for 10 hours to get 1% of what you need.Back to the missions they're very repetitive. Explode IV? Why the do you need 4 of the same mission!?Also the average heist people who don't have enough friends online do 1) Wait 1 full hour before someone joins your heist setup/finale.2) While getting to the objective you have to steal/kill everyone is ramming each other for no reason causing a flamewar in the chat usually.3) Kill everyone. Steal vehicle/thing.4) Go back home while the lobby lags to hell.Connection issues.This is going to be a long one.You can't have a 65Gb game not server based. It's just stupid.Yet Rocktwat went crazy snorted some cocaine and decided to make it lobby based like CoD.GTA already can't handle 20 players why would you raise it to 30 claiming ""only da new mlg consolez and ee can handle dat stuff"" if it's mostly based on your connection?I really want to know what happened when R* decided to do it that way.And then there's the online transaction system. And boy let me tell you does it suck donkey balls.First off there's a fun little thing you can do to get banned. Bank more than 50.000GTA$ in an hour and your account will be flagged for revision because... Who knows. And although it wasn't even your fault maybe you got the money from a modder unknown to you or even in a legit way (by grinding the same mission over and over again) you can get in trouble for that.Another fun thing.Apparently sending a couple of bits to the Rockstar Cloud bits that say how much money you deposited or withdrawn may disconnect you from GTA O if it fails to upload. What even.Online modders.Not every single modder in the world is a bad guy tar. Some of them are nice people that bring some variety to an otherwise boring gameplay.Like flying in a yellow bus from one side of the map to the other.And I love the guys who give out money. Not because I can buy everything I want but because it's a big "" you"" to your micro transaction Now I know you're all wondering ""HD why are you saying modders shouldn't be banned? How do they know someone's a good modder or a bad modder?""Why that's easy my friend. Just look at the god damn kill counts and get actual PROOF before taking action like videos of a modder purposely exploding everyone. You know like people in a civilized world do. They piece togheter evidence indict them and then process them.Maybe Scotland isn't civilized at all but at least try.The conclusions.Would I recomend this game?

They never hooked me coming off as giant sandboxes with nothing to do that was interesting aside from blowing things up.GTA V is easily on my top 25 games of all time list. It's everything all the previous GTA and SR games lacked for me plot perspective and scope. If you enjoy heist movies at all this is the game for you. By having three main characters it feels like you're observing this grand plot rather than being the silent protagonist that most games put you in the role of which is part of the reason I disliked previous GTA games. It also allows for great variations in side quests and how you view the main quest. The size of the game is amazing. Not just in map size but in how it spans the areas of the map and the plot points between them. Again if you like heist movies books or anything else this delivers on all points. The setup the execution the over the top scenarios. This is without even mentioning that the first person perspective makes it so much easier for folks who enjoy FPS's to play the game (at least the shooty parts) the ability to mod it how freaking beautiful it looks maxed out the fact the VORPX mod makes it feel amazing in VR etc. Just buy the game already.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar is only so enforcing because they want people to A) grind their asses off for money in repetitive game modes and the same heist over and over which leads many to people to B) Buy their con artist F2P market inspired money cards.I stopped playing GTA MP originally because of the grind which is up there with many F2P games. of course F2P games its tolerable because.. its free. I expected more from... oh wait I really didn't expect anything from the delay and ovehrype masters. Despite it all i would pay 60 dollars just in interest of getting the excellent mods that even now are leaking through Rockstar's little dam. But of course I cant play with my friends if I get even the SP only mods.for now this game is a 4/10 because the repetitive grind that DOES NOT belong in this game franchise and their awful stance on modding.,Grand Theft Auto V

You got hackers and Rockstar killing the fun with all of the unnecessary bans and that includes the poisonous Microtransactions. The single player experience is where it's at. But that's not why I'm thumbing this down.IT HAS ONLINE DRM REQUIREMENT BY ROCKSTAR TO PLAY IT'S OFFLINE MODE!!! This is exactly like Sonic Mania only I didn't know but why is Rockstar locking down this version with a Social Club login to play it's OFFLINE SINGLE PLAYER?! Are these big game companies seriously try to downplay and aggrevate PC gaming community with slimmy stunts like DRM shotty ports lacking support delays and such? If so then WTH am I doing here in Steam?

It'll take you MANY tries to pass even the easiest ones since all 4 players (public lobbies have no idea what to do/how to play) must survive the mission and be flawless. I've done entire missions only to fail since the jet landing wasn't perfect.Rockstar is making B I L L I O N S selling their fake money for your real money. Shark Cards should be illegal.

I don't know has this gotten any better but I'm certain that it isn't which obviously defeats whole online mode's main points.In the end I was also one of them who received a 30 days ban and character removal for spending time with this whole farce even whilst I've never modded nor used any tools in single player or online.And now the news tell that Take Two &amp Rockstar are deliberately killing even the single player mode by decapitating the faithful modding scene which have been working on to keep the GTA's living and breathing since these games have been a thing there is not a single reason to ""support"" this kind of behaviour by any means.

Rockstar is Very Strict online with there Rules of Conduct but thats made up for with a great community watching other players get perma bans for small and stupid things make you behave. (Kind of a Plus and Minus) The Majority of players in GTA Online Dont Speak English so the chat is just squares or foreign language Because of the Extreme Diversity of the game and little people using english it will be very hard for people that speak enlisgh to play online and interact. Despite How Gigantic San Andreas is There can only be a max of 30 players in a single online session The Disk Space Required for this game is a Woping 64 Gigabytes. Took me an entire week 7 days to download this game with 2 Megabytes Per Second Speed. Attemping to use Mods Online will Result in Perma Ban When you get Perma Banned Rockstar Bans your CD Key So you cant just make a new account and start over.

Perma Bans Duration Ranges from 18 years to 350 Years and nobody wants to be banned from gta online or really anything at all!

This game Deserves Many awards for years and years to come.EDIT This Game is Full of Modders and Hackers With Mod Menu's and Aimbots who Constantly Drop Millions of Dollars on you and spawn the best Weapons and Vehicles on you in the entire game and Boost You Taking the Fun out of the Game and Gaming it Boring really fast. If you can some how deal with this and survive to level 100 you will be done really fast. For Serious players this game is Ruined online from the Amount of Modders and Hackers. Join a Session and try doing MC or CEO Work but there are 20 Presidents and 10 CEO's who are really just Noobs who was given money by modders. The noobs thought it would be fun to buy a Organization and or a MC. They dont know about the game or how to play. Join a Session and There is a modder Teleporting all over the map killing over and the Objective. Join another session and ther is another hacker with an aimbot and explosive bullets killing everyone.

2017-08-07,0,0,1003,False,Not Recommended,As far as GTA's go the best one to release so far in terms of graphics physics and characters you don't completely hate and aren't absolute scumbags. Enjoy the campaign but do play online at your own risk. This is the single most toxic online community I have ever seen in my near thirty years of existence. Between outright being harrased by openly modding players (being frozen teleported blown up on the spot having weapons removed put in a cage forced to dance having your character literally being e r*ped from behind while frozen the animations are taken from a paparazzi mission under franklin to fighting people with infinite health and ammo with all weapons and weapons they shouldn't have like the railgun etc.) to just standard trolly players who will jetstrafe you with explosive rounds incessantly and if grounded will probably marksman rifle you in 1 2 shots to death near instantly because they've been practicing it for far longer than anyone who can work a full time job has the chance to.These same mental midgets will then call you a p*ssy for using passive mode just to get some damn breathing room and who value K/D as if GTAV is the single most competitive and skill based shooter in existence. What's worse the community is now so intimately comfortable and familiar with modding that they'll regularly shout into the lobby for free money and when modders do attack and start screwing with everyone no one can take the time to get into the vote kick function and remove them no matter how much you plead with them to do so. It can work and you can have fun but the best bet to doing this is playing with a majority of friends in the lobby so that you have kick vote authority. Good luck with that in a full lobby though. Players won't hear you out and no one will get kicked even a player who is obviously modding to screw with people for over an hour straight.I don't know what if any measures are being taken to combat both modders and griefers but it isn't enough and probably won't be. The sad thing is they're adding in a lot of cool extra content to multiplayer. It's just a pain to bother playing in when it seems you have a 60 or &gt % chance of running into trolls or modders in any given lobby. So.. at it's core a very decent game and working and making money and doing missions and all that is so very fun with a good crew. But this community is the most toxic I have ever seen and they are easily breaking this experience that millions have paid to have access to.There also seems to be this very disturbing mindset going around that 'it is GTA therefore you should be trolling players'. I don't know where people get this idea as nothing in the campaign or in any of the GTA games encourages you to kill everything that moves all the time. If anything this is at it's most basic form a game about making money and profits from crime.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-07,1,11,249,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR Review GG Rockstar GG.Longer Review While I did enjoy GTA I believe it makes a great example for how flawed the Steam review system is this game is not bad enough for me to ""dislike"" but in no way good enough to recommend.Both Single Player and Multi Player boast with a huge world filled with different activities for you to explore. And especially in GTA Online you will find races missions and of course the heists scattered around the map. Yet somehow the world manages to still feel empty to me when playing a game called ""Grand Theft Auto"" the last thing I want is all the deathmatch nonsense I find around the map most missions are too simple to be truly as good as the single player and thus they bleak in comparison. The races can be fun when they are made by the community or if they generally include crazy jumps and stunts. But most races (especially air races) will end up being won by the person that started first.So? What can you do in GTA Online? The answer is simple not much while I had a lot of fun with a few of the races I spent mos of my time buying clothes modding my cars getting tattoos and of course doing the much anticipated Heists. That was the most fun part of the MP as they had some form of ""story"" coming with some well made cutscenes and good dialogue (if you can call it that) that made them compelling. And even the actual gameplay the killing driving flying etc. worked well in that context. It was fun or it would have been but I'll come to the negatives later.OK we talked about the MP how was the SP though? Fun honestly even though I had basically no choice when it comes to customizing the characters Michael Trevor and Franklin it didn't make the mistakes Online did providing the player with a lot of fun main and side missions the story wasn't too cliche even though a lot of the gameplay seemed like it was intended as a tutorial for the MP. Last but not least the world (SP and MP) was beautiful the landscapes the night sky all of it was breathtaking. So much in fact that I once went to the beach just for the sake of swimming.So until now it seems like a fine game why the thumb down? GTA has problems major problems despite being originally released two years ago. First off the lack of content I already touched on that before but again I have to say that most of the stuff you can do is kinda boring and in both SP and MP heist set up missions are basically mundane tasks.Speaking of heists you remember when they said that the player could choose how to proceed? Yup totes true in SP. And let's not forget that the choices are ALWAYS binary. Seriously the Heists could be fun if you didn't have to replay every setup mission 1000x because of either bad teammates connection or some other silly thing that has nothing to do with the actual game. Also the stock market is a terrible feature that is tied to missions and will essentially only be of any benefit when in that context.What else? Well the progression system is quite bad. I'm rank 20 something and I'm almost done with everything I want to do in that game too bad one of those things is to get a minigun (a fun weapon I have to admit) that I can only get when I'm LVL 120. Yup have fun doing only races for three months do achieve that. But the worst part is the car mod progression of which some is not tied to rank. As I mentioned I like tuning cars well you HAVE to do races for that. Again have fun with that if you don't like racing.But the greatest of all problems are still the bugs performance connectivity issues and more oh you finally found a session? Whoops to bad we lost connection. People unable to get into cars because of sudden lag people ONLY starting to lag when in cars with other crashing that one guy that is level 12000 and thus has four times more life than me (great game mechanic) that is in the same session. Why? Why don't they just have a server browser? And of course the most recent bug I have experienced and also the most recent one in fact it's the reason that I'm writing this review (bias much?) is the one that locked me outside my account. Yup can't login. GG Rockstar well played.To conclude Pros +GREAT world and graphics.+Fun even if a little dull Single Player in general.+Good dialogue and filmography when they actually show it off.+Tuning is alot of fun.+Gameplay is overall solid.Cons Lack of content what IS there is dull. Bugs crashes glitches etc Problematic progression system.(still somewhat rewarding to get new stuff) Overall the high expectations were not met.A great game that is sadly dragged down by a few bad design choices and it's bad bad state. Best treated like an early access game get it once they have actually worked on it. Fun but not good.Edit(Stuff I forgot etc) 1) Turns out you can invest in the stock market and make a profit by robbing someone and investing in that stores competitors. Only works in SP.2) You do not make enough money in MP. Heists are the only thing that make a lot of money. It still only allows for very little considering the work you put into them.3)Game crashes when accessing the GTA V creator from Online.",Grand Theft Auto V

It crashes all the time(tried on multiple pcs with good high end hardware) The community of people that play this game sucks. The combat is so horrible. Hiding behind objects usually takes 5 seconds of running in circles before you actually take cover. The default keybidnings are terrbile you will need to change them. The racing is horribe rather all the match making all together is terrrible. The care control like crap and is more like bumper cars rather than a race. Furthermore if you are trying to get any upgrades on your car expect it to take you a very very long time. You need to win races of that class out of 8 30 people and even if you get 2nd place it will not count towards an upgrade at all. Terrible system. Also the heists suck.

2015-05-06,5,33,106,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is an amazing game. The single player is an engaging and incredibly detailed piece of work which had me hooked for a long time over two platforms. From first person dashboard panels to puns and debris scattered around the city it will impress.Unfortunately the Online mode doesn't stack up so well as seen from extended time playing it. The world feels less alive and shallow compared to single player and suffers from a multitude of bugs that never should have made it past QA. Lobby crashes aren't uncommon strange design and UI choices make it clumsy to use and the activities are fragmented into a string of waiting rooms with broken lobby mechanics. It doesn't even have any wildlife making the world even more empty!The game also suffers from a crime and punishment system that doesn't work. Want to shoot someone chasing you? If you hit the explosives carried in their hand you get penalised and fined for destroying their car even if it wasn't your intention. Someone coming at you in an armoured car? Surely it makes sense to blow it up this time since it's bulletproof (especially for newer players) but instead you get penalised again. The developers expect you to shoot through a tiny vision slit to defend yourself which is heavily unbalanced against someone when they are caught out in the open by player killers giving little chance to fight back.Of particular note are the loading times. They are utterly horrendous and unacceptable in this day and age with the game commonly getting stuck on the loading screen. If you Shift+Tab to pass the time you find the game will refuse to load and silently get stuck in an infinite loop. This is especially terrible for a game two years old what's the excuse Rockstar?And last but not least the modding situation. Not too relevant to me as I don't use them but there is quite some controversy surrounding the banning of players for mods in a series that was heavily modded in past incarnations. Rockstar's treatment of players has been brought into question.(UPDATE Rockstar comment here http //www.rockstargames.com/newswire)Overall if you haven't played single player I'd pick this up. But due to the poorly performing multiplayer and bugs I won't be adding it to the recommendations list for anyone looking to go online.,Grand Theft Auto V

Without even considering Take2's recent takedown of a major modding tool for the game I can not recommend this product as its goal is to suck as much money out of its customers as it can. $10 will get you GTA$500 000 (in game currency). This isn't enough to buy half the supercars let alone any airplanes rocket powered cars or yachts. This would all be okay if you could try out these vehicles in singleplayer but sadly that isn't an option. Rather Rockstar would have you spend real life money for a car or a apartment that you MIGHT like. If you don't like it then you can sell it for less than you bought it effectively wasting money. All of this and I haven't mentioned the hackers that plague the multiplayer and all in all make it an unfun mess of a mode that aims to take your money.,Grand Theft Auto V

You will have toxic asshats as in any freeroaming game but you can just play with your buddies if that's not your cup of tea. I do a lot of heists missions and do CEO work and MC as well.

I know I'm not someone with 4k hours playtime but over each Gen of gaming i have Close to 1.2 k hours around the point of this review and in my personal experiance i've never come across to any of the problems others seem to have and i can say that on my friends behalf also. I love this game its a gem a classic and i love playing it still. The only issue I have is of course the ways in which you earn money and how bloody expencive everything is. But other than that no faults. I have to give this game the award of my favourite game of all time 1 for the amazing story and singleplayer and 2 for the online replayability and the countless hours of fun with my friends I've had!,Grand Theft Auto V

I hate to even call your DLC anything less than their own great games Undead Nightmare is still in my top ten games of all time. But with Shark Cards it's sad to see that you guys are treating DLC the same way everyone else is lowering the bar you have set for so many years. Buy more money so you can have this wacky hat and op gun. Isn't that what gaming is all about? I have a lot of problems with how GTA's story was treated from the reduced ammount of activities to do in the world all so you can play as three bland characters with only one having a complete arc by the end but this just shows how little you care about producing good SP content. By not even allowing the community to step in and fufill the role you have shunned by focusing on just the impressive but lacking MP you just show how little you care about creating the Singleplayer experiences you used to craft. I'm just hoping Red Dead 2 goes back to just wanting to be an amazing story with an even more incredible world to explore.,Grand Theft Auto V

Way to be the new EA. Online has become a tradgedy. between long load times to even get into a peer 2 peer session once you get there you likely will be greeted by a modder who trolls everyone and ruins the experience. If you go to find a new session enjoy that 10 minute load time and more likely lately connection drop. Time to restart the game and enjoy more load time. ""OH BUT WINKZY YOUR PUTER MUST SUCK!"" ahhhh no. SSD 200D/50U connection and gtx1080i GPU to start. I play with a core group of 4 people when we do manage to get into a decent session and they all have the same complaints.The modding and connection issues as well as the long load times could be negated by hosting servers.

2015-12-23,0,0,157,False,Recommended,"There are two aspects to this game 1. Single PlayerThis is just what you expect from a R* title and more. The environment is great the story is great and is light years ahead of GTA IV (mainly because it brought back a lot of elements from San Andreas). Rockstar does update the game with new features every few months but unforutinely they do not get incorporated into single player. Even some core features from multiplayer such as the car insurance just incase your vehicle gets destroyed are missing in single player.2. Multi PlayerWhen this game first came out it was a great experience. Since the low riders update in late October 2015 this game has been infested with hackers/modders/""script kiddies""/or whatever you choose to call them. Each multiplayer lobby has at least a few. The anti cheat is a joke and from what I read its as simple as replacing a few files in the directory. Some say to find a crew or play in ""invite only"" lobbies but I feel I shouldn't have to do such things to enjoy a game. From a modern title I find this problematic especially when people are now taking it upon themselves to mod themselves to combat other modders OR just leave the game entirely.ConclusionThe single player game is a great ride and well worth the price of admission. Multiplayer is a big let down considering its potential. Overall I would have to NOT RECOMMEND this product as a whole of single player &amp multiplayer due to the hacking in multiplayer and the lack of features offered in multiplayer that havent been translated to single player (the car insurance low riders yachts and so on).",Grand Theft Auto V

I don't say he is a hacker because he killed me more times than I kill him or because he shot me and I die 3 blocks away I even understand the lag and I know that you can kill 3 blocks away with a sniper even if you are driving in full speed (I did that and yes it was 100% lucky but that can happen). I'm talking about hackers who they do not care showing what they are. I'm talking of people to can get 10 sniper shots in the head and they still alive people to which you shoot with an rpg in the face and they do not die and if they are inside the car and the car explode they get off walking and kill you in one shot... youtube is full of people playing with hacks in the original game so if you don't believe me you can watch it.If you buy the game by torrent you have exactly the same as here you can even play online too and for sure you will find fewer hackers than in the original... or at least you will not go feel ripped off by rockstar because they does NOTHING about it. If you send a message to the support with images or videos they copy and paste the same message ""the best way to report is in game menu"" and they do not care what you are sending to them. Rockstar is and the technical support is one of the worst that exists that is why it is not worth pay for something like that.To abbreviate the game is good and I recommend playing it without doubts but pay to rockstar for his ineptitude and his total disinterest to the players/community... well that depends of you.Recomiendo jugarlo pero NO pagarlo El juego esta LLENO de hackers/chiters/modders o como le quieras llamar y cada dia parece que son mas me animaria a decir que 7 de cada 10 lo son ya que no existe una partida en la que no encuentres a uno que no muera que vuele que te encierre en una caja que tenga autos de pegasus modificados que tenga 19021089279182716271602 de plata un yate 5 casas la oficina mas cara mas de 10 autos que cuestan mas de 1M cada uno modificados el garage de importaciones lleno y todo eso a nivel 10... y no digo que es hacker porque me mato mas veces que yo a el o porque me disparo y me mato a 3 cuadras de distancia incluso entiendo el lag y se que te pueden matar a 3 cuadras de distancia con un sniper por mas que vayas en auto a toda velocidad (yo lo hice y si fue 100% suerte pero se que puede pasar). Yo hablo de hackers que no les importa mostrar que lo son porque saben que no les va a pasar nada hablo de personas a las cuales le disparas con sniper 4 veces en la cabeza y siguen vivas sin perder vida a las cuales le disparas con rpg en la cara y no se mueren y si estan adentro del auto y les explotas el auto ellos se bajan caminando... con ir a youtube te das cuenta de la cantidad que son incluso ellos mismos muestran en sus videos como los usan etc. Hay muchos que dicen que los banearon sin razon... despues de mis mas 350 horas de juego me es imposible creer que fue por nada o por culpa de un tercero.Si lo compras en una pagina de descargas vas a tener exactamente lo mismo que aca tengo entendido que incluso se puede jugar online y lo mas seguro es que encuentres menos hackers que en el original... o al menos no te vas sentir estafado ya que rockstar no hace NADA al respecto. Si los denuncias enviando un mensaje al soporte con imagenes o videos te copian y pegan el mismo mensaje ""la mejor manera de denunciar es desde el juego"" y no le hacen caso al ticket que les estas enviando ya que no tienen ganas de responder o prestarle atencion a las denuncias que se hagan al respecto porque NO LES IM POR TA te ponen un boton en el juego para que denuncies ahi como si algun dia alguien del soporte fuera a prestarle atencion a eso. rockstar es un asco y el soporte tecnico es de los peores que existen por eso es que para mi no vale la pena pagarles por algo asi.En resumen el juego es bueno y recomiendo jugarlo sin dudas pero pagarle a rockstar por su ineptitud y su total desinteres en los jugadores... bueno eso ya depende de cada uno.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,312,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is really fun.The publishers are serious s but that doesn't stop the single player from being really good on its own or the multiplayer from being fun especially with friends.Most of the long time players either worked their asses off or had modders drop millions of dollars on them to buy everything on PC. You won't ever have the purchasing power you'd expect from playing legit even once you own all the money making enterprises but ing around in a $30 000 junker with friends is still fun and plenty of vets will let you use their The $100 shark card will buy you 8 million in in game cash and that amount of money will only get you 2 4 top end vehicles or maybe 2 cars and an office/penthouse. (This is a tiny amlunt of content really) The missions generally pay out $25k so you will be forced to grind for a long while if you want to buy anything nice. Better options open up eventually but things like heists and import/export operations have a decent risk of failure resulting in a lot of lost time and money.I received a lot of modded money previously so I spend most of my time in game helping friends run missions playing golf and flying my new rocket bike around.There are a lot of reasons not to buy this game but lack of fun isn't really one of them at least until you decide to grind out a few million dollars online for a luxury car or one of those fancy rocket bikes. Its a weird situation but the bottom line is that there are a ton of major red flag turn this car around level problems but you'll likely have gotten $60 worth of fun from the game long before they become particularly relevant.Keep in mind though by paying for this product you are enabling some really greedy business practices from the publishers who are squeezing the online mode for every penny and more recently taking steps to kill single player modding outright.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-28,0,0,731,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 WAS a good game yes WAS let me explain why.I Love GTA V Single Player and when you add mods to it it makes it evan better allowing to play as part of a gang or the police and that is where most of my game time is not so much online. When GTA V first got released Rockstar said that they would be releasing Single Player DLC howoever after they released there first Online DLC they announced the single player DLC wouldnt be happening WHAT WHY???? They said it was because they notied that most people were online and this might be true but there is still a lot of people who play Single Player and i am one of them. The reason i think they didnt release it was money just that age old thing money! How many people daily spend 100 after 100 (dollars or euros or whatevever curreceny) on the online. I dont know exact figures but i bet its a few Million pound worth if they released single player dlc they couldn't do that.So if you want to play a game just for the online and want to spend a load of money just to stand a chance then Yea go for it. but if like me you want to be able to play a good Story and Then have more hours on extra story mode and then maybe hop online and be able to do things without buying a 82 sharkcard in order to get some weapons and cars or to start a company then dont get this game!!GTA V has been Ruined for me with all the Online Micro Transactions and no focus on single player and i understand that they have to make money to fund for servers yes but im pretty sure they have made enough to release a couple of Single Player DLC for free!,Grand Theft Auto V

Characters are good and the voice acting is generally brilliant. Overall great singple player experience.Online The online is pretty fun especially with friends and you'll never run out of things to do. BUT everythng is so expensive. I'd understand if it was just 'cosmetics' such as cars or something. But it's not. It's thinks you require to make your online experience better such as 'bunkers and facilities. Now you don't NEED' these to play but there's hell of a lot less to do if you don't. It's like R* is screaming 'BUY SHARK CARDS' despite the game being a huge success. Loading screens are sometimes ridicoulous and end up not loading at all. Not to sure about hacker situation as they only really drop money which isn't such a bad thing.Overall Great game that's slowly being ruined by the online.

2017-06-22,0,0,479,False,Not Recommended,BUYER BEWARE T2 has issued a C&amp D against OpenIV which is a backbone of the singleplayer modding community common sense suggests that they did that in order to force players to play online in order to raise the shark card sales. They then had the audacity to claim that they issued the C&amp D because OpenIV allowed cheating after the community backlashed that insued. OpenIV has never allowed hacking and even discourages it. T2 is being blatntly anti consumer with this move and it would be of your best interest to stay away from this game until T2 goes back and allows OpenIV to continue. If T2 succeeds with this move the anti modding anti consumer behavio that T2 has shown may spread to other companies. T2 is the parent company of rockstar. If you want modding for singleplay games DO NOT BUYTL DR Take two the parent company of rockstar are currently waging a war against singleplayer modding and it may spread to other companies throughout the game industry if you care about your consumer rights DO NOT BUY.EDIT T2 and R* has recinded their C&amp D of OpenIV however this review will stay as a negative. Why is it still a negative? you may ask the awnser is simple. T2 is still on my list they are on probation as far as i'm concerned T2 just demonstrated a complete disregard for the customers who have paid for this product in their latest fiasco i will not be giving any money to T2 for an indefinite amount of time that is until they show that they care about their customers The same could be said for this review.

Single player experience is very smooth im hitting almost all times 144hz on 1440p. Sli support is good multithread suport is good.Story wise you cant go wrong rockstar always do have great writers and manages to create an awesome setting.The bad part well its not San Andreas gta 3. It does not have las venturas or san fierro and it was the only thing i really miss. This and the fact i cant eat burger shots. Or play cassino. Or bet on horse races and after that kill everyone in a rage. The online game is good but it basically only work if you have a trusty group of friends because you need people willing to do the heists they are the real fun of online.

2018-01-05,0,0,150,False,Recommended,This is my first review and I want to start by telling you all that GTA V is in my opinion not what everyone else says in all these bad reviews and this is also my first time buying the game ever so I might be able to shed some light on people who want to buy the game for their first time too.Single Player To be honest i've played like 5 missions not really dipped into the single player too much but everything looks amazing it runs very smooth and it is a very well optimised game I see me having a lot of fun on the single player when I do decide to play it.Online Now this is probably the need to know things about online from my limited experience.Yes there are hackers. You might find yourself online in a free roam lobby and hackers will spawn you in mid air drop SWAT on you you'll see people on the side asking for cash and all that me personaly I just left the lobby and let them do their things I wasn't going to let myself stay in a lobby with them after hearing people getting banned for accepting money and stuff so I just leave the lobby and everything was fine. New lobby hacker free easy. I did however have one issue and that was after going into single player the next day after my first day online my single player character had 2 billion in cash every gun (non dlc) and all the guns had full ammo now I was kind of annoyed about this because I wanted to do everything without cheating or anything and I was super confused about why I had everything my friend even called me out on it a few times because he didn't believe me luckily I was only like 5 mission in so I just deleted my saves and started single player again which wasn't too bad but still was super annoyed about. But really that's the only bad encounter i've had.Online is amazing. I was scepticle about buying this game because of all the bad reviews and everything but I really can't recommend this game more. The online races with about 8 people is hilarious there are jobs you can do online with friends to make cash buy garages to store cars make a gang with your friends make enough cash to buy houses I feel you will easilly play this game for a few months before getting bored.So to end this review i'm giving a 8/10.I'd give 10/10 if someone never screwed my single player over but hey things happen I hope you get this game and enjoy it as much as I do.,Grand Theft Auto V

It comes out a stupid DLC after the next the meaning is clear you should buy GTA Cash. From flying bikes firing rockets to bombers the MP game transforms into a plague bruised chimera and dormer that even hardened gamers can not stand. If I'm ever there The Cheating in GTA Online has become an absolute plague I have not even seen so much in San Andreas Multiplayer (And there they were even banned most of the time). And was free from the community. Reporting cheats brings absolutely zero because most likely no staff is there to stop or the existing staff is incapable. All in all the SP is pretty good and the MP gets worse with every DLC. You realize that it's all about the money of the GTA online players who in return get a kick in the butt. In San Andreas Multiplayer I had more fun and did not have to pay anything except the main game.,Grand Theft Auto V

I am very grateful for the constant updates which have kept this game alive for years. But all we keep getting are more and more expensive vehicles and missions that a new player will only see after weeks of grinding.The gap between the rate at which you can earn money and the required money for the new vehicles and missions keeps increasing forcing you to spend on microtransactions (after already spending 60 euros on this game) that are highly overpriced and at times misleading.

If you have a mission you just can't do you can skip to the next bit.The single player alone is worth the price but the online on top of that? Priceless.The game controls really well and plays really really well. It's a FUN game.CONS Online filled to the rim with script kiddies and griefersIt's impossible to just enjoy the game.Script kiddies? I've had cars rain out of the sky. I've had MY cars disappear out of my garage. I've had people having gunfights IN my garage. I've been blown up by people who don't show up on the map. I've been blown up by someone on the other side of the map. I've been teleported out of my apartment into the street and then killed. I've faced off against attackers who couldn't be killed ... and on and on and on.Griefers? I can barely go online without somebody randomly blowing me up for no reason. Once even twice I can look the other way but half the time I get somebody who has nothing better to do than to kill me wait for me to respawn then come after me again and again and again until I quit.Recently over half the sessions I join have jets helicopters and/or armored vehicles blowing everything in sight just bombing the whole damn street.80% of the time as soon as step out of my apartment BOOM. Bounty on my head. Immediately. And the game informs EVERYBODY! X has a bounty on their head! Kill them to collect!!!!The game is DESIGNED to encourage people to go after other players to kill them to blow up their cars to steal property from CEOs trying to make a buck.The game is DESIGNED to make it nearly impossible to earn money.As soon as I try to run an import/export I have a giant target on my back and there's a message to all players encouraging them to pile on. And now they don't even have to chase me. They just take their favorite rocket launching helicopter or jet and park over one of the five or six drop off locations. It's pretty obvious where I'm going.Tonight I was trying to heist a mid range car ... not even high end. Mid range. I have to steal a helicopter from the military (and take out four maybe five guards). Fly out to the coast. Take fire from another half a dozen guards. Hook the car. I land on shore and prep. I fight off SIX helicopters. SIX! While I'm shooting down the last one? Someone steals the car. How did they know it was there? They could hardly miss it. It's lit up like a christmas tree on the map.As soon as I steal a car or try to export one everybody gets an alert.And all the prices keep going up. Hundreds of dollars for a shirt. Tens of thousands of dollars to repaint a car. Thousands upon thousands of dollars to stock up on ammo.I feel like I'm shopping in Disneyland.And how about races? I bought several of the most expensive cars. I have maxed out my driving skill. Do I have a chance? No. I don't have the mods to improve acceleration and speed. How do I get them? Win races. So in order to win races I need upgrades but to get the upgrades I need to win races. Otherwise right from the starting gate even though I have the accelerator on the floor people pass me like I'm standing still ... although all right half the time they just get in a huge pileup at the starting gate.How about heists? Half the time somebody quits and the mission ends.Online gameplay is brilliant. It's a fun wonderful brilliant game completely ruined by some bad choices by Rockstar and a whole army of griefers.I love this game but I also hate it.Do I still recommend it? Yeah. It's a good. It's worth the money. Just be warned sometimes you'll love the game but sometimes you'll hate it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,821,False,Recommended,"UPDATE Rockstar Games has somehow talked its publisher Take Two into relenting on its earlier C&amp D to the OpenIV team. Since this decision I can confirm with many others that OpenIV has been updated to the most recent version of RPF and is now able to open and edit the game files again. This is wonderful news and it has shown especially that the negative press both companies were recieving forced them into changing their position. I can now recommend this game purely based on its single player. Old review This game has an outstanding story mode. It's interesting it'll keep you coming back for days or perhaps you'll play it in one two day stretch because you can't put it down.The online mode is possibly the worst thing ever created. I know nuclear weapons are pretty high up there but no. The online mode in this game is the worst thing ever created by humanity. Easy solution? Stick to story mode. One of the perks of sticking to story mode is getting to enjoy mods which make the single player experience more interesting. Oh never mind. Take Two just sent a C&amp D to the creators of the main modding tool for this game citing security reasons. . This is part of an ongoing attack on the PC community by Take Two which started with a C&amp D to the original FiveM team. They feel they've not made enough billions out of milking the absolute dog online mode from this game. One of the things implied by ""security reasons"" by Take Two is people playing online only content in single player presumably ahead of release as we have seen. Apparently having access to online only content in single player is stealing billions from them. This is intolerable on PC. I would say it is a duty of those that have not purchased this game to never do so and I would suggest it is a duty of those that do have the game to not ever purchase a shark card or even stay off the game completely. We don't want this behavior on PC. Take Two you are not welcome on this platform.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-31,0,0,420,False,Not Recommended,So I will preface this whole review with this Mechanics wise this game is awesome same old awesome GTA that they've been putting out since GTA III.That said I would NEVER recommend this game to another living soul. Here's the list why 1 NO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. I just spent the last 20 minutes trying to find a help line and I couldn't find one. No in game reporting mechanism for hackers WHICH I ENCOUNTERD AT LEAST TWO THIS CURRENT SESSION. They don't ing care about the players just their bank accounts.2 Terrible balance of time to reward. They expect you to pay for the pleasure of doing ANYTHING in their game unless you are willing to pour untold hours into the game to make the BARE MINIMUM of money to afford anything. They will drain you and they won't help you at all while doing it.3 Horrible community. This shouldn't need to be said but the people who play this are generally imaptient children who think they're cool because they're playing an 'adult' game. And if they're not they stick you in a session full of people who don't speak your language mostly Russians and chinese. After you get past that there is no incentive to stop people from quitting out of a heist they join. You get a full four players get through the esplanation do your loadout... only for them to quit after you just waited 20 minutes to even find a full room of people to do a heist.4 The single player sucks. Now this is kind of a dual problem here. What they should have done is put more time into both games because yes GTA Online and GTA V are really 2 se erate games. They should have developed these two things as seperate games. Instead they half the out of GTA V just like they did GTA IV. The story while good is so short and unfulfilling that it's a fair point to say they don't care about solo gamers at all. Insatead all they went for was the micro (macro really) transaction route and forwent any care for actually developing a good game for the gamers. I for one will never buy another Rockstar product since they have finally stopped caring at all about helping the gamers or giving them a good product. They gouge you for damn near full game prices just to get their shark cards and the piddly amounts they give you for those insane prices aren't even enough to buy the good stuff in the game. TL DR Rockstar have become con artists run by greedy corporate losers who will tank the gaming industry if we let them. Please join me in boycotting these liars and make them see they cannot lie to us steal from us and then ignore us when their product does nothing but fail us at every turn. NO technical support failure to moderate and direct the commnuity too much focus on profit and not enough on customers and honsetly glitches and THE WORST INTERNET CONNECTIONS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN AN ONLINE GAME!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,1,1,216,False,Not Recommended,Modding can prolong a game's lifespan massively. For example mods for older 3d universe GTA titles are still being released today. To say that modding was outlawed due to players exploiting GTA Online is complete nonsense as you are automatically denied the entrance to a server if the game detects you have an altered copy of the game.It was simply to make the story/singleplayer mode irrelevant thus promoting Online in order to generate more profit from Shark cards. Which is considering GTA V was one of it's quickest grossing and most pre ordered games highly despicable and greedy.As much as I enjoyed the game I must say I'm extremely disappointed in Take two's decision. If you like me want to purchase the game a second time on PC just to be able to play singleplayer with mods then you should reconsider. At least until further notice hopefully.It is true you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.,Grand Theft Auto V

Over the course of two hours I remembered again why I fell in such love with this franchise as I downed four beers got in a wrecked car I already stole wheeled around like a man possessed shooting any car in sight getting chased by cops sobering up and wading through marshlands with a sniper rifle and the determination to shoot the first living thing I came across fired into a bridge killed three soldiers escaped 3 stars by running under the bridge shot a woman in the head at point blank range with the sniper stole her jeep jumped into another car after crashing into and killing the driver and then returned to my apartment.

2017-08-04,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,I am really mixed. This game is great when you are playing in single player mode. I loved the character of trevor because I totally liked to play a crazy bad guy who always wake up somewhere on the map in underpants after a night of drinking and picking up fights. The map is so diverse missions are funny and sometimes challenging (even if the game is not difficult to complete). There is so many possibilities funny characters great locations great cars possibility of customization and so many adventures and scenarios possible... This was my favorite GTA since Vice city and San andreas.I also have to say that the game runs fantastic on my quite old gaming computer. But after I completed the story mode I heard that rockstar had no plans to extend the single player mode. No DLC in the future. They choose to focus only on the onlive game....I tried the online game. I hate it. I tried many times because people were always talking about it how great it is. I tried to find the fun in it and I failed. It's not funny. It's a mess people running around and shooting at you challenges that you don't know why they exist and as an oldschool gamer I never take part in microtransactions so it seems that there is nothing for me there. And the long waiting time at the start of the online game is really annoying same with the big loss of performance compare to the single player mode. I'm done. I want to be able to play Trevor again and have new missions in single player.... I still ride the streets of los santos just for the fun to drive in a so beautiful game.

2015-04-14,0,0,463,False,Recommended,I really bought this to see what Grand Theft Auto Online was like I'd already played through this game on the Xbox 360 and thought it was a good game however if I were to review this based on my online experience I'd give it a firm thumbs down. Seemingly never ending loading screens very unreliable server connection everything besides guns and clothes is priced to move microtransaction shark cards and even then there really isn't all that much to do. If you love racing cars maybe you'll get something out of online but overall I find it totally frustrating and basically awful. I wouldn't have even bothered with it anywhere near the amount of time I have currently if there weren't achievements on the line but now that one of the last achivements I need seems to be bugged I don't know how much more time I'll be putting into it.All that being said I'm still giving this a solid thumbs up just due to the offline single player experience. It's just as great as it was in 2013 it's packed full of content and has a great story with very refined gameplay. There really exists no cons to it that I can think of. If you're an achievement completionist however note that it's probably going to take you at least 100 hours of the aforementioned online play to get the grindier achievements and you'll probably need a friend to take care of the rest.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,491,False,Not Recommended,Taking away OpenIV is the stupidest thing they could have done to this game. Along with t DLC adding more expensive items each time and making it almost impossible to make any kind of gains toward buying that people either resorted to hacking or buying shark cards. Both of which are awful choices.Now I don't agree with hacking to ruin other people's enjoyment of the game but when devs pull like that and basically forcing people to give them money on top of an already expensive game then I'm all for hacking to get money it's Take Two's and Rockstars own fault there.Then to take away OpenIV and one of the only things keeping the single player aspect of the game alive (which basically kills the game as they killed the online themselves) is just shooting themselves in the foot. The only reason some games are still alive (see Skyrim) is because of modding.So whoever made the decision to attack the OpenIV team you can go yourselves.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,645,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game on PS3 originally and then again on Steam. Firstly the single player is very good but fall short of the other games in the GTA Franchise. There are many improvements from previous games that are completely removed and if you 100% the game you will be insanely bored. Secondly the multiplayer is also lacking despite what it seems. It misses the point of open world fun instead twisting the game into a microtransaction hell of glitches hackers and broken promises. Rockstar lowered the payouts of ALL missions making it harder to earn money and experience new content. They also have no anti cheat so hackers pretty much run the game. So with the multiplayer being garbage I decided to dwell in single player This is where the game shined again for me. Mods brought back the single player fun I was used to but apparently Rockstar is only about money now. Even though thier customers have remained loyal and supported them through countless controversies they decided to begin threating mod tools and creators people who loved thier games so much they wanted to add on to them. This behavior is inexcusable. No company should treat fans this way. Rockstar is now one of the companys it used to satirize on the in game radio. Expect more of this behavior because GTA V was insanely lucrative and the online brought even more cash.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,Take Two the publisher of GTA V forced the developers of OpenIV (a mod creation tool) to cease development because mods were made that were used in a malicious way in online play. Instead of correcting thier security or working to produce official mod creation tools they just ended all modding since OpenIV is the only way to create a mod for this game.I cannot recommend a product when the company behind it is so incompetent as to blame the modding community when their game's online security is defeated by a few people. Regardless of if they change their stance I can't recommend this or any other Take Two product.,Grand Theft Auto V

I can't recommend it to anyone anymore due to Take Two's devious management of the GTAO economy in order to drive microtransactions and their complete negligence of cheat prevention except for money cheats.The C&amp D letter Take Two sent to OpenIV is what pushed me to submit a negative review. I've stopped playing GTAO regularly and with the Single Player modding scene under attack I'm not sure I'll ever have a reason to install this game again. I completely support a corporation's right to protect their interests but the C&amp D letter targeting a Single Player only mod is simply overreaching.The GTA franchise and Rockstar Games used to be darlings of the gaming industry and Take Two is poised to tarnish a reputation 20 years in the making with a handful of poor business decisions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-26,0,0,599,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas,Grand Theft Auto V

Unless it's about their accounts getting banned most of these bad reviews are dumb.If somebody wants to pay for the game and buy in game content its their choice. They choose to not have fun doing the missions and want to acquire everything at once so they can play as they want. Rockstar doesn't have to stop selling in game money just because you are both lazy and jealous. I didn't buy any in game money but I still own everything I want. It doesn't take too much of your time if you aren't brainless and lonely.Game still keeps getting amazing updates and maps both from the developers and community.Last update made the game even better me and my friends are having way too much fun with the clubs.Online is way too alive and fun. It never gets repetitive due to unique game modes and other stuff I loved to do back in sa mp and MTA.And yes there are many chinese hackers but all you have to do is click on finding a different session and done you don't even lose anything.

2015-07-23,0,0,227,False,Recommended,The most IMPORTANT part of this review comes later but all in all this will always be an amazing game. Better graphics and gameplay and everything else in general than any other gta game. My current computer that im playing on is a windows running windows 7 64 bit service pack 1(I may not have said that correctely but you get the gyst of it) and i have an intel core i5 processor also a nvidia geforce gtx 560 Ti and 12 GB of ram. It meets all the minimum requirements but runs like a dream and is still stunning. So for those of you worried about the look of the game if you arent all up to date on the recommended pc drivers/processors etc. DONT BE. I most certainly was but I followed through and optimized it as far as my GPU allowed and im entirely happy. But not so happy with how much i spent to buy the game. For those of you still with me I went to best buy to purchase the steam card for the game (which gives you 59.99 credit to BUY THE GAME ON STEAM) since i didnt want to buy the physical disc(s) to install the game. So I ended up paying around 65 dollars for the thing at best buy without even realizing THAT I HAD TO STILL PAY TAX AGAIN TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME ON STEAM( around 3.74). I didnt want to wait either for the game to go on sale bc ive been hearing that it probably wont because of rockstar or whatever. So instead I went out and bought another 20 bucks worth of steam credit(I couldnt find lower) just so I can buy the game everybody has been raving about. Welp it worked so now here I am broke as because I spent 80 BUCKS on steam credit ( Huge cash grab which pisses me off plus I was tricked into thinking that the 59.99 would pay for the whole game and id just pay the needed tax at the store Best buy. Please dont make the same mistake I had. Either buy the physical game off of amazon (which gives you an 8% discount and free shipping) or elsewhere in an actual store which is probably the cheapest route.

Now (2016) you pay upwards of 2.5 million to even compete with the top cars so you either need to make the money or buy it.

2016-09-07,0,0,183,False,Not Recommended,ONLINE REVIEW ONLY. Not played the single player.5 for each. Good 1. Runs fine I have a high end laptop with almost everything set to max. The level is a beast optimisation isn't an issue. 2. Water looks realistic visuals are stunning at times.3. Plenty to do free roam races survival golf tennis darts parachuting random public server events cinema daily rewards own a business and hire people heists...4. Can switch between 1st and 3rd person view. Changes gameplay on foot/driving.5. A lot of vehicle weapon and clotheing choices. Bad 1. Rockstar really doesn't care at all about hackers. The best time to play is straight after an update.2. Menus are belivebly clunky. 3. Controls are broken at times flying is impossible without a controller. 4. Camera angles at times are the worst. If you do a loop the loop in a stunt race it locks it on top of the car so you can't see where your going and then spins it round. Just a mess. 5. Takes a long time to load and that's on a new solid state hard drive.Overall is a visually stunning very mediocre console port.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-12,0,0,286,False,Not Recommended,My review is much the same as the negative ones before me. I have been permanently banned and I will admit the first strike was valid I got money from a modder shooting it all over the place. My assets got wiped which was a fair punishment. The second and third strikes however were completely unwarranted.This most recent and final ban happened last night where my gameplay consisted of playing my first self funded heist careening into other players' vehicles with my own and playing in others' heists. The only thing I can imagine triggered it was a modder (I believe) in the Humane Labs raid who disappeared as we were leaving the high rise died and then upon restarting we were already at the helicopter.I'm beyond mad and have basically wasted $50 and almost 300 hours on nothing at this point.,Grand Theft Auto V

Not just the online is good but so is the single player campain is amazing with 7 hours of campain and all the smaller stuff you can do in this game is endless fun and Rockstar left us a lot of easter eggs to find in the game and mysteries like the MT.

2017-06-16,0,0,3274,False,Not Recommended,"Okay I'll start from the beginning. Back in September 2013 I got myself an illegal copy of GTA 5 for the Xbox 360 since my Xbox was modded and could play illegally copied games with the drawback of no online. Half a year later I saw what the online could do and got myself a legit Xbox with a legit copy. I played countless hours on there easily 1000+ hours. made some friends and had a ton of fun with all the harmless glitches (old players will know the fence launch). Then next gen was announced but I spent all my money on my PC so I waited for the PC release instead.Then PC came. I transferred my level 180 something character and went straight onto organizing all the stuff I owned. That Infernus I saved up for for ages was sold and was traded in for a Turismo R that I still have to this day. I played online nearly all the time took a day off or called in sick every day a DLC came out because I wanted to be the first one to get my hands on the new stuff.Many hours later I noticed how everything was starting to become very expensive. Luckily I had quite some money saved up over my playtime so I could buy what I wanted. Then came the Finance and Felony update I earned even more money. Then came Cunning Stunts which brought a whole new aspect to the Creator. I created countless race tracks stunt tracks deathmatches and even custom minigames. Every update started to become more expensive than the next and even I couldn't afford the DLC's that came after.Skip a few months and I was playing one of my tracks with some friends. I was in the lead laughing how everyone crashed into every tree imaginable extending my lead comfertably. Then my car stopped in an instant my character was spawned next to the car my screen went black and a message appeared ""You have been banned from Grand Theft Auto Online."" Not knowing how this happened I waited out my two week ban and continued playing.Skip another month or so and the modders were starting to infect the game. I tried to avoid them for as long as possible until I got a bounty placed on me (while in an Invite Only session) of a few billion dollars. 48 minutes passed and I recieved the money placed on me since I survived the bounty. Then a day later I was driving home from work when my phone vibrated. I got an email. I'd check it out when I got home. I got home booted up the game and during the incredible long loading time checked the mail. It has the title ""Permanent Ban"". My heart sank. I stared to my phone for what seemed like ages until my monitor also turned black displaying the same message.After 4000+ hours in the game mainly Online I got my permanent ban.I got a new account nevertheless since I liked the game too much despite it's flaws. However a few days ago word spread that the mother company of Rockstar Games Take Two Interactive had forced modding tool OpenIV to shut itself down or they'd get sued. OpenIV followed instruction and the internet went crazy. Heck Rockstar even said when the PC version was released that they had nothing against Single Player modding as long as the Online mode stayed untouched. OpenIV did just that. It only modded the single player version but appearantly that doesn't matter anymore.Believe me this game is a great game. However there are so many flaws bugs and just plain things broken that make the game not enjoyable to play anymore. Cars are in the wrong class planes cost 10 million dollars modders are literally everywhere Rockstar is releasing 'free' DLC's but you need at least a shark card worth $15 to buy something from it and you get banned completely out of your power.Rockstar I know you're not reading this. However if you are please don't ruin GTA 6 Online if it'll ever come out. GTA 5 is beyond repair.",Grand Theft Auto V

I have spent so many hours of my life and money on this game on console then I bought this for the character transfer because console wasn't cutting it for me. The worst part is they got rid of the transfer because of cheaters and modders moving to next gen with there accounts. Honestly you modders and cheaters. Also you rockstar for not putting effort for fixing this and just decided to remove it. Rockstar you are lazy for not fixing the game also your in game content is mostly only obtainable by shark cards which they are horribly overpriced. This game used to be a masterpiece now it is a of tryhards and modders and lazy devs.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-31,0,0,59,False,Not Recommended,This review is about the online portion of GTA 5. GTA online can be very fun with friends but this is so heavily overshadowed by constant arbitrary repetitive boring side missions that you pretty much need to do for money. For example I have the criminal enterprise pack and the import and export/ special vehicles missions are so goddamn tedious it's inexcusably boring especially when doing it by yourself. Not only that but most of the other little side objectives you will do to make a bit of money are more repetitive grinding. Honestly it feels like the fun parts of the game like the special guns and vehicles are locked behind a in game paywall/grindwall that seems to encourage you to just go and buy cash from the steam store. Overall the game can be fun although most of the time it feels like repetitive busy work.,Grand Theft Auto V

I preordered the PC version and loved the game ever since. the first summer it was out on pc you could not play in a public lobby without modders ruining the game for everybody. So by christmas of 2015 they ""cracked down"". by this point my friends list and I had menus and we were able to kick people in the lobby with it so we would kick other hackers and that all we used it for (and maybe some money but who wouldnt?). then we all got banned for ten days. I have not cheated since then and have not revieced a ban. i got my warning and learned my lesson. But now you see theres the problem you let people off too easy who dont care about getting banned. i did so i stopped but clearly others dont and clearly you dont rockstar because instead of punishing those who cheat with an actually GOOD anti cheat system (which is where your money should go instead of hiring lawyers to right a cease and desist to a modding company that makes SINGLE PLAYER MODS which you said in the beggining you supported and also you cant acces online with them it says ""you have modified game files""). Dont punish the modding commuity for your mistakes. I hope you enjoy losing all the customers you just away. In the end yes this game WAS great now they ruined it. (id also like to mention they add content that you have to spend your entire life to save for just to spend on a system like gunrunning where you wait 5 hours and maybe make 100k. its t and thats why people chea. i get you have to spend money to make money but you just make us poor so we buy sharkcards which i will never do!)",Grand Theft Auto V

Small mapMaybe it is so subtle discribed in the city causes the occupying of 70G space in desk and the programmers are already tired in programming other cities which cause me tired in one city and I wanna say a part of San Andreas is not enough for our players to play this game. The map is even smaller than GTA3 on a same city2. Simple physics in driving flying divingEasy to drive is the tradition of all GTA series that is totally good for you firstly play this game. But as a totally fun of car sports which totally bothers me is that all GTA series Do Not have the ABS system in cars even in GTA5 with a more better physics than GTA4 and the in vehicle mode is not good enough developed causes many players stil play this in a third person view3.Didn't change much after you do comparisons between GTA4 and 5When you actually play GTA5 after playing GTA4 I found the differences are that GTA5 have more stories and a better physics and that is all4.Why am I already feeled Tired with a 36 hours game timeMotivation for players as a person to play this game is what Ive already mentioned beforw MoneyStory Mode is all about Robbing Banks and carrying out plans to rob banks which totally bothers me beause during the preparation of Robbing there exists more other smaller missions for you to do causes a more time for you to wait in a small mapthe same happens on Online Mode Players just wanna to make money when playing the game which ruins the meaning of GTA5 as a game to play.Which often happens in a particular scenario when you become rich in this game.You dont know whats the interestings to do next which ruins you to enjoy the process when playing this game directly cause you dont want to play this games any more because you become dominant in the Story Mode and Online mode.Particularly happens in Online Mode is the Bully to the novice playersAnyway it's a game that should be Always comes to the end with a motivation,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-18,0,0,238,False,Recommended,GTA V has its pros and cons like every game. The story mode is absolutely amazing. Graphics are stunning but also requires better than potato specs. The Online game is more mixed. There are so many DLCs now and content keeps getting more and more expensive (in game currency) which makes New players lag behind. There's still a lot of fun things to do in this online sandbox world especially if you play it with a friend or 4.If you have no friends though the price of this game is worth it for the single player story alone.9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-27,0,0,227,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game for quite some time now and have enjoyed it... ...until the latest update which seems to have made it almost impossible to play on a mostly empty server. I really don't understand why Rockstar thinks it's a good idea to make the players suffer. Why always do what the fans tell them not to do? It seems everything Rockstar cares about these days is making money and making sure that nobody can get anything in the game without buying shark cards. The offline game isn't great and the online community is getting more toxic every day. If I could get a refund today I probably would have taken up on that offer since I hate giving money to companies who only care about money and not the gaming experience. Of course the people who make great games deserve to get money for their hard work. But it seems that some companies only care about money these days and not about the experience at all. Sure they give out free stuff. But that's something that they really have to do in order to keep people from leaving the game for good. And since you kind of have to pay extra for shark cards in order to get anyting out of the online experience Rockstar owes their players this free stuff and updates. The free stuff really isn't free they're charging you real money for in game money and then offer you some small stuff for free to make you think that they're good guys. And that's always something that makes me think of scammers. If you have to pay extra for the experience even after buying the game then the game developers need to rethink why they made the game and for whom. Rockstar don't change what is already good. Listen to the players and stop giving us updates. Thank you. TLDR Rockstar sucks.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-16,0,0,914,False,Not Recommended,So this is my first serious review I will make.The game has improved a lot after it's launch in 2013. New content and features and all that except that the single player still feels kind of empty because of it's neglection of DLC in favour of more stuff in the Online mode that atleast requires playing the same heists that hand out a lot of money or having to resort to producing contraband to sell which makes even more money but in a slower way only to afford one new item at a time. Wanted that cool full customised Avenger? Great! Now go grind the same repetitive missions over and over on the same location you've probably went a hundred times in. The same thing could be said about single player since the map is pretty much the same it could have been bigger with better sights to see have different landscape or hell just add more continents. Online could also benefit from having custom dedicated servers instead of peer to play bullcrud that makes you disconnect every one hour and have custom maps with a proper level creator. Story mode is also bland with not many changes whatsoever just filler collectables that add up nothing to the story. It could of had DLC of exploring each of the character's past in a different timing and/or location or atleast a different protagonist. The missions themselves is kind of meh which the number of Is is equal to an oral joke (haha R* very original) but the medals add some replayability to them. I'm going to leave this review here which will be continued after I begin playing the game again after a 4 month abandonance.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-19,1,1,1013,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V is the definition of a love hate relationship. It's one of those games that would greatly benefit from a ""neutral"" recommendation. This game does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. I'll be discussing the single player portion and the online portion in seperate sections as at this point they are nowhere near the same game anymore.TL DR at bottom!GeneralThe attention to detail throughout the game is absolutely stunning. Puddles are dynamic people comment on your car as you drive by cars will have their tires turned into the curb when downhill parking. It's mad. It's clear that significant amounts of effort when into creating a living breathing environment for Los Santos. The game is gorgeous. Everywhere you turn there is a beautiful sunset impressive reflections and eye catching vibrant colors. It's such a breath of fresh air compared to the generic brown/grey colour palette. Luckily optimization allows GTA V to run as smooth as butter. I've been running the game on a GTX 1060 6GB on ultra high settings and have been consistently getting a 60 70+ FPS with very few frame drops. Friends with lower end GPUs have reported the same thing to me. This game is widely playable across a lot of systems in my experience.First Person is a welcomed edition from the last gen edition of the game (if anyone still plays those...). Nearly the entire game can be played through in first person which offers an interesting (and often times challenging) perspective for races firefights and roaming the city.Single PlayerThe single player is and always has been an amazingly enjoyable experience. It's a lovely blend of gritty twisted dark plotlines and absurd entertaining fun. There are some scenes that were a bit too much for me () but this all ultimately comes down to personal preference. The character dynamic between Franklin Micheal and Trevor is fun to watch unfold throughout your time playing which could be a while. It took me about 50+ hours to finish the main story and 90+ hours to 100% it. However content is limited thanks to Rockstars inability to hear the community's cry for solo content. A lot of people wouldn't mind spending $10 $20 on an expansion for the single player but Rockstar continues to ignore half of it's game to continue to work on it's cash cow.Grand Theft Auto OnlineGTA Online sings a tune very different from that of the single player. Online is at best a hugely entertaining passtime and at worst a horrible nightmare to play. The game essentially revolves around completing missions jobs heists etc. in order to acquire large sums of money. You then use this money to buy vehicles weapons and property (which often times unlocks new missions jobs and heists to play at your disposal). The main problem with this model is that unless you're willing to grind your off you're not getting anything quick. As more and more updates come out the prices of things go up and up all in a desperate attempt to push Shark Cards (In game currency for real money). What's even worse is that the value of Shark Cards has not kept up with the insane inflation that GTA Online has had over the years. On launch $1 000 000 was an insane amount of money. Now it's chump change. With every new update comes millions upon millions of dollars you need to spend in order to get anything. The most expensive Shark Card in the game ($99.99 USD) gives you $8 000 000 in game. You will burn through that quick. So unless you're ready to spend a LOT of money to get everything you want you'll be grinding. What adds insult to injury is all of the hackers spawning themselves infinite amounts of money and all the bans that don't get applied. You'd be lucky not to have some sort of hacker in your lobby. They run rampant with free rain to kill everyone and everything and spawn themselves (and you) money. Don't worry Rockstar will just ban them right? That'd be nice. Most of the time they do ban waves they catch thousands of innocent players who have worked hard for their money and will either take their money or ban them completely from Online. It's entirely innapropriate and Rockstar really needs to work on it. So say you've acquired your money you've bought some nice things and now you're enjoying free roam. Prepare to be blasted to hell by one of the most toxic communities I've ever experienced. This game breeds toxicity. People will blow up you your car your plane and your will to live. Low leveled players have little to no chance of fighting back as they don't have sticky bombs miniguns or any other of the strong anti grief weapons. Your only option after that is passive mode which is no fun whatsoever. Basically what I'm getting at is Online is a complete nightmare to play alone. However if you and a couple buddies pick up the game and play together you're in for some of the most fun you'll ever have. Playing races and missions together away from public lobbies is the most entertaining thing I've ever played. The most recent update the Doomsday Heist reintroduced new PvE content instead of the hollow PvP content they've been pushing lately. It's a huge step in the right direction for the future of this game and if they continue on the path of PvE and co op I can see this game lasting a lot longer into the future. I cannot stress it enough If you plan on getting this game for Online get it with friends!

2017-06-08,0,0,797,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V Overall I can Recommend this game BUT....There still are a lot of small things that bother me personally that are important to point out to potential buyers.GTA Singleplayer is fun for some time at most until you finished the Story and you can extend the Time you can spend in Singleplayer without it getting boring by installing mods or completely new game modes like LSPDFR with the help of that you can get a nearly infinite amount of fun in SP especially because GTA Vs modding community is quite large.Now to Online the for most people probably most important Part of GTA V. I played all GTAs before this one and none of them had a comparably awesome Multiplayer experience but GTA Online has been full of little Kids and Modders (often the same people) which can really take away the fun. I somehow manage to get into quite Quiet Sessions without really annyoing people but mostly you can't pervent to get random killed once or twice per hour for me it's not such a big deal and there also some possibilities to not have this happen which aren't really good solutions in my opinion for exemple private or friend lobbies or passive mode I don't really like using either of these methods.If you think you can handle these flaws there isn't anything else that could really bother someone Controller Support is awesome and loading times acceptable from what I have experienced.Edit Rockstar removed the ability to install singleplayer mods so the games singleplayer basically just got not worth playing anymore for me personally. Only online is left which still is as described above... All in all I can just recommand this game because the sheer fun this Game brings and also extends with each little DLC is making up for the little flaws that it still has.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-09-15,0,0,383,False,Not Recommended,I've seen a lot of people give negative reviews about this game without properly going into detail about why they feel the way they do. However to properly review this game I'm going to divide it into it's single player and multiplayer because they differ heavily.Single PlayerThe gameplay and story of the singleplayer is exactly what anyone would want from a GTA game good story fun gameplay lots to do. I'm not going to go too much into detail about it because of how much it's been praised already so just know it's worth the praise.Overall 9/10MultiplayerHere's where the game holds all of it's faults. The missions early on are fun and are directly related to the single player story but they can get a little repetative after a while. However the main problems arise after those missions 1.) The game gets horrendously grindy. It can take upwards of 4 real life hours to make $1 000 000 in game. So when most vehicles cost upwards of 1 milion it just seems so boring. Which leads me into my next topic...2.) The game shoves microtransactions in your face constantly. Some load screens and areas of the pause menu advertise them. It's really frustrating because this is BY FAR the most effective way of making any good money in the game.3.) The game is also filled with cheaters. Plenty of which just spawn money onto every player in the lobby which ends up getting them banned (this happened to me twice). If you try to send a support ticket trying to get your account unbanned I'll just say this. Good luck.Overall 2/10,Grand Theft Auto V

I can play 1 to 30 minutes until i get either a bluescreen (!!!) hang or program crash. PC software drivers etc. are all up to date. This for a 60 euro game is unacceptable the focus for R* needs to be the instability of the software. That being said here are my pro's and con's PRO Beautiful world to explore First person finally!!

2017-11-26,0,0,1254,False,Recommended,"Single player Grade 10/10Multiplayer Grade 9/10Short review Single player is once again a long and extremely enjoyable story driver open world game by Rockstar.Multiplayer is extremely as well fun and has vast amount of content but it is marred by some rough edges and cheaters.Full review As said in the summary the single player is exactly what you would expect from a GTA game. Thus I will keep single player review as relatively short. The Single player is a a long story driven chain of mostly humorous missions that takes places in a large and lively single playable open world. Even outside the missions the world has a lot of things to and discover from beautiful landscapes to creating massive traffic jams and from bullying pedestrians to tumbling down the mountain to escape wild animals. The quality of the execution is once again flawless. Due to the single player experience alone this game is a must buy for anyone who likes open world games and for others this gets a strong recommendation as well. The single players part is easily 10/10.The multiplayer (called GTA Online) part is executed as follows. By default you are in on open world together with 30 players. This mode is called free mode and is mostly identical to you being in your own single player open world except that you can interact with other players. On top of that the free mode is filled with random events and jobs started by players who have bought themselves with in game cash the CEO VIP or Motorcycle club president status. In free mode prepare for the fact that many of the players are hostile and shoot you on first sight. You can choose to be in passive mode to avoid being killed by other players but it also prevents you from using weapons.The other thing that the multiplayer offers are different kinds of missions. To get into a mission you must first be in the free mode and then start a mission there or choose to join a started mission. These missions create a new instance of the open world available only for those people in the mission. There are many different categories of missions so that there is definetly something for everyone. Some examples are story mission like co op missions surviva l deathmatch team deatmatch racing with vehicles parachuting and many more. A nice bonus is that players can create their own custom missions (excluding some game types such as co op ones). Note that the single player campaign's missions are unfortunately not playable as co op missions.The missions available in GTA V Online are fun and the large amount of them and the large amont of different game types together with having fun in the multiplayer free mode make GTA V Online a great experience and I would really like to give it 10/10 but unfortunately there are some notable issues.First one of these issues are the cheaters. In no other game have I seen as many cheaters as in GTA V (Online). The amount of them is so big that it is a great shame that Rockstar has not been able to control them. You can avoid cheaters completly by creating private session. That however prevents some free mode mission types. For some stupid reason the players tend to call the cheaters in GTA V Online as ""modders"". I really hope that stops because traditionally modders are completly different group of people. Modders are people who create modifications to games to add/modify content such as Forgotten hope 2 mod for BF2 or Prophesy of Pendor for Mount &amp Blade Warband.Second issue with GTA V Online is that it is possible to buy in game money with real money. This happens by buying ""Shark cards"". This makes GTA V online more or less pay to win. By money you can buy yourself for example CEO status and with that you get abilities unavailable to non CEO players other thing that gives obviuous advantage is buying vehicles.. You can of course grind enough in game cash to become CEO (like I did) and get vehicles. However that takes a lot of time and there are many different things you need in game money for such as buying apartments warehouses and motorcycle club persident status. Grinding ALL these without buying in game cash requires a massive amount of time for normal players. In addition some of the missions of GTA V online are locked behind CEO/Motorcycle club president status. About 2 years ago the grind needed to unlock all the stuff you ""need"" was still acceptable but nowadays with more content the time you need to grind is totally stupid especially for new players. As of writing this I have played over 800 hours of GTA and most of that in GTA V Online. That is a lot. I am still far from owning everything. I would say that you need about 400 hours to get all that you ""need"" (CEO+President+Couple of apartments+most important vehicles) and that is way too much time.The last problem in GTA V that I am going to list are the loading times and some related issues.1. The load times are massive even with current high end PC SSD.2. After a mission you have limited amount of choices for next game that you can vote about. I like the vote but the problem is that if none of the given choices is good the only opnion is to return to free mode to create new mission of yor liking. Going back to free mode requires loading so this thing worsdens issue 1 a lot.3. After many heist type co op missions you are forced to free mode. This worsens issue 1 a lot.4. If someone leaves heist type co op mission the mission fails automatically and you are forced to free mode. This worsens issue 1 a lot.5. Someimes after a mission you and your friends end up in different free mode session. This worsens issue 1 a lot6. sometimes loading to free mode gets stuck and instead of cancel and retry user must restart the game. This worsens the problem 1 a lot.7. To start private open world session you must first get into GTA V online or single player mode. This worsens problem 1 a lot.I think you see my point. The loading times a bad. Sometimes that is price you have to pay for great graphics etc. However what kind of an idiot decided that 2 3 4 and 5 6 and 7 are a good ideas especially in a game with massive loading times??!Despite all the flaws I listed for GTA V online it is so enjoyable that I have to give it 9/10.PS. The flight controls suck on Mouse+Keyboard. Rockstar please add joystick support next time and/or take a look at Battlefield 2 to see how to implement flight controls properly with mouse and keyboard.PPS. This game is so large that I would still like to say a lot of other things as well but to keep the review in somewhat acceptable size I must stop now.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-04,0,0,1580,False,Not Recommended,With over 1000 hours played I feel that I am qualified enough to write a thorough review on this game.I found the story mode to this game quite enjoyable great characters beautifully detailed and expansive open world map great story and sidequests and genuinely enjoyable gameplay that is well worth the $60 asking price. If you re looking to get this game purely for story mode by all means get it because it is a lot of fun.My problem with this game has to do with the online gamemode GTA Online has become a mess. The grind in this game is so ridiculous that playing it isn t enjoyable it begins to feel like a job. Everything especially the content added in the newest DLC is so overpriced that this game is beginning to feel like a free to play game. The prices are so exorbitant that players especially new players are almost forced to buy Shark Cards to be able to afford the new content. What makes matters worse is the fact that almost everything in the new DLC s is behind a paywall. The worst example of this is the content from the Gunrunning DLC in order to upgrade the new vehicles you first had to buy a bunker buy the staff equipment and security upgrades for the bunker then a Mobile Operations Center then a vehicle mod shop inside the MOC and then you had to pay for the research required to get the upgrades for your vehicle. Oh and don t forget the ludicrous price for the vehicles themselves.The content in the Smuggler s Run DLC (the most recent DLC as of me writing this review) has a cumulative price of almost 60 million in game dollars (58.9 million to be exact). The largest Shark Card that you can buy gives 8 million in game dollars for $100 of your hard earned cash. Some quick math would tell you that if you were to buy everything in this DLC with Shark Cards alone you would have to spend over $700.But remember the DLC is free .The game if you re like me and do not want to buy Shark Cards is very grindy. I however don t mind a grind. To be honest I feel like grinding makes the reward that much greater it makes you feel like you ve really earned what you wanted. My problem with the grinding in GTA Online especially because of recent DLC s is the fact that you can spend hours getting product for your businesses sourcing crates and cars etc. only to have some jerk come by and blow it all up. Rockstar in these recent DLC s is catering to the griefers who do this by adding more and more military/weaponized vehicles that are armoured can launch missiles can carpet bomb have explosive cannons and so forth making selling almost impossible. Those who are trying to sell their product are usually in a non armoured slow and thus incredibly vulnerable vehicle. What s worse is that griefers get rewarded for destroying your product. Again I normally enjoy the grind but unfortunately the game mechanic for grinding is entirely broken so you ll find yourself constantly wasting time and losing money. With this newest DLC I along with many other players have had our legitimate money taken from us without reason. Rockstar typically corrects everyone s account upon the new DLC s to get rid of illegitimate money given to players by modders. (Modders giving players money is a common form of griefing because it flags your account and could get you banned). However this time people again myself included have had millions of their legitimate hard earned money taken from them without reason. The community has been trying to contact Rockstar support to get this issue fixed so much in fact that they shut down their phone line and have edited their typical bot answer of we adjusted your in game funds to remove illegitimate money no further action is required. to include If you keep contacting us about this issue you could get banned . (This is a summary of what they say not word for word). Nothing has been said by them to address the issue no apologies etc. This happened close to around two weeks ago. Rockstar s blatant lack of customer loyalty made very obvious by this event is the last straw for myself as well as a significant portion of the community. TL DR do not buy this game if you are only buying it for online because it will be a huge waste of your time and money. I have enjoyed this game in the past (such should be obvious by my hours) but until the issues I mentioned have been addressed I cannot recommend this game to new players.,Grand Theft Auto V

This sentance alone should sum up this review in a nut shell.If I was writing this review back in 2015 a few weeks after the inital release of Grand Theft Auto V during which I sadly stayed up all night unlocking the files for 2 hours eagerly anticipating my much beloved game on the PC this review would be praising rockstar for delivering one of the most engaging and simply fun openworld games to date. The game initally was a game where you and a few friends would spend literal weeks of your summer carrying out heists racing roleplaying creating in game movies deathmatching grinding and simply enjoying the game for what it is or should I say was. However after leaving the game for a while due to real life reponsibilities like ""education"" and a ""career"" I came back to the game only to discover that it was infested with hackers. Not only was our once beloved open world game crawling with filthy money spawning trolls but Rockstar had decided that instead of delivering an amazing game with a steady flow of content for their fans they would milk the absolute out of micro transactions. What ensued was a flurry of new cars golden jets super yachts clubhouses cartels businesses all of which were clearly far too expensive to purchase with legitimite in game currency earned with blood and sweat through hours of endless heists races and game modes. These computer generated bonuses were inscentivising users to throw their hard earned cash at Rockstar for in game content. Well done you've spent 79.99 on a ing computer generated yacht which by the way doesn't do anything except shoot intruders with missles and allow your character to get of their head at the inside bar. That was really worth the 16 hours at your local McDonalds racking up fries.If microtransactions didn't take your fancy then you turned to hacking or seeking help from a hacker. They would spawn you in 10 million dollars in 10 minutes completely destroying the game and defeating the point of everything. You would create your Yacht stand on it and realise that now you had the much desired exclusive feature of GTA V what was the ing point. You in your need for glory skipped hours of legitimate fun from heisting to asking some kid in his pants at his computer covered in dorito dust and mountain dew stains for a freebie which also makes your account look suspicious as as Xxx_BOSSMAN69_xxX apparently has earned 200 million ingame dollars thorugh jobs and is level 19. Using this illigitimate money was and is also tracable by Rockstar as the majority of these dumb s decided to bank the 49 million dollars gifted to them by Hackers only to receive a week month lifetime ban during which their money is set to 0 and losing all legitimate cash they had or even worse their entire accounts.

2017-06-27,1,1,225,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar has recently decided that their playerbase is only good for their wallets. That's right our beloved GTA developer is following the path of EA. Adding microtransactions was one thing but then they started banning innocent players from online while the hacker A holes continue to run rampant. The hacked money wouldn't even be a big deal if Take Two wasn't using the monetary system as a way of milking the players for those damn Shark cards. Instead of trying to fix the mess they've made WORSE Take Two shot themselves in the foot with a nuke by attacking the modding community with the cease and desist sent to Open IV the tool made specifically for harmless SINGLE PLAYER mods.Do yourself a favor and don't let them take advantage of you with that shark card B.S. If you want to enjoy GTA 5 (and the singleplayer campaign is quite good) I reccomend just pirating it and installing the Iron Man mod. Way more fun than the garbage online mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-15,0,0,1196,False,Not Recommended,Literally this piece of trash game. The single player is alright but once you finish it once it's boring. After that you decide you're going to try out GTA Online. Or maybe you baught GTAV just for the online. However you'll quickly find out that it's infested with a ton of modders who suck at the game so they have to cheat by modding in explosive ammunition god mode and they have to ruin all of your open session missions for your Motorcycle Club or your SecuroServ CEO status. Then there's the other bag modders who decide to blow up everyone in the server over and over or those who want to sell their time in order to give you in game money for $5 a minute or some and if you trash talk them they crash your game. So basically unless you're in an empty session or a private lobby of your own you're ed. Rockstar doesn't care about you your gameplay or their own games in general. They never even try when it comes to the modders. Literally every one of their games are just big cash grabs and it's surprising how they haven't abandoned GTAV yet. The only reason they haven't is for the money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-05,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Summary Massive content Multiplayer Yes up to 30Completion 47 hrsCards NoCloud No but the online portion is saved on Rockstar's serversSave location Drive Users (username) Documents Rockstar Games GTA V ProfilesGrand Theft Auto V tells the intertwining story between three professional heisters and their run ins with well everybody. What's unique is that you are (eventually) able to switch between any of these characters on a whim to enjoy seeing each story unfold at your leisure. This review focuses mainly on the single player aspect as that is my main reason for playing.The first thing I remember thinking about GTA V is the raw amount of content. It's mind blowing. I haven't remotely explored every nook and cranny of the landscape they crafted. The folks at Rockstar hand crafted an entire island and I have no idea what sorts of easter eggs I must have missed out on. While there is a fair amount of boring terrain the detail in other places is quite high. I absolutely love the architecture. Every home looks lived in not just some assets arranged in an orderly fashion.The acting is pretty amazing in this game as well. Everyone is damaged. I thought Mike was the one with anger issues but boy was I wrong. Overall the sound design is pretty solid... except that none of the radio stations really stood out to me. It's just a personal thing though and I listen to my own music anyway.The game could use some better tutorials. I never completely accustomed myself to the method of keeping new cars shopping investing or using the internet. Also I would have liked to see optional mission objectives off to the side during the mission I am on. Also while overall the controls are standard when you get into certain vehicles particularly of the VTOL/aquatic types the keyboard controls get all weird. Thankfully you can rebind virtually anything in this game.One great underrated feature about GTA V is the fact that it runs reasonably well on relatively poor machines provided you adjust the settings as necessary. Loading times are still a bit crippling but once loaded it's generally smooth. To the best of my knowledge the game requires an internet connection to play which is highly irritating when I just want to play the campaign. Sadly you cannot play the campaign in multiplayer either. While you cannot make your own avatar for the campaign you can customize your main three protagonists to a limited extent. You can however make your own avatar for the online portion of the game.Overall Grand Theft Auto V was a fantastic experience. I give GTAV a B+ with the glaring flaw of online integration on a portion of the game that did not need it. I recommend a gamepad at least for the driving sequences as keyboard is kind of awful for that. Thanks for the copy tetro!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-24,0,0,5308,False,Not Recommended,"Overall Rating Story Mode 4 of 5.Online Mode 0 of 5.Story Review When I first purchased this game on the PS3 in 2013 I admit I was hooked. The storyline and unique gameplay elements following three simultaneous main characters was amazing. I was a bit disappointed to see that the upper end super cars were gated behind in game cash and the on map player garages glitched out and deleted cars pretty often. But heists were intense and challenging. and all the secrets in the game will take a literal eternity to find. I achieved 100% completion on the PS3 version in the hardcore span of about 3 weeks. I went from there to Online carrying a mastery of the game behind me. The PC version released and since my main gaming platform is PC I picked it up when it went on sale. There is ABSOLUTELY no story difference between the old gen version of this game and the new gen version. The new gen version gives you access to a new race mode and a flight school wannabe mode a couple dozen new cars and that's it.TL DR if you want to play this for the gameplay or the story buy the PS3 version used from a Game Exchange for 10 bucks there's no reason to sink 5x that into a game over 6 years old.Online Review I picked up GTA O in October of 2013 and I suppose I have the hours on record to prove it. In the early years of GTA O things were much more fun. Sure lobbies were more like deathmatches back then but that was the nature of the beast.I have to admit I had fun playing the game online and under normal circumstances this game would have been reviewed much higher.GTA Online has the following problem This version of the game has an in game transaction system that allows players to buy in game currency.They currently have instated a security system that suspends and bans players without reason.On the surface it looks like an innocent way of providing newer players an advantage by investing real life money into the game.However as witnessed by many of the legitimate player base (myself included). The anti cheater system doesn't actually target cheaters. And for those unfortunate to get caught in a ""ban wave"" you get the following message This is a message from Rockstar Games. Your account was used in violation of our Terms of Service and/or EULA found here http //www.rockstargames.com/legalhttp //www.rockstargames.com/eulaAs a result your account has been suspended from playing GTA Online on PC for 30 days.

2018-08-29,0,0,1144,False,Not Recommended,Over a thousand hours of playtime on PC and countless more on PS3 and PS4 then suddenly banned out of the blue for no reason. I despise modders and hackers as they ruin the game and I actively avoid them. I don't even attack people I am just a friendly player that minds their own business. Seems funny how so many obvious modders are still running riot and nothing happens to them but innocent players like myself take the hit for their t.Everyone's response to this is that I MUST have done something to deserve the ban. If playing legitimately for 5 years and grinding for hours and hours while those around me press a single button to get the same reward then clearly I was playing the game wrong as modding seems to be the normal way to play now and nothing happens to you.Don't waste your time progressing in online because you'll just lose it all.

2017-06-15,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,So I mostly played this on my Xbox one ergo why I haven't clocked many hours on PC.This game's pretty smooth controls and it's just generally a good GTA game if you want it.However certain events some recent some not have made this game a no buy in my book.Firstly the multiplayer is pretty much ruined. It's almost impossible to find a game that isn't plagued by hackers and cheaters. The publisher and developer haven't taken any steps to fix this problem that's been around for 2 years now. This is certainly funny if you're watching a youtube video but it gets old quickly.Second it no longer runs well on most PC systems. I don't know what happened but a few patches ago changed the game so that it's now far more taxing on most systems. Systems like mine with a GTX1080 are barely able to hit a solid 50fps even in single player. And there doesn't seem to be any consisteny to it. I've had friends with specs far less than mine be able to run this game just fine but they're the minority.Thirdly the publishers which are NOT Rockstar Games but actually Take Two Interactive have suddenly threatened modding teams with legal action. As a result almost all mods are now completely unavailable. You know mods the things that've kept this game current for 2 years?Terrible anti consumer practices by the publishers and shoddy work all around.So yeah don't buy this game. At the very least don't buy it on PC 'cause there's no reason to any more. Even if you did get it to run without too many problems it's still the worst version.,Grand Theft Auto V

At first it was so much fun to grind and get new items guns and cars. It felt like I was working to a true goal and felt rewarded with every purhase.But at this point after not playing for more than a year I come back to a game filled with hackers modders and players that do nothing but hunt other players in lobbies because the game has become so stall that's all people can do. You earn the same amount of money but compared to the original vehicles it's only a fraction of the cost per mission. Back when you earned 15k and the most expensive car was $1mil you could see the finish line but now to have a decent time you need to spend Millions of dollars to make a dent that never trully feels rewarding.The overall grinding has just increased with the same payout with higher costs and more toxic community than before. At this point GTA Online has just become a way to milk sharkcards to fill R* every greediness. It was fun while it lasted but now it's just boring stale and just not worth the time it takes to make ingame money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-31,3,1,251,False,Recommended,Hello! In this review I show you very basic methods on how to become rich and buy everything you want in GTA Online. Lets get started!Method A 1. Play every job on the game2. Realize what jobs pay the most3. Grind those same jobs for hundreds and maybe thousands of hours4. Go to GTA V Steam Discussions and start an argument with every user who complains that GTA Online requires too much grind5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until you become bored or until you get everything you want and become rich6. Finally have fun using all the stuff that you spent hundred of hours grinding for7. Get bored 30 minutes after starting step 6 and realize that those hundreds of hours were a waste8. Uninstall GTA V and start playing another gameMethod B 1.

2015-08-02,0,0,223,False,Recommended,"Definitely a lesson in ""quality over quantity"" at least in regards to the singleplayer story mode. The story is good (much better than GTA4) and definitely worth the asking price alone. Unfortunatly there is a lot of wasted potential and once the story is over the side activities are minimal. Story mode is what it is and that's all. While everything is pretty and the gameplay has been improved as a sandbox open world its not that great. Clearly the intention was for all the side activities to be for GTA online and only the story for single player. Heists are really cool but you will only do a couple in singleplayer as part of the story. Story mode really isn't a sandbox that's GTA online.So its a bit of a disappointment on the singleplayer side of things. I expected a lot more. Never the less I recommend it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-14,0,0,662,False,Recommended,I think the game at it's core is very fun and addictive. There are many things I love about this game The physics based movement that reacts to inclines and character balance the vehicle customization that they have added back from GTA San Andreas the beautiful city of Los Santos and the wide sprawling forests near the mountains. I think the story is cinematic and definitely would feel right at home as an action movie. They went all out with the cinematic action scenes and destruction that the other games didn't really have much of (Except TBoGT). The weapon customization was a nice cherry on top of this polished sundae as a little added bonus. Extended clips flashlights and gold finishes. The story isn't as dark and sinister as the underbelly of the American Dream that GTA IV was but it's still a fun and intersting enough story with lots of characters and side mission to keep me entertained enough to finish it. The story mode is loaded with hours of content and easter eggs to the point you'll get easily over 15 hours of solid playtime in missions alone. Not to mention the various activities like tennis and golf. Sadly there will be no more bowling with Roman. The map is pretty big enough that you may get tired of going all the way across it and it's loaded with things to find.Now let's get to the multiplayer a lot of people complain about. Number one The NPC's are too un balanced. They have lock on aim that can easily hit you when no normal human can. Number Two They will soak down rounds in a lot of cases before they drop dead peppering you with rounds in the process. Number Three Along with thier Robo Cop aim they do tons of damage and I've been killed in less than a second in some cases.Now to the good stuff about it. Number One It has tons of character customization like clothes tattoos hair cuts various styles to wear certain clothing and layered outfits that allow you to wear your favorite shirt under whatever jacket. Number Two The vehicles have a ton of customization that you can choose from. You can turbo tune your rides custom rims liveries spoilers and specialized vehicles with military grade weapons and rocket boosts. I'm not trying to sell this game to anyone I'm just trying to mix the good with the bad especially since I'm tired of everyone complaining about the game. A lot of people say the game is only because of one aspect the online. When they do that they are only rating one half of the game as a whole and I'm sick of it. Nobody talks about if the story is any good or about the game mechanics. Everyone usually says the game is bad because the multiplayer sucks. I thinks the story itself is great and proves not all modern games are I don't really have a problem with the single player as a game. The online may not be the best but look at the good in it as well. Hopefully after reading this you may consider these things before writting a review trashing the game because you lost your charcter or you got banned. To be blunt a lot of people won't care because they want to know if the game is good and those reviews don't help. So please be constructive and critique the whole package not just a piece of it lots of people may not even play.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA online has become a micro transaction laden hell hole where cheaters are allowed to run rampant as long as they don't give players in game currency. So kill you 20 times in a row randomly even if you are in a safe zone like your appartment? That's fibe. Give you in game cash to buy new weapon skibs? BAN for both the cheater and you. Why? Because take2 make money from people paying real money for in game currency.Don't get me wrong i understand that companies exsist to make money. I don't have a problem with that.

2018-06-26,0,0,295,False,Not Recommended,It's a hard knock life Back in 2013 I could have easily recommended the single player portion of this game and even to this day I still can but the multiplayer is now the golden goose of Rockstar Games. Coming soon is another update that will be implementing Nightclubs which is another way to make easy money as a player. However it's going to be incredibly expensive. This is not Grand Theft Auto anymore this is a pay to win sh*t show that makes having fun a chore and more of a barter with your wallet. Seriously starter packs? Thats not GTA. I never condone microtransactions unless they're done right and Rockstar has russled my feathers since they have removed money from my account because some punk $$ modder dropped 20k on me resulting in continuous amounts of money to be removed from my in game account and making that money back in a legit manner is next to impossible even with all of my many ways of making money since players love to destroy my progress. Maybe if Rockstar got their heads out of their asses and added these money making methods to private servers maybe my tune would change but no they won't do it. Also the amount of hackes is still incredibly high and all of these OP means of killing one another is really getting tiresome. And I know what you're thinking and yes I use to love play GTAO but at this point it's getting stale and it's just...not fun. And it breaks my heart seeing the game go down this path and the ironic part is how Rockstar promotes game modes that are giving double cash and RP but guess what. No one plays them. Because why should they? Especially when you can just buy money making the entire point of stealing and being a crook pretty much pointless. Rockstar should undo all of the money nerfs and make it easier for players to enjoy the game instead of flushing players away with this practice.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,GTA V singleplayer is pretty good and would probably warrant buying it on saleHowever Rockstar lied about sp dlc any extra content can only be found in GTA Online right now which either requires large sums of microtransactions months of grinding or hacks (which are obscenely common). Whats more is that modding was recently disallowed so your best bet is to cheat to actually have any fun in online which is an incredibly sad thing to sayALSO if you actually want to play online expect 1/4 or more of your total game time to be loading screens. This is not an exaggeration the load times are actually that atrocious,Grand Theft Auto V

Noone else is saying it so I'll say it the campaign in GTA5 is GARBAGE!!! The multiplayer is a disaster of poor decisions (particularly in poor anticheat and microtransactions) the absolute contempt with which R* holds modders that want to improve the experience is disgusting and back to that first point THE STORY IS GARBAGE!!!!I know a lot of people enjoyed it but I didn't never even finished single player. Completely uninteresting characters (michael has a couple good moments and of course Franklin is likeable but dull) by the numbers plot that doesn't engage me for anything aside from heists (few and far between) and of course that awesome ""emotional"" decision at the end to save trevor (unsympathetic psychopath) or Michael (person lost in suburban life) that failed to elicit any response from me (I watched a friend play the ending it was lame) especially when you can save them BOTH!GTA5 is a parody of itself they wanted to make it so big and grandiose seeming that they neglected to have good content or at least allow modders to fix it up.

Which this game is said to be 'One of the highest profitting games out there' thats true because on top of the fact they have microtranactions they relesed the game on the PS3 PS4 Xbox 360 Xbox One and computer. There is also still simple bugs with this game what simply shouldn't exist but yet again these things can be unavoidable but a lot of it is simple mistakes. For me to fully review this as positive I think changes should be made but yet again why change it since their buisness modal works they wont. On top of that the recent negative publicity they got has worked againtst them quite a lot I don't understand why they would go against a lot of their players like that I personally don't use the program or any other like it. But I understand that many people brought it for the PC for modding compatability and that it is also a big part of the commnuity.I would get into single player... But that's a whole differnt story of what why and comparing to past games basically go and watch a dramtic heist film and you get the genual idea. But in execution mechnicates etc I can say it is a nicely built game but I see more issues now than pros.. I might change this review at some point to Recomended as it could just be how I feel right now but I don't know.. I struggle to with what to mark it honestly..

2016-01-01,0,0,2367,False,Recommended,I have now reviewed this game three times. All of them over something R* or their parent company Take Two have done in regard to the community.I feel so bad for the coders artists and editors that brought us a beautiful experience that I enjoyed (And will continue enjoying despite the recent drama) for literally thousands of hours. That being said the actions of the legal staff and I'm sure the higher ups that were commanding that team are reprehensible and cannot be encouraged by our community. Unless something changes in this regard I will never buy another title linked to Take Two interactive in the slightest and will make sure I tell people to stop buying this cash cow until this is resolved.UPDATE Rockstar did an amazing thing for the community and stopped the legal action against the single player mods on this game coming from Take Two. Therefore I can absolutely recommend this game again. Thank you.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-02-06,0,0,309,False,Not Recommended,GTA Online is absolutely awful now. This game used to be fun for me but now every time I connect to an online session there is someone flying around in a car with rockets on it just blowing your cars up over and over. People are driving around in these weird Mad Max style vehicles that just ram you off the road and destroy your car. Saw someone flying around on a motorcycle with rocket launchers. I feel like I'm playing Saint's Row. These new vehicles are so powerful and over the top people use these to just bully constantly. GTA Online has become so stale because of this. This happens to me everygame and it's just not enjoyable. I understand you are going to get shot at in GTA Online but if I'm just getting spawn killed over and over again by someone on a fictional flying rocket launching motorbike that travels faster than I can get away from it I'm out.,Grand Theft Auto V

Next to the obvious bandwagon of hate for taking down single player modding tools that have been around for years with no problem before doing something about cheaters I'd like to remind everyone that this fully priced game has microtransactions. Well micro is a big word because the prices for virtual money are disgusting. Futhermore rockstar failed to deliver on single player DLC since they noticed that they can just make a new color for a car and call it an gta online update and make money that way instead.Congratulations on ruining one of the most solid game dev reputations on the market carefully build up over more than a decade in a single week.

2018-05-08,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Pros Very fun multiplayer with friends large but populated open world great storyCons Grinding in multiplayer is pretty bad Rockstar doesn't allow singleplayer modding rampant pay to win microtransaction but worst of all The loading times in this game are absolutely atrocious. Even on a SSD it takes way too long to get in a server and every time you join a job or lobby it takes ages. Sometimes it felt I spent more time in loading screens than actual game time. Overall I'd still recommend it as it is still a blast with friends but if you are playing solo perhaps look elsewhere,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,150,False,Not Recommended,this,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-06-27,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Can reccomend this for singleplayer but (and here's the rant) this game's nearly half decade old online is absolute garbage for new players.And here's why 1. Balance this game's online has been fashioned in such a way that new characters (if playing in public lobbies) will always be targets everyone who is high level will tend to have high end gear that can't be countered (like a rocket motorcycle or an OP vtol plane because why not) by the starting gear. Also to even get to the higher ranks and afford better gear and vehicles you've gotta either sell your soul to rockstar and buy sharkcards or grind for hours.2. Age Minor complaint but the gameplay gets old fast and yes like stated earlier this is kinda normal for the game being nearly half a decade old. Despite that I kinda wish the new gamemodes for online weren't so similar (aka deathmatch style or races) since the older gamemodes (which honestly felt more diverse) are overshadowed by these new gamemodes.3. Community If you thought this game would have more adult or mature players then you were completely wrong. A good populace of your average public lobby is people who probably shouldn't be playing the game or those who troll for the fun of it. (this could be solved easily via the solo lobby trick or joining a crew but still can occur in those lobby types too)Overall Singleplayer is a gem of the decade multiplayer is a hot pile of trash (instead use something like fivem for online (there's more communities for all types of players without all the grinding or other issues from above)).,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-24,0,0,435,False,Recommended,So Ladies and Gentlemen.(Please read full review. The update is at the end.)Yesterday my account got suspended. Now firstly it got suspended for winning a race. Yes you read that correctly I won a race. Secondly I don't use Mods / cheats to enhance my game. I can see why people would but personally I don't. So It started with the New hotring race as I bought a custom car and enjoyed the game mode a lot. In it were 8 people when the race started there were only 3. Me another person and an AFK. After the first lap the active one left. Deciding I would continue the race anyhow I completed the 7/7 laps. Finally crossing the finish line the camera give a short few seconds of you crossing the line. It did this however after I crossed it it got stuck viewing the track for about 5 minutes. After waiting it panned to my character and a black screen saying that my account was suspended. I did nothing wrong. So I made contact with rockstar explaining what had happened. I asked them to give me an explanation if I had breached their EULA and banning policy (Which I didn't)Around 10 hours later.I got a responce saying something on the lines of Your acount has been suspended for 30 days factors that can affect these are (Insert a few from the banning policy here). Your stats / money and progress will be reset. They didn't even tell me what I was suspended for (The terms I supposedly breached) neither did they continue the investigation further. That was it. I have responded to their email and will continue to endevour to get my account to its original state back.(Update)Rockstar from the 28.3.18 has returned my account to its original state alhough I'm happy and pleased that they have done this and realise what they performed was pure foolery this really shouldn't of happened in the first place.So do I recommend this game. Of course but in terms of the Singleplayer game. Multiplayer please be wary it is full of modders which will most likely hinder your game experience. If you can find lobbies without them and have a few friends this is great platform to play.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,482,False,Recommended,I bought this game originally on its initial launch day for PS3 at almost exactly the stroke of midnight. I played the crud out of it beating the single player without cheats or guides and landing over 80% completion for my troubles (I would've gotten to 100% still without cheats or guides but GTa Online cut that venture short). So why would I pony up the $60 to buy it again on PC?Simply put GTA V is the best game ever made. And this isn't something I say lightly.The missions are intelligent well planned hilarious and even sometimes thought provoking. The gameplay is carefully engineered and entirely meshed out. There's easily a solid 100+ hours of gameplay in single player alone. And the game world is nothing short of spectacular. If you've seen a more fascinating finely detailed and mind bogglingly massive game world in another game I'd love to hear what it is because to the best of my own knowledge it simply doesn't exist.GTA online is almost insultingly fun. That's a strange word to use there I know. But you'll be insulted by a number of other game developers who failed to deliver experiences like this in the past. It's a proper MMO built around the famed GTA gameplay and it's quite easy to get lost in such an immersive experience. I dare say that of all the MMO's for me anyway this has been the greatest of the day slayers.Coming into this from PlayStation 3 and having watched extensive videos online of gameplay from PS4/ XB1 I can confidently say that the PC version blows the others straight out of the water in the graphics and audio department. But that's to be expected from the glorious PC master race of course. No console can hold a candle to the raw power of the PC.Having said that there are a few hiccups with this version when compared to the PS3 version. For starters aircraft controls with keyboard and mouse are simply the very worst of any game ever. If you have a controller as I do that's not a big deal. But flying controls are seriously terrible and Rockstar should feel ashamed for how poorly planned this aspect of gameplay is. Worse still you can't use a joystick so this game will cost you an additional $3 so you can buy a feather duster in order to keep your fancy pants Saitek X52 in good standing. Why this game doesn't allow for joystick input for flying is well beyond anyone. Huge oversight there Rockstar.But the biggest beef I have with the PC version? So far Rockstar haven't made any efforts toward helping out the modding community presumably in an effort to curb cheating in GTA Online. Of course this would be easily solved if they'd just rent out modded servers to players and create separate characters for those servers no cheating Rockstar gets paid we get mods everyone wins but somehow no one at their studio has come up with this remarkably simple solution yet.All told despite the few issues the game has GTA V is in my opinion the best game ever made. It checks every single box. Excellent gameplay a brilliant story immersive online play hundreds of hours worth of gameplay breathtaking graphics and audio tons of aesthetic and interactive detail the freedom to explore and stuff to find when you do... this game offers everything I've ever wanted out of a game and then some. I just wish I could use my flippin' joystick while experiencing it all.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have tried just about every possible fix for this. Including uninstalling and reinstalling the game. This is completely game breaking. It won't even function on the lowest settings anymore.

2017-12-29,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,With 200 hours in this game I feel comfortable saying the base game is worth about $20 at this point.The campaign is ok the special abilities either being slow time (not bullet time since most weaponts are hitscan and the driving version is a bit midnight club) or Trevor's rage mode which is less on damage resistance and a damage multiplier but more of a mode that makes him drop more quips of aggression while fighting. the story kinda ends sorta meh for something as long as 24ish hours (I did take my time) but still fun for a little joyride.the gunplay is ok but most of the riffles feel the same. automatic weapons still have a bug where a single shot will still registers an audio queue like several shots were fired. the scope attachments for 1st person are mostly dot sights that kinda suck. they are so dim during the day that they look more like a orange or green paint texture than you know a DOT SIGHT. flashights also have a problem with the light fog in 1st person as well. the game is bright enough that you dont really need them in the first place but when you use them the fog is so bad it makes it harder to see unless you are in 3rd person. something that should have been fixed since release. the other upgrades are pretty standard and basic and don't help differentiate all the types of pistols or rifles. also on a side note the LMGs feel like rifles that shoot slower are less accurate but compensate for extra ammo. With an update a while back that can give the ak a drum magazine it almost makes no sense to use them anymore.The driving is good better with a controller. Car mods are still bountiful still no nitro boost but the sports cars are still dope. It's GTA and cars what do you expect.The AI is ok. you can walk up to just about anyone on the street talk (press e) and have two or three phrase exchange before someone drops an insult. One guy had a bagle and was trying to sell stocks it was great. Even talked to a police officer after he shot a guy and he said hi back. Attack wise enemy characters will take some cover and trade shots before hiding. However there is an insane amount of B.S. regarding them knowing your current position at all times. Ever had a gunfight hid three allys away when backup arrives to the seen just for them to start hustling directly to you instead of scouting the area? this whole system makes the silencer feel pointless as attack action (even a fistfight) will give away your position.The Police system is weird. Got a silenced pistol and shoot something in the baren desert area? One star. Cop car cuts you off in traffic while you pretend to be a saine driver just this once? Three stars weapons drawn and a chopper is on the way... for a fender bender. For reducing their wanted system from six to five stars I've hardly ever seen the Two star level. The police just get aggresive way to fast.Most of these gripes just affect the single player. Multiplayer is where the game ceases to be GTA and becomes a MMO grindfest. The focus in Online play is to unlock the faster cars better appartments boats and bases to earn even more money. Money earned in heists offset by how long it takes to set them up (also prepare for people to drop out of a 30min setup or die just to restart the thing over again all the time) and smaller missions payout is hardly incentivising besides the ability to pick up some free ammo during a run. Races are fun the tracks that are available are pretty great. Overall the aspect of the multiplay is FINE but the execution is handled poorly.The biggest problem here is the Shark card system most likely added in by Take2. It's not a bad way to incentivise players to spend a bit more to play a game with items behind large paywalls but the porblem comes with the inequality and hackers this system attracts. anyone who does not buy a shark card can expect 40+ hours of repeating the same heists over and over until they can just afford a stock super car. At the same time someone else can spend $20 buy an exotic with all upgrades and already have a competetive advantage in any racing mode. Better yet these users can also afford armored vehicals as well making them nearly invulnurable in free roam as they mow down players. I don't need to get into hackers you're reading this far you should already know about this in GTA. Lobbys seem less full people are leaving the game and yet the imbalance is still there.

I have changed my stance.

Think Forge but for GTA. Open IV only affects the singleplayer without touching the multiplayer so it can't be used to cheat.

Take Two would still have it their way and OpenIV would still be down if Rockstar didn't step in. As long as Take Two is part of this game series and as long as Rockstar keeps working with Take Two none of it should be support. Forgiving them and taking your negative review away would be like forgiving someone that stole from you only because their parents said sorry and gave it back.

Playing online is a pain in the because of the modders. I joined a random session and I tried to leave because I was quickly put in a cage and I got a 5 000$ bounty on me. I can't join my friends or join a new session. I made a new charater and I was able to escape like that but when I went back to my old character I was still in the same modded server. I then looked up everyone's name on Social Club and blocked everyone thinking I would be put in a new server. NOPE it just put me in a similar server with different people. What is weird too is that I spawn in the same place when I leave or swap charater. This just ruined the fun for the whole online expirence.

From large chunks of the map missing nonstop rubberbanding and getting killed by people who arent even in the same dimensional plane as you. Rockstar cares so much about people who want easy dough. They care so much that they spend all their time banning people and dont solve the real problems. I like how rockstar pumps out DLC all the time which is actually halfway decent but they fail to realize the only people who come back to buy their new content is the people who cheat their money in because nobody can ing afford that overpriced t.

2017-11-29,0,0,94,False,Not Recommended,This was a great game until Rockstar made online gameplay very difficult to enjoy for those who are too broke to afford the new DLCs. Shark cards have become necessary unless you wanna grind your life away as if you don't have a real job to grind for as it is. This game would still be pretty good if the new DLCs were available in story mode so you don't have to worry about grinding as much with other players griefing you online. The new vehicles and weapon upgrades are just too OP and make it impossible for anyone without them to have any fun in a public lobby. Many of these vehicles are personal vehicles so it costs you money to destroy it and as if that wasn't bad enough they could just respawn it right next to them after you finally destroy it. What is ironic is that vehicles that pose less of threat such as the Phantom Wedge Wastelander and Rocket Voltic have a ten minute cooldown period before being able to request again while the Oppressor APC and Mobile Operations Center virtually have no cooldown period. If you wanna actually enjoy playing online you should avoid public lobbies or play with a group of friends to hold your own without having to activate passive mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

Buying Grand Theft Auto V on Steam for PC gets you access to both the legendary Story Mode and the infamous GTA Online. The Story Mode for Grand Theft Auto V is awesome the physics the graphics the sickening level of detail the characters and story it's all fantastic...but do not get me started on GTA Online. Don't take my review for it feel free to read how other people have innocently gotten banned. As far as I know I have not but it's probably because I avoid GTA Online like the plague. And here's why I played GTA Online and built my character up to Rank 148 on the Xbox One (sadly those hours aren't logged in my Steam hour count). Rockstar apparently only let you transfer your character from Xbox One to PC for a brief period of time and I happened to miss the window so I had to start over (wow just wow).Not only that but there are MANY other issues with GTA Online. It's horribly unbalanced other players are jerks and uncooperative the missions you can do by yourself are annoyingly repetitive you're in a constant PvP situation whether you want to be or not (genius) the only way you can ""earn"" enough money to buy anything is to buy Shark Cards and even if that's not enough by the looks of it I'd say every innocent person on the planet is getting banned left and right and yet the actual hackers and cheaters walk free and I know because I kept encountering them!I love the Grand Theft Auto series especially Grand Theft Auto V but I cannot forgive Rockstar for so badly screwing up GTA Online or as I call it ""Rockstar's biggest mistake."" GTA Online had enormous potential to be a great fun way to keep playing Grand Theft Auto V post Story Mode and even post 100% Completion (if you're like me and accomplished it) especially with the introduction of the Heists.

2018-09-05,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,YOU CANNOT TRANSFER YOUR ONLINE CHARACTER/PROGRESS FROM PS3/XBOX 360/PS4/XBOX ONE (!!)I've been playing GTA since 1997 and have been an avid fan of the franchise. If you're new to GTA V then I absolutely recommend it. The story mode is great and there's absolutely lots of fun to be had for many hours. And if you have a bunch of friends who also have GTA V then the online experience can be a lot fun too. However why do I not recommend the game then? Why is there a big red thumbs down above this text then? Well from my point of view here's why I don't recommend GTA V Online ResetIf and only if you have played GTA Online before and you were hoping to transfer your online character and all of your online progress to your newly purchased GTA V PC version then forget about it. They removed this option since March 2017. Thanks Rockstar Games! I've just recently made a gaming rig for myself after being a PlayStation gamer for a long time. So my hundreds of hours of GTA Online progress cannot be transferred to my PC version of the game. So my purchase was all for naught and I'm not about to start all over again. Extremely GrindyEven if you're new to GTA V you should know that GTA Online is extremely grindy. It's worse than your run of the mill JRPG. You really have to grind a lot OR... pay for a shark card to have a decent amount of in game money in order to be able to have some good fun on GTA Online. If you're someone who is used to and enjoys games where the grind is real then this probably won't be a problem for you. But I'd rather have say 20 hours of fun instead of 200 hours of grind so that I can have 20 hours of fun.Rockstar Games is turning me offThis is my personal opinion and perception of Rockstar Games but I really don't like how they're treating their player base as of late. They ban people who use GTA mods for GTA V Story Mode (Offline!!!) they've constructed GTA Online so that you either waste money or time (grind or pay up for shark cards for in game money) They've removed the option to import your character and progress if you're (permanently) switching platforms etc. It just doesn't sit well with me.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,1,1,256,False,Not Recommended,The game used to be good. Now they add content that costs so much it's almost impossible to buy half of it. Also they forced OpenIV to stop development on its modding tool that only affected single player. I'm never going to buy a game from Take2 again. Complete waste of money.Update New DLC. Waste of money. Everything costs a bunch up to the point where the only way to buy anything is to use Shark Cards.

2018-05-10,1,1,1,False,Not Recommended,Decided to buy this game for the 3rd time since it was on sale for $30. However I realized after buying and getting to the online setup that they stopped doing character transfers from other platforms.I have requested a refund as I would rather not have to start all over again when I have been playing online since day one and have spent over 600 hours building up a level 240 character with pretty much everything in the game purchased on another platform I refuse to do that all again. Especially after all the cheaters I saw in the single lobby I joined.Edit (August 2018) Just realized Rockstar dropped the base price down to $30 now. I may actually reconsider buying it now depending on how cheap it goes on sale at the new price. Even then though I would most likely steer clear of official servers at this point and use FiveM Rockstar gives too many fake bans and it isn't worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-14,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,After playing a decent amount of hours on this game I have seen a lot of good and bad things. Before I go further explaining in detail why I would't recommend this game I would like to summarize this game with one word 'Frustrating'Don't get me wrong Rockstar made a badass game. The campaign and solo play is incredible and gives a lot of freedom. You can just go for the main mission in one go or get seduced by the many side quest that are present. Giving a lot of funny cutscenes and memorable events this game aced the solo play in my opinion. BUT this is not why yu buy GTA V. You buy GTA V for the mulitplayer and in here is were hits the fan.First I want to start with the things that GTA online does well. First of all there is a lot of mission side quest or other ways to get money. The game gives so much freedom to evolve your character (customisation is a bit limited when it comes the general appearence but this isnt that much of an issue) starting from a street thug who slowly earns money stealing car or trading drugs to a fully moneymaking machine with running buisnesses and thousand of cool and fun vehicle's who can be perfectly made to the players like and will. You never get bored playing this game but there are a few aspect to consider before buying this game.Community Maybe not that much of a suprise considering that almost every multyplayer game has s in it but GTA online has one of the most toxic frustrating and just plain annoying community I ever experienced. Starting with the fact that you can only report somebody else for an abusive name or clantag. This means that the world is open for you to completly up somebodies gaming experience. Disturbing missions trolling in missions destroying expensive properties raiding parties toxic voice and textchat insults killing for no reason...The list keeps growing. Yea there are invite only or even solo session for you to enjoy the game but most mission that deliver actuall money require you to be in a public server starting from 1 to up to 30 people in one session. (I talk more about this later). I really recommend that you buy and play this game with a group of friends. You're gonna have a hard time looking for friendly players and with friends in a private session you ill have a blast.Missions I praised GTA online earlier for his rich variety of mission but the mission that will actuall make good money are from buisnesses nightclubs motercycle clubs selling goods ... . I don't really have a problem with this because it makes you feel like an actuall crimelord which is great BUT all of this missions can only be done in a public session. This means that everybody on the map can come to you and start disturbing your mission even so they will even earn money and RP (experience points in GTA) for killing you destroying mission objectives or making sure that you fail the mission and it doesn't stop there! Oh no to make it even more easier they add a 'global signal' to the map so that everybody can see that you're doing a mission that they will earn money from it and even an explaination discribing in what type of vehicle the players are so they can be better prepared to destroy your mission oh wait there is even more! Not ONLY does it make sure EVERY player on the map knows what you are doing NO that would be to easy while the game gives you an undefendible and slow vehicle it sends armored NPC's in choppers armored vehicles bikes. You know what? I dont really mind the NPC's they make it more challanging and exciting but not if you let them spawn infinatly on locations like RIGHT behind you or RIGHT in front of you. You don't wanna know how many times I have crashed into a spawning armored vehicle. The combination of NPC's and actuall players making it so easy for you to lose SO much money you worked hard and long for the get. REALLY frustrating.NPC Gta online is a living game it feels like every NPC has his/her own story and destination but honestly there sooo dumb and stupid. The mission NPC's are actually decent they will hold position try to flank and give you a proper challange to succeed which is great and fun but the random NPC's are just so dumb that they will actually respond unnatural and annoying. Best example is traffic sure it's a very nice way to show the realistic driving of some people letting them make stupid mistake and such but this could actually screw your missions. When driving away from cops random NPC will start driving in front of you (a criminal shooter on a bike cause you know safety and such...) blocking you way they wil start driving in the wrong direction and crash against you. When you are shooting armed thugs on the street they will start driving high speed change their direction to the pedestrail road and actually hit and kill you. This may sound stupid but you will discover in game.Money Gta online is all about making money. I don't mind that everything is so expensive especially the armored or armed vehicles. But every time you think you have enough money to buy what they want they keep bullying you by asking even more before you can get what you ACTUALLY wants. buying buisnesses for example will let you buy a clubhouse first you can buy a nightclub but to make it actuall usefull and pretty you have to cough up even more extra money. You want to play Heists? Then you have to buy a High end appartment starting from 1 million. You want a supressor? No problem that will be 25 000 extra please. You want a car? purchase a garage please the cheapest wil let you hold 2. You want to upgrade your buisnesses? that would be another million please. It's a tricky system cause it makes the different 'cards' who will give you money in game from paying actuall real life money very seducing to buy.Notifications This is just annoying. When entering GTA online (even as a lv.1) they will start spamming and I mean SPAMMING you with buying nightclubs starting heists play in races buying bunkers it just keeps going while leaving behind actual usefull information. My buisness was under attack and I had to protect it (a pretty fun and cool little mission) but what it didnt tell me was who was attacking me how many people I could expect and how many try's or lives I would get. I arrived and got instantly sniped by a chopper because I wasnt in my armored car and there were like 15 policeman in SWAT cars and choppers who instantly kill me. I had only 1 change apparently so I lost my buisness with everything in it (it was containing max supplies and cargo worth of 210 000). Another form of notifications are the waymarkers in group. When 1 person in your group places a waymarker it completly deletes all other markers a very dumb system.Groupproblems Playing this game in a group of friends is amazing but there isnt much that promotes doing so. A lot of mission require a vice president or leader of a group who will choose the missions and equipement. But at the end of the mission the members of the group often don't get the money they deserve. While the group leader gets 120 000 for selling goods the group get 5000 for helping delivering which is a bit unfair. ALSO while you are in a group your buisnesses will keep running but there is no way to promote them help them or even manage them while you are in another group. You cannot even enter certain areas in YOUR OWN building because you're not the leader of the group. So you could run out of supplies while doing other missions your popularity will decrease during other mission and there is nothing you can do about it exept leaving the club/party and do it yourself or hope that the other members will help you after.If you have no problems after reading all of this above me then this is the game for you but if you're easily frustrated don't like grinding for money you like to play on your own then I would really consider deeply before buying this game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-01,0,0,149,False,Recommended,Few sentences about the game.1. The story mode is so well done. Fun to play( it even forces you to play 24/7).2.

Quite simply the game's ability to uphold my interest despite the companies behind it is finally starting to wear thin. At one point I may have given this game a great review.

All DLC has been for online play and mostly for the easier to develop(I assume) adversary modes. The best part of GTA Online were the heists but they never released more because they take more work than a new race or adversary mode. Rockstar has allowed modding in single player forever but suddenly Take Two threatens the people that add content to the game an make it worth continuing to play. Bottom line. R* and Take Two want you to play their online game where everything costs way too much so that you will buy GTA cash from them via shark cards. If you aren't going to do that then they have no interest in you playing their game.

2016-09-20,1,1,1472,False,Not Recommended,"One of the best selling games that turned out to be the most utterly disappointed and outraged in the whole gaming community. Rockstar and Take Two are only asking for money at this point no more fun. Grand Theft Auto 5 however at the time around release was one of the best games ever to be released. I personally loved GTA 5 as a whole a while back and I do have to admit GTA 5 has it's positives. It has been a lot of fun then and I will always remember the times I've had most fun with it myself and with friends. Now the game is being buried down further into the grave for me. After +1 200 hours it's really sad how it turned out. This game has turned out to be at the pit of for video games. I'm deciding to review it again.Pros Great storyline Rockstar always makes a great story line 3 characters to play as (Michael Trevor &amp Franklin) with neat special abilities Graphics at the time were astounding and now is a lot more Lively Environment good diversity of activites to do nature people and animals Gameplay is straight forward easy to cling on to Missions are great side missions are also pretty cool Lots of cars like LOTS of cars with detailed interiors and superb driving physics Many weapon choices Full Controller SupportCons There's so many to list but I'll list the most common ones No singleplayer DLC nothing else to do in singleplayer You have to use mods to get them Online's extreme grindfest and absurdly priced items (some are pointless) Broken &amp faulty anti cheat hackers are still ridden in public sessions and Rockstar is still banning innocent players Rockstar's/Take Two's pestering of notifications Online to buy things really tells that they want you to buy shark cards Easy to spot laziness (Ex. about every car interior is the same no difference) Too many gamemodes milked out that almost no one plays now Rockstar/Take Two is adding a too much of cash grab and/or unnecessary ""DLC"" not actually giving what players want (They are also adding things like Blimps way too late onto GTA Online) Very long wait times Disability to play CEO Import/Export Gunrunning Hangar and Warehouse missions in your own private session (which obviously means you have to play them on public which makes it VERY very hardto complete any of either) You are charged for literally owning a property you never really hear a game doing this to you thus making you have to eventually grind so you don't lose moneyPretty much all the downsides are belonging to Online mode. There is nothing really much wrong with Singleplayer but it's like every GTA game. After you beat story mode there's not much to do but then all ""DLC"" is moved to multiplayer. Now here's the problem using mods to get something that's clearly unaccessible to singleplayer users then there's something wrong. Rockstar/Take Two really tries to lure players to play GTA Online just so that they can have access to these things and yet putting everything expensive and making it very hard for you to make millions and millions of GTA dollars (that is sadly mandatory). They are really trying hard to make you pay more for their game that is horrendous to such a game. Yes Valve does it but to me it's not horrendous and ridiculous like how GTA Online has it. Unfortunately there's nothing to end this pay to win or grind to win feature as many people have already payed for shark cards. In conclusion GTA 5 is a bad game now. Singleplayer is good but you have to use mods or it just becomes dead for you. This game was nothing like this before. You'd want to beware or probably stay away buying this one. I do therefore recommend an alternative check out FiveM. It's another Online realm where you won't have to worry about many things in difference to GTA Online.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-11-24,0,0,578,False,Recommended,"There are pros and cons about this game. Pros Extreamily good graphics (Geforce GTX 1050ti) Tons of updates and DLC Fun to play with friends Has a huge discord community There are some amazing looking cars It has competition like having the best cars buying the best apartments and having races ect Cons Rockstar are hard to get intouch with they only have online support and never pick up the phone. There are annoying hackers. I don't mide hackers but the ones that ruin it for all are the worst. Items are overpriced makes you buy alot of snarkecards** The game price has still not gone down (But you can wait for sales) The games getting ruined by adding cars like batmobile in my opinion. Making it unrealistic Some people like this others don't. It your own opinion really.Overall this game is a must buy and hopefully DLC will keep improving this game. I would like to see some more histes added as they are fun to play.Update As I said previously "" I would like to see some more histes added as they are fun to play."" Well the good news is Rockstar have added new hisets but the only thing is they are not affordable to setup and everything is getting worse and over priced Rockstar want our money really bad. That's why instead of fixing stuttering issues they bring out updates for DLC which provides us with free content. They're trying to turn the multiplayer in to a premium currency. Shark cards are expensive and earning money is a task require 100h of making small amounts of cash. Just like on a mobile game. Everything is priced terribly and they are really trying hard to get as much money out of us as possible.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,Great. So I got around to doing a review for this game and despite recent events I'll try to be a bit fair to the actual game.Singleplayer Screwed. SP was great up until recently. The story is still great. The characters are awesome. 100%ing the entire thing is a bit tedious but whatever.Graphics I'm not one to talk really since I'm running on Intel HD 530 but oh man. Yeah it's great. I've seen max graphics before on this game and it still holds up really well. If you can run this at 4k60 then it is beautiful.Optimization Ugh. It's not good. For quite alot of people it might work but basing this off of personal experience the game stuttered for my friend so badly that he had to reinstall drivers on analmost brand new gtx 1060 and it STILL didn't fix it completely. It wasn't mich better.Take Two being vile wretched pieces of filth and garbage so often that it makes me want to vomit blood until I can't see straight Okay maybe an overreaction but still. Online is a toxic wasteland. It's filled with hackers and horrible players that murder you at spawn over and over until you leave with no punishment except not getting 2k every 24 billion god damn hours. T2 doesn't ban anyone for hacking unless they money drop and even then I have forcefully collected about 400k at one time because they were trying to get me banned and still nothing. They're horrible at moderation. Microtransactions are god awful and are equivalent to a f**king mobile game. Don't want to waste 15 hours grinding the same boring and repetitive mission just for a meager 1 million? Buy our sh*tty cards!!! Buy buy buy. Don't stop buying. OBEY. No but seriously I hate microtransactions they were invented by like Satan himself or something. Almost done! One more thing. Take Two being vile wre Yeah you get the point (part 2) THEY SENT A CEASE AND DESIST TO THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE FREAKING GTA MODDING COMMUNITY!!!!! THIS IS OUR REWARD FOR BUYING THE GAME UP TO THREE DIFFERENT TIMES OR EVEN FIVE MAYBE. I would've NEVER even CONSIDERED buying this game if not for mods. I'd rather play it on my 360 to be honest. But I still bought it. You know why? I already said. Because of the mods!!! AND THEN THEY GO AND DESTROY THE ENTIRE THING IN ONE MOVE. Checkmate T2. You win. I will never support any of your games ever again. I hope thisgame gets pushed so far down it's more lost than Atlantis. You deserve not even a quarter of what you gained from this awful game. You have no idea what you've done. You opened the floodgates people. Prepare to get swamped.Conclusion So yeah the game isn't that bad but Take Two is stupid. Most of that whole spiel was hyperbolic but it's all pretty true. I will not support anything T2 does. I could care less about RDR2. Never even played the first so what does it matter to me? In then end I highly suggest watching this or the Jimquisition about it on Youtube for more info and less ranting. Thanks fir reading.Bye now!,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V it should have something like the Valve Anticheat technology a detection system for game integrity. Those who cheat or install any mod should not only be banned from the game but also from Steam. If Rockstar change the security of Online game mode I will change my review for positive. Until then will be Negative because this game in Online mode it's good but only to play in PRIVATE sessions. Community? In Online mode there's no community only a mass of people without a sense of friendship.

2017-06-16,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,Let me be very clear companies that practice unethical and anti consumer methods do not deserve your money. Rockstar/Take Two Interactive has apparently decided to be giant to the customers and their fans. I bought GTA V twice. Once on the Xbox 360 once on PC. I may only have 115 hours of it on PC but that's because I had already gotten burnt out on it somewhat by the time the GTA V PC release came around. And because modding was a pain in the and because of constant updates which broke said modding I got tired of playing it.Well Rockstar and Take Two have formulated a plan in their infinite wisdom if they shut down the modding teams and offer lackluster online support and updates while doing nothing to stop hackers (while banning people that hackers have targeted in game) it will make people want to come back....No Rockstar. No Take Two. Pound sand. If I could get back my $120 I've given you in the past 4 years I would. I don't want your games I don't want your services and I don't want to give you any of my money. And I won't. Talk with your wallet people. If you were buying Shark Cards (...why?) stop. If you're buying Rockstar/Take Two games stop. Buy other products instead and gloat to those developers that they're getting money instead of Rockstar.MAKE THEM POUND SAND.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-26,0,0,109,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V for computers was in no hurry. The game was first announced on consoles of the previous generation and the fact that it is also being chosen on a PC was kept secret. Previously many times there was gossip about whether it would even be created and the creators denied this information. And although as we learned this week Rockstar from the very beginning planned to create this version it appeared as the last and only after a few shifts. However it did not hurt its popularity. The title broke into the top selling list on Steam becoming the most popular game produced by a company other than Valve. Rockstar who made sure that the computer version is the last one will be the most refined and complete one. And this is indeed what we are proving in the following text that focuses on the technical side of the game and the differences between this and the previous releases.Already Grand Theft Auto V on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One presented itself beautifully but the PC version of the game is even prettier. Certainly admiring the game on a computer is the best way to see its beauty in all its glory. For example because it works with more frames per second and you can see at a first glance that the animation and appearance of the game gain a lot from it. This is also the final argument in the discussion whether 60 fps looks better than 30. If someone has any doubts let them play the game on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One then look at the computer version. The difference is great visible to the naked eye.But the visual layer has been improved not only in this respect. Kudos are also on the Rockstar account for the fact that the production has been optimized. Thanks to the wide possibilities of adjusting its settings you can fire it on quite old computers. Of course it does not look very good then but at least it works. At the same time if you have a super modern equipped with two graphics cards equipment you can tug on the inclusion of the game in 4k resolution. This is also a plus for all players even those who do not have such a ""monster"" at the moment but maybe they will have it in the future. GTA V will look even nicer then today.What's the most important however the game allows you to achieve 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second even on medium efficient computers. In order to watch GTA V in such a quality the processor from the i3 series is enough as well as a graphics card like the GeForce 750 and that is not much. On the other hand owners of stronger computers can struggle to incorporate additional effects. In the options you can decide which DirectX library you want to use how diversified the transients on the streets are to be how well shadows or reflections should appear on the water and whether you want to incorporate edge smoothing effects such as MSAA. The PC version even when it does not work on the highest settings and with medium quality textures looks simply better than the console version. The range of view has been increased surface reflections and molecular elements have been improved the faces of the figures and the elements of their attire are better. Rockstar also improved the weather effects. Fog or rain look even better than on PlayStation 4 / Xbox One and then it looked very good.Personally I tested GTA V on a computer equipped with an i5 4670 GeForce 770 processor and 8 gigabytes of RAM. Such a set allows you to turn on the game in 1080p with medium textures for the better there is a lack of memory resources on the graphics card. However there is a lot of computing power to incorporate MSAA FXAA and TXAA. The game also offered sixteen fold anisotropic filtering maximum compaction and scaling of distance high tessellation very high quality of surface shading and high or very high quality of other effects. It worked slightly below 60 frames reaching values from 55/56 to 58/59 fps.GTA V has been better optimized than its predecessor and the game has avoided major problems at the start. Yes she did not like the custom characters in the Windows username but it is nothing compared to the problems we experienced while launching GTA IV on the occasion of the premiere. If I had to attach I regret a little that here and there will appear elements out of the overall quality of the visual setting. Posters in Franklin's room or hanging items in the closet were definitely done with less detail although it may be the price that you have to pay for the opportunity to launch the game even on weaker computers. If that is the case then I accept it because it is not excessive. I would also like a greater density of streets and sidewalks I wrote about it on the occasion of GTA V on Xbox One. I counted silently that if this was not possible on the current generation consoles maybe it will work on the PC. Unfortunately for cities with hundreds of cars and passers by visible on the screen at one moment we will probably have to wait until the next game in the series. On the other hand I'm glad that the view range has been increased even more and only sometimes it happens that textures in higher resolution are read before our eyes. As a rule this process is carried out early enough so that it is not noticeable.Opinions were taken from the website http //www.gram.pl",Grand Theft Auto V

As far as story mode I would recommend this game but multiplayer has panned out to be crap.Rockstar has fostered a community that caters to 10 year olds that use shark cards to buy all the tanks jets helicopters and whatever else to on everyone. Skill doesn't matter and after 3+ years hackers are still everywhere. A lot of the missions are in free mode so you'll enjoy the hackers and op vehicles just ruining your game and costing you time and money. This game always had problems but at least online was still fun parts of it still are but it's all about who has bought the most op vehicles.

2017-06-17,1,1,202,False,Not Recommended,Alright listen as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster like story in single player mode and crazy Trevor of course. But see that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode but it's so terrible the community is toxic as f*ck and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick 1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned how f*cking is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. 11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old I don't need this bullsh*t right now I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time but if you the person reading this plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people then by all means go right ahead if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait the heists..... man f*ck heists I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious though it isn't always this bad but it can be).15. And shark cards can gobble my balls._________________________________________________________________Other than that this game is an awesome game and very addicting totally worth the money you'll have tons of fun especially in online mode I promise D,Grand Theft Auto V

Using thease vehicles to spam kill you/ Destroying your vehicles/ blowing upp your oppertuneties to earn money by cargo missions. Plus that all the new vehicles are expensive as which is a big problem considering that you hardly get any chanse to do the high paying missions because they are in freemode. Where these ""vehicles"" are commonly used by greifers. The only way around them is either using the same kind of op vehicle they use against them until they go away if you have that money. Hope that you can convince enough people on the server to kick the greifer. Or join a solo session whitch makes it a single player grinding game. But attleast you can earn money to spend on something that helps you stay protected when you return back to online servers.If you are new in gta and log into multiplayer you sadly often get picked the target of the greifers because they know you cant in any way protect yourself. Your only hope is that you have someone on the server that realise what is hapening and comes to aid. But it isnt much of a use since they are back onto you in seconds whit the same op vehicle even after you blew them(It) up. Gta onlina has more or less gone from free rome driving exploring and lots of free rome and freerome activeties such as vissiting the carnival.

The only reason why I don't recommend this game is because how terrible and toxic the online community is. You'll probably find trolls modders and little kids who can't spell even If it saved their lives. If you stumble apon this review I'll tell you that Ive played this game since the PS3 days and I never liked the online community. You'll see how terrible this community by reading the first two reviews of this game and how they've been banned for no reason while bashing the online community but if you have a niche little group of friends that you could play the game with it all fun and joy. I like to say the online community is worse than League of Legends community by a long shot. At least you can find randos who you can have a nice conversation with about different topics. The GTA5 online community will shoot destroy and explode anything that moves. The combat is either A. You spawn out after a heist or mission to get 1 tapped by someone you just played with so they can hype of their KDA(that doesn't mean jack in this game) B. People who get in jets or expensive high level weaponized vehicle to your dry. and then C. Nothing but modders. The word ""modder"" in PVP should give you a good enough explantion of how the PVP will go down. Now the Online community does have terrible rep and so does Rockstar support team but under all of that trash filth you have some really great communitys that are usually filled with nice people. An example would be car groups. Car groups and just there to show off their stan cars in the glory that GTA5 car custimazation is. In the end though I don't think you should buy this game full price since half the game is a toxic community over drafting the great storyline in offline mode and small group of great players.

Then gave me $1 Million dollars.Overall I would like there to be higher player capacity on servers more gamemodes (not made by GTA developers but rather people who host servers that can edit and create their own game modes) and administrators to weed out cheaters. I wish i refunded my $60 when I first brought this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,522,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game on PC when it came out. At the time I didn't really care for mods. I then proceded to pour hours into this game 100% it twice. After that sure its okay and semi fun to run around and do stuff. The online I have also put a few hours in but it is so broken. And I don't just mean the hackers who can't really use OpenIV. The ""micro transaction"" are not micro anymore. Yea I put my $60 in to buy the game which is the most I have bought a game for but to do anything in the online you either have to grind for literal hours or buy a shark card. I would have less of a problem if it was balanced but its not.I could put in a ton of real money in the online and barely get enough to get an upgraded office. So the online isn't really something I do anymore. I just get on the online and there are hackers everywhere and OpenIV has nothing to do with them. And after playing so much of the single player it gets really dull. However mods ramp it back up and make me want to play it more. If it wasn't for mods I would only have about 60 or so hours in the game instead of around 400. Mods make it fun and T2 is now taking that fun away. I hope they change their minds and soon. I really think that there is going to be a significant drop in their revenue. THe score on Steam is dropping so fast. It used to be so Mostly Positive and now its Mostly Negative. GTA 5 is the fourth most popular game so far. ANd really if you think about it its more like the Second most popular and T2 is now trying to take even more money out of this game and its not good.

GTA O is full of cheaters who will never be banned despite innocent players being banned constantly. Luckily for them its not enjoyable enough to miss.Singleplayer is great but years down the line and not a single DLC has been released or even announced.

2017-06-17,0,0,195,False,Not Recommended,So I had previously made a rather negative review of Grand Theft Auto V made in the midst of all of the OpenIV drama. I was not best pleased so I decided to rewrite it the review is still negative because any critism I gave Take Two Interactive back then still applies now.Let me explain I have no issue with Rockstar Games infact they seem to be rather supportive of modding their games and have in the past featured mods on their Newswire site. The issue is with T2 and their ideology of sales over what the consumer desires. In Grand Theft Auto V this is apparent through the ludicrious Shark Card scheme which by this point has become a requirement for anyone wanting to have anything nice on GTA Online. It is also apparent with the OpenIV resolution T2 took a big L and decided that their decision was going to hurt them.See how I've been able to get by without mentioning that OpenIV didn't even support what T2 suggested (allowing for online modifications) so far? That really is a shocking indicator of how T2 acts. But to suggest that this was any suprise is utter nonsense T2 having sent cease and decist letters to the authors of alternate online modifications for GTAV a few years back. As far as the actual game goes its pretty good okay story very nice graphics. Online has become pretty awful has time has gone by requiring either hundreds of hours game time to get money to have fun or hundreds of pounds spent to have fun. It certaintly started off nice I was one playing online as they released the X360 update.Note that I said the story was only 'okay' I say this as the story is nice but doesn't really feel like a classic GTA title. For the money and the story Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a much more viable option IMO. Considering the two share the same fictional (although different in interpretation) worlds there are things that don't really add up for me such as how the Ballas took over Grove Street in the continued existance of 'The Families' or even how 'The Families' could become a thing CJ having really turned on every gang in Los Santos at some point for territory. All of these unanswered questions ontop the ier map I find that San Andreas is a more enjoyable game try doing a master save if you've got some spare time p.In closing I will note that I may have some inaccuracies regarding the 'The Families' and Grove Street as its been a while since I last played through the GTAV story which is steadily becoming the better half of GTAV. Frankly T2 have put me off purchasing any of their new games I won't be getting RDR2 I'll stick to their just as good or even better older titles when they actually put the consumer first (or atleast not as close to last as they do now).,Grand Theft Auto V

That's a lot cut from the game and making it soul less.They've also butchered online the ammount of pure uninterrupted constant grinding you would need just to get a car would actually no joke take you months cars are like 1mill$ and OVER and the highest paying missions take an hour to complete and give you... 20k. It's that grindy. It's the grindiest game on the planet I actually can't think of one game that has bloated to such a massive requirement of grinding I'm genuinely baffled it's this bad it actually is disgusting how bad it is. And they keep releasing new cars to make the others irrelevant so you have to KEEP grinding. There's no fun at all no playing only grinding it will take so much of your life just to get 1 cool item that they will make sure is garbage within a month because they keep replacing every car. And to top it off cars are just ONE of the things you need to buy and they're not the most expensive. It's absaloute madness it's litteraly slave work you even have to pay in game bills. This game is anti consumer in all its back stabbing glory and will not let you have fun it only wants your money. There's nothing this game holds nothing it offers.

2018-07-11,0,0,489,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V. The fifth installment to the series. Developed by Rockstar it is an open world 3rd person shooter sandbox that gives you the freedom to do nearly everything. Although my experience so far with it has been less than satisfactory. While the campaign and singleplayer is relatively decent the story feels somewhat bland and recycled. Some of the characters are kind of black and white as well. A lot of the buildings aren't enterable like in GTA IV and a lot of the time it feels boring especially after you complete the main game. You're left to roam freely doing as you please. But to what end? Then comes the online part of this big game. As soon as I join I'm tossed into a character creator and... well I have to make new characters until the game decides to work. I go online and I'm met with none other than pure drama. A few hackers here and there salty players and a load of ignorant players. I didn't mind it... until I got kicked for attacking a group of hackers. All in all the game is semi fun. There are some enjoyable aspects of it that I liked but the cons outweigh the pros for me. The graphics need to be worked around as well. Most of the time I find my self unable to find a good setting as my game keeps twitching and the frames slowing down on police chases. So would I recommend this? If you're a long time GTA player and want to continue on I suggest you give it a shot at least. But in its current state I wouldn't dare recommend it. Here's hoping Rockstar can fix it. Again this is my view so it's up to the player to decide. Just keep in mind the things I've said here.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-26,0,0,925,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is a masterpiece. It has great tech visuals (for 2013) and story. It is a must have action game. But GTA Online is absolutely different. It is the same open world but much less interactive it's empty and boring and full of all kinds of cheaters and greafers. Almost every session has a cheater or two. Game community is one of the worst I've ever seen. There's no balance at all. This game is not even supposed to be balanced in any way. It's all about dominating by number and better gear bought for real bucks. Skills are almost irrelevant. Don't get me wrong I have a positive KDR much more than 1 but I don't have fun playing skirmishes in free roam because fighting mechanics are not designed for competitive play so I mostly fight to protect my cargo from griefers. GTA gets free updates that is good in theory but in reality their implementation breaks the game even further. Stabilty is also not the strongest side of GTA.OSo the bottomline Story mode is awesome I highly recommend itOnline mode is not competitiveIf you see a cheater change the session asap not to be permanently banned instead of himLoading screens simulatorBest way to play GTA Online is not to play it at all,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-15,0,0,296,False,Not Recommended,The single player game is great story is great characters are interesting gameplay is what you'd expect (in a good way)The multiplayer is also pretty good for a while... If you have 3 friends to play with you can have a lot of fun doing missions playing the heists and finally doing the Criminal Mastermind challenge. But once that is over it's all down hill from there. There is no longer any viable way to make money that doesn't make you feel like you're wasting your time aside from the shark cards of course. The new updates are fun for about 30 minutes unless it's a vehicle update in which case you can't afford it unless you dedicate lots of grinding time or real world money. It starts to feel like everything is designed to pull money out of you and you either pay or you stop playing. I stopped playing.The game was good but I dislike the fact that it could've been much much better. So I can't recommend it with a good conscience. Plus the random bans are just a move.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-11,0,0,873,False,Recommended,"GTA is a part of our culture. I'm sure most of have played it since the first edition all of which have been the transcending games at their own times. GTAs have always been a huge package of gameplay and fun activities into one affordable game. GTA V is no different and in fact sets the benchmark even higher than before in terms of every aspect (except storyline GTA IV wins here). That being said GTA Online is an experience of its own. It's an RPG like no other there are tons of gameplay modes and an epic array of stuff to do with additions being made by Rockstar each month. Cons The storyline of Trevor is not binding or fun. Other storylines are ok. (There are 3 major offline characters to play with) The fun in GTA Online is often disgruntled by 12 year olds shouting over the mic and destroying everything and hackers who chat in boxes (because of our missing language font) and type only 1 english sentence ""CHINA NO 1"". Cheating has been on the rise since a few months so online lobbies have become irritating. (I know this isn't the game's fault but since I'm reveiwing I need to sketch out important gameplay stuff)Pros There is no reason why you shouldn't buy it already. GTA doesn't mean mayhem only. I've met people who are really decent and are as qualified as commercial pilots marines racing drivers SWAT officers and even a doctor! I definitely recommend GTA online to everyone (18 years and above age).",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,1343,False,Recommended,"Good and fun game. What else to say? Online mode is fun with friends specially when playing the heists. Beware GTA Online requires grinding for money (GTA$) if you wanna get the cool stuff so it obviously requires time or you to buy Shark Cards with REAL money to get millions of GTA$. So this money is important for Rockstar/Take Two interactive but it's also important for the game because part of this real money is what keeps the game going and receiving updates/DLC. The game has big vulnerabilities because it does not have an effective built in anti cheat/hack engine (if it ever had one) it's also somewhat unstable during online gameplay with Heists being ruined with disconnects and glitches/bugs.GTA has always been fun and great with the modding scene with mostly single player mods or even multiplayer mods but that don't run or affect official GTA online servers. However side effect is that same mod tools that allow great mods to exist also can be used by cheaters to obtain fake money (GTA$) in GTA Online and cause disruptive gameplay (god mod remove people's vehicles guns teleport them elsewhere etc). That is because the game has vulnerabilies and not because the mod tool exists. Nothing is stopping someone else to develop a new tool that will keep ruining the game and possibly creating losses of profits for Take Two Interactive.Obviously the mod tools intended use is not for cheating or gaining ""illegal""/fake GTA$ money but in order to protect their game and profits Take Two interactive decided to send a cease and desist letter to a popular mod tool (Open IV) site to stop developing and distributing the software that is essentially the base for all mods. Instead of fixing their game and creating mechanisms that block those illegal exploits they decide to target the modding community. TL DR Because of a few deranged people they ruin it for everyone.They have the right to protect their game but they should act more professionally and considerate of the large user base that likes GTA because of the legit mods.Due to a lot of protest and public outcry Take Two has decided to re evaluate the issue and allow the mod tool to be distributed and supported.

2015-11-06,0,0,407,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. UPDATE 2 (6/26/2017)Apparently they decided to rescind their cease and desist so mods are back. Yay!UPDATE TO MY REVIEW (6/16/2017)Well Take Two just killed modding so there's really no point to get this game anymore especially on PC. My original review actually documented a fun memory with a modder in GTA Online. That modder didn't give out money ranks or even bother the people that weren't involved in the situation. Sure loads of people came to see what he was doing out of curiosity but he didn't teleport everyone instantly to his location. Instead they turned up on their own accord. While I do see that there are some agressive modders that just kill everyone in a lobby or use their mods to do better in the game modes the best way to deal with that is to report them and get them banned. It was apparent that Take Two or Rockstar wanted to increase their profit from GTAV through the rather expensive ""microtransactions"" from the start I never thought they would do something like this in order to protect them. It's just stupid. Don't buy this game. Now the saddest part about this situation is that they will get away with it. Just think of how much money they already made from the game its something like the 4th most sold game of all time and that isn't including the microtransactions. They have enough money that they can do whatever they want and not be affected. Plus people are still going to buy their other games (RDR2 is coming out remember and thats only on consoles so far which means that there is no modding to be had anyway) so for someone thinking of boycotting their games it probably wont work. Original Review Below *This review is based on my perspective of my GTA Online experiences upgrading from GTA Online PS3 to GTA Online PC**Launch game* ""Wow the loading times aren't as long!""I then was put into the game with a modder present and he teleported me to the beach.The modder then spawned one of those large dump trucks which was cycling all the colors of the rainbow and was invincible. ""Get in and honk the horn"" he said over the crystal clear voice chat that GTA Online has on PC.I do as he says and the dump truck shot forward about 500 ft at what felt like 200 mph.""Cool huh?"" he replies after seeing this.At this point the others in this lobby type in the text chat things like ""Is there a modder here?"" ""Can you give me money?"" and ""This session is being monitored.""But some were more direct and came speeding to the beach in their modified Zentornos Adders and T20s to see what all the commotion was about. They immediately started air humping the modder and giving him the thumbs up with GTA's emotes.Afterwards the modder spawned about 5 more of these magical dump trucks and we all had a mini destruction derby until I accidentally held on to the horn button for too long. I was trying to honk and have my truck boost into someone when they swerved out of the way at the last moment. My dump truck hit a park bench and rocketed towards the sun but did not stop hurtling towards it until I could no longer see Los Santos. We declared this event the maiden voyage of NASA's experimental ""Dump Truck Corps."" and when I eventually splashed down into the ocean a few hundred feet away from the beach a roar of ""Hooray!"" ""Woohoo!"" and laughter erupted both in the voice chat and a handful of lol's and XD's in the chat.10/10 Would pilot dump truck spaceship again.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-30,0,0,143,False,Not Recommended,6.5/10 (9/10 For singleplayer 4/10 For multiplayer)After almost 100hrs finally I decided to write this review. Singleplayer (Storymode) is almost perfect interesting missions three characters with different personality you can't dislike them it's just impossible hours of play and I have still only 30% game finished. So why is my rate so low? Answer is easy to know GTA ONLINE Wait almost 5 mins to join the Server (Everytime) after this create your character and start the Game as newbie. Farm a lot hours on minigames who plays almost nobody with you because you need good car and house like others. Now should be easly right? Nah was more harder than before cuz you need more money for next products in this Game. Farmed 3mil's and bought motorcycle club with methamphetamine factory for instant money farming After hours of production wanna sell my holy products in Los Santos which means I need 10 minutes to arrive there but naturaly little kids with 8000lv's must destroy everything with his cheats (teleported on my plane and blew up) but that Situation wasnt once or twice that was in my every session...If you want buy this game with your friend for 30 to play only GTA ONLINE then it's not worth your money. In short version I have found a lot of bugs which shouldn't have happened in game like GTA V need too much time to login into the GTA Online or online Missions because Rockstar Servers are on the fire (sometimes I have waited up to 10 minutes and my friend with gtx 1080 and i7 7600k have the same Problems) Cheaters are everywhere trust me EVERYWHERE. New cars and buildings costs so much money that players who want to buy something needs hours of farming solo or (of course) with huge friend group BUT only with huge group. Probaly you can cheat the Money which there is not so stupid. Solo or duoplayers will find in GTA Online any friends to play Everybody will try to kill you in every opportunity. This is funny cuz in GTA SA with free multiplayer mod was more refined in terms of wasted time.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-03-10,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,"Fun game singleplayer is a blast but you need to remember how to save. As a first time GTA player i lost all of my save data a few times because i was not saving correctly. The ""Autosave"" feature does not work as far as i have found you have to manually go save often and even then those saves would not always work.As for GTA5 online there are serious latency issues on the servers and after playing for a few hours the other night and going into over 100 random lobbies 85 of the lobbies had at least one hacker in them blowing people up teleporting around spawning items etc. In races and in jobs there are serious latency issues with the surrounding players so bad that most game modes are unplayable. People are constantly rubber banding making any deathmatch impossible and races often result with two people flying away from each other because the rubber banding made the server think that they collided at extreme speeds even though they had not collided. This carries over to most game types as im sure you can imagine.Overall 4/10 game. I think the content is fun and a really great time to play singleplayer despite the save issues. Multiplayer is at best a decent time as long as you overlook the latency issues and at worst unplayable which it often is due to the lag and massive amount of hacking and exploits going on. Also the tech support team is pretty useless i have had a problem with the game not taking the right CD key and it has taken months of emails and about 10 15 hours on the phone with them to get it to work.If you are looking for a game to play singleplayer and you have alot of time on your hands get this game. Not worth full price so get it when it is on a big sale. The multiplayer is a complete waste of time unless you have a couple friends or a group to play with so you can get into a private lobby(creating a private lobby is also a huge pain in the ***). Public lobbies are just people abusing the game or going around blowing other people up over and over.Note that i do not live in a remote location and i have a 5gb connection and i still have incredibly bad latency issues and my load screens are often upwards of 10 minutes with a brand new pc running top of line equipment.",Grand Theft Auto V

Game mechanics are great theres quite a bit to do such as missions heists and endless brutality! If you have friends to join you that makes multiplayer all the better. You and your crew can rule lobbies! 3The downsides are plenty too however. Modders are all over spawning in objects and money freely and almost entirely unabated. Joining a public online lobby means a high chance youll run into at least one modder. The game has bugs too with heists and missions sometimes unplayable because of them. Finally once you get plenty of money and buy yachts or cars aplenty theres not really anything else to pursue other than mercilessly killing other players which can still get tiring. Despite the downsides it's a playable game great for burning a few hours a day here and there. I highly recommend playing with friends. Give the story mode a try too !,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-25,0,0,618,False,Recommended,This game is by far the best game I have played out of the 60 I've installed since my begining Steam years. This game has an incredible world that is just a joy to be in. Rockstar games spared no expense when making this world feel alive. Moddifying your game is hard but the outcome is great. Getting a Mod Menu allows you to spawn in whatever you want and change whatever you want. Some key things I love about this game is that you have to listen for a lot of things to uncover some hidden elements another being veichles. The veichles in this game are great a handful of them have their own unique abilities like the Opressor's (A motorcycle) ability to expand it's wings at the back of it and fly. One more important thing about this game that I think outshines al the others. Rockstar added a feature in it's game where you can record gameplay and edt it in what's called Rockstar Editor. It's a wonderful editor where you can create your own film from the footage you gathered (A mix of the Mod Menu and Recording Feature is a good way to create interesting films (I've done it before)).,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-20,0,0,488,False,Not Recommended,GTAO was golden in it's first 3 years. Fair fun and reasonable. But these last 2 years the developers got greedy and ruined the entire premise of this game. What used to be a game where there was only a slight work ethic needed to stay relevant in the game has turned into a hectic storm for new players or people who can't afford to throw their wallets at micro transactions. Buying this game new at it's current state for online is a horrible idea unless you are going to use cheats to get money which is the only way to stay relevant and alive.You get thrown in at level one with a pistol and a small amount of cash to barely keep you going. While you aren't even a high enough level to own an explosive someone is roaming around in a car that shoots rockets and takes 15+ to even compete against. Do not buy this game unless you have a high level friend to keep you company if you manage to get mentored by a friend who can maintain himself in an online lobby you can still enjoy yourself.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-12,0,0,159,False,Not Recommended,The single player is somewhat enjoyable but Rockstar never bothered adding DLC to single player because it's all about making money from GTA Online. About that without entering solo mode or invite only session you CANNOT play in a session for more than 15 minutes without a modder joining and ruining the session for everyone by trapping you inside objects attaching pedestrian characters to you or simply putting you in a death loop. Oh and they can spawn thousands of objects and crash your game. This is all without provocation simply because they have nothing better to do. It makes starting GTA Online from scratch pretty much pointless. Rockstar has given up entirely on fixing the servers and keeping modders away. So I installed a menu myself to run as protection and while it solved many issues I experienced with people trying to harass me now it makes me more of a target for the more malicious modders who resort straight to locking me in a box and spawning stuff on me. So there is no answer. Relying on Rockstar to keep you safe will not work and using mods to combat mods does not work. The only solution? Play in Invite Only which locks away dozens of much needed features provided by public lobbies such as utilizing CEO services and MC missions. Not to mention you're stuck in a game by yourself defeating the purpose in multiplayer. Simply put if you plan on playing GTA Online consider playing on Xbox or PlayStation the only time I'll recommend that for any game title. At least modding isn't as prominent on those platforms but it's definitely still there.Or just don't play.Don't buy the game.Don't buy shark cards.Don't participate in this **** show. If Rockstar has chosen to stop caring why should we?,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-18,0,0,188,False,Not Recommended,The game is decent but since Take2 doesn't give the slightest about it anymore the online version sucks. The servers are so god damn and there's nothing you can do. One second you're doing act III of the doomsday heist and the next you're disconnected because the servers ing suck. The singleplayer is good however once you finish the main story I guarantee you will get bored in 15 minutes and as I said the online sucks. Best part the servers aren't the only problem with online. No no no get ready to get blown up every god damn second because about 50% of the people that play this game are veterans and half of them are so bored of this game that they start griefing. Obviously veterans aren't the only ones that grief. Hell I once saw a level 15 kill a level 120 with a god damn sticky bomb while he was doing vip work and there were only 4 people on the server. The only way to actually enjoy online is to go build a house near NASA so that you can steal internet from them then rob a ing bank so that you can get enough money to buy a helicopter IN THE GAME.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,759,False,Not Recommended,"Oh GTA what did Take Two do to you? At the time of writing I have logged 743.6 hours in this game that I have thoroughly enjoyed. Many many hours spent with friends in online messing around and having fun.Things would quickly turn for the worse with every update coming out adding new and expensive things eventually reaching the point where we could no longer afford things without making the game our jobs... or paying for horribly expensive micro transactions. There was a moment of relieve early on in the form of benevolent hackers/cheaters/online modders/whatever you feel like calling them. Of course this wouldn't last but suspiciously while the money cheating was being combatted left right and centre the actual harmful cheaters were left practically unchecked at least seemingly so.That's the point I realised what was going on without a shadow of a doubt. This was also the point I more or less abandoned the multiplayer save for a few mess around sessions with friends. Instead I turned to modding singleplayer with new and exciting things coming out. Drag racing meets LSPDFR custom missions hundreds of thousands of cars and other vehicles all at my finger tips. With only a few clicks and a couple of downloads I could be cruising down the roads of Los Santos in a Porsche 911 Turbo. A few moments later I could be sitting at the helm of an F 16 taking on AI pilots in deathmatches. Not much longer and I had replaced the blimp with a Helicarrier.All of these amazing things done by so many different amazing people have been undone recently in an effort to ""reduce cheating"" or more accurately to reality prevent people from accessing new and expensive multiplayer content in singleplayer. The cease and desist letter sent to the developers of OpenIV one of the core tools to make GTAV modding possible was nothing more than a cynical ploy to drive more money out of our wallets. Many of us have already bought the game up to three times yet they still demand we pay many times the price of the game itself in micro transactions to afford using the new content provided to every player as ""free"" content.This is unacceptable behaviour. This is why I am negatively reviewing this game that I have enjoyed so much since its release. I cannot recommend a game being run by a company like this. The singleplayer on can hold its ground on sale but at full price do not buy and until T2 reverses its stance on modding do not buy this game at all.

2017-06-17,0,0,57,False,Not Recommended,Let me start this off by saying that I've put hundreds of hours into GTA V both on console and PC and have enjoyed (mostly) every minute of it. However this is what makes it so hard to not reccomend this game or atleast the online portion of it. The single player portion of this game is amazing and you can obiously see that a lot of work has been put into making the world of Los Santos feel alive and breathtaking. However the same cannot be said about the online portion. The online segment of this game is filled to the brim with bugs hideous loading times poor network design unstable servers hackers tedious grinding and a blatant anti consumer stance towards micro transactions. Worst of all Rockstar and Take Two have done next to nothing to address these problems since launch sometimes even banning players unfortunate enough to run across the many hackers and exploiters roaming GTA Online unmolested. These problems in addtion with Take Two's recent hostile moves against the GTA V modding community make it hard for me to reccomend this game to anyone. If you're absolutely dying to experience the single player story I recommend picking this game up on a discount. Otherwise steer clear and spend your hard earned money with another company who's not trying to charge you $60 and rip you off with overpriced micro transactions.,Grand Theft Auto V

I am sad to say it is full of so many problems and I will state all in full detail and with furious anger. Problem #1 Everytime on startup be prepared to wait 20+ minutes to join online. Not exaggerating. On a good day it'll be ten minutes. And keep in mind that has nothing to do with my internet or my computer. Specs will be posted at the very end. Problem #2 At the end of a major Heist I get a white screen where sometimes it might show it is loading down in the corner... and I can still type in all cases but it never seems to fix itself. I have to alt tab OUT of the GAME and CLOSE IT in FRUSTRATION. Then repeat problem #1. Finally get into a game and continue with my day. Luckliy up until now its always saved before i quit. Problem #3 At 7AM to 8AM every morning EST all rockstar servers seem to be down. I press play online and wait for 50+ minutes to join a game. Either games are full or no one is playing at 7AM which I find highly unlikely. Problem #4 So I'd join a mission from my phone and it would take me through 5+ minutes of different loading screens and different world transfers. Until it would send me back to my original game indicating that the session was full or he cancelled the mission. If the session is full dont even put me through all that Just tell me and ask if i wanna queue. ill say no and NOT go through any load screens. But just continue driving along. Problem #4 THIS GAME has absolutely NO CONSOLE in ONLINE. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO DISCONNECT MID LOADING SCREEN QUEUE FOR 40 MINUTES. Im sitting there regretting clicking the ing ""Play Online"" waiting 30 40mins contemplating life... When ROCKSTAR COULD just add in console so i could press "" "" or ""F1"" to disconnect or stop trying to join.In conclusion this game is a piece of and not worth buying at all. but if you really want to torture yourself but have a little bit of fun.

2017-06-15,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,The primary reason I bought the pc version of this game was to be able to use mods. Take Two doesnt seem to give a . Online is a grindy dumpster fire unless you pay for Shark Cards (which I would never even remotely consider doing especially now) so I really only play SP these days. Unfortunately Take Two doesn't really even want anyone doing that considering that SP has missed out on quite a bit of content that made its way to MP (vehicles and customization mostly). Most likely due to the fact that in SP they can't charge people real money for in game items. To make it even worse these vehicles that get added to the MP side of the game can't even be spawned in with cheats/trainers. If you try to spawn them in SP they immediately vanish. The only way to access these vehicles in SP is through the use of mods.Sending a C&amp D to OpenIV really only serves to show that Take Two doesn't want people to have fun with this game anymore they just want people to give them more money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Cuz after you owned nearly everything in the game you will definitely feel bored lonely as there are nothing left to do unless u hv tons of friends OR at least 1 friend Online whenever u are Online as well. Of cuz i understand ppl are BUSY at this era BUT in this game NO friend(s) to play with NO Fun/Interest!!!Apart from that R* also didn't set up some very systematic system. For example the CHAT system. The GTA Online CHAT system is damn complicated or a better word CONFUSING!!! Cuz R* mixed EVERYTHING together in a chat they don't split them out like they SHOULD HAVE separated the CHAT into General Organisation/MC Friends Recruit Region/Help and etc. CHAT systems. Then the CHAT in GTA Online will become very SYSTEMATIC plus If we can sroll up to view previous CHAT history will be better xD. Besides the ITEMS SEARCH system. This SHOULD be improved as well. The same reason R* expected we can find the items we seeking for easily it is DAMN difficult to some ppl. Hence R* SHOULD had added a thingy called SEARCH BAR in every sites of GTA Online( Legendary motorsport Benny's etc.).AND a series of ITEMS will pop out when we type certain keywords. For example Grotti Peggassi Sport Super etc.I believed that ALL Players will be very happy &amp enjoy GTA Online more better and less stress IF R* added these features!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,575,False,Not Recommended,Let me get this straight off the bat I enjoy this game both the story and the much less popular online mode. I don't mod this game and i've played this game a ton. But it has some glaring issues not with the game itself but the people running it and playing it. But If I could give this game a neutral or mixed or something like that I wouldFor starters the people running this game. Like you may have heard or not Take Two (the publisher) sent a cease and desist to the team behind a popular modding platform used for many mods. Which you know kinda killed the modding community and made alot of people angry. But they did eventually take back what they did. Rockstar put microtransactions in a full $30 price tag game. They also continue to be taking the wrong steps to combat the rampant hacking in the game (more on that later) and in turn hurting the people who had not done anything. Rockstar doesn't treat the players like people but like the numbers they see on their screens. Ignoring input from the people often and when they do listen they hurt the game more than help it.Now for the thing I have more info and knowledge of the community and the game. This game has the most toxic commuity i've ever experienced in any game period. The commuity will destroy all your work with little to no reward for them but they do it anyway. Rockstar have made everything in this game extremely overpriced taking hours even days to make the money required to have fun. Hackers. Lots. The amount of hackers is frankly disgusting I'd be willing to say there are less hackers on COD World at War then on this game. The hacks they can activate can range from cheats from singleplayer explosive bullets ridiculously fast vehicles spawing money which if you pick up I've heard from some people got them banned and other such things. And to close I can say completely certain that friends kept me playing this game for this long. Honestly I can't really completely reccomend this game to anyone if you do want this game you might want to wait for a big sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-04,0,0,275,False,Not Recommended,Grand theft auto online is the real reason to play GTA V but GTA online is a massive grindfest. My friends and I have spent close to 300 hours each in this game and it has amounted to about 1/80th of the content being accessible to us without buying shark cards or booster packs. Basically grind heists until you can afford a business and car warehouse grind import/export cars until you can afford other stuff you want. You'll make about $70k per car if you're lucky and it takes about 25 minutes per car. Now don't get me wrong the grinding can be fun but when there are modders in every other server launching 100 planes that shoot fireworks and carpet bomb the whole server and rockstar throws out bans that thoroughly wipe your account like candy at a parade it just makes the game not worth the time.Speaking on bans a couple of months ago there was a mass false ban wave leading to a pretty big chunk of accounts being falsely banned. A friend of mine just got temp banned whilst afk no reason given no appeal allowed 273 hours of gameplay wiped. One of the biggest rockstar support threads ever created is devoted to false ban problems and it is still posted in to this day. If you try to appeal the ban support sends a big ol' middle finger your way. Rip any money you've spent on shark cards or booster packs and all of the time you've spent grinding. Its all gone for no reason at all. My friends and I are all just baffled and confused and done with this game at this point. Rockstar also very blatantly and intentionally tries to shut down ANY chance at earning money at a relatively fun but still grindy pace as fast as possible. They removed the ability to use personal vehicles from one of their heists simply because it made it too easy to earn money. If you somehow find yourself in an empty server and try to export cars good luck. Teleporting npcs with god tier aim chase you down to the ends of the earth to shoot you and crash into your car you're trying to sell.,Grand Theft Auto V

They seem to be turning a blind eye as if the problem isn't there but it's very much there but the community has very much noticed this. Once it has been fixed then I'll revert my review to positive. But with this they may see that something is broken this changed take two's opinion on mods somewhat so why can't this bring to light this issue and get it fixed.So Grand Theft Auto V this is my third time buying this game. I enjoy this game for the most part I've put about 1000+ across 3 platforms now however over the past year or so its gone downhill rapidly. I think it all started around the time the original heist update started. The Kuruma was released along with a bulletproof variant that costs a lot and was fairly OP at its time. They kept adding more and more OP vehicles and weapons. Now its pretty much who has the deepest wallets not who is the most skilled. There doesn't go a session where I'm not killed by someone in an armored vehicle or some other stupidly fast vehicle. Even on my other character that I couldn't transfer over because Rockstar removed that feature a few months back this happens. That one is level 166 or so yet I dont have any of the armored vehicles. The game is so grindy that at 80 or so hours played I can finally afford the most barebones office in the game. Everything is priced at around or over 500k and that takes about 4 5 hours using an office to get that amount. It could be done quicker with heists but not everyone has 3 friends on all the time and random people are hit and miss. Everything is kinda behind a paywall. I didn't pay full price for the game I got it during a steam sale and I'm glad I did. I don't want to give Rockstar more money than I have to (Again I've bought the game 3 times) because of this ""paywall"". I remember when the newest supercars costs about 500 750k not double or tripple that. And the newest sports cars costs 100 300k not 4 5x that price. The old pricing was reasonable now everything is at least 1m for the really good stuff. And the only things that make a lot of money are heists nowadays. The missions that were in the base game make at most 20k each races make about 10k. So you really have to grind this game. So don't buy it? No I say buy it but keep this in mind. There is a lot of fun to be had espacially with friends. Thats what the online was made for having fun. However being turned into a paste by an orbital cannon doesn't sound like fun does it. I also didn't talk about the single player much. Its the single player its fun. I've played through it twice and its good. However no updates have left it pretty stale. So yeah get it just keep in mind its fairly grindy to get anywhere.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,362,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. GTAV is an interesting game because your impression of it and experience will vary depending on if you want to invest your time In the single player or online. The online has grown and its a big part of GTAV now. Yet its an experience that leaves more of a bitter taste. It started as an amusing sandbox to mess around with other players and friends. Its what GTAIV began with but evolved with more activities and things to do in the game world. Its a great extension of that experience and well implemented.However now all I have is just a poor experience. There are toxic players hackers here and there but for me the biggest thing is Rockstar's huge push of Shark Cards. From reasonably priced goods turned into crazy expensive items. I can't complain about the implementation because it worked and they made A LOT of money but It did turn into an unfortunate side effect. GTA Online is VERY grindy and you will need to spend hours upon weeks to see some kind of payoff. It doesn't feel rewarding since you grind so much but you get very little in return imo. ""hacking"" sure made the game more enjoyable back on the PC launch day. I had endless money and fun. I was able to do amusing things with friends and do hilarious things to the game world. Gave money to people and never toxic to other players. All I get now is long loading screens and have to basically work a second job to get anything. Or spend a lot of money in real life to get things that I get in single player for free.As for the single player its all been already said. Solid game with a ton of content and a really great experience. No issues fundamentally however to me its not as special or memorable as GTAIV. Still a great game well worth your time.

2016-04-10,0,0,226,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto has always been a very interesting franchise and it is a staple of open world gaming which has over the years achieved itself to be brought up as the first example most times when it comes to open world or third person (somewhat first person in V) gameplay. I've been following the series for quite a while to the point where I cant even really remember. But I know it was when I bought San Andreas is what pulled me into becoming a fan of Rockstar's games.Also on note I will bring up a few comparisons to San Andreas which is what I still believe as the best Grand Theft Auto experience you can get without a doubt especially with mods like Multi Theft Auto which allow for multiplayer on top of the excellent story. Though Grand Theft Auto has gone through many iterations leading up to GTA 5's release i'll still hold it as a better game and something that Rockstar should've held as an example for their future games.I preordered GTA 5 way back when in 2013 the excitement for its release forced me to hand over 60 dollars shamelessly. After I got through the long line at Gamestop I was astounded to what I had in my hands a fresh copy of a game that i've been anticipating for months. It was a crazy but somewhat rewarding experience and I wasted dozens of hours on the single player campaign alone. Though the story is more direct and definitely with more scripted cutscenes than San Andreas GTA 5's story is dramatically shorter and the plot reaches a somewhat 'meh' state midway through GTA V on the PC doesnt add the storyline either which is definitely a bummer. The storyline is a little disappointing to a hardcore Rockstar fan like me but im not going to tear a new for the game... Not yetWithout Online GTA V is excellent. There is tons of content to be offered and things to do in the state San Andreas than compared to the game San Andreas which mostly content wise relies on its story. Activities from golfing to a plentiful amount of side missions are available and it makes the world feel much more alive. There is a wide scope of clothing weapons and vehicles too which make Grand Theft Auto feel more like... Grand Theft Auto... Especially with the re introduction to planes which is a sight for sore eyes after IV happened... I don't want to talk about IV...As an amateur writer there are some things I don't want to do... Such as what everyone has to go through. I have to say this with a heavy heart after my fanboyism died down and its been almost a year after the game was ported to PCRockstar Games is full of lazy greedy and manipulative people.Most may be curious to why I said that. Well it all started when the multiplayer portion of GTA V was released. I should've pointed out hints to hold back my purchase when it was announced that Online would be a completely separate game which i'm sure anyone who can see are able to point that out as untrue. Now I know why they labeled Online as a separate experience.First off the launch was horrendous. I had my character deleted twice and my levels set back multiple times servers went down numerous times during the initial week and I ran into various glitches that forced me to restart my system. It was unacceptable on Rockstar's part especially for the amount of quality they put into their games and DLC. I continued and kept my faith strong even through a lackluster release.Shark cards weren't much of a problem but a foreshadowing after the buggy release and I had loads of fun with my friends mission structure was alright through somewhat grindy and reminiscent of an MMO style game which through the cracks it was. There were still bugs but they were par for the course nothing serious or game breaking so I shrugged it off and grinded away. The hours that I put in did add to the value of GTA$ I earned per mission and I spent it conservatively along with just screwing around with my friends. Even the hackers weren't that bad and were few and far between thanks to Xbox's consistency paired with Rockstar's charm and problems like hundreds of millions of GTA$ given out to everyone were resolved though in one instance it took them months... They even had a scheduled date of when they were removing the cash so everyone could buy anything before they got rid of it. This was when money wasn't much of Rockstar's priority of which I should've been grateful of for the time being.Before I sold my Xbox to... Make Buoyancy so to speak. I concluded that GTA5 was an excellent magnum opus of the 360's generation and met most of my standards but times have changed and almost three years later my outlook is a farcry to what it was.Though my opinion on the story stays the same since it hasn't really changed much with the exception of more content such as cars clothing and weapons. Online has changed juridically with that so has Rockstar's stance on modding and payouts for races jobs etc. Both have changed for the worseStarting off Rockstar doesn't give a about hackers they run rampant on PC servers and plague the servers with funny sounding dudes speaking Chinese and spawnkilling me while they turn invincible. I'm not sure about other places such as Europe and whatnot but I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same. The problem is pretty self explanatory really and I shouldn't go much into depth with that. Not only that but when a guy tried to make a dedicated server version of GTA Online complete with a server browser and the freedom to do whatever just like MTA it would've been extraordinary and could've drawn more people into buying GTA V. I know it would for me. But of course Rockstar or specifically Take Two Interactive sent two investigators to the creator of the mod and gave him a personal cease and desist letter.Now let me make this clear so it'll sink in. Take Two Interactive A triple A games company sent private investigators to a guy who made a dedicated server version of GTA Online's house they literally took the time to send two dudes in business suits out to a guy who mods video games for free mind you 's house just to ""investigate him"". What a serious load of financial greed and t.GTA Online as it stands now in my opinion is hopeless jobs with a decent payout is few and far between and things such as cars and clothing got more expensive than before and what I should really feel bad about is the people who are still faithful that GTA Online is still in its prime and glory. Those days are gone and i'm sure if I spend more time grinding it out and wasting my time i'd feel the same even compelled to buy a shark card or two. The sheer fact of Rockstar lying under their tongue is the final nail in the coffin for me Rockstar has changed for the worse and by now with how much money they're sitting ontop of it would take a miracle for that to changeIn conclusion if you haven't gotten Grand Theft Auto V yet and you want to buy it please don't waste your time with Online at least Rockstar finds single player much more acceptable to mod there rather than Online. The single player experience is somewhat flawed but a satisfactory experience nonetheless but I still would recommend getting San Andreas for anyone who is newly interested in the series. It's both fun and challenging.Oh and I dont give scores for games because I think its stupid and devalues the bulk of the review",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-28,0,0,280,False,Not Recommended,TLDR If you're buying this game solely to play Grand Theft Auto Online by yourself don't. Wait until a sale. This game is not worth 60 dollars.This is a beautiful game with diverse characters and a unique story but is it worth the price? No! Don't get me wrong this game is pretty good and doesn't fail to entertain but there are a lot of other games that you can buy and get the same enjoyment as GTAV and only pay half the price! The story is stretched out and can sometimes be overwhelming especially with all the sidetracking things and the extra content The online mode isn't a pleasent experience for newer players especially if they care about KDR (kill death ratio). Other players outclass newer players with jets tanks even nuclear weapons and they are NOT afraid to abuse their power. When a group of experienced players team up on a noob it is not a pleasent experience. The loading times are awful especially for Grand Theft Auto Online. If you don't have something to keep you occupied while you wait 10 minutes just to load into a lobby then it's probably going to be the longest 10 minutes of your life. The community is probably one of the most toxic on Steam good luck making friends.There's a lot more cons that outweigh the pros in this game but I don't want to cramp my fingers.

2017-06-16,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,I am sad to see a great game like this lose its modding support. Allowing mods for a game is beneficial in many ways. It allows creators to express their creative minds for a game they love. For users it allows them to experience the game in new ways that they may never have imagined. Developers also benefit from this as well. This encourage people to continue to play the game after the player has experienced the vanilla content of the game. Modding also attracts a broader audience since there are players that may not like all of the vanilla aspects of the game but they still buy the game because they know they can changes the things they do not like. Though there are some negative effects of modding such as content being added to the game that the developers did not want to see in the game I believe that the good aspects of modding outweigh the negatives. This is why I am so disappointed with Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive. I hope that these two companies see the public outcry against their decision and take action to reverse their cease and desist order. I also hope that other developers see how unfavorable this kind of action is for the gaming community and do not take a similar course of action to ban modding.,Grand Theft Auto V

Unfortunately that reason is they're trying to push you towards the DLC cash cards that cost a lot of real money and only give you a little in game cash.

2017-05-30,0,0,144,False,Not Recommended,The online version of this game is probably one of the worst unbalanced money hungry boring and ultimately unfair online experience I have ever experienced. If you don't have money you will have to grind these long loading screen boring repetitive side missions as finding a normal mission these days is impossible or very rare. Also expect to do this alone because the only players left in GTA 5 Online are trolls griefers and harrassers. They will make it their mission to just make your day complete They will just wait outside and follow you everywhere you go simply to kill you and ruin anything that is outside of missions. Players now are so aggressive and inconsiderate that they will spend hours upon hours of their useless lives to make this online experience a bad experience. The worst part about this is that there is no penalties for all of this. They can wait outside your apartment for hours just to kill you or just wait for you to do any serv/motor missions just to blow up the goods and run away with passive mode just to do it again. Rockstar is uncaring of its playerbase instead they encourage the behavior of these players to kill so that the players who are getting completely rekt due to the sheer difference in level money and equipment will be forced to buy gameshark cards or continue to suffer losses. I rate the online game a 1/10 and the 1 is most likely due to the fact that you can play with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-25,1,1,66,False,Not Recommended,I purchased this game basically for playing online. Though I played single player too and Single player is great and has a good story. The other overall mechanics in the game are way better than previous GTA games too. But the problem here is the online mode which is full of flaw. First if you start the online you have to just watch loading screen for more than 10 minutes in some cases. The character customization is limited and i expected more from the game. When the game starts it takes a long loading again and when you join a match it loads again and when you complete a match it loads and when you get ready for next match it loads again and when you leave a match it loads again. And yeah all are irritating loading times. If you plan to roam in the city you have turn on passive mode so that hackers don't kill you repeatedly. Even in JOBs you will find hackers ruling the match either in your or in the opposing team.Everything made in online is just flaw for the game. They should have separated the online and single players mode as stand alone games. But on this game i won't recommend you spending on this. You can get it on sale if you want to play the story mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar make GTA better and better with each installment. Best campaign and despite some people prefering the basic archaic online of GTA4 the GTA5 online expeience is unmatchable there is work involved to make your money but what good would the game be if you didn't have to put in any effort to be rewarded with fast cars swave apartments and the like then what would be the point?,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-07-26,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,In my experience with this game I do not recommend it to anyone who isnt sure that they can play online. I bought it only to play online and I couldnt get into a single online game without everyone bouncing out of the lobby. I tried literally every possible fix and got nothing. to the point where I spent 5 hours of in game time troubleshooting and staring at loading screens and then Steam wouldn't agree to refund me because I was 3 hours over the limit (eventually they gave me the refund after I relentlessly asked for it but they wouldnt have given it to me if it wasnt my right as I also wouldnt have been so relentless if it wasnt). SO if you want to take the risk go for it. I have no problems playing online with other games. And you wont get jack from Rockstars support theyll just keep replying with default auto reply emails and wont look at what you actually wrote in the email. Seriously a damn shame was really looking to continue my progress from my PS4 character on the gloriousness of PC. Sucks...,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,1337,False,Not Recommended,I've changed my review for GTA V from Recommend to Do No Recommed because 1. Cheaters everywhere I know everyone has said it before but it's still a severe issue. How long has the game been out? R* doesn't have too many excuses2. Security The rockstar social club accounts have little to no protection from it being hijacked and stolen from hackers. No email verification for changing password or email seems like an easy thing to fix but that hasn't happened yet. R* refuses to achknowladge the issue and take action so many are left without their accounts as they are stolen. There's an obvious data breach but R* remains silent.3. Customer Support last but far from being least as every user who has dealt with this support can agree that it's the worst. They don't help the policies don't work and they don't reply or leave people hanging for months. EA has better support and it's ing EA. I feel that R* needs to fix these issues in order to progress. I love R* and all their games but just how they deal with hard to tackle issues that every top dog game company deal with like Valve or Blizzard is inexcusable. I can without a doubt recommend this game when these problems are fixed but right now I don't see that.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-20,0,0,94,False,Not Recommended,Even though Take Two's atrocious decision to 'ban mods' from GTA V is what caused it to even cross my mind to write this review in all honesty I would've marked this review a 'recommendation' if there hadn't always been major flaws with the game to begin with.Just to get this out of the way it goes without saying that there was no rational reason for Take Two to make the decision they did for reasons pointed out numerous times before and they will surely be pointed out until the rest of eternity for very good reasons. I'm also not going to elaborate too much on what I find praiseworthy about this game the customization the visuals the copious amount of saturated and engaging content since those things have already been pointed out thousands of times in these Steam reviews alone.Personally what disappoints me the most about this game is the lackluster gameplay the way the controls feel. While vehicles do behave a bit unrealistically it's not an inherently bad thing I'd go as far as to say that it only makes the game more fun for players (such as myself) who don't particularly well... have the slightest clue how to drive properly. What's objectively good with how the vehicle controls feel though is that they're responsive.The same can't be said for when you're on foot though. While there isn't noticeable delay between user input and the player character doing something based on that input actions tend to have ridiculously long 'windup phases'. Sure your character does start moving in a direction when you press a key but it takes a staggeringly long time to accelerate to a standard walking speed and a matter of seconds to actually start running. After you release the key your character must also decelerate and trot around for a few steps possibly falling down from a rooftop or performing some time consuming unwanted parkour moves in the middle of an intense firefight.The combat gets even more infuriating in close quarters situations. When the third person camera doesn't really cut it in a given situation I usually go for the first person mode. While it's theoretically (and usually in practice too) superior it does have problems of its own. You can't fire if you're standing too close to a wall. You can't strafe run heck you can't even properly strafe unless you're aiming down the gun sights which reduces your situational awareness and movement speed.I do understand that emulating real human movement is a conscious decision intended to make the game more immersive but immersion should never come at the expense of actual playability. Sure it does look good on paper and even in my opinion more immersion usually equals a more enjoyable game but that's certainly not the case here one's appreciation for immersion will be quickly replaced with frustration upon facing the issues mentioned above. There are numerous features that I can only interpret as signs of a PC release never being quite high on the devs' and/or publisher's priority list. The weapon selection wheel is a joke. You can't strafe unless you're aiming down the gun sights (yes I mentioned this twice because it's relevant to do so here too and because it's such a major flaw). Interactions with the surrounding environment are triggered automatically (usually in the case of arriving to destinations to start missions) or from an unnecessarily long distance from the object the player is attempting to interact with. The way the game chooses a cover for your character to get behind when pressing the take cover key is 'extremely automatic' and hardly ever gets the job done right.In addition to these (and other) faulty gameplay elements the software itself is also somewhat faulty. Even with an SSD and a fast and stable internet connection the loading times for both Single Player mode and Online are frustrating at best and infuriating at worst. It feels as if getting a group of specific players to the same session/match/heist (to you know play with your friends for example) has been intentionally hampered for whatever reason. I'd be tempted to say that keeping people in the session until the match/heist can be finished is also a challenge of its own but whether you or one of your teammates gets randomly disconnected or stuck at a loading screen is mostly dependent on luck (both of these 'incidents' will naturally lead to dozens of minutes spent staring at loading screens). Sometimes during a post game loading screen the game might decide you don't have an internet connection and throw you into Single Player mode although this time it happens instantaneously further underlining that the loading times are not supposed to be as long as they are.Grand Theft Auto V is still by all means an enjoyable game and I'll undoubtedly be spending lots and lots of time playing it in the future. It's worthy of both praise but also scrutiny. Unless you're willing to overlook some significant flaws I doub't you'll find the game worth the full 60 /$/ /whatever price. Buy it when it's on sale.Also microtransactions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-03,0,0,147,False,Recommended,Great game very nice and fun to explore around the city that is vibrant and jostling. After completion however it is quite boring and multiplayer is also quite boring in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-04-19,0,0,442,False,Recommended,I will start off with the single player. It's too short. I just completed the game 2 days ago and was left wanting more. More crazy bad fun heist missions with Trevor Michael and Franklin. The idea of 3 players in a story is good and it was fun. There just isn't much of it. I did alot of the Strangers and Freaks missions. I believe I did them all. I haven't see any new ones popup. I did all the main story missions. The story missions were fun. But like I said the main game is too short and left me wanting more. Driving around randomly and going on a killing spree is not as fun as the missions which have a purpose behind them. Once you finish the game the world just seems big open and and boring. Doing the story missions it's like you are actually in a living real city. Afterwards it goes back to be being a boring game with nothing that provides any excitement. A large empty great looking virtual world with nothing to really do. There is only so many times you can sky dive crash cars blow things up or kill people it gets boring very quickly. The fun only lasts for a while. The story and the missions are good otherwise I wouldn't be complaining. Also the single player seemed really easy to me. I can see why they give you the option to replay missions now. I also have the feeling I spent $60 for a tutorial. That is all the single player seemed to be is a tutorial for the multiplayer. I feel that Rockstar focused on the multiplayer and cut the single player short. Which is a negative to me cause I don't care for the multiplayer. I will get into that next. My complaints about the multiplayer seemed to be the same as others opinions of it. It's a hot mess. Hackers everywhere. Cheaters. Wallet warriors. All the worst plagues of multiplayer games are there in the multiplayer. I spent some time in Multiplayer but not much. What time I was in multiplayer I spent my time running and hiding from people that have better guns better vehicles and armor. They are also have more money than I do in game and are at a higher level allowing them to have access to better equipment. This means you will be fodder for them till you gain the ability to get the better stuff. This is where Rockstar came in with their own messed up ideas. The multiplayer is a grind fest. You have to grind for something called rep from what I can tell is like xp in an RPG. You then have to grind for the in game money to buy stuff. It's just one grind after another. But wait you can buy ingame currency in the form of Shark Cards. Now you see where this is going. GTA Online is just one big money making scheme for Rockstar. You paid for the game now they want more money from you to have fun in a game you paid for already. This reeks of the worst pay2win elements from the worst Free2Play games. The problem here is GTA Online is not free2play. You have to buy the game to get access to the multiplayer. The multiplayer is full of lame boring missions like a deathmatch mission. When I played no one seemed to bother with these missions at all. They all seemed to occupied with harassing new players and blowing each other up. No Rockstar having some D bag in ahuge armored SUV chasing you around with sticky bombs is not fun. Its the farthest thing from it. I would not buy this game for the multiplayer only. It isn't that great. Another issue I want to get to is the updates they do for the game. They mess the game up most of the time and stays a mess till they fix it and that could take months. The most notable issues recently have been stuttering and frame rate drop. Several months ago it was frame rate drops when firing weapons. Then it was stuttering. They seemed to have fixed it. Then they did another patch and now the game is stuttering again. This issue hasn't been fixed yet. I uninstalled and reinstalled again ran CC cleaner and defraged my HDD and it seemed to help some but the game will still stutter quite a bit. Longer stutters to like 1 2 second freezes. I really wished they would just fix the game and leave it alone. I also hope they release some DLC that adds to the single player experience. Give us single player people some more missions to do. More heists would be nice. But I have a feeling they want to herd us into the multiplayer or try to anyway. The single player is good and starts out slow. Just a warning you don't make alot of money in this game. The game world brings up the recession alot and the economy so maybe this reflects it. But you don't make any money at all during the first several missions. Most of the stuff you will be doing will be done for free. Sure there are lots of ways to make money in the game. But in the other GTA games you got paid pretty well for missions especially the later missions. This game isn't like that at all. I would definitely wait for the game to go on sale or for a price drop. It isn't worth $60. There isn't $60 worth of single player content there in my opinion. More like $40 or so. The multiplayer isn't worth $60 either. This is definitely a game you can wait for a price drop for. I don't want to give it a thumbs down though. I guess it's going to be a thumbs up. I am going to give it a 7/10 because of the short single player and the horrible multiplayer. But what is available in the Single player is pretty good. Trevor Phillips is the most interesting character in the game. His missions were the most interesting as well and he makes the heists more interesting. The story between Michael and Trevor is pretty damned good. It's shame it seemed to end so quickly. It's just not $60 worth of single player content.,Grand Theft Auto V

Game used to crash for me alot before i capped my fps at 58 frames. I used to get the err_gfx_d3d_init error after every 25 30 mins of gameplay. So i fixed it by capping my fps 58 frames. GTA V offline Story mode is awesome and long. You wont feel bored playing the story mode.GTA V online Now this is the real deal here. I only play online. It is the best online game i have played so far. Online has wide variety of stuff to do from roaming around in free mode and playing heists or missions with other players (friends). You'll never fell bored of playing in online. Unless you encounter griefers or cheaters. Cheaters are running rampant in GTA V online. Full of script kiddies. You'll encounter cheaters in almost every session if you leave your apartment or office building. The best way to avoid them is to play in closed friends only session or invite only sessions if you want to play 1 v 1 PVP or TDM/Missions/Heists etc. GTA V developers are also not able to deal with this issue so far and legit players are getting targeted from both ends. Either cheaters will drain your RP or drain your money. Or they'll give you huge amount of cash and RP and get you banned by social club eventually. This game is not meant for competitive gameplay at all. However it is the most fun to play minus the griefers and cheaters. Best stress buster after a whole day of work.Things to keep in mind for playing Online a) Never pickup dropped cash bags from cheaters.b) Set your mouse settings to Free aim in gamepad settings and to direct Input (fixed my mouse stutter). As free aim lobbies are less populated and it is also the best aiming mode.c) Whenever you see a cheater/hacker in your lobby. Jump into the Nope train and get into another session by finding new session after reporting them from the players list.d) Never beg for money to cheaters/hackers. It will get you banned as well.e) Never try glitch in public sessions as you'll get reported. you can try them secretly and risk being getting banned.f) Make friends ingame so you can play with them everyday freely.g) Dont roam around in freemode with passive mode disabled thinking nothing will go wrong. If you see 2 3 players in a car coming fast at you they're probably coming to kill you Dh) Never modify your GTA V game directory or add files for mods online. You'll get instantly banned on your next online session.i) If your rank is below 80 dont go 1v1 PVP against higher ranked players. You'll get your handed over to you in a silver platter. You atleast need the heavy sniper first. trust me Dj) Make new friends and join any active crew with legit players or with 100 members not more than that. Dont join IGN crew it cancerous. Dk) I wouldn't recommend buying shark cards for the extra money. As that can be taken away by cheaters easily. Its better to grind ingame heists or missions than to pay more money for ingame cash.l) Lastly try to optimize your game by changing ingame settings and lowering them to get a smooth gameplay without stutter and keep a balance between visualquality and performance.So thats all from me.

So now they are banning players because they are too inept to build a functioning online mode. Also as a side note I spent over 300 on this game (PS3/PS4/PC version and shark cards).Edit was unbanned so yeah... that changes things. It's a good game but the online component is riddled with modders and griefers. It's sad because it's a solid game otherwise.

2017-12-31,0,0,205,False,Recommended,GTA V offers the GTA experience we have all come to expect and more. The world of GTA V is expansive and well thought out. Coming back to Los Santos after all these years feels just right. Strory is good by GTA standards and while your choices as a player don't really make a difference to overall story expect at the end I really like the 3 protagonist approach. Side quest are also fun and provide much of the WTF feeling D GTA Online however is in my opinion mostly just a cash crab. It can be fun at times but often halts down to a grind for money doing the same missions over and over if you are not willing to pay to win. Also PvP elements often are spoiled by horrible lag and netcode issues (this could be improved haven't played in a while). So recommended for the singleplayer not so much for the online. Trevor is love trevor is lyfe.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,288,False,Not Recommended,Update rolls in.. Getting the new stuff would make the game fun again for at least a week. You look at the prices everything costs 10m grinding that kind of money would take over 15 hours and it would be enough for only ONE of the new cars and other stuff. The only reasonable way would be to buy shark cards but you would have to spend 4 times what the game cost to get any of the new sh*t. Then you look into modding. Finally a way to make the game fun again and not make yourself go bankrupt. The game is fun again tons of people are playing it because of modding. GTA RP becomes a thing. The game becomes one of the most watched on livestreaming sites. The amount of people playing GTA doubles even triples because of GTA RP. But people playing on RP servers and having fun means that people aren't paying for overpriced sh*t on the official servers. They just can't take that! So they ban modding. The only thing keeping the game alive. Well done well f*cking done.,Grand Theft Auto V

Single player is boring and no single player dlc has been released after all these years!! the online is a show full of modders hackers trolls and p2w kids that bought everything to have an advantage over you. Though the modders and hackers are actually cheesing rockstar off because they lose money to them so that's good I guess. This doesn't stop rockstar banning and punishing those that got given stuff from the hackers/modders in the online that they didn't want with no way of stopping or deleting this once it happens... but hey oh well.. you and give us money from our shark cards plz!I have never really enjoyed this game as much as everyone did even back in 2013 when the game was first released anyway but I still bought it on ps4 and pc! Now in 2017 the game has finally gotten the reviews it deserves calling out its t. Taketwo and rockstar are greedy uninspired trash who only care about money..not making a good fun enjoyable and FAIR game.OpenIV was the last straw for me with this game and for rockstar and taketwo in general.. Rockstar acted the good cop bad cop during when taketwo shut down OpenIV (gta mod)and expects everyone to kiss their (rockstar) backside after they (rockstar) spoke out against this..well no because if it wasn't for these reviews the community backlash and anger about their new stance on mods..nothing would have changed so don't defend rockstar for anything! rockstar and their PR stunts is nothing new either.Once again it's good to see this game finally dying and getting what it deserves.Especially after rockstar increased the price just before a sale started so the price didn't change at all during that time. That one thing alone was what really taught me everything I needed to know about what rockstar has become. So all in all..

Its hard to find people for your team quest and even when you complete your missions they give you such little meagre payouts that its not even worth the time to grind it out.

GTA online is just another big name company producing another milk/time grinding experience in which not only Rockstar is stealing your money and time with shark cards and free updates which is just more superficial novelties but trying to get your to fund their probably next predecessor to this game REDACTED the game.

Take Two are ignoring the fact that modding is one of the key factors of why GTA has been so popular for so long and now they want to say that it is illegal. They are trying to kill the single player modding scene so everyone will move to multiplayer and spend more money on microtransactions. Because people who only play single player don't give any more money to Take Two they feel the need to forcibly remove the way a majority of the single player gamers enjoy their game. Take Two Interactive is a scumbag company and I will never buy another product from Rockstar Games 2k Games or any other game that has any involvement with Take Two Interactive.

There is definitely enough to offer in the Single Player to warrant getting this game it's a big step up from GTA IV and even the slightly duller missions don't really drag it down. Hearing they were revisiting a map they'd already done sounded like a misstep but it feels completely different and is a great sandbox.But Online... the most infuriating thing is just how good it could be but the loading times are horrific and the matchmaking is completely unreliable. It comes across that getting a private lobby with friends in freemode is your best bet.

Recently though they stole $4.7 Million from me when I DIDN'T EVEN CHEAT. I know what you're thinking ""Contact Rockstar Support"" No. Contacting Rockstar support is worse than even contacting Steam support copy and paste information from FAQ's and they don't even believe anything you say like other people here.

2016-05-26,0,0,842,False,Recommended,"This review is mostly for GTA Online where I spent the bulk of my time.There are some mentions of the single player though.Where to even start with this game? There's so much to discuss so let's make a list. Pros Enjoyable/memorable single player Multiplayer is pretty fun Customization of vehicles is in depth in GTA Online and GTAV Player character customization in GTA Online is rough but allows for good custom characters Ability of a ""passive mode"" in case you're tired of the violence in Los Santos Normal Rockstar humor and charactersCons Toxic community Grinding is required to get a steady cash flow Absurd in game prices (Infliation really hit Los Santos hard didn't it?) Unbalanced gameplay with high level unlocks V.S. low level unlocks (Low level players are often broke or unable to purchase weapons that can really damage a higher level's tank fighter jet or armored car. Some purchasables are achievable at any point but require use of a shark card or saving a lot of money for a long period of time.) Weird Peer to Peer servers that often queue you outside of your zoned areaEnding Notes While I don't agree with the direction Rockstar has gone with the pricing of the new stuff in each update I still think this game has so much to offer in GTA Online. Rockstar still updates this game with new vehicles gamemodes and other neat stuff.Single player is really fun and is well written from a comedic perspective. It also offers a lot of content on it's own and mods add a lot more to it.I'd highly recommend this game and it's even better with a group of friends to play it with.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-29,3,1,107,False,Recommended,An awful game made by awful people for awful people that's why I love it so much. Also careful out of context talking about the stuff you can do in this game will likely get you a terrorist watch list.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-09-26,0,0,371,False,Not Recommended,A massive waste of potential purely because of the greed from the publisher.extremely volotile attitude towards modding.

2018-09-27,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,Fun game. Enough content to go around. PvE Coop is my favorite (Heists) and a lot of PvP modes. I love it.Though the loading/waiting times are annoyingly LONG. It is ridiculous. It takes the fun out of the game. Also if you are not with friends filling up a heist crew or other modes can take approximately forever. I am short on my time (I have kids) so I like to play for one hour or so. These waiting times are killing the game for me.If you have enough friends to go online with you go for it.If you are a lone and casual player like me wait for the loading times to improve. Like I said they are f***ing ridiculous. Play Just Cause 3 instead.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-02,0,0,391,False,Not Recommended,"Everyone knows the game and what it is about so I won't write a review raving over the single player or the immersive world which are still holding up fine after all this years.The thing is that Rockstar a long time ago (in game release years) dropped the additional single player DLCs in favor of the online which blew up big time. GTA V finally released on the PC and from that day till the current time of this review it is riddled with modders which mess with you either by destroying your gameplay/fun/business or filling everyone in the lobby with money that you never asked for or wanted.But overtime Rockstar/TakeTwo found out that people want an easy way out of the established grindy way of getting some money and released the shark cards which totally coincidently are not affected by the ""account adjustments"" for when a modder fill you with money and that money will not be taken away if Rockstar feels like it the other day.In my experience I worked my way to level 60 something while leaving every lobby as soon as I saw anything out of the ordinary (someone used scripts) and have lost countless fun times with other players due to the fear of banning. One day we were 4 people in a player's yaght after having completed 4 setups and a guy started putting in our normal accounts (not bank) 50.000GTA$ per second. This was the first time that a modder dropped money on me and I was scared of getting banned so I took a screenshot alt+f4 out of GTA sent a ticket to rockstar with full details (modder account name time amount recieved).Next day a canned message arrived from R* reassuring me that I won't get banned and that their regular sweeps will adjust my balance.One and a half months later while trying to do my maths so I wouldn't touch the modded money I caved in. I bought a CEO office slightly nicer that what my legit money would have allowed me to get. About three weeks later the bunker update came R* did the adjustments taking away all the money (every last $) while giving me 20.000GTA$ to start my bunker carrier while bombarding me with all the new content on the map with notifications unavoidable telephone calls and ads on the loading screen for shark cards. To be fair I expected this well I expected it in the first days or weeks and not 2+ months later right before the big update.I said OK now that I don't have ""dirty"" money it is a new start. I worked (by the definition of the word) for one week every night to get the oppresor because I like bikes and flying in this game. No guns no bunkers just the bike for rides in free mode. Then I thought that I have to earn 2mil $ as a safe net for weapons and such expenses. I built a steady 2mil $ but I lost my interest in the online as I felt that it was getting rediculous by the amount of grind y work you have to do in order to get a new toy and have some limited fun. So from then I have only gone online 2 times and about 10 15 times directly to single player just to interact with the beautiful world of Los Santos in peace. Today I wanted to play some single player while listening to my podcast and as soon as I dropped into single player there was a banner over the GPS saying that ""Rockstar game services have corrected your account by 1973871"" which was all the money I had in the bank (the 30 something thousand$ in hand are intact).At this stage I really can't care less about GTA online with R* shady intents BS and fundamentally corrupt practises. I bought GTA for the fun I had with every previous title and blind faith to R* (from their solid track record) but GTA V recent direction made me avoid R* for now on with their money grabbing techniques. Sure the single player is pretty fine but R* wants you online and actively buying shark cards in order to enjoy this game.The above is for the people that hate this trend of microtransaction on everything just stay away from this title for your own good. You can spent all this hours on something you genuinely enjoy and love like a game/ your family/ a hobby/ your job or whatever else. GTA V online unfortunatelly turned overtime into a cancerous monstrosity.I would not recommend it at all even to the last persons that haven't fallen in this Rockstar/TakeTwo rabbit hole.I just wish I hadn't spent all this time on the online believing that everything is possible and achievable just by trying to improve.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-15,0,0,793,False,Recommended,I've been playing nothing but this game for the past 3 months and at this point in time have garnered over 125+ hours. What do I think of it? I love this game I found the story to be really fun and the gameplay to be even better possibly the only game where I didn't get tired of a certain mission type.The problems with this game lie in the online. I love the online in this game most of my playtime came from it. But unless you have an actual friend to play it with you or enough cash to buy an apartment then don't even bother with it. I had to buy the $100 000 shark card in order to get an apartment to do heists and get even a bit of money. And the public online sessions are a huge waste of time considering how riddled with hackers they are. Another problem with this game is the price. $60 for a ing 5 year old game? You've gotta be ing kidding. Do not and i repeat DO NOT get this game unless it is on sale for either $30 or less if you pay full price then you're wasting your money.On an unnecessary sidenote if you still live with your parents and they say that you can have this game but you can only play the online then don't bother playing this game in the first place.In conclusion I highly recommend this game to people. If you are sensitive to extreme violence then maybe skip the campaign. But overall if you are planning to buy this game get it for the campaign first and online second.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-26,0,0,1751,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly the game can be fun every now and again but with the amount of griefers modders/hackers and downright jerks who play this game I would say don't buy it. In addition there are a lot of problems with the game including getting your money removed for reasons that make no sence more recently the issue of the ""free"" albany hermes and many more things that will likely never be fixed. Also almost all the cool stuff is really expensive and you either have to grind jobs and stuff for hours days and sometimes weeks to get enough to buy them and the payouts for the things your doing aren't really worth it half the time because of how long it took to get it. Alternatively you could waste your real money buying shark cards (unless you have a bonus) because if you want to get most of the stuff you will need a couple million dollars and thats a lot of real money that you would be spending on shark cards. All in all if you really want this game then buy it but if your thinking about whether to buy this game or not I would say save your money for something else.",Grand Theft Auto V

It's not really easy for them to stop the hackers while there are over 1 000 000 people playing this game everyday. Rockstar is obviously banning them but they can't do it all at the same time.I have played this game since the day it came out and I had a very bright smile on my face first time I played it.

2017-06-14,0,0,280,False,Not Recommended,"Fun game. Why negative then? They've basically killed the modding scene. They shut down a huge tool for modding this game. Until this changes this review remains negative. Take Two get your stuff together. Do not go down this road. I mean seriously making modding illegal? That's ridiculous and we all know it. What are you afraid of? Security breaches you say? OpenIV wasn't responsible for anything to do with that and you know it. Cut it out. Mods do nothing to harm your game. On the contrary they improve it. They keep a playerbase. They keep people interested going back for more after they've exhausted everything you have to offer. So why do it? Why kill the modding scene? Why make a huge mistake for a hugely successful and very fun I might add game? This review is staying negative. I will update it if Take Two resolves this. Possibly to a positive review who knows? Until then I will boycott it. Some of you reading this may not like it but I have made the choice. P.S. Before the inevitable person thinks ""This guy gave a negative review because of the modding scene boo hoo"" quiet down. I don't give a toss if the modding scene died I'd still judge the game. I'm writing this as the basis for the review because the publishers are actively suppressing the modding scene for this game when at release Rockstar North (the primary developers of GTA V) expressed interest in what the modding scene had to bring to the table for the game. Seeing the point now? If not then I can't convince you. Drop your 'unhelpful review' rating and move on. TL DR blah blah blah publishers are suppressing mods shortening the game's lifespan in turn and overall causing a ruckus over mods mass boycott blah blah blah you get the idea.",Grand Theft Auto V

Tons of mods tons of vihecles but you will end up plaing onlame mission and repeating it dozens of times. Sure you can play quick matches but it's not profitable which drains all of the pleasure. There aren't many things that you can spen your money on. Basically vehicles.Things worth mentioning is the loading screan which takes forever.

2016-10-03,0,0,285,False,Not Recommended,I am redoing my review because my thoughts have changed on the game since i originally reviewed it. Grand theft Auto 5 is the 5th main story line installment of the popular franchise It is an open world game with many possibility it offers multiplayer a large map huge variety's of things to do and endless entertainment. Pros Very large map The map is so large that there is many different places to visit around the game worldMany missions The amount of missions you can do in the game allows for many hours of entertainment without doing the same thing twice.Possibilities The game offers alot of dynamic aspects from the wheather to the ability to cause mass chaos simply by high jacking a car. There is hundreds of vehicles to chose from as well as many weopons to chose from.Online There is no shortage of online players making it easy to join a server and play with the people of the globeCons Modding Modding was one of the largest parts of the GTA scene many people increased their offline solo play experience by downloading and using some of the mods (of which there was thousands to choose from) The mods opened up a whole new level of play and Take Two software (owners of rockstar) removed them.Online reporting system I have had my fair share of problems here. I never could have a day in GTA 5 where someone didn't shoot me on site. Due to this i took to defending myself. I'm not going to lie Yes i did often do the same thing But i did it once and moved on just for defense. But when it comes to people who camp kill you and laugh about it i usually fought back and when i finally managed to start killing them I got mass reported and was suspended the reason for the suspention was (Ruining the epxerience for others) all of my characters and houses were reset i lost 100 hours of work because some butt hurt 12 year olds reported me with a bunch of their friends. ConclusionDue to the environment single player expereince and the constant updates this game in my eyes is still worth the purchase it is a lot of fun and since they lowered the price it is even more so worth it however due to the fact that there is no justice in their reporting system and it seems like someone can just have friends and gets someones entire account reset or banned I will give this game a 5/10 and not recommend it on the premis of the Multiplayer being unbalanced and unfair.

2017-05-28,0,0,1894,False,Recommended,"Here's an honest review Rockstar really created a milestone with GTA V. Using motion capture in their production creating a mesmerizing world and artwork and a somewhat strong and dramatic storyline with 3 different characters to play with.The protagonists are criminals as usual but we also see everyday life struggles. An unemployed mid aged man trying to make it big time. A former military pilot who is mentally unstable and finally a father who is trying to hold his family together.These are really serious and to be honest hard to write on subjects for a video game at least. But I think Rockstar managed to create a well written story there. Also as usual Rockstar again has a great sense of humour in dealing with modern day politics and society. These have always been one of the most important selling points of the game in my opinion.In short the design and art aspect of the game is great. The coding? Not so much unfortunately. Even though the game is not unplayable and the examples are too small to mention they accumulate very quickly over time and may become really frustrating if you focus on them much. Some of the decisions may be understood keeping the online aspect in mind.The idea of having GTA online is wonderful a dream come true and definitely a step forward. Being said that speaking of the devil and frustration this is where the shooting themselves in the foot part comes in. Simply spoken ""Online"" is broken.Loading times and queues are unbearable. Disconnections and session drops are maddening especially when you are on a mission with a friend. Heists become a torture after spending hours and hours of gameplay and effort only to find yourself disconnected just before the end or some newbie quitting because he or she thinks they're on a mission with NPCs some of them don't even realize they're on a heist and try to continue freeroaming and you have to explain beg and explain again...Here comes the cherry on top CHEATERS.... Yes people stop calling them Hackers they're not! They are merely spoiled and low self esteemed cheaters who have no life and try to ruin others' too... They're merely cheaters but the guilt is not on their part.... This is where Rockstar points a minigun on their foot and begin shooting until they run out of bullets.Having the development team already spread for future projects and games will not do any good for them as long as they leave turd trails with their former products. They need to step up their anti cheat coding and come up with a reliable permanent once and for all solution.It is NO FUN AT ALL having invincible people kill you in passive mode teleport you from your home to wherever they want stick a huge UFO on your head put you in a cage or stun you delete vehicles from garage and even steal your real life money from your account. Possibly fun for them but certainly not for us.The fact that there are ""paid"" undetectable softwares out there on the internet is solely enough to bring some really disturbing and dirty questions in mind.Yes there are options to log in a solo session friends or invite only sessions...but what good are they if you can't do most of the missions unless you're in a public session?To sum it up and finalize my review single player is there and it's good. But if you're like me and were excited about the online aspect of the game forget it for now. I'm not even get into the promised but currently disabled online stockmarket.So I ask you what's the point of owning a unicorn if you can't even pet or ride it cause it kicks and bites you every time you try? Hope this helps.Peace &amp out...",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-09-09,1,1,157,False,Recommended,this game makes me really nostalgic for middle school so im really biased but honestly just joining random online sessions with your pals and making friends with other people and just crusing around together is still a great time. you've probably played the story mode a bunch of times but if you haven't this is still one of my favorite story modes and is full a bunch of great missions (minus that ing crane mission with trevor i ing hate that so much it is the bane of my excistence.),Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-19,0,0,216,False,Recommended,GTA V showcases a ton of different activities both offline and online like racing armed combat sports flying vehicles missions etc. And just as many possibilities when trying to create your own fun with the distinctive features it brings liked the custom game modes made by the community or yourself.The narrative is interesting and develops as the three main characters each with their own motives personalities and circumstances interact with each other during the game s story. The missions are diverse and really fun surprising the player of what will come next featuring three different endings. Each character including your online persona is completely customizable with the ability to buy anything available on stores be it a haircut cars houses or weapons.Until now they have included lots of free content mainly focused on the online mode that bring new ways of having fun or other objectives to aim for. However everything is incredibly overpriced when compared with the money you make and the time it takes to acquire it via repetitive missions which greatly promotes the purchase of in game money using real money to buy shark cards.Overall GTA V is an incredible open world sandbox to play with with lots of diverse activities to choose from total freedom amazing graphics and high quality visuals and a really interesting story featuring three different but correlated characters. I highly recommend it.Overall Score 8/10,Grand Theft Auto V

But sales are frequent. If u have some spare money left Not recommended You could also just burn your money Bugs Never heard of You will love the glitches like the repeat glitch. Can get annoying The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsThis game gets addicting especially the Online part. It has numerous land and air vehicles to try and too many different missions and modes to get bored. It feels so satisfying when you buy a vehicle after all the hard work (grinding). Grinding While it's true that it requires so much grinding you can grind different things the main being 8 different heists. The repeat glitch makes it much more easier to get money as you can repeat the finale without doing setups. Because of the repeat glitch I don't find grinding being a problem for me.Modders While it's true that there are modders in the game that doesn't mean that they will not let you play normally. Most modders just mind their own business while some are good help other people and spawn vehicles for them and others just like to cause trouble but they are rare (saw them only 5 8 times in my 200+ hours of playing).Griefers While they do exist and they your game up they aren't everywhere. You can just change the sessions. Banned for no reason lol there's no such You try to mod you get banned. You ask for modded money you get banned. You don't do either you don't get banned. I didn't do any of those and actually a modder once gave me money **BUT** I didn't ask for it so I didn't get banned. I keep seeing people asking for modded money and when they get banned they will most likely say they got banned for nothing lol.Overall While it does have problems and while the negative reviews and haters exist don't let that stop you from getting this game.Note When starting it may be confusing and you may not know what to do but once you collect enough money for an high end apartment and start doing heists things will get clear.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-06,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,All I can say is.. oof. I can tell you that for a game it is very great I played a majority of this game on the PS4 and I do love it overall but for this it is a steam review. And I have to rate this based off a game on its console.For starters I'll go over story mode I love it to death and played it over multiple times.. I personally wish Rockstar made on their promise before their GTA Online release months later after the games release that they would add a bit of story mode DLC to their game I would have absolutely LOVED to buy their DLC. I can understand how hard it may be to implement into a game like this but RDR (and I understand this is a different game on its own) has its own DLC with it and it was a captivating DLC. But story mode a nice 8.5/10.. I respect it with all the realism on the story mode.Now for the online portion and we have a problem.. I'll go over everything and won't miss a detail.Missions Straightforward.. it is a bit fun but it can be repetitive with spamming them to get cash at lower levels and hell it is fun for those who start off.Adversary Mode I can't exactly understand as to why this is even a mode to start out with.Hobbies (golf darts etc.) The only real 'mission' I can consider even putting myself under for online. Golfing is fun darts is a bit on the meh side but.. it is a blast.Heists I really love the idea and have awaited months/years for this release all of us have. I also find it very very fun. I'm a bit bummed that we can't have a free play heist mode where we can go over to the bank it rob it on our own because with this we can actually set up and find ways to escape wihout objectives to tell us what to do but it is still fun. BUT I really hate the fact that it isn't very rewarding to those who look into needing money unless you have done the ever challenging Mastermind Challenge or first time bonuses. I can understand if Rockstar wants to keep this game alive by giving people something to keep playing on but it needs to be a bit more rewarding. At least at least.. Add stock markets to online.In game pricing EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING on this game has a high price nothing is cheap on this game. The only way you are ever going to ever afford something as expensive as a Hydra you may have unlocked from a heist. Or a yacht or a house a garage a nice car nice outfits.. anything. You NEED to be able to pick up every last bit of your life savings and save up to even something you are really really wanting. Again I get that you need people to stick around so this game doesn't die. But you guys have already claimed billions from people because of this game and hell we can make that kind of money on singleplayer but please knock down your prices the singleplayer mode is a reasonable price for everything. ALL GTA Online clothing items and some cars are reasonable. If prices won't go down for some of these things please fix your payout for missions/heists.. everything.. or just add a stock market. You have billions it's possible to implement. If monkeys can be turned into humans then we can have common sense to add a market.Companies Okay I get this is the new age of money making it is possibly even shatters heisting which makes everything else not even worth it but let me tell you it is a hell of a grind unless you have friends. Doing things alone you will be frustrated because other people will blow you up or even kill you and steal from you. Investing in your business overall if you have friends will possibly make you a millionaire over time but don't count your lucky stars you won't become rich that easily or that fast.Controls This is just an opinion so don't attack me just because I have my own matter of opinion if you just have a PC and are only playing on a PC. My advice change all the controls you are comfortable with. I can't bother scratching my head to what button goes where on my keyboard (this makes PS4/Xbox a hell of a lot better) but Oblivion.. you could just use a controller. No.. Coordination with the controller is bad it doesn't even match up with my game let alone work.. I tried hours on end to affixiate my controls and everything but I can't be asked anymore with the controls.P2P GOD please.. remove the shark cards from stores because they aren't worth what you pay for. You will make more money just doing missions alone.. DO NOT buy cards and buy in to their market.Free world gameplay The core of this game is your time in a server (now extended to 28 to 32 than the original 16) and playing with others or on your own.. I don't get why you would play by yourself I guess to save yourself from the toxic community this game has to offer whether it is you to git gud or get rich. The survivability on this game is insane I tell you if your a low level player everyone will make attempt to want to kill you as your the most vulnerable person on that server. I'm not complaining as I'm level 200 but for a steam review a steam game playing a PC version and having to play a online game starting over.. boy it is hard to make a living within an online server without getting killed within 10 minutes. Bounties alone will make you an easy target. It does not matter who you are by the way even if you might be in a random crew they will all make attempt to want to kill you everyone hates you unless you meet another low level or if your lucky you might run into a nice level 125 or something and help you. A very racist sexist and discriminating community.. for the exceptional others.. the nice players.. I love you. But for those who mudstompped me and spawn killed you are as toxic as toxic gas my friend.. I can't stress enough to be pulled up on by a tank when I'm just driving by minding my own business riding my bike and just getting blown to bits. Aside from that and countless times being killed by Hydra/Laser swarmer try hards.. Cheaters are a majority of the problem. I get I was involved within a modded server but hell can't I play a legit game? Yeah it may be nice getting millions to billions of dollars just to be able to buy things and getting your rank modified.. but I hate it to those who think they are God on a server and can 'help those in need'.. a little sympathy for Rockstar not being able to put a full stop to these cheaters it isn't just modding alone the glitching section of the community too. I remember back in the day with the Adder selling glitch being a top priority to make money I'm guilty to buying into it yes.. but the game is no fun when you have cheaters too ruining your fun. But hey we are all different doing our own things so.. you do you.But Rockstar a message from a newly steam reviewer to the big shot in the offices over at your studio.. FIX your community FIX your game FIX the prices FIX the rewards other than that you are standing on a literal gold mine you have a semi perfect game. The stunts are amazing I like stunts.. I like dressing up.. I like all the little bits and pieces and all you have to offer but at this stage it makes it harder for new players to just rise back to glory with the community and pushing people to buy something that is.. not.. worth.. it. $100 for $8 million? Damn I'm better off buying a new games collectors edition and completing it without P2W. so.. please fix it.. please. I've been with this game since its release so I hope either A we do something about this in the future where we can have a great game or B.. lose people and the community drops like GTA IV did.Okay.. after an hour of this review..

2017-06-12,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,Take 2 is trying to make modding their game illegal. They've sent cease and desist letters to the creators of OpenIV a mod that only effects the Single Player. They are doing this because they feel they need to push more people to play their boring and grindy multiplayer so they can earn more money from Sharkcards.Don't support TakeTwo. Don't buy this game.Real Review Below The singleplayer is fun but unfortunately it's not very replayable since there will be no DLC packs for SP so your focus is probably going to be the Multiplayer.Multiplayer is a grindfest that tries its best to get you to buy their sharkcards. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are usually needed to do the events that they push out every few months most of these have been sub par. Heists are the most fun but I highly recommend getting a dedicated group of 4 to do them. Unfortunately Rockstar has no plans to add more Heists. Mutliplayer is infested with modders and hackers and adding what a grindfest the multiplayer system is it's overall not fun if you're not playing with friends doing missions and Heists.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you do plan on getting this for Story mode/Modding I'd HEAVILY recommend you get it on sale.Why is GTA O bad you may ask? Well heres a a list Hackers are almost in every single public lobby I have even been in. (Encounters vary from Person to person) E X T R E M E grindfest makes Warframe (a F2P that has a fair bit of grind to it) look childish in terms of grinding. *Basically P2W since Doomsday Heists. This could be a neutral or bad but most Online content requires other players going solo is pretty much super hard and even MORE grindy than if you were with say another person. Everything (except maybe the Vanilla content) is also insanely expensive. Hense the stupid insane grindfest. First few hours are actually fun afterwards it feels like you only work to get things and hardly ever have fun. The new update Gunrunning has completely ed balance. Anyone who is brand spanking new will get eviscerated. And to add to this vehicles from Import/Export are now almost completely useless. The only one that can do anything to anyone would be the ruiner 2K but even then you'd probably get one shotted by a Heavy Sniper w/ Explosive rounds. * And to add EVEN MORE to this Doomsday Heist Update has completely ed balance even more than gunrunning. The power creep is absolutley insane and so is the prices. Shark cards are no longer worth the money due to the absolutely insane inflation of prices. Getting a yacht with nothing but shark cards will cost you around 100 USD.***Hey Take Two and Rockstar You wanna know WHY people hack mod and glitch on GTA O?Because your buisness practices/models are completely and absoutley horrible.If you didn't further the grind and didn't shove Micro transactions down our throats You guys wouldn't put so much effort and time banning and patching. Seriously you really thing this buisness model is going to fly in RDR 2's Online? You must be out of your goddamned mind if you really think that it will turn out well and NOT recieve backlash.Wanna get on the good side of your playerbase? Make the game not require most of your life to play. Many of us have responsibilites jobs etc. I can't believe im even suggesting this but FFS. ADJUST YOUR SHARKCARDS FROM THE INFLATION I GUARENTEE YOU WILL GET MORE SALES IF YOU DO.***That's pretty much all I can think of at the top of my head but i'll probably update this later.TL DRDon't buy for Online buy for modding/story wait until its on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-07,0,0,209,False,Recommended,Online review in short held back by a horrid user interface and at some times during the day 6+mins to load into the game (not including loading times for anything else you want to do) but still incredible fun with friends.In elaboration to create a friends only session you are required to enter singleplayer mode and create it from there purely because they forgot to put the option in the online menus. To get a car delivered to you repair a car call in a helicopter/taxi or anything like that you are required to go through a gimmicky phone menu which requires way too many button presses to find what you're looking for and forces you to wait through a ringtone which can take 3 seconds to 15 seconds and doesn't always go through. There are a couple other menus as well which although they don't have the stupid ringtone gimmick force you to scroll through a list of many things using the arrow keys which takes way too much time.Loading times as I said before often take 6+mins to boot up into online in Australia. Loading into races and such also takes a bit as well. I don't think I'll ever complain about loading times in any other game ever again after playing this.There are also a fair amount of bugs for example when starting a heist if someone is bugged in a loading screen no one in the squad can play the game unless you or the bugged person force close the game passengers are kicked out of the vehicle for no reason if the driver starts a CEO mission races sometimes bug out and don't start etc etc etc.Money is fairly easy to obtain especially through heists and such although if you want to win in freeroam PVP (not the proper PVP though) anyone who buys sharkcards will have a huge advantage over you. Still I have never paid for them and I have still been able to afford everything I want.The community is varied some sessions are filled with people who just want to kill you others are nice and won't blow you up on sight. Modders are very common no less than 1 in every 5 sessions has one and sadly most just want to kill you (and don't them off they can stop you from playing the game for as long as they want even if you join a private session as it happened to me) although some very very rare ones are genuinely fun to play with ones who add some spice to the game without incoveniencing or killing you even if you kill them.Movement mechanics aren't the best pressing A or D makes you slowly turn instead of strafe which is in my opinion the worst thing about combat situations. Mouse flying controls aren't very good either having a controller to quickly switch over to makes it so much better.Now for the good stuff I very much enjoy the driving mechanics each car has a different driving style some grip the road like glue others slide out everywhere and it's always refreshing to switch between different cars once in a while. Heists aren't bad playing them with friends certainly help but after a while you really only play them for money not for the actual gameplay. Still they're pretty enjoyable. Races are pretty good as well as all the other minigames and although they can get a bit repetitive they've lasted me for one hundred hours so far. But above all the greatest thing about GTA is simply all the silly things that can happen and laughing like hell with your friends. Nothing can beat it.I very much recommend getting this game if you have friends to play with. If you don't you may still enjoy it but it's nowhere near as good.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,1,1,577,False,Not Recommended,"I am updating my last review to shine a final light on GTAV. A summary would be like this GTA 5 is a luxurious ice cream mixed with vanilla chocolate and strawberry flavors with a beautiful Canterbury Bell on top making it look like a high class desert designed specifically to give you a taste of heaven with every bite. The moment ice cream touches your tongue you feel like flying. You feel like a feather. Then as you take a second and then a third bite the taste only gets better. You can't control your hand as it automatically goes for more and more while your tongue dances and body tingles with happiness. It's like you're back to being a kid who was eating his first ice cream in the middle of hot summer while your parents looked at you with bright smiles on their faces. But as you progress through this delicious paradise you're met with a dark brown cream. You have never seen it before it doesn't look like any chocolate you know. But it gives a lovely smell of roses. It is even shaped in a form of the Julia Child Rose. But for some reason you feel suspicious. You ask a waiter to come but instead get the manager himself. Confused you ask the manager to describe this unkown substance in your glass but the Manager only nods and assures you that there is nothing to worry about. He when encourages you to proceed and you in your bliss innocense and unfortunate ignorance take a bite. At first the taste feels acceptable almost pleasant but as you chew more you realize something is wrong. It sticks to your throat and it is very hard to chew. It becomes difficult to breath tears fill your eyes and then finally in horror you realize that you're chewing on a pile of You attempt to spit it out but manager just covers your mouth and proceeds to shove more in your mouth. You try to fight back and finally push the man away only to see yourself covered in crap. As you angrily wipe yourself away manager apologizes for his behavior and offers you water and sweet candies. But as you reach out for them manager shoves a bucket of at you again. Angry and confused you shout at the manager but instead of apology manager slaps you like a and tells you that you act lke an animal in his restaurant. After covering you in humiliating you and ruining your blissful experience he kicks you out. As you get up from the floor the manager then in sweet voice tells you this ""You're always welcome to come back!""And shuts the door.This is my experience with GTA5. 444.5 hours.GTA5 Single Player A masterpiece it is alone worth the price.GTA5 Multiplayer Stay away. It is designed for you to buy microtransactions. Not for fun. Every challenge every mission every ""profitable"" activity is designed in a way that you have to face overwhelming odds for a terrible reward. To acquire anything ""cool"" will require you hundreds of hours. The only reason I have most of the stuff is because I got lucky with a modder throwing money at me. My other friend who wasn't this fortunate is still struglling to get even half of what I have yet played this game for almost 1000 hours. Which also brings another issue. Hackers/modders. For one good modder you get 20 griefers. They will insta kill you they will teleport you they will ruin your missions. Report function doesn't work as Rockstar ignores you (also lately they started kicking even the innocent players). Modders do not get punished for months or at all. Every server with more than 10 players has a 90% chance of having a modder.To those who are more into numbers. One of the most profitable businesses you can have in game is GunRunning.You need to periodically resupply your bunker for workers to keep manufacturing your stock. It will take you 25.7 IN GAME hours to gather maximum stock which will be worth 770.000$. If you decide to take risk and deliver it to a more distant location you can get 1 155.000$. Once you start delivering every player will be announced to your presence. They won't be limited to how they can engage you. They can take the most powerful planes cars weapons to destroy your shipment and receive a quick cash for ruining your shipment. If you kill them they lose nothing if they kill you you lose everything. You will have to restart your 25.7 hour session and hope that next time you will be more fortunate.So ask yourself this. Are you prepared to grind and risk losing everything to someone who has a better gear than you or just simply cheats? Most of you have limited time as it is. Do you really think it is worth it to spend your precious time on a game which is designed to make you fail?Of course you can buy Shark Cards and they will give some cash. But here is the thing. The most expensive Shark Card in the game costs as much as the game. You get 8 million in game cash. Here is what you can buy.The cheapest bunker costs 1.165.000$ (needed to run GunRunning missions)That is without all facilities and functions.If we add them you get the price of 2.860.000.That's without all the upgrades to make you production faster (remember those 25.7 hours? You need 2 upgrades for that and 1 upgrade for security reasons)So total price will be 4.964.000$. Almost 5 million!You have 3 million remaining. You need an apartment for heists too. The cheapest one is 215.000$Ok you also want to do CEO business? Ok.Here is the cheapest office.No upgrades 1.000.000$With upgrades 3.900.000$Oh I am sorry. Did I start losing your focus? It is boring reading all these numbers? Well if you're planning on buying this game and plan on investing time and money into GTA Online get used to it. That's what you will be doing the entire time. GTA Online won't be your getaway game from work or school. It will be just another work. Or just don't buy this game and invest in something that is actually fun.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-06,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,It is the most advanced best looking &amp most intuitive car handling of the GTA games. A lot of very weird choices in the game that really ruin the GTA feel. Still fun for the GTA mayham. But you will get at times if you are a die hard GTA fan at what is missing. Online is the big draw single player got crippled. I'll beat it but I dont think I'll play it again. The past GTA games I would start &amp beat again &amp again. Here are the gripes...... YOU NEVER get paid for doing jobs. 35 hrs in &amp $12k still looks real good to Franklin when properties are in the millions. You make money by playing stocks which is just boring as the only real way to make money. NO SIDE MISSIONS for making really extra money whenever (Emergency services ice cream van deliveries taxi rides kill streaks Stealing cars general races Insurance) THESE ACTIVITIES MADE GTA. THEY ARE GONE! The 3 character storyline is well done &amp new but you re not the king of the town the boss no empire you dont run a gang. Your just 3 crooks who s personalities were pulled from past GTA games. They make the game look full with activities to boost your stats but they are pretty much mundane &amp boring &amp you only need them for the first few hours in the game until you max the 3 stats you really only use. THE WORST! NO POINT IN CARS! You spend a ton of time finding the car you like you mod it you loose it &amp never get it back. Cars are never saved so it becomes infuriating &amp altogether pointless to invest in another car unless you wanna just drive it for a bit &amp always put it back in the garage in fear of the game loosing it. A car impound will store your car for awhile but numerous times it has randomly lost the car I worked so hard to mod and learn to drive. THIS is a huge vault in this game others like GTA *cough* Saints Row understood that as soon as you take a car to your garage it is forever remembered. THIS ISNT REAL LIFE make the game fun &amp lets us have the cars we want without spending all this time being cautious of losing it. PROPERTIES SUCK. Property income shows up in 7 real days so it is very useless unless every 10 mins in the game you run to the safe house to safe just so a day goes by. Should have just paid daily like the old GTA or paid a HUGE amount every week. They use to open up real side missions when you bought businesses also. Not stupid redundant run &amp hide from the cop mini missions.,Grand Theft Auto V

The online shows how rockstar has gotten spoiled trying to milk every last penny by adding new content and not changing/fixing any old content.Online is sh*t unless you already are good and have alot of stuff. To get that you must grind the flying f*ck out of the game. This is rockstars tactic by boring players to the point of buying shark cards from them. Oh and did i mention that other players will make grinding even harder meaning useally if you want to grind for the cool stuff you do it in a lobby with no other players.Their are also a load of hackers because rockstar can't make anticheat. Some of them are great by giving money and allowing players to get stuff without grinding. Anti cheat does not exsist! The online mode is run on matchmaking meaning their is no sever to verify is the data being sent to the game is legit. However in game money exp and all other inventory goes to the server when updated if something doesnt seem quite right then rockstar will ban you.People not me luckily get banned all the time without reason while hackers are allowed to frolick freely. Once you get banned all of your stuff and your progess gets reset and you can't go online for 1 month. If you get banned again you are perminatly unable to play online meaning you need to buy a new copy of the game if you want to play online.TL DR I will play this game but i don't recommend online to new player.

So if you want to play online maybe GTA 5 isn't your best choice.BUTIf you just want to play single player and don't care about online then this is one of the most story rich fun incredible games ever made.

2016-08-18,0,0,1344,False,Recommended,A very fun game with good community. So many things to do. GTA for me at least is a game that can be returned to. Very addicting. It's a easy game once you learn what your doing. GTA Campaign is fun but it's not the best. GTA Online is very fun. So many possibilities. You can be a racer create your own MC or/and be a psychopath murder. A lot of people dislike GTA Online due to the fact that public lobbies can be very murderish. Personally I enjoy violent lobbies but for those who don't they can go into passive invite only lobbies or smaller lobbies (Which is calmer most of the time) The game is updated frequently. All updates are free. In game money is easy to get. For those who are lazy there is microtransactions. Game is very fun. Easy to make friends. Worth buying if you enjoy shooters racing and sandboxes. This game had problems with modders in the past but most modders are gone. I would rate this game a 8.5 out of 10. There is some annoying bugs but other than that game is great.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,The story is great but after you're done with that you can do two things. You can play the garbage online mode which roughly consists of 30% loading screens 30% grinding and 40% microtransactions or you can mod your game which is a great way to add replayability to your game. But since Take Two just announced they are pretty much eliminating mods you're left with just a great single player story which usually makes a game only good enough to rent or buy used. Since you can't sell the game on PC after you beat the story and you can't use mods anymore I can't recommend this game on this platform. If you are one of the 3 people that haven't played the story yet I recommend buying the game used for a console and then selling it or find another way of aquiring it (you know what I mean). I think if you buy a single player game you should have all rights to modify the gameplay experience to your liking this game will not allow that anymore so I recommend you steer clear.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game was pretty good overall but if hackers wouldn't exist it would be better. So if you see a hacker and take 100$ from it you're getting a ban instantly.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-21,1,1,93,False,Not Recommended,Game world wise there is little room for complaints. Again Rockstar did a splendid job recreating one of the biggest American metropolies and making it a very believable and lively environment. The vehicle handling quirks from the previous installment were fixed the almost manic attention to detail prevailed and PC/next gen console users were gifted with the innovative and long anticipated first person mode. The game encourages player to explore the massive area with heaps of side missions mini games and collectibles to aid that quest. The storyline however is as shallow as it can get. I remember people complaining about the GTA IV plot (which is probably my favorite of the series) being too serious for a GTA game. Well apparently Rockstar decided to hear all the casual players out and serve them something less demanding less engaging that would only keep them occupied for two to three days until they could hop onto the money grabbing multiplayer. I cannot point out all the faulty points of the storyline which was the first truly unenjoyable of all GTA games. The character development and progression are non existent. The game showers you with six digit cash rewards 1 2 hours into the game. No matter what trouble you get into the atmosphere is light hearted and the protagonists don't seem to bother much. Whether you accidentally demolish a drug lord estate shoot up an entire police force of a medium sized town using miniguns and Doomguy power armors or steal military equipment using a helicopter it doesn't really matter. Sure we had ridiculous missions like this in previous installments but they were sporadic therefore memorable. GTA V is fully loaded with absurd which simply makes it feel like a parody. Ironically I found Trevor to be the most interesting and engaging of all the shallow protagonists but his creation doesn't hold a candle to the previous playable characters. Took me three attempts separated by a one year long break to finally finish the game which I did out of boredom. The most enjoyable were small scale missions especially the rural southern Cali tweaker segment.As a sandbox the game is pretty good especially paired with the LSPDFR mod but this isn't enough to sink more than 100 hours in this game.And I haven't played multiplayer for one second but judging from the other reviews I didn't miss much.,Grand Theft Auto V

However Rockstar &amp Take 2 refuse to update the single player aspect with the new vehicles weapons whatever else they added in Online (Not a big deal as you can download mods to implement dlc vehicles into traffic). While on the topic of online... Sometime in the middle of May (2017) I recieved a 1 month ban AND character wipe whilst playing the game legitamitely. So after hours upon hours chatting with Rockstar Support explaining the situation and attempting to have them lift the ban (or even TELL me what I did to trigger a ban) everyone that I spoke to stated that they could not tell me why I was banned and ""bans are final and cannot be appealed"". Whatever. So I waited a month and figured that I might as well try Online again even though my character (with +1200 hours from Xbox 360 + 1 + PC) was deleted. After I was compensated from a previous shark card purchase I purchased a 2 car garage and a motorcycle. LIterally played for less than an hour. The next morning I was greeted with an email stating I have been permanently banned from GTA Online. After again attempting to get this resolved with the unfriendly and unsupportive people at Rockstar Support I have just given up on online at this point. I have since then found multiplayer in single player mods to make up for this and enjoy them as they contain normal people (no greifers) normal priced items and a sense of realism. Oh yeah and mod support. I recomend this game when it is on sale ONLY for single player and mods. As a result I am unsure if I wish to purchase future Rockstar and Take 2 games.

2017-11-26,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,The GTA single player in story mode is great. The game probably have the best looking graphics compared to games in 2017 and this game released in 2013. It shows that they invested a lot of money to the game.Hence why I'm disappointed because I think the multiplayer characters looks bad especially the female characters. They are way too masculine. I don't see why you can create good looking NPC's with a lot of varieties but can't give players good character customization?I do not recommend this game if you are interested of playing GTA Online. The character customization is bad and there isn't much to do in game IMO. Other than grinding money I just bought clothes or played golf with my friends. I didn't have that much fun.

2018-01-20,0,0,150,False,Not Recommended,"My original review was supposed to be much much longer and more detailed but Steam capped me off at some point so I'm trying to keep my main points short in this attempt.I recently uninstalled GTA V from my computer and I just have to share why. Singleplayer Many people say that GTA V SP is great and fun and I generally agree with that. However the GTA formula is getting a little old for me. GTA hasn't changed much since the beginning of the 3D era and this is understandable as it still seems to work for and attract a lot of players. However I personally am a little frustrated by the lack of new content and ideas. GTA still consists of this errand boy styled gameplay. You do missions for other people because uhmm...they said so. Or they pay you. Or blackmail you. Anyway we never get to be the shot caller ourselves. We are still not allowed to build our own criminal empire we are just the ones doing dirty work for others. It gets boring. Even in installments of the series where we kinda did something different it is only presented to us in story missions and less so in free roam and actual gameplay. Only exception was the empire building system in VCS a title less known and less popular as it was console only back then.R* does everything to keep things as they are. They even moved a few steps back with this one as many people didn't like GTA IV's more realistic and dark approach and GTA SA is still the best game in the series to many. So we got Los Santos/San Andreas back we got a more crazy and less realistic GTA back and while many people liked that I do not. We've seen it before too many times. I just want something to change. Since GTA SA we haven't seen a new environment in the series. It's always been Liberty City and now Los Santos. How about a GTA version of a completely new city. Maybe Chicago maybe Seattle maybe Dallas maybe even Washington DC. Also I really wish that R* would make another GTA that is set in the past instead of the present. Vice City and San Andreas were so cool because they had this 80s/90s flair which made them pretty unique. How about the 70s we haven't had that yet. Just imagine the radio stations...New features are limited to heists and multiple protagonists. While they are not really bad they are not implemented in a way they really add to the game. Heists have been around in the GTA series forever. Now you have different choices how to rob a place you can recruit your own crew but it still isn't that satisfactory as the options are too limited for my taste. Again R* relies on presentation and story not sandbox gameplay and for a series that actually made sandbox a big thing back in the day that's rather sad. Multiple characters were not a bad design choice either but they also don't add anything to gameplay outside of missions. Missions are the only moments in the game where you can switch characters for certain special actions but only because the game is scripted to do so at these points. Nothing of that made it into free roam.All in all GTA V SP is still fun and entertaining but dissatisfactory and lacking at the same time. I only made it through story mode once. After that I didn't have enough motivation to go through it again. A lot of missed potential here. SP &amp MP First of all the health system. HP regeneration? Really? What the actual R*? I know it's only partial regeneration and the game has to be appealing to casuals but GTA has always given us creative ways to heal up again. Steal an ambulance go eat something call paramedics and so on. Not much left of that but a crappy portable ""medkit"" system. Which means that you have to drink coke or eat a snack in the most inappropriate situations. GTA didn't need that and now we can't even go into a Cluckin' Bell anymore to patch ourselves up with a nice chicken burger.Shooting is very little fun and much worse compared to GTA IV. Lack of good feedback animations on hit enemies etc. . Weapons feel like they don't have punch. Also I don't like the weapon wheel system where you can carry every gun in the game. In previous titles you had just one weapon per slot which made your loadout a tactical choice at times. Completely gone. And don't argue with ""Eeh that's old school."". It's not. At least not for GTA. And when you have tons of weapons that feel exactly the same there is no need to have a massively overloaded inventory that is just plain annoying especially in MP. Also PvP combat in MP is a chore. The weak weapons in combination with the health system make firefights unintuitive artificially elongated and just not fun. Meh.Police AI is a huge step back compared to GTA IV. It is so bad it's almost insulting. Back to the ""shoot first ask questions later"" AI. This is even worse in MP as cops will start shooting you even at a one star wanted level.Also the game world feels very empty and shallow for the most part. GTA IV was so much more interactive paid more attention to detail had all kinds of environmental scripts and animations. Liberty City felt so much more vivid. That's all gone as well. Multiplayer GTA Online is a GTA player's wet dream. Do all the fun stuff and GTA style missions but with friends and other players? Awesome! At least in theory. Again GTA relies very heavily on its presentation not gameplay. Let's be honest GTA missions mostly consist of driving somewhere killing some people grabbing an object or a car and drive somewhere else. Occasional race here and there that's it. The onesidedness of the missions is less noticeable in SP as the great presentation scripts and cutscenes do a good job hiding that. But there is no such presentation in Online. The missions are mostly the same get boring very quickly and races and versus gamemodes are pretty standard too. The real fun comes either from being a massive and grieving other players' fun away a problem that R* hasn't been able to solve in more than four years since Online was first released and buying horribly overpriced assets (I find it funny that Online offers you crime empire style stuff while SP doesn't btw) and special vehicles. Problem is they are only fun if you either manage to grind massive amounts of cash together or pay more real money to R*/T2 by buying Shark Cards. GTA Online has become a massive cash grab. Microtransactions and then this ridiculous ""DLC"" on the Steam Store where you have to pay 3/4 of the actual game price (which hasn't received a drop since its release whatsoever) just to get all the cool things in multiplayer from the beginning on. No thanks. Also from what you can read in other reviews and on forums R* seems to treat their customers like I can't confirm that myself but there are just too many complaints for this issue just being made up. ConclusionGTA's singleplayer is fun but so lackluster and partially feels very empty. It's enjoyable overall but I think it's time for a change. R* is getting a bit lazy on bringing up new ideas. GTA Online on the other hand is just plain insulting. Little effort to keep the game balanced fun and clean but great efforts to steal your hard earned money. If you ask me I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone anymore. I don't want R*/T2 to earn a single other Cent with this piece of software at all. If you really want to play the story wait for a sale but PLEASE don't even touch Online. And if you just have to don't you dare buying Shark Cards. R*/T2 shall bleed for their shady and awful business strategies. So be careful about this one. If you want coop heists go play Payday instead. I really hope that the community will wake up and put an end to the greed that is now the driving factor behind this game. I also won't buy Red Dead Redemption 2 unless we are guaranteed not to receive such a mess of an online mode in that game as well. Thanks a lot for reading through all this!",Grand Theft Auto V

Their policy on content sharing through the likes of YouTube and Twitch may at first glance appear rosy with the 'Rockstar Editor' in the game. Unfortunately this will result in a DMCA takedown.The recent comments from Take2 CEO Strauss Zelnick which decided to pour petrol over the fire that had started in the community ""We re not trying to optimise the monetisation of everything we do to the nth degree. My concern is if you do that the consumer knows. They might not even know that they know but they feel it.

Unless you are continuously paying into Take2's coffers you are the enemy of the company. They think you are a fool someone who has to have their money taken sneakily and carefully.

2017-06-15,0,0,499,False,Not Recommended,"This game is by far my favorite game when it comes to just enjoyment while playing with friends. Fighting driving stealing and just generally doing stupid stuff is a ton of fun in this game but the way that Rockstar does business makes this game near unbearable sometimes. First of all if you want to actually get anywhere in the game and you don't want to give up 1000+ hours of your life to the game you're going to absolutely have to buy a shark card at some point. They aren't super cheap either. $20 get's you something a little over $1 million. Which in this game doesn't get you far. Most high end sports cars are over a million and the best car in the game will cost you something like $3 million fully upgraded. That's not even going into DLC. The most recent gunrunning DLC is so insanely expensive that just to get all the vehicles it will cost you between $10 505 000 $13 971 900. Yes that is 8 zeros... The bunker will cost you minimum $1 165 000 just to get started on the new mission content and then when you go into your bunker the first time if you haven't already bought the $3 Million $4 Million dollar mobile operations unit agent 14 will literally tell you that you should buy it. This game is built around huge amounts of money that are near impossible to obtain legitimately in a timely manner.Here we get into the second problem I've found while playing this game. Hackers. They are everywhere. Teleporting spawning vehicles killing and dropping money everywhere. Literally an hour ago I ran into a hacker teleporting on top of me and blowing me up every single time I spawned. The only way to stop it was to switch to passive and leave the server. Not to mention that despite the fact I actively avoided getting cheated money when I could I received a notification upon downloading the new DLC ""warning me"" that I shouldn't cheat. Thanks! That's helpful! I'll remember that next time I'm teleported to the top of the Maze Bank tower and have literal bags of money dropped onto my head and then get blown up. I'll just do my best to use my will power to repel the hackers away. So if you're interested in getting this game I recommend you be prepared to be heavily under powered compared to everyone else unless you're willing to whale money into the game or grind for thousands of hours. Either that or you'll eventually succumb to the temptation of hacked money and just start begging in chat for someone to give you money like half of the people playing this game thus risking getting banned and losing the money you payed for this full priced 4 year old game and any time and energy you spent playing the game.Last but certainly not least we have the recent issue of OpenIV an essential part of the GTAV modding community receiving a Cease &amp Desist letter. This has basically put to a halt the whole modding community which for some people was the only reason they got the game on PC in the first place. The single player isn't very fun to play and there are certain vehicles and bits of content that can't even be accessed in the single player without the use of mods. In effect Rockstar by getting rid of OpenIV has forced players to go to online to get access to these things. I can't help but feel that the intent was to bring in more online players and in effect bring in more people spending money on cash cards to gain access to content that should easily be available in the single player mode but isn't. While this is just my speculation I feel it is worthy of bringing up in my review of the game because for some who many be considering getting the game to try a mod they saw somewhere for single player they will now likely be unable to do so. I would like to say this is in fact my favorite game and I will probably continue to play the game for a while to come but these 3 big issues force me to leave a negative review as I can't in good conscience recommend a game that is actively trying to get money out of the player base and filled with unsportsmanlike cheating while also taking out a modding community of people playing single player.",Grand Theft Auto V

You will find yourself (if you buy the game) spending time looking for glitches hacks and money making techniques non stop because the costs of items in this game is ridiculous. Rockstar is constantly adding (mostly) stuff to the game that will hopefully make them loads of money i.e a golden jet thats well... golden nothing else oh and it costs 10 million to buy. 8 million in game cash is around $100 each all in all every bit of content in this game costs $465 046 509 in game cash... if you do the math is 59 megaladon shark cards so the grand total to buy every bit of content is $5900. So if you have absolutely no social life play it if you have tons of dosh to away play it but if you just want a fun game with easily accessible content then Rockstar basically wants you to off. This game literally gives you three options. 1) invest in bitcoin and become a millionare to fund your GTA spending sprees. 2) Divorce/leave your lover and become an addict eating nothing but liquidized Doritos in Mountain Dew spending the rest of your sad miserable life at your computer trying to save up for a useless car. And finally 3) Hack. There are plenty of them out there just find a good one like Nullify or Hydrogen and get all the money items and freedom you want (and should get) from this game.Dont get me wrong the game in itself is good and if you want it for the single player then definately buy it imo. But the game is simply ruined by greedy bastards known as ockstar Games.P.S im having this rant after being banned for caging everyone and placing ildos on their crotches also giving myself 500mil so i could buy everything although it turns out that theyre pretty sensitive about modding...Well then back to PUBG.,Grand Theft Auto V

Your forced to do content in pub lobbies with maybe a 15 20% player hacker rate.. Additionally Rockstar chooses to have everyone who pursues you in this game as an NPC do it suicidally and comically. Sorry but IRL if my buddies Mustang is stolen im not gonna get in my Car and RAM IT TILL I DIE. if you must buy this game get it on a console where there are less hacking issues. that being said Rockstar has not optimized this game either in years. A typical experience is to crash on loading out of a heist then reload into the game and because the game wont let you pick which friends lobby to load into you then have to load into a buds lobby. that works out to about 12 15 minutes of loading. if you have limited time especially for this kind of functionality nonsense avoid at all costs.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,I was waiting for Rockstar to release their statement about the openIV debacle that take two opened but I am thuroughly unimpressed.OpenIV in no way affects the multiplayer section of GTAV some hacks may use it and then go into online but openIV a program once supported by rockstar was given a cease and desist. This is a way to do buisness. The single player of GTA should be both a story and a sandbox a place to have fun. The mutiplayer should have been a mega snadbox but they turned it into a microtrasaction laden hell hole so singleplayer was the only playbox for many players.I was very willing to overlook the online problems too It was so disheartening I stopped playing it entirely but I could understand they wanted to milk their whales of their money and screw over everyone else. I was willing to do so because single player was still our playground. Rockstar even supported single player mods and advertised them a little when an interesting one showed up... That is until a few days ago.One week ago the CEO of take two stated they are under monetising their games... a game which made multiple millions last year alone a game that is the 4th best sold game of all time... is under monetised. Then a C&amp D gets given to the biggest singleplayer mod. I can only imagine they want people to move back to online so they can milk some more whales but the whales never left online only those of us left uninterested by your buisness practices did only those of us who wanted to have fun with our game left.Bear in mind this is IGNORING all the shady buisness practices GTAV has used before. This is ignoring many things to give them the benefit of the doubt and understanding they want to make more money... But this is going too far. I have never personally used mods on GTAV but I do come fromt he days of the original games. The approach to mods that make the sandbox a playground is a tried and tested thing just remember that in the games themselves were key combinations to spawn anything give weapons... basically what openIV allowed on this version.Rockstar. You had ONE chance to make a statement that condemned the actions of take two that it went against the core philosophy of GTA but instead you want to let it ride to see where things go. We as players are not going to let it stand and I personally will not play GTA again until this is fixes. This includes any new GTA's you have planned and any old versions I still have on disc.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,242,False,Not Recommended,They have done it. It has finally started and there is no way people are going to let this stand. If you are reading this chances are you play PC games. As a PC gamer you have used some sort of mod for a game at some point in your life. You have it's not even a question because you have. This is what PC gaming is about. People make games we pay for them. In some cases we buy them three times in a row for different platforms! Sometimes (most times) the games that we play on PC are lacking something or could be improved by removing something (a wonky mechanic or AI) and as modders it is almost our duty to fix things like that or test the limits of the game we have just paid for. Well all of that ends now. No more modding no more creativity no more fun and absolutely no more TRULY sandbox games. At least not from Take Two Interactive. I hope they do as their name states and look into a TAKE number TWO on this decision that they have made.Do your self a favor if you want to pay for this game. Don't. If you are in dire need of a somewhat good GTA game that still (for the time being) has some modding support buy GTA San Andreas. No micro transactions no modding blocks (yet) and a beautiful multiplayer mod that is more ironed out than the full release of the multiplayer for GTA V.I know I'm not alone when I say this but if this no mod thing continues they can kiss a once loyal customer goodbye.Shame on you Take Two.

2017-05-31,0,0,299,False,Not Recommended,Advice you not to buy GTA 5 even though it's got high reviews. Single players is good but GTA 5 online is a joke. The game is infested with game hackers. This has gradually become worse through time and now it's so bad that it's not fun to play anymore. Every time you link online you will find a hacker and players looking for a hacker to mod for them. Here is a list of all the mods I have found in this game which cheaters will use against you. Players who cannot be killed.Aim bots.Players give themselves unlimited money which can also be forced to your profile.Mods that spawn everyone to the same place on the map.Hacks that force the game to crash.Gamers can multiply computer players in one place which causes the game to lag.Mods which force your character to jump out of your car.Other mods that can stop you using the car garage.Mod which traps your character in a cage so you have to leave the gaming session.Character mods making players jump really high.Hacks for high jumping cars.This is what I have experienced while playing online. GTA 5 does allow players to report cheaters but this obviously hasn't worked. You will experience people moding very often not just from time to time. GTA 5 has been ruined and I have given up playing it online. This is very bad and I wish I could give the game back and have my money back. Will I buy another GTA title from Rockstar in the future? Not likely.,Grand Theft Auto V

So when I found out they were making a pc version I was so excited. I bought it for a second time! I had just as much in single player if not more fun. Recently I had been working my freaking butt off online grinding missions and getting cash and RP legit and had worked up to about $600K.Almost to that 1 million mark to be a VIP. When all of a sudden I GET BANNED FOR NO REASON. A ten day ban okay not too terrible. But when my ban was up THEY TOOK ALL OF THE MONEY THAT I POURED TIME INTO GETTING. THAT 600K TOOK ME 20 HOURS TO GATHER. I'M ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF YOU WANT IT FOR THE ONLINE BECAUSE THE SUPPORT STAFF IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. THEY WILL NOT ANSWER YOUR ARGUMENTS FOR A BAN. THEY WILL NOT LOOK DEEPER INTO THE ISSUE. I BOUGHT THE GAME TWICE AND WAS TREATED LIKE TRASH. And this is how they will treat you too.

Mods are not ""breaking"" your game they are adding hours (hell even weeks) of playtime to a dying game. Take the mods modding community (and why not cross ""fun"" off the list too?) and you're left with what you had before a dying game.Yes we know you've had trouble with mods in the past (sex animations accidentally being left on the disc with San Andreas) but once again you shot *yourself* in the foot there and apparently like how that feels enough to do it again.

2017-06-18,1,1,57,False,Not Recommended,"Was ok entertaining singleplayer experience. Couldn't stand online loading times on the console and thought PC would be better and it marginally is.HOWEVER the online gets taken over by hackers constantly because Rockstar doesn't use main a main hosting server therefore the hacking won't go away without some significant code changes from Rockstar.This recent decision wasn't Rockstar's as much as Take Two's likely because hackers are steeling their ingame money and without server side hosting there's little they can do to stop them short of just ""making modding illegal"".As well Take Two's answer to the ""hacks"" is to make ""modding the game illegal"" which obviously everyone but the chairmen of Take Two KNEW was a bad idea by cutting off your must ""avid"" players. Making ""modding"" your game ""illegal"" is a pretty steep threat. There are many ways for you to protect your game and off your most avid playerbase by forcing them to play ONLY the version of the game you intended really sells yourself short for your players the ones who care to think up fun things that you haven't or won't implement.I mean look at PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds. There's a game BASED on a mod and is offering ONE type of gameplay however that developer basically took what everyone expected GTA Online to be and is immensely successful with their janky game. ROCKSTAR SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS YEARS AGO. Shame on them and they deserve the negative feedback their receiving for prioritizing making a few extra bucks at the cost of making a FAIR game people enjoy playing.Again it's Rockstar's or Take Two's ""fault"" for the hacking because they do ""console side"" hosting. I don't expect them to fix this either and maybe won't for the GTA VI either not unless WE make sure they acknowledge the long term value of being able to limit hacks that comes inately with server side hosting.Oh and if it's because people are hacking ur cash well that's your fault too for making those ""purchasable"" items actually affect peoples gameplay rather than being cosmetic in nature... also would have been avoidable with server side hosting... only would have cost you an extra $500k to develop AT MOST and last I checked GTA V sold 29M copies... I'm SURE you could have afforded doing the job right than halfassing it.For the CEO's and Publishers now you see? that fateful decision to not implement server side hosting forced the recent ""modding is illegal"" decision because you wanted to save paying a couple of programmers and you knew the game would be ""successful enough"". That may be true but here you are earning all sorts of negative PR because you had to save a few bucks 5 years ago and I doubt you ""just didn't have the funds"" after the success of GTA IV... ************************TL DR Be wary of developers that offer ""online multiplayer"" without ""server side hosting"" as hacking is practically unavoidable and most gamers and developers KNOW THIS but at the end of the day if the boss says ""no"" then the only people who can change their mind is...THEIR CUSTOMERS!The Publisher Take Two is more at fault here than Rockstar.Unfortunately voting with your dollar also hurts Rockstar more than Take Two...SoVOICE YOUR DISPLEASURE!... and consider not buying the next one if nothing changed.",Grand Theft Auto V

I hooked up with a really awesome group early on and we've been enjoying the game for going on two years as a crew. This is something you can play for a little bit or as long as you like because DLC and updates are always dropping with new content.Now keep in mind this is a Grand Theft Auto title....which means there are going to be plenty of randoms who just want to blow up.

2016-01-02,1,1,166,False,Recommended,Ye it's a game which should have been released 2 years ago. Yes it's unfinished. Yes Rockstar kinda screwed us over. Game is still fun by all means. Especially with friends and if you have a YouTube channel and you're making funny videos. HUGE improvement over the console version obviously a lot more content. I played the console version for a couple of years and I can testify that there is enough new content on the PC version which justifies purchasing it even though you already finished it on the Playstation or Xbox. I got it on sale and I believe that is the price it should be regularly. Also don't worry about being banned for using mods on your SINGLE player account. Rockstar released a statement they are not banning people who mod the single player account but only people who alter the online portion of the game which is a great thing. Anyway buy it and enjoy it. If anyone is wondering I didn't have to buy any shark cards during the sale (Winter Sale of December 2015 January 2016). Game was $42 CAD.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-16,0,0,1142,False,Recommended,This is one of my favorite games however it is going downhill quite considerably.

I would reccomend this game but with caution having knowledge of the things I have listed before purchasing.Pros Excellent graphicsRuns well (on my pc)Lots of things to do preventing you from being boredLots of customization options (guns vehicles etc.)Driving/flying mechanics are smoothCons Hackers on online ruin your fun Jets get annoying when used to kill people and also ruin your funExtremely painful loading times (I once waited 16 mins to get onto online however this may be my pc.)Everything is very overpriced requiring hours upon hours of playtime grinding for things.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-08,1,1,599,False,Not Recommended,GTA V. Had a good time in the single player story. Online? It's some fun sometimes not.I am here to rant about their ridiculous suspension/ban policies as many others have. I have been an honest player for around 200 hours of online play adding meaningful play experiences with other people. I saw something that allowed me to play on a private GTA server instead of the official servers which are full of hackers. I decided to try it out and see what fun could be had with a game I consider to be pretty good. I mistakenly connected to the official server with an exe file that was dated prior to the current version of the game which caused my account to be immediatlely suspended and had my characters progress and inventories all reset. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? I just finished playing on an official server with someone who was making objects appear on people spawning in cash and blowing up cars randomly. This happens with regularity yet I who has never hacked or done anything to exploit the game and harm other player in any sense gets suspended. Rockstar you are a joke. I could rejoin and start over completely with my character but I won't. The community on the private servers is much more pleasant to deal with and play with. So long GTA online.Update 1/1/18 I've started playing again on official servers to play with friends. Upon my first 20 hours back at it I've spent most of my time in invite only sessions. With about 2 3 hours in public servers I've seen a hacker teleport around the map and to my personal vehicle. He then used a fire hydrant's water to blast me out of my car and then blew me and my car up. On a separate occasion I had a hacker spawn in a vehicle that hasn't been released yet to cruise around. Hackers are prevelant as ever and this is dissapointing because CEO cargo missions and the like can't be done in invite only sessions. If Rockstar would allow those jobs to be done in invite only I would rate the game positive. However because much of the content is unplayable or destroyed by hackers I still can't give this a thumbs up even though the game overall is still fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-04-08,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,Ima click not recommended just because I know everyone else will say recommend and yes single player is a fantastic game however apes could do a better job on the online mode. 5+ minutes loading screens which btw you need to go through every other 5 minutes because of the worst matchmaking system I have ever seen in a game which means that it's practically impossible to start a mission without being invited to one. Bugs and glitches galore (and after a quick google search I found that most of which have been in the game for a very long time so maybe rather than giving us more cars every month that that add zero substance to the game maybe fix all the existing issues and glitches?!). Oh and when you do actually manage to get into a heist/race or whatever be ready to be sat in stone cold last or spend most of your time respawning because until you grind for hours you're going to be much slower/easier to kill/do much less damage than everyone else in the game. If you have a group of friends that you can set up your own private server with then I can see this being ok as an online game but soloing is one of the most boring experiences which is such a shame because I genuinely believe this could such an awesome oniline game if it was done properly!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-09,1,1,475,False,Recommended,It is a fun game in many ways both single and multiplayer. If you got friends to mess around you probably won't never run out of something to do. You can achieve almost anything by working you off but it requires many hours of grinding (which isn't fun in the long run). Community is alive and it's not too toxic. You can find hackers from almost any session. Sometimes they are hella annoying but usually they just mind their own business. So hackers grinding and the lack of mods are my only problem with the game. Everything else is very well made!,Grand Theft Auto V

Its to the point where if you buy the most expensive shark card and you still don't have enough money to purchase half of everything per dlc.

Mods are the only thing that actually continue to make this game fun to play once the single player storyline is over.Overall I reluctantly recommend this game purely because of its fantastic single player campaign. I definitely don't recommend playing online. It's just not as fun as the single player. You should buy it when it's on sale because it's really not worth $60 in its current state.,Grand Theft Auto V

This completely excludes Multiplayer Modding which has been openly shunned and hated by the modding community.

The game offers a variety of gameplays nice cars (to buy and steal) tuning races Missions ... It's all been alot of fun. But since about a year the main focus for the creators is to continually and gradually increase profits through sharkcardsales (ingame microtransactions Simple put you fork out real cash for fake ingame cash). All prices for every new item ingame have drastically risen and continues to rise. Now you can also earn ingame money and quite a good deal to be honest but since the last few months it's been very clear that the gaming company wants to maximize your moneyloss. One might say this is the essence of this game (putting people up against people) and that might be true to an extent. But when you have to collect items for quite a few hours and then during the few minutes of a sale it gets blown up in a matter of secs by other players the fun will wear off soon. In current GTA online things are all tweaked to maximize your loss (military vehicles/futurustic vehicles ..). This coupled with great new vehicles (including those military vehicles and now new planes) and their huge pricetag will push players towards microtransactions.Some players decided to 'grind' certain ingame money makers but since the last two DLCs it became apparent the ingame money monitoring software was/is buggy. This 'bot' removes illegitimate earned money (due the game being massively hacked the last six months) and while that's a good thing it also started removing legit and honest earned ingame money from players. Ofcourse you'll always have people crying out innocence when they're not but the magnitude and outrage of players crying out right now speaks otherwise. So then you start filing a formal complaint aka ticket to the gaming company to check the 'bot's possible failures... To cut a long story short. There is no support you will receive a formal confirmation the removal was correct and due to illegitimately acquired ingame money. No explanation on the when and where and why so you can at least verify and possibly adapt your gaming. No if you persist in sending in tickets the tone of the automated replies turns grim while threatening you with a possible ban if you persist in breaking the EULA. So instead of an explanation (which is the very least a player deserves when he got robbed of ingame m illions (which do mean quite a few hours of ingame work) you get served a threat. Currently alot of longtime players are re evaluating their gaming time within GTA online. It's still a fantastic game but once you'll get hit by something that appears fundamentally incorrect wrt ingame earning ( hours of playing the game) you cannot trust the game that it won't happen in the future again as you'll receive ZERO explanation.I'm not gonna recommend this game to new players. The ingame money earning has decreased drastically the ingame price tages increased exponentially and the ingame monitoring is so focused on eliminating players' money it can't distinguish illegit from legit money. So both get taken away and then you have to their Support. See above for what happens next...A damn shame cos there really is no game like this but it'll come with an ever increasing (real life) pricetag... Just don't assume you can earn it all ingame... You clearly can't... Sad really... Paid DLC would have been a far better choice for players and the gaming company... Not this...,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-22,0,0,312,False,Not Recommended,"GTA is in itself especially story wise a great game with loads of features and tons of stuff to do. Multiplayer is an extension of that and what I will be focusing on here. It brings a bunch of new vehicles features missions characters into the game and allows you to play with friends or alone in the city of Los Santos and do as you wish. Fly a bomber plane get a tank buy an office and start stealing cars buy a yacht. Multiplayer does however also include outragiously priced items such as a 50000 hat or a 100000 Suit. And that is just the clothing which is optional. Vehicle prices skyrocket from ""acceptable but high"" to ""insane"" very very quickly. Some ""normal"" super cars cost upwards of 2 million dollars with more added rather frequently. Others so called ""special vehicles"" cost upwards of 3 million the APC for example. There are a bunch of buisnesses for the player to run you can craft weapons and sell them smuggle narcotics and other illegal stuff become a CEO and steal cars/supply crates or get yourself a motorcycle club and produce drugs which you then sell. Those are some amazing things to do admittedly. The issue with all of them consnsitently is the pricing. 4 million dollars for an office between 1 and 3 million for a bunker another 2 to 3 for a hangar the motorcycle club actually comes in rather cheap at 200000 dollars. Oh I nearly forgot to actually make money you again have to invest into your buisness sometimes going over one million dollars. Now lets get into the cool stuff I will just list a few prices here Flying motorcycle (yes this is a thing) 3 000 000 $ Yacht Starts at 6 000 000 can easily be pushed over 10 000 000 Apartments Starting at about 20 000 it goes up to 1 000 000With the at the writing of this review most recent DLC airplanes were added into the game. Most of these are really rather cool to fly and kill people with but at the same time the cool ones start 4 5 000 000 $. With the update before that the developers added a sniper rifle that shoots explosive rounds. It takes just a few of those shots to without exception destroy all airplanes. Heck you don't even need to reload to get multiple of them. Now the prices wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for the fact that you have to grind for ages to get anything done. Hours to get to 500k and guess what you need 10 times that. Easily. Rockstar has also decided to drip feed content to the users over weeks even months which makes it even worse. New content would be great if it would be affordable.At this stage GTA Online has become such a grind that any attempt at getting into it now without cheating is futile and a waste of money.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-23,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is easily one of the most expansive high quality open world games in recent years but despite the quality of characters voice acting fullness of the world and general graphical fidelity (as well as fun silly moments as can be seen by the myriad of .gifs on the internet) unfortunately I can't recommend it in its current state at full price of $60 USD.If you were simply interested in the single player aspect of this game there are several games which are more fun despite doing much of the same thing for example Just Cause 3. For full price GTA V is ok if you could get it for $30 USD by all means not a bad purchase if all you want is single player. However the thing that really holds back this game is the GTA Online aspect of the game and this is for a number of reasons Online Modding You've seen all the articles and reviews. One of the largest flaws with GTA online is the capacity for modding the online experience without other players having the same mods. Don't get me wrong modding games online can work but as is Rockstar allows players to have mods and join lobbies with unmodded players. This results in some players having unlimited HP miniguns that shoot rockets etc. Which horrendously breaks the online experience and makes it nearly impossible to play vanilla if you wanted. Which actually leads to my next point... Improper Punishment What happens if you're in a lobby and a modded player joins uses his money shooting minigun to give you way too much cash? You may very well get banned after all Rockstar doesn't know whether it was on purpose or not. As such you may buy this game and then never get to play online for long because you get banned due to others' actions. Unacceptable Online Level Up Design As you play online your character levels up as you level up you get access to more guns vehicles houses etc. Makes sense. However you also simply can't do certain things (use certain guns pilot planes etc) until you get up to a high enough level. That being said you can certainly join a random mission in which you need to do one of these things. Ergo you now cause everyone to fail the mission because you joined a mission you shouldn't have been able to. On top of this it makes PVP virtually impossible as you gain more HP and weapon damage when you level up meaning that players which are much higher level can literally just tank through your shots and there isn't much you can do about it.Overall because of this I'd say give GTA V a pass if you wan online game like GTA Online I'm not sure there is anything better but with how poorly maintained it is (to speak nothing of the endless loading screens) the online isn't worth it.If you just wanted the single player experience honestly just get GTA IV Just Cause 3 or any other game even remotely similar.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-10-07,0,0,771,False,Not Recommended,I have to say the game is extremely fun and full of options you might like to experience. however I have noticed several times in GTA V Online after finishing a cocaine and weapons sell mission that the game could not add my money into my game account. I said SEVERAL times and still Rockstar doesn't even take this as an issue so I played it plenty of hours online not to get my $ GTA money. I have spent time and $ GTA to fulfill my suplies bar and after selling those products during missions only to get and bankrupt in the game not allowed even to reload my ammo. sad,Grand Theft Auto V

I've been playing it since it came out in 2013. The singleplayer is fun when you play you can pretend you're a hitman and just kill people. Or you can download mods that expand this game to be several more hours although you can't usually play multliplayer with mods installed so you usually have to delete the mod files if you do want to play online. As far as online goes you can either play solo and do missions with others and just get money or be one of the millions of other and just run people over machine gun them to death and call them names.

2018-06-25,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Important information The game knew how to give their jumps in the matter of optimization they did a good job giving a very decent performance in an AMD Ryzen 1200 processor paired with a Sapphire RX 560. The story is plausible but it is worth remembering that it is for completely adult people it has obscene language constantly it is impossible to escape from the vulgarity of the game. So be careful when playing in front of children try to be just silly take a walk around with Michael's car when you have children in the room.The soundtrack and audio quality is crystal clear.Go preparing your best headphone that the game will make an excellent use of it the dubbing of the characters give life to the story more than you imagine angry screams calls for help moments of fury indignation and drama! It's one of the things that make you stick in the game. The soundtrack handpicked by the best game developer can only give one result Perfection. Rock is good Hip hop / Rap is good Electronic is good Contry is good. Except for some mainstream pop artists boring and with their annoying music. The audio of the game is wonderful leaves nothing to be desired.The graphics are totally flexible!The game seamlessly follows the transition from seventh to eighth generation console graphics and that inside a PC game is wonderful! The game can be taken to the sky with its extreme settings but can also be dragged below the acceptable with very low graphics. So if you have an Integrated HD of deception do not be afraid the game can be yours and accompany you when you have a Radeon RX Vega 64 CrossFire in the future!The online game the truth Is Pay To Win? Yes and no. If you are lazy you will never get anywhere GTA Online is to be unhindered you can not compare to the history line you will not always win it will go wrong many times. But it's not impossible. Can you afford to be the big boss? Of course give your little fortune to Rockstar to take you down a shortcut. But it's different so you do not live the life of a bandit that Rockstar wants you to live. And the Hackers do they exist? They're bashed to every server a few days ago I turned a huge orange with an open parachute face that's true I swear. It is impossible not to have played for at least two days and not to have seen someone exploiting the game or using hacking tools as a vehicle summoner or killing everyone in one click. That's why online mode is becoming an apocalyptic and disappointing place. Another reason the game will never separate you from other level based players such as Counter Strike Global Offensive you will easily see someone from level 300 and when he sees you from inside his tank a TM 02 Khanjali annihilating the whole city for pure enjoyment then will be your end.,Grand Theft Auto V

In a lifetime spent under the schadenfreude of off children and the people who terrible players call ""tryhards"" I could never gather enough disappointment/anger at a video game until this very moment. The kicker here is that isn't at the hands of some virgin modder or ineptitude against other ier players but it is the game's NPCs and the requirement to grind in this awful game if you don't want to get banned or support the god damn cretins that made it.Sure I could throw 100s over and over at (((Rockstar))) and buy everything I could possibly want in this game but those god damn imbeciles don't deserve any more money than what you've paid for this terrible game. After several account bans (before those god damn cretins decided that one should lose everything when they're banned) I decided it would be unwise to accept any more money from sweaty awkward men using ly named mod menus in exchange for nude pictures of women that aren't myself and pictures of my admittedly cute feet.Such a decision led me down the primrose path of honestly gained e wealth and the vehicular perils of the latest update Smuggler's Gunrunning Gypsy or some t like that and hours upon hours of playing this terrible game more time than it could ever deserve. The grind collecting contraband goods over and ing over until it filled up a large warehouse. Eventually one liquidates the whole warehouse selling off all of this contraband. And on this contraband mission I lost all of my stock. To NPCs. I couldn't even defend myself watching helicopter after helicopter shoot down my goddamn plane and I was probably halfway down a bottle of straight Cointreau too hammered to realize that I could've cut off my Internet to avoid losing everything.And now my Magic Wand is out of batteries and my apartment is dry of any and all liquor and it is all Rockstar's fault. yourselves.",Grand Theft Auto V

Comparable to the likes of Just Cause Sleeping Dog and Saints Row.Story Interesting characters a decent plot. This basically carries the entire single player experience.UI Suffers from obvious console port syndrome. Some of the keyboard+mouse keybinding are atrociously stupid. E.g. The controls for controlling a plane is beyond comprehension with WASD and keypad both being used and you still need a third hand to control the camera with a mouse.

2017-06-22,0,0,407,False,Recommended,EDIT I am changing my review to positive as a thank you to Rockstar for returning support for OpenIV as it seems they have turned face upon realizing how much this means to their community. Take Two Interactive you have some serious work to do and it's going to take a lot for me to respect you after that bull. GTA Online should have been a seperate game as whole and not pushed as a part of GTA V. From my own perspective they are two seperate games with different methods of play and you should NOT bring real world money into something that supports modding they are two things that will always clash. Let GTA V be its own thing and GTA Online another.PRE OPENIV C&amp D REVIEW ______________________________________________________________________________All the time I've spent in this game having fun modding and being entertained by the things people come up with from custom cars to scripts that can better the single player experience as a whole. Open IV was a tool for people that enjoyed the experience of making their own world in single player and you Rockstar and Take Two have taken that away. You destroyed the creativity of a community that supported you and cherished the fact that you let them do as they pleased without limit.What a pitiful waste of everyone's resources time and money.

I pay $60 ing dollars as it is TWICE because of the held back release for pc and you still can't be happy with having one of the best selling games and not dropping the price a bit from the original. The only reason I still play this game is because of the single player modding community who have salvaged this game a bit and you almost ed that up as well so nice job there. I would say that the new dlc's being produced for Online is a plus but even that is just another scheme to get there greedy hands into your moms purses by making them cost so astronomically high that the fastest way to get the new stuff is to go out and get a literal ing job which takes less time then grinding out the boring missions or playing with friends.I really wanted this to be a fantastic multiplayer that you cound roam around and just have fun like gta 4 but you cant even do that anymore with all the people who payed for military class vehicles and even worse the hackers in every other lobby who just blow up the entire world.Oh but don't worry the modders cant give out money anymore Rockstar made sure of that becasue if people had money to actually play the ing game then they couldn't fill there greasy pockets full of your(parents) hard earnings.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-02,0,0,184,False,Recommended,When i bought this game i was uneasy whether i wasted money on this game or not.My answer is This game is definitely worth it. The online isn't ridden with that many hackers/modders as i expected (though i am in Europe so i can't speak for NA/Asia) and you can easily switch sessions so if you see one you can switch.Singleplayer and its story is amazing and is worth the money itself.Online is also nice to be honest to really be able to enjoy the online fullest you need to get 700k though you can get it easily through heists and their first time bonuses. And people complain that the community is toxic though i disagree with that. (again i am in Europe so i can't speak for other regions) I've met my fair share of friendly players that i like to play with. People do sometimes shoot on sight in freemode though that can be avoided with passive mode. People do sometimes kick low levels from heist lobby's (around from rep. level 1 9) though you can easily raise levels at the start with races and solo missions.The only thing i dislike about Online is the Doomsday futuristic vibe. I like the concept a heist with setups in freemode thats a nice change but i dislike certain vehicles like the Deluxo as it is a bit OP.TL DR The singleplayer is awesome the Online is great too.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-02,0,0,218,False,Not Recommended,Please read the following (carefully) The gameplay and the DLC content is freakin amazing. Rockstar Customer Service Agents are amazing but the mechanics of the game is total crap. Their ban system is automatic that basically means the AI will automatically ban you instead of having a User/Person behind the computer monitoring the ban system. Lazy. And there is no way to appeal your ban. All bans are made as final decision and the final decision are all made by the AI System.My experience with GTA V I have never cheated or modded ever. I actually do play mission to get in game cash. Then this happened I couldn't play a mission due to a bug/glitch. I decided to inform Rockstar Customer Service about this glitch through their Live Chat System. I followed the instructions give by the Rockstar Customer Support Agent (Verify game cache &amp Restart PC). After the restart I logged back into the Online Servers to see if whether or not it was fixed. As soon as I loaded into the GTA Online I got permabanned. For what reason? I went straight back to their customer service asking what happened. Their Customer Service Agent is super professional and friendly we were just chatting back and forth waiting for the results of my ban. Even the UNDISCLOSED AGENT said how their ban system works and agrees how it is unfair to most players who are casual to normal players. For the UNDISCLOSED AGENT's honest opinion He deserves a promotion. But in the end my permanent ban is not unlifted. The UNDISCLOSED AGENT tried every method he could do but was unsuccessful.Would I recommend this game?Hell Yah. If you want to risk losing your money that was used to purchase this. I have to say though the GTA V gameplay is good some people may say its worth getting.But from my perspective? (look down below)From my experience?I would definitely not recommend you to play this game due to lack of effort done in their banning system. If you get banned I would recommend you not to repurchase the game again they basically scam you. They banned people (who does NOT CHEAT) and force you to repurchase the game so they can make money off of you.I will definitely not be returning to any Rockstar Games if the Ban System is this bad. It is just not fair for any players who purchased a copy of this game (Normal Players and Casual Players). In my opinion the modders and hackers in this game ruins the experience for other players.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-21,0,0,398,False,Not Recommended,This review will be covering the online component of the game as I have not played single player.Grand Theft Auto V/Online really is a work of art. I can mean that both seriously and with thick sarcasm because of the unpredictable nature of this game. To many the game's potential is overshadowed by their unstable servers and slow load times to the point where it is frequently dubbed as 'Loading Simulator 201X'. Looking past these barriers it's incredibly fun as a game.Obviously the main highlight of the game is the ability to use GTA$ in the online compnent of the game to collect whatever you want. Gun and Car nuts can rejoice because you can claim permanent ownership over anything you purchase. As time has passed the goods available has gone from semi tame to insane. The best vehicle in the game has transformed from an attack helicopter to a fighter jet... to more bizarre toys like flying cars and an orbital cannon. Fun as this sounds the game has severe problems which is why I can't recommend it to anyone new. The sheer cost of everything either forces a new player to put HUGE amounts of time into the game or purchase GTA$ with 'Shark Cards' that can cost over $100. While farming is sometimes fun the most lucrative famring methods require you to be in a public server with other players. Public servers run rampant with toxic players or modders/cheaters. And since adding the orbital cannon to the game someone with obscene amounts of GTA$ can instantly kill you anywhere on the map with no warning. All in all GTA Online is still incredibly fun. They are still updating the game years after release. New toys are expensive but not unobtainable by conventional methods. It's just really hard for someone new to get into it especially alone. If Rockstar would allow more things to be done in a Friends/Invite Only session I would be more willing to support the game. I would also like to see less blatant cash grabs given your only options are to farm in public sessions for days or give them money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now that the only way to quickly earn money is shark cards every Online lobby i ever join feels like a ghost town since there are only 2 or 3 players on each lobby.

2018-01-12,0,0,391,False,Recommended,Don't let the hours played fool you. I have much more time in GTA 5 than steam knows. As I have had the PS3 version since release and played through it many times. So naturally I'm going to be comparring the two while I write this.First of all old PS3 version doesn't hold a candle here. As someone who wasn't sure I could even run this game I was very happy to start this up and it run just fine. A few graphical issues like shadows being a bit rough and screenshots and taking pictures with phone doesn't work like 95% of the time are minor to the overall quality.PS3 didn't have the first person mode. Which I really enjoy here. It feels like a totally different game when playing like that and driving is a new challenge. Playing mouse and keyboard is much better than controller to. Aiming and shooting is easier and more accurate. I can't really fly planes or helicopters with mouse and keyboard though. WHich is fine cause as long as controller is hooked up you can switch on the fly.Online is much better than the PS3 version as well. First of all my experience with the PS3 online was bleh at best. As the only way to hope to get people for a match or mission was to join a big crew. And even then it was a crapshoot. Most players were more interested in killing each other in free roam than doing anything else. There's a lot more content now so that helps. But people are constantly playing and they are doing missions and heists and you can start anything and expect people to join rather quickly most of the time. Online of course has its issues. Cheating is rampant and griefers galore (I swear this one person was screwing up our Lamar mission on purpose just to mess with us) and making money for new players is so hard. But the good outweigh the bad if you ask me. You don't really need money to have fun here. Money helps you get better stuff and gives you an edge but.... I was having fun right out of the gate doing missions with just my pistol. I got just enough money to buy one of the cheap crappier apartments and I couldn't be happier.Other things like singleplayer having more animals is small but I love it. Dogs and cats walking around! Bunnies hopping along.... The Ps3 version didn't have nearly as many animals. I love dogs I was so happy to see them in the game! upgrading to a better PC after being stuck in old generation of console for so long is great as I see the improvements to games I've played before but this is the best example of that.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game is also expensive. I one day decided that I was going to get it. It was on sale for $20.00 opposed to it's usual $60.00 so I thought what the heck why not. A lot of my friends own this game and I knew it would be fun. I had completely underestimated the game. I am not an avid gamer. I am not good with mmp games or fps games. I also don't have many hours in this game. But this is the only game that I have truly gotten into. Other than Sims 3 which just shows i'm not an avid gamer but this game I had 80 hours in less than a month of owning it. I 100% reccomend this game. Its super fun. However if you don't have a lot of friends that also own this game it will be rather boring and not worth $60.00. If you see this game on sale don't hesitate to get it. It's also worth the $60.00 if you have it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-08,0,0,484,False,Not Recommended,I've withheld judgement on Grand Theft Auto V for the most of my gameplay because it's been a rollercoaster for me. Now that I'm basically done with the game I think it's time for me to leave a review. I will be reviewing the Online portion not the story. The story is fantastic and fun to play and I highly recommend you play it if you purchase Grand Theft Auto V. If I'm correct I've played GTA O over the course of three years which have mostly been a delight. I will cherish the memories I have made playing this game with my friends which were fantastic.However most of these memories came from the first few hours of the game. The game is only REALLY fun for the first few levels around up to 40 50 I'd say. The game allows you to explore and learn the game along with immersing yourself into the fictional Los Santos which is quite a large map and a fun adventure. For the first &lt 100 hours the game is truly a new and unique experience.Once you learn all there is to the game however it quickly loses its value. The game becomes not about having fun but earning more money to buy things that allow you to have fun. The heists are monotonous and provide too little compensation for a tedious setup. The MC Clubs / Offices / Bunkers require constant maintenance and need you to consistently work on them every second you get and there's always a risk of it being taken out by griefers who fly by in their Hydras and fire a storm of explosions. The hangars are a joke. The Doomsday Heist is only fun the first time through. The jobs don't pay. The races need expensive cars that cost you 3 000 000 in upgrades.The game obviously doesn't let you earn money as fast as you should be able to. This is to advocate the purchasing of Shark Cards a microtransaction which lets you instantly gain millions of ingame cash. But it doesn't end there. The Shark Cards are heavily overpriced with $100USD netting you a mere 8 000 000 dollars ingame. That's a joke! You can barely afford the most expensive office in the game or buy two/three of most expensive cars. You can't even buy the most expensive item which is a 10 000 000 dollar jet covered in gold paint the normal variant of which is merely a million dollars. You cannot possibly hope to gain any form of actual worth out of these microtransactions which means that it inherently is built to make you buy more and more sinking cash into a scam.Me and my friend beat the system. We've earned millions and millions of money ingame. But now that we've spent all that money on the cool things there's nothing to do. There's nothing rewarding about being rich. You play with your toys then you quickly realise you're just doing the same thing over and over again. I've spent the last 200 hours of my GTA O experience flying around in a jet shooting down anyone who shoots at me. Sure the expansions are fun and I come on each time one comes out but that's only to try them. Once I'm out of money I'm either going to hack it in or just quit the game because it's not worth the grind. Grand Theft Auto Online gave me a great experience. I will always love jumping out of helicopters with my friend to assassinate someone with a bounty and then calling in a car to make a quick escape. But I can't do that anymore. Now it's just rolling up in an APC and blowing them to kingdom come with an automatic missile launcher. Or it's bombing the hell out of them with a rocket powered plane. Or it's strafing them with explosive bullets out of a jet. It's not fun anymore.Except for the stunt races. Those are cool.,Grand Theft Auto V

However that said I can't support a desicion to ban modding. For one thing rockstar in the past was very open about allowing mods in single player only so they shouldn't be going back on their decision this far along too much time and energy has been put forth by people who love this game. The banning of single player modding while their servers are flooded by hackers who can literally spawn a giant ufo in the middle of downtown or make invincible crome hydras or just continuously blow up the entire map in a lobby killing everyone over and over masking who's doing it by giving credit to a random person in the lobby is a giant waste of time and horrible priorities.

When will these devs realize that we BUY our copy of the game and not lease it. They don't even give you the courtesy of asking whether or not you want the update but instead just act like they own your computer internet and your paid copy of the game. Imagine if they ran a car company. Open sand box games like this and Skyrim stay interesting because of modders and NOT of the lame content the devs offer. Often times it's the modders that make better content than the devs and fix bugs that the devs are too lazy to fix themselves. Skyrim would still be a bland POS if it wasn't for modders and would have died out back in 2012. I bought this game because of the mods out there that made it fun to mess around and take my real world frustrations out on the good citizens of Los Santos.

That's right A car. Then you have the joy of spending more precious hours of your life selling another fully loaded warehouse to fully mod that ONE car that you just bought. Want to run drugs as a biker kingpin? Well they've thrown all of what makes sense about purchasing and cutting cocaine and profit margins out the window. That's right! You know how in the real world cutting your coke would usually yield MORE coke now for some reason you get less coke. EVERYTHING ABOUT MULTIPLAYER SUCKS! Rockstar is forcibly not forcing players buy shark cards in order to have money by making it impossible to earn money without wasting several hours making pitiful pocket change while also making anything in the game worth buying super crazy expensive.Play this game for the story line which was AMAZING and super fun.

2017-06-15,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,One of my favourite games of all time but Rockstar's and Take Two's attitude to their EXTREMELY LOYAL playerbase is disgraceful. Everybody pays for your DLC in a roundabout way via Shark Cards most people bought the game 3 times and most people sing praise for R* as some of the most memorable games of all time are your creations but when you go after your modding scene and essentially end a lot of peoples fun just because you aren't milking your customers enough you've ended anyone with a brains interest. I was gonna buy a 75Euro Shark Card for Gunrunning not a hope now. I was gonna dust off the PS4 for Red Dead Redemption 2 (that's a whole other issue that you're restricting it to console only) but now I'm bailing on your games forever unless you change your attitude towards consumers and fans.We love your games but you are ruining your fanbase via lazy and poorly thought out content for GTA Online and now you've lost the support of die hard fans because of money grabbing stupidity and a terrible outlook on your fans. How about you go after hackers online who essentially rob your money via giving themselves and others billions basically stealing your ingame cash and leave the people who like to have a fun sandbox to explore in singleplayer alone.You clearly don't understand your fanbase and think of gamers as mindless money farms. From a person who loved every GTA game since the beginning goodbye. EDIT After Smugglers Run I realised how little R* care about their playerbase. It was tolerable (for me at least) the grind and need for the occasional Shark Card to buy some cool stuff to have fun with friends but the only good thing about DLC is the aesthetic and idea of it but when you boil it down it's just the same system they've had since the import/export crate stuff. I enjoy the biker gameplay but it's gotten old and my problem is that they seem to think that new vehicles out weighs new gameplay. The old term 'an ocean as deep as a puddle' doesn't even apply. It's more like they're adding so much new content that lacks any depth that we're in a landfill of old under developed content that gives you no freedom to play the game for the missions. I would have loved to run my MC for many years into the future but I would assume that there will never be any add on content for biker gangs so my time in GTA is over. I think R* think that we all like new vehicles and guns but any GTA fan will tell you that there favourite thing about the classics like Vice City or San Andreas wasn't vehicles in fact but it was the stories the freedom the feel and depth the games presented. Where's the gang wars and turf holding stuff that Bikers have been crying out for and the gangster Ballas/Vagos/Grove Street style DLC we've been hoping for. Sorry GTA O San Andreas Multiplayer (SAMP) is still 10 times better.,Grand Theft Auto V

Every single online lobby you get into will have modders however if you attempt to even the playing field you will get banned either permanently or for months. Every 3 days single player stops functioning for about 3 days so if you don't want to play with modders online then you can only play half of every week because of the extremely EXTREMELY stupid patching system. They make their own game unplayable every week. Makes me incredibly sick to my stomach that I spent money on these clowns. Don't buy this game don't play this game.

2017-11-23,0,0,1450,False,Recommended,Let me preface this review by saying that I have been a GTA fan for as long as I could remember even before I owned a system that could play any of the games.This game was highly anticipated by me despite the year long waiting period between release and me getting to play this game. This review will be in two parts firstly regarding the story and general gameplay mechanics and the second dealing with my experience playing GTA Online.Part I From what I ve percieved it seemed like the split style gameplay of GTA compared to previous releases was recieved with mixed opinions. Personally I was a fan of getting the feeling of a deeper game experience by having the story presented from three different perspectives. Transitions were much smoother than I previously anticipated before playing and overall I do feel like the game benefitted from this. In regards to the story I can t say there was too much that stood out to me so I d say that the story is the weakest link in this game. Characters were written extremely well however their eventual purpose ended up being rather generic. Former criminals getting back together for one last heist not much else you can do with that. There s the element of choice that we saw in GTA IV making a return which to me made the plot feel a tad bit derivative but this is really just a minor nitpick.Otherwise it s a GTA game plain and simple and it s really good at being a GTA game. The world is bigger and better than ever and there are more aircraft boats and cars to choose from when you want to get around.Part II GTA Online where do I begin?Before I started playing Online which now contributes the most to the amount of hours I have accrued I actually had to be coaxed into starting off in it. I never really saw the appeal before I set out but now I realize what I was missing out on. It s all the fun of single player (post story) with more clothing vehicles and more importantly friends to hang out with. Within a week of playing online for the first time I was absolutely hooked and despite the presence of many modders at the time I began gameplay was largely unaffected.Since I began playing there have been major overhauls to the connection system anti cheat system as well as the addition of several new game modes and methods of making money. This means that the experience of playing Online has only become increasingly refined and despite most of the activities being a money grind there s enough variety to break the monotomy.In conclusion I highly recommend GTA V both for its single player and Online gameplay.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-03,0,0,284,False,Not Recommended,Whatever you do DON'T buy this game. Or at very least stick to the Single Player campaign. This game is the worst example of how a big name game can extort money out of it's customers with branding alone. Disclaimer the actual single player campaign is phenomenal. Good story great characters fun gameplay it's easily the best part of the game and I think Rockstar didn't even intend for it to be the prime selling point.The online mode is what I'll be talking about. It's ing abysmal in every sense. Let me start from the beginning with this dumpster fire. Before you can play this game you have to install all 80 gigabytes of it. Now granted it's a *huge* game. There is a lot here so that's not my complaint. However when you get into the online and you start thinking back to all of that space and what you could've used it for it does actually become a negative. Now after you've waited hours for the download and install process you get to actually play the game. Ignoring the Singleplayer entirely here we're going to jump right into multiplayer. What are you greeted with? A load screen. No big deal every game has to load right? Only this one is a patience tester. I recommend having your phone nearby so you can watch a video or play a game during the process because trust me it's going to load. I've sat through almost 2 ten minute long videos just waiting for this trash to finish loading. Once you're finally online you can begin the grinding! Oh God too much grinding. If you're not blessed with the luck to find a random friendly modder willing to load you up with millions right off the bat you're going to have to sit through a bunch of boring repetitive missions which are just slightly more playable than a TI 84 calculator. It's all designed to make you want to purchase these stupid Shark cash cards which are ridiculously overpriced. To give you an idea of how much grinding you'll be doing a decent car will run you about $500k. You can earn about $25k within an hour doing bland missions or partaking in poorly balanced games with payouts. One survival mission set took me and two other guys nearly half an hour to beat and cost us $3k in armor snacks and ammunition. The payout for countless bodies dropped? A cool $15k. Chump change in GTA. What's even better is that the you'll need to make any decent money is in the millions of dollars to own. Want to steal nice cars and sell them for a profit? Something to the tune of $2m and the missions are designed so that you'll never get a full payout. Why the is there an attack chopper following some car barely worth $20k? So that you'll lose money and cave in to buy their cash cards. You'll also have to worry about some with too much time and money just looking to make your life harder. This game rolls out the red carpet to s who find joy out of ruining your and the missions are designed to give you as much chance to lose all of your investment along with it. I haven't even started talking about the hackers yet...Oh boy the hackers. For a game with this many microtransactions you'd think it'd have top notch security to help those who are in the thick of it at least have a fair time right? HAHAHA NOPE! This game has no designated servers it all runs on P2P netcode which means there are more anticheat measures in Valve's tirefire games. You will meet script kiddies on a ing powertrip and their sole reason for playing is to make your life miserable. I had one spawn a literal campfire inside my player character so I kept burning to death. I'd spawn and die ten seconds later losing any money I had on hand. Even better passive mode doesn't do either. Surely you can kick them though right? Lolno that would require Rockstar actually programming something! And it's not like a one time isolated incident either I left three servers in a row only to pop into a new server with another modder. Learning how to force myself into a solo server was the only way I got as many hours as I did in this game.Long story short while I'm usually against pirating just pirate this one. Or buy it and be a hacker. As for me I'm done with multiplayer. 200 hours I could've been playing any other game and I feel cheated after looking back on it. Don't play multiplayer. Just don't.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,103,False,Not Recommended,I originially purchased GTA V for the online. The story never really interested me but the online looked like a lot of fun. It was but it got very repetitive and boring and I never really felt I was earning enough money for it to be worth my time. I almost quit until a cheater (they are everywhere and gamebreaking) gave me an inordinate amount of money. I proceeded to buy everything I wanted. This alleviated my boredom for a while but eventually I ran into the same problem. Repetitiveness. So I along with the rest of my friends stopped playing online. I didn't touch the game until I came upon a mod called LSPDFR. This mod allows you to play in singleplayer as a police officer. I played this on and off for a while having mroe fun than ever before in GTA V. However recently Take Two those who control rockstar sent a cease and desist letter to the creaters of OpenIV. This has stopped the distribution and advancement of OpenIV. OpenIV is currently the only way (that I know of) to mod GTA V essentiallly making all modding illegal. GTA has had a strong modding community since GTA III and all of the sudden the execs decide no more? This has changed my opinion of GTA V and Take Two completley. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It may seem cool and fun. But it will get boring fast without the mods. I will never be purchasing a Take Two game again as long as they try to make modding illegal.Summary GTA V seem cool.I buy.GTA V gets boring.I stop playing.I find cool mod.I play again.Take Two bans modding.I stop playing.I stop buying Take Two Games.I write this review.,Grand Theft Auto V

After all they also ruined San Andreas PROS A really good follow up to the previous games Many things / activities to do in singleplayer and multiplayer Multiplayer is fun for a short period Good graphics and good feel to the guns Quite big open world What I think I think GTA V is worth buying for 60 euros. I don't think buying it just for the multiplayer is a good reason for buying it in general. You should really check out the singleplayer seeing as it has a lot to it and is replayable to some point.

The single player is great (and with mods even better) and the multiplayer is a lot of fun to mess around on.I only have a few small problems with the multiplayer which are The slow loading times The overpriced things (causing you to buy shark cards)The annoying idiots that keep killing you in online sessions (for no really reason than to just be an annoying idiot)And the low payout for doing jobs heist and for the CEO stuff(for the owner and there associates)But apart from that the game is great.,Grand Theft Auto V

Being online is fun the only annoying part is that earning money is pretty slow unless you buy shark cards (In game currency). But you don't have to just find a drop lobby like most people do. Story mode on this game is pretty damn good. Decent story line and countless hours of gameplay before you 100% complete the game. I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who's looking for a combination of both multiplayer (online) and story mode.TLDR Amazing story Lots of missions. Online multiplayer is amazing.

2017-06-22,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,While GTA V does have a very enjoyable singleplayer campaign with some great characters and memorable moments it stuffers from many issues that plague both SP and especially MP that Rockstar doesn't seem to care to fix instead of putting out free DLC (the free part is nice and some of them are cool DLCs) but they are just designed to be increasingly expensive and to drive sales of overpriced and scummy Shark Cards.This is in addition to Take Two's crack down on singleplayer modding even though it does not harm MP at all and they have never done anything to actually stop cheaters anyway.First of all singleplayer's problems. There's absolutely nothing to do that makes it worth to keep playing singleplayer after you beat the story. There is no insurance for cars so once you lose them you have to rebuy and remod them wtf!? I am not sure if there is any way to keep making more money either.Plus there is no sign of any SP DLC or expansions it seems that despite earlier confirmation from voice actors and suggestions in game of SP DLC they ahve ditched it just to focus on selling shark cards in MP. Multiplayer... where do I even begin? Menus are laggy like unreliable when clicked and slow. I have never experienced this in any other game. P2P servers and how you can easily switch straight to MP from SP mean they don't have any real way of stopping people from just using mods in multiplayer (which is utterly bizarre for an MP game from such a big company). Also does nothing to stop hackers there are hackers everywhere. Driving is still just hold down W to go faster and faster! Kind of hard to maintain a reasonable speed. Plus the AI likes to randomly swerve into the wrong lane. Can only start a private MP session with friends FROM SINGLEPLAYER. If you're already in MP you have to leave and start SP and then switch back... this makes zero sense and is frustrating. Especially due to the long load screens. Many other smaller issues I don't recall because I stopped playing like a year. No support for steering wheel peripherals.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,The company that owns this (take two interactive) is screwing modders over and using generally practices on people that just want to create something and make a decent living. They just banned a mod which about half of all mods in this game depend on effectively eliminating half of the mods in the game. The mods are only in single player too not effecting multiplayer so no cheaters come out of it. So why did they ban it? It makes more people play online and that means more microtransactions and that means more money for their greasy fingers. If the community lets like this slide more games will follow and mods will be far and in between while companies will be more and more excused for overall practices.,Grand Theft Auto V

Having my character wiped for money dropped on me by a modder while a friend who modded his own characters to lvl 4000 and has hundreds of millions of $ still has all of his characters.... I bought the PS3 version launch day played GTA online as soon as the servers would let me built a PC with the specific intention to play GTA5 (just to be told my character cant be transferred over because I missed some arbitrary cutoff date from rockstar) and this is how I'm thanked. Dont adress the rediculous ""economy"" in game just squeeze for shark cards and ban anyone who gets a drop of fun out of the game without paying the R* tax... Any money you do manage to somehow get is then ripped from your hands with multi million dollar vehicles and daily fees from every side for every property so even after they have your money they keep taking more. The launcher doesnt even work it's faster to start up story mode and launch GTA online from there. The ""find a session with friends"" does not work have to go to friends list and specifically hit ""join friend"" The options change themselves (have to set game back to full screen about once a week) The matchmaking is useless basically play with a set group or have fun failing every mission because the drooling mongoloids youre matched with play in traffic or just spam random garbage in chat... and thats IF youre lucky enough to get into a mission period. Hosting is worse start mission hit auto invite leave pc for soulsearching journey backpacking across Europe come back still havent got a full lobby together.And even now years after lauch and the game still doesnt actually work caught in the infinite limbo of starting missions/heists/sessions just to be disconnected and thrown back to story mode.... getting fun out of this game is a chore and Rockstar needs to start trying to fix the PLAYABILITY OF THEIR GAME INSTEAD OF PROFITABILITYThe true shame in all of it is how easy they could fix it 1) Stop being greedy and bring down the in game costs the costs of everything have inflated so much the only way to physically play half the content is to mod or grind for hours a day to be ""allowed"" to play the game content they paid for.2) Stop banning people for $/RP amounts be it increases or totals. The fact of the matter is they are punishing 100s of innocent bystanders for every legit modder they catch and at this point I prefer modders over the unjust overreach of rockstars policies. A modder did not flush both my characters which I put dozens of hours into Rockstar did.3) Stop acting like GTA O was the sequel to GTAV and actually do something with those billions of dollars of revenue and make some single player DLC its only been multiple years since release and im kinda sick of monthly hot wheels packs with 0 actual content. 4) Stop re using your ideas over and over again making the players pay each time for your unpolished soon to be abandoned ideas. First the CEO crap then the bike clubs and now the gunrunning. Same different sparkle and guess what staggered release so you buy the first one like ""oh wow cool finally some actual CONTENT"" so you spend millions on property and vehicles and you do missions that suck to unlock the missions that dont suck and then the bike clubs come out which do the exact same thing but with differnt names on the objectives and you got some stupid biker roleplaying fluff that does jack but make sure you spend millions of dollars on this too cuz gotta buy it before you can see just how crap it is. And now we got the gunrunning which is the final (dear god I hope) not as fleshed out ""run your own business"" sim which is actually just another pain in the drive all over for little to no actual ing mission content time waster.

2016-12-28,0,0,409,False,Not Recommended,"I would like to tell you that in my opinion do now R and how they are ruining the game forcing you to cheat or just farming forgetting that this is a game. A game designed for fun.Think back those who play at least a year. As before in another we were treated to the game and preference for fun entertainment rather than simply farming money. But the developers themselves shout at us ""You can not make money to buy the wheelbarrow So buy a payment card which is worth more than the game itself and you will be a lot of money for which you can buy a pair of useless wheelbarrows!"". But you do not like this situation. You look out digging in the internet and find cheats or some glitches with the money. You do not leave a choice.Let's just go on site with cheap cars and look at the price tags. And what do we see? Motorcycles. One is 2kk. Near the old pimped which should cost no more than 15k. And the motorcycles the value of which goes far beyond 100k. Even ordinary scooters sell for 50k.Now let's see what the prices were before. We flip through and see that the cars of the recent upgrades are very expensive. Conventional muscle cars in livery standing at 300k or more. The lower we go down the cheaper and dearer cars we see. Some are the same as new without labels. The same f*cking Dominator is a 10 ed * times cheaper! R so lazy that sell old cars in a new wrapper.Take a look at the old motorcycles. Do not believe it? According 12 15k. Of course Hakuchou monster is 82k but that it justified the price. His counterpart in the new store flaunts for 1kk. Well yes sometimes kings arrange discounts so we certainly have bought that .Look at the new supercar. The average price tag for 1 5 2kk. But they still need to pump. Previously the most expensive was the Adder's wheelbarrow and all surpriced wali saw him in the free session. The remaining cars cost about 500k not to mention sports cars.And yet we can say that new cars disgusting quality. Their bottoms do not have detailed covering all the bl * dskim sheet glare as a 3D object without textures. All of the same type. The more expensive the steeper. Now the only way determine the best wheelbarrow.Before it was different. Sporti classic loved and went to her constantly. How often do you see people today on sport classic? Yes if only on this new Tornado which place a landfill. It is sad to see how developers are in the pursuit of money.Now some of you shout ""What about updating Bikers and Import / Export A Cool new job is to transport cargo and earn money!?!""Yeah cool. Enter the game as a job. Jerk off with warehouses and businesses. Wait until you call black and say that the whole warehouse cleaned some s pumps. A guard bought for 500k just sucked. A warehouse? You all week for half a day filled the largest store in order to sell. But R cut off the faucet with a single session and you had to take back the goods to the public. Once you have boarded the ship or aircraft immediately flew the boys and smashed everything to smithereens earning a couple of thousand dollars and ruined you. You're broken capillaries downloads cheats money and then a couple of hours you get banned for a month and you take your cheat 10kk and another couple earned an honest living. You start yelling and leaving maynkraft play because there is no more strength.And you know what they were doing in the game before? We were playing the usual race shootout. Did you know about this regime as a confrontation? The mission of ""corrupt cop"" where the two teams had to send a case to different places. How fun it was to go from the cops and other people's teams while you were covered by his own guys. ""Rapid convoy"" ""Hasta la Vista"" and other exciting modes. We no longer go there because it is important to get as much money and experience and the fact is interesting or not we are hammering. That is admitted. How long have you tried to stop the cars in ""Swift convoy?"" A land and hold a position with the ""landing""? This is a relatively new confrontation but many do not know of their existence.

If I can't mod GTA VI again I'm not going to buy it simple as that. I don't like Online games filled with microtransactions and this pretty much ruins the game for me.

And that is ultimately so I could have fun. Indeed this is no longer possible for those that don't particularly care for the online because Take Two Interactive wants to squeeze enough money out of consumers' pockets (even after the vast majority had purchased this game three separate times). It didn't take long for me to lose interest in the Online aspect of this game seeing as it was absolutely full of hackers and microtransactions so I thought ""Hey I can have just as much if not even more fun just modding the singleplayer. Because you know I along with millions of people that pushed this game into its legendary status throughout the years want to have fun."" Not only is the cease and desist towards the largest modding tool used in the Grand Theft Auto series an absolute kick in the teeth for those that just wanted to enjoy your game Take Two but it's a massive hideously enormous absolute kick in the teeth to the modders that spent countless hours so us singleplayer users could have some fun of our own often without any financial backing or support. All of this restriction on mod develepors and consumers of the admittedly brilliant and phenomenal singeplayer experience just so a single company can grab as much as they can from people's wallets (despite GTA V already being the fourth and nearly third best selling game of all time) is downright shameful.No more Take Two games for me until you get your together.

That and the online part of gta 5 is horrible and they have done NOTHING for the single player mode. A team decided to make something for gta 5 single player and it gets stopped. They didn't even try to negotiate with the openiv team like hey guys you can make this as a dlc or hey guys lets just make sure that you require players to own gta IV to use this. Nope just up yours and buy some megalodon cards so you can buy a single fricken yacht! only 100 dollars to get 8 million oh and you need 10 million to get the Galaxy Super Yacht! Come on a single yacht is worth tens of thousands of players to pay us 100 dollars to own one but only until we end online support for this game! At that point you get jack and can enjoy all the hackers ruining the online servers just like with gta IV they saved us the trouble of ending the online community. This game is NOT worth 60 bucks its a 2015 game that only gets overpriced online updates. You can buy this game for the Xbox 360 on ebay for 14 bucks but if you decided for some god awful reason to buy it now on steam not only will you pay the full original price from TWO years ago but you can also get overpriced online credits that will expire when they make a new gta.

2015-11-10,0,0,215,False,Not Recommended,I would recommend this game but not at full price. I suggest waiting for a price reduction or at the very least 75% off the original offering price of 70$As a big fan of the GTA series since it's inception I think the game fell flat in the single player game. The single player story had some good moments but was way too short by GTA standards. The multi player missions are lack luster and with so many skill levels in the multi player arena it is hard to get missions done without someone intentionally spoiling it. Free roaming in multilplayer is not worth your time.

2015-07-26,0,0,73,False,Recommended,Initially I couldn't really play the game since it kept crashing so I took the oppurtunity to explore the world and have a little fun. I was mesmerized. The scenery is simply phantasmagoric wait no... not even something I could dream of! I had fun stealing jet skis and running them up sewers away from cops in the city. I swam with hammerhead sharks took a tractor up to the highest peak in the game and then launched it with myself on it into the canyon. I even managed to hijack a train and cause mayhem on the highway. I can recall stumbling onto a ranch and stabbing a cow to death for absolutely no reason. Who would have expected to find a nihilistic overman in the making?But then I discovered that I could attack people to get cash. It started out small going to remote beaches and making a few dozen bucks a raid. But then I realized I could plan massive highway ambushes not unfamiliar to the terrified peasants of the middle ages!!Slowly but surely I became like a black widukind fighting the decadent society of Los Santos in this strange game.I reccomend this to anybody with spare time and a dash of boredom every now and then!On a rather ironic sidenote I believe that this game has actually taught me to be a better safer more responsible and more alert driver in real life.

2017-06-15,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE Thank you to the community and to Rockstar urging Take Two to get rid of the Cease and Desist letter while what they did the right thing to rid the CnD I'm still going to keep the thumbs down. The reason being is that this shoudn't have happened in the first place. Take Two you need to respect your community and the people who buy this game especially to those who mod your SINGLE PLAYER experience which potentially increases the game sales. We don't hate you just hated that you made a decision that almost lead a great community into the dirt a community that loves Rockstar games and appreciate the fact we're given the chance to increase our play time. Lastly since you did this I will be most definitely be getting Red Dead Redemption 2. You (Take Two) and Rockstar are both a great company and a great team. Let's all join forces to keep on making great content together and having an excellent communtiy. Thank you. I loved this game played the hell out of it on Xbox One then decided to get it on PC since I had the computer to run it and I could also use mods. But now that dream is now a nightmare since Take Two Interactive has officially screwed OpenIV when they did nothing wrong. Good job....................................................................,Grand Theft Auto V

Well firstly I have 2 copies of gta v on my pc one modded for offline play and a fresh install for playing gta v multiplayer to it's full. To remove openiv which has been around the time of most gta games for modding the gta series for extended fun was a big mistake. Gta v is only popular to this day because of mods and to over the loyal fans of the franchise like this is horrible. However short and sweet BAD IDEA TAKE TWO!,Grand Theft Auto V

So you spend your hard earned cash on shark cards for the TERRRIBLE online mode because apparently the 4th best selling game in the world isn't earning enough money for the company.

The main story and side jobs / quests and activities you can do in this game is great.What isn't so great is the multiplayer. It's a love hate relationship. The loading times to get on to a game server to your first game can take anywhere between 5 minutes to 30 minutes and another 5 to 30 minutes to load another heist / job. So a huge chunk of the online experience is spent waiting to get connected and waiting for the community to join any activity / heist. The comunity online has not been great too. There's just wayyy too many hackers and rude players to make the game enjoyable on multiplayer for me.

2017-08-27,1,1,4428,False,Not Recommended,Before you read the my review please look at how many hours I have played on thsi game. Did you look? Good. Now the single player mode is pretty good love the story and the 3 characters. However there is no dlc for the single player mode in which R* focuses on the online mode. Now with 4 000+ hours of playing time and never using an exploit cheat glitch hack beg/accepted money from hackers how come I am punished by having my money taken away from me? Never once did I do any of those things and R* punishes me. Not only that but I still didn't get all the stuff from the gunrunning dlc. That doesn't even include all the things I wanted to get from previous dlc. 4000 hours and still not able to get everything from a single dlc. Way to go R* for making everything so expensive and punish innocent people like me just because I'm trying to grind my money to purchase said dlc. I would say wait for this game to be on sale for 30 bucks to buy it because the single player is amazing. As for the online mode it is a waste of time and money as R* never fixes the problems and blames the innocent people for its unfairness and treats hackers like they are the gods of the game.SP 10/10MP 0/10all in all 5/10EDIT Steam Sale 10/27/2017 WOW It's out for half price FINALLY for how many years now?

Now don't get me wrong the story mode is fantastic. I love the storry mode and if the game goes on sale for a decent amount I'd say pick it up just for the story mode. The online you have to make your own fun and this is a real pain considering anything really enjoyable will put you out millions of dollars. ""But I can just buy shark cards right?"" I mean you could but let's look at something here. Criminal mastermind. 10 million dollars. More than what an $100 shark card gets you. An $100 shark card can't even buy the best yacht. And if you buy a few cars say bye bye to your precious $100 investment. Making money online is a real joke and is akin to pouring molten hot wax into your eye sockets. Car missions car missions car missions car missions. Crates crates crates crates crates. Or you could spend all your time grinding pac standard just so you could afford a buggy with metal taped to it that explodes after ramping 20 cars (the intended purpose for the vehicle) AND THEN Back to grinding boys! If you want to play online I don't recommend getting this game unless you know friends play online too. Then yyou'll just be making money without any of the fun really unless you reeeeeally try to make your own fun. But other than that have fun wandering around an empty world with nothing to do. No animals 90% of the buldings you can't enter no more world events like armored cars. Just an empty world with the same looking npcs the same looking cars and genetically cloned cops with an aversion to hair. So in short the only thing that will save this game is Rockstar actually giving a damn about making the game fun again rather than trying to make you buy their precious shark cards. Oh yeah and don't forget about being terrified a hacker will put money in your inventory.

If you don't well don't get this game because thats what will happen if you buy this game. I tried to like the game but everytime I try and do my ceo missions there is always someone trying to screw you up and you can't do ceo missions or motorcycle club missions in a private session. You should be able to but you can't. Please don't buy this game. Rockstar needs to know how messed up this game is. Also I didn't mention the amount of cheaters in this game. Almost every session you will join there will be at least 1 modder killing you over and over again by blowing everyone in the lobby up and going invisible and using infinite health and teleporting you around everywhere. It's a shame because this game has so much potential to be a masterpiece but there are so many flaws that rockstar doesn't address. Instead they make new content hoping people will ignore the fact that rockstar is letting all these modders into their game. And yes I know I don't have many hours in this game but i've played it enough to know what kind of crap goes on in this game because I even bought the criminal enterprise pack for the businesses hoping it would be better but it's actually worse since everyone in the lobby knows where all of your product is at all times.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,579,False,Not Recommended,"This game is perhaps the most disappointing thing i have ever substantially played. Yes i have 574 hours on it. However an untold amount of those hours were spent in modded SP which is good however 2edgy at times. Now the main reason i'm giving this game a no is Online. GTA Online has always been one of the top draws of GTA V with an original promise of a living economy and rising to the top of your own criminal empire! Sounds nice right......but like everything else problems quickly arised. Instead of robberies or heists you got a ton of missions where it was painfully obvious R* had copy pasted the same situation. Now that's not that bad really. You could make a balanced amount by grinding them and the worst thing you could buy was an attack helicopter that a well trained sniper could quickly destroy. You could by microtransactions (a bit of a recent buzzword) but they were relatively balanced to the cost of content. The first few updates were generic civvie cars nothing you wouldn't see driving around hollywood at the fanciest thing. Fast forward into March 2015 where something a bit sour begins Hiests allows you to purchase armored cars that are pains in the to take down. Still the Hiests themselves are fun and each toy can be weakened and nothing with weapons can be put in a garage. The ""Meta Game"" of online started getting bad during late spring 2017. You go from a couple armed vehicles you have to pay to unlock to 4 armored vehicles that any child that can use their mommies credit card can buy and the facility to do missions that pay well is behind a 2 million dollar paywall. Hey at least the vehicles all aren't complete cancer right? I mean you can't use the turret on most of them without a team member... Except the ing Opressor. That ing son of a of a rocket bike easily outshines anything else can ing fly can use rockets and machine guns and is fast as hell so of course it becomes a grief tool of choice. Oh and those vehicles you couldn't put in a garage? Yeah you can now. Oops. Oh and you manage to destroy the who's flying around in the Opressor he can store in his garage? You shoot it down and pay 20k. Now the next update is also gated behind a paywall. (Paywall as in ingame GTA$ as was any examples listed earlier. Microtransactions for it can be purchased.) You can now garage your planes... and make people pay for shooting down your Hydra a VTOL fighter jet that outshines literally every other plane. Finally the 2nd most recent update includes a ton of military items including another tank (like we needed one) and a goddam heavy bomber because balance isn't needed this is Rockstar. Oh and the weaponry you could use previously? The new Attack Helicopter can make itself invisible to radar. Also there's now a flying Delorean with rockets and missiles because we totally need more ing weaponry.Finally most civvie cars in recent updates have been given a ton of weaponry they don't really need to drive up prices and buying GTA$ has never been adjusted to account for the steady increase in prices creating a outlandish exchange rate and locking out content from the people who were willing to pay. Instead Rock$tar seems to only care about the sweet sweet market of tweens who can use mommies money. Rockstar has also failed to keep promises one of the most recent updates a giant heist was probably originally going to be the SP DKC they promised us and they said they were gonna put a casino in... around 2013 ish? Also none of the new vehicles are in SP to try outside of mods.Combine that with the fact that making money takes literal days to buy any given new vehicle greifers are stronger than ever and there's several recent banwaves for ""modding"" against people who've done nothing wrong and you have yourself a failure of a game. It's sad really you have so much potental and it all wastes away until you're left sitting in your 350 000 virtual apartment staring face to face with a tryhard who changed their crew logo to be a hypebeast clothing brand in their 2 million dollar flying car.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-13,0,0,266,False,Not Recommended,Single player is one of the best GTA stories ever told and every reason to pick this game up when on sale for a huge discount. Multiplayer however is a mess. I'm not talking about the price of new Xpac content either. There are ways to farm cash quickly if you are not a scrub do some quick research on farmable missions heists open world stuff ect.... As of Doomsday leveling up as a lowbie has never been better just join a DD mission and chill with the CEO's. That said I've seen so many bad players who cannot seem to figure out how get item A to point B and refuse to git gud(I've seen someone struggle for 10 minutes to figure out how to put a van in a garage). Fortunately reddit can save you there with many group pages filled with players who actually have common sense(such a rare thing these days). All this aside the reason I cannot recommend this game for a few reasons. Chiefly being the poor servers for online. Constant queues with poor matchmaking options followed by more loading screens followed by a mission where one scrub can ruin the whole experience followed by another loading screen and one last long one to take you back to the overworld at which point sometimes things happen to fast for the game and leave you in loading limbo till you TM and close the app. After the server issues comes the modder problem and the games ban system picking players who may not of been hacking and just in the wrong place at the wrong time and permabanning them. Lets wrap up the three strikes with this final point TakeTwo have been nerfing every way to make more money in online from bugs to straight up removing the best farming mission(old school 2013 stuff arguably better than the farming methods available now with the DLCs) from the game just to make shark cards more enticing. In a world currently running rampant with the freemium method desensitizing society to it's inherently greedy and underhanded approach to revenue generation I'd tell you to pass on this one.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is both a fantastic interesting and funny singleplayer game and even funnier multiplayer game. The world is massive. It may not compete with new(er) open world games like The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn but it's damn good for a 4+ year old game. The story is amazing and long. At many points while I played I had to stop and think about what I just saw such as Trevor blowing up a meth lab killing 50+ red necks and dropping his pants to show off his privates to his friend's cousin (many of the messed up things are caused by Trevor if you can't already tell). The online works well and is still going strong. At the time of writing GTA Online is nominated for the Best Ongoing Game at the Game Awards 2017. If that doesn't sell to you how good the online mode is on top of an already great game I don't know what to tell you.I highly recommend this game for fans of the Grand Theft Auto series and anyone who just wants some casual fun taking hits from a bong in a friend's apartment while playing online.,Grand Theft Auto V

After really enjoying the game from start to finish I stopped playing and uninstalled it to get some space on my hard drive.A few months later I wanted to play the game again and one DVD was scrached so the game couldn't install which with 99.9% of other games wouldn't be a big deal but for some strange reason you can not download GTA V if you bought the retail version.After asking the support to give me some sort of download code or just to send me a new copy of the ONE scrached DVD and even sending them pictures of the whole box the reciept and the broken DVD the told me to go to gamestop who of corse also said no as this game is DRM protected.So in a steam sale about half a year ago I rebought the game effectively owning it twice and boom now they made modding illegal or at least super hard to do.I spend 90 on two versions of the same game just because of Rockstars f*ckery and now they take away what keept the game going for me.Unless they fix this whole bulls**t quick I will never buy any Rockstar or Take2 game ever again no matter how good it may be.,Grand Theft Auto V

Money making while there are many options take a massive amount of time and offer very little reward and that's IF you manage to evade the hackers good luck. I stopped playing for months and the first guy i run into when i get back online is teleporting around the map spawning vehicles and explosions and killing everyone around the map simultaneously and reporting them will do no good. So unless you get into a lobby by yourself or with only a few ppl and no hackers theres no way to make money yet R* keeps adding content you can't buy because you don't have the money to buy it hence why the introduced shark cards the only real way for you to get in game money and yet another cash roll for themselves.So while i did like the previous GTA's and especially san andreas R* missed the ringer on this one by making their greed and lack of security too obvious.

2017-06-17,0,0,580,False,Not Recommended,I can recommend the singleplayer if that's your thing.The multiplayer has lots of potential but is only being abused by the developers and publishers to lure players into spending real money for overpriced ingame stuff that is mostly there to show off or troll other players. Of course you can earn it all ingame after hours of repetitive grinding. It takes some time until it gets repetitive but eventually it does.Then there are lots of hackers who apparently can do anything they want. Sometimes you will just die other times you will suddenly have insane amounts of ammunition for a weapon unobtainable in multiplayer (so you actually look like a hacker) if you're unlucky you will just lose money or RP.There is some freeroam stuff to do which is not bad but gets repetitive quickly. Also you need a good amount of money until you are able to start with it. Everything else is locked behind an atrocious lobby system which will eat up your time. You will spend much time searching for a lobby or have the game search one for you whereas there are way too few filter options or a *just take me to a lobby that is about to start* feature. You will spend loads of time waiting in lobbies watching how two players leave out of boredom right in the second the last player to fill the lobby joins. You will spend motherloads of time looking at a faded out top down view on the city which acts as the loading screen because each time you enter a lobby or the game decides to kick you out of one or move you to another or when you're about to enter an actual game session this screen turns up. Sometimes it won't even go away. It will just stay there and after five or ten minutes you need to decide whether to restart the game or keep waiting. I've seen loading screens disappear as if nothing was wrong after fifteen minutes of waiting and no indication or whatsoever what it was doing. And if you manage to get in a lobby that starts a game after waiting you will in many cases be presented a minigame like session whereas the minigames are sometimes fun but often not well thought through and as soon as you are starting to have fun the round ends and you get back to your beloved lobby. And if you decide you want to play another gamemode you can't just change it even if all the people in your session want it because the game will present you only a random subset of available modes. You'll have to go through the loading screen to freeroam then through another one to a new session.This game (also online mode) could've easily become the game of the decade but the developers and publishers decided to get a high rank in the list of games where you can buy the grind away and the list of games with the worst development decisions after a well made and potent base has been established.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-29,0,0,56,False,Recommended,Overall I had gotten this game as a gift from my friend Which I was happy enough when he sent me the gift over on my vacation a couple months back. This game is something I have been waiting to get into since my last playthrough of Vice City And San Andreas on my old Ps2 and my Laptop. For me being a console player I'd say this will not dissapoint you at all. And I ALSO remind you all that using the controller is more easier than using your keyboard and mouse But that is just me It does not matter what you pick Its still the same game Alright now I will get into the basics of my review. Lets talk about the Single Player Overall the singleplayer is something you will spend about a couple of hours on The characters are memorable And the story itself is pretty sweet. And yet The main cast of voice actors are one of the best parts in the game itself. Ill just end this portion off with saying its one of Rockstars masterpieces. I do reccomend the older games like III SA and VC. 9/10.Now I get to the Multiplayer Oh Boy.This was something I have really was excited to try out. GTA Online was something my friends had mentioned to me a few times on my skype group I had a couple months ago and they kept telling me that this portion of the game was amazing enough and that once you get into it You do not want to leave at all. Alrighty then So I do not see why people hate this section. Oh wait Theres one thing I hated. the chat is insane enough as it is. But you could just tend to ignore it. But now from what I have heard Modders ruineed the online experience. Which Is kinda true I have seen a few players here on through and it tends to get a tad bit annoying when you are playing for fun or any of that stuff. But trust me Its best you play the online mode on console Or just play it some times in a private loby with friends. Avoiding the people who hack and all of that.Mutiplayer on Pc gets a 6/10Overall The PC version gets the job well done for now. Only dissapointing thing that Rockstar had did to the pc version was that they had removed the mods off of the game Pretty sucky isnt it? Yeah It is. But I reccomend that you avoid the Review section Heck just ask a friend or a classmate who has played this and talked about it in your local areas then. But I still do recommend that you at least try the game out.,Grand Theft Auto V

After seeing the BETTER and even NICER way the MODDERS dealt with multiplayer I am really disappointed with the way the developers dealt with GTA online. A full on on a stick.You launch the game the logos and the rights claim whatever. You will become accustomed to this sight after spending countless hours trying to LOAD ONLINE. Every choice to join a lobby join a heist EVERYTHING requires a loading screen. Oh you were joining the session but the host began to play? Pff maybe you want to spectate? No? Well then have this ed up loading screen that never loads and makes you CTRL + ALT + DELETE and remove GTA 5 from tasks. Booting up the game again. Ah a fresh start! Nope spend 5 7 minutes waiting until you load online again. Oh great I am in! Hmm what's this invite I have got? Let's try it! Proceeds to fail mission twice and everyone votes to continue. (Which just brings you back to freemode). Oh another loading screen... that's... understandable. Hm? What's this? Can't connect to session and want me to return to my story mode? Ehm sure... Reconnect back and have to restart game again.Hello logos! How I miss you NOT. Okay this time. This time this will work. *PRESS ONLINE*. *WAITING*. *WAITING*.*OOPS DIED OF OLD AGE DO YOU WANT TO RETURN TO STORY MODE?*.On the other hand the story mode seems fine and wonderful. Nice working and characters. I love the GTA universes but SPARE YOUR MONEY if you want to play online. It's a load of 3/10. Not a real critic but no one cares.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-02-20,0,0,73,False,Recommended,"Contrary to the overall review score on steam the singleplayer mode is quite solid. It just got dragged down by its online mode and OpenIV ""incident"". Gameplay wise some changes from GTA IV like Missing world detail from IV (Check out the ""GTA IV is better than GTA V"" video on YouTube if u wanna know more) Arguable weaker physics Casual driving system (Many may like it hardcore GTA IV players will hate it) Toned down car damage Rather generic story (I really not that impressed with the story not as fun as GTA SA and not as deep as GTA IV) Extremely constant and overpowered cop waves (They will kill you quickly comparable to the FBI from GTA3 if on street level)...might off some older GTA players. But overall this is still a solid open world game. If you see this game on sale you should definity buy it the singleplayer component is well worth the asking price. It's well made entertaining and much more beginner friendly than older GTAs.Just avoid sinking too deep into the online mode for a few simple deathmatch with friends is fine.

2017-06-15,0,0,472,False,Not Recommended,"In the world of disconnected executives it probably sounded like a really good idea to remove mod support. It probably looked good in a spread sheet and in a power point presentation. It probably sounded really good in the ears of the corporate zombies that are completely removed from their customers. The oportunity to make a couple of thousand extra dollars is just to tempting for them to take a step back and ask themselves ""Guys is this REALLY a good idea?"".And no it was the worst decision they have ever made. By far. So bad infact that if there was a zombie apocalyptic outbreak in the Take Two's HQ it would actually increase the average IQ. It would probably improve the customer expererience and interaction as well.We are talking about tools that are targeted towards the single player mode only. A mode that has been left completely unsupported since the launch. No new missions no added campaigns. No nothing. Enter the modders that VERY LIKELY has had a significant impact on the sales since tens of thousands gamers are watching Youtubers and streamers mess around with added content. Content that people clearly like but the publishers have been completely ignoring. Why? Probably because the online part is easier to monetise on since you get to buy Shark cards due to the ridiculous pricing of the added content for the online mode. I for one couldn't be arsed with the online mode at all any more. But that is a completely different story.The trend in the business at the moment are going towards 2 things 1. Coop2. Mod supportMore and more AAA titles are incorporating systems for modders to publish their work. And we are talking work out of pure love of the game since they make zero US pesos on it. Not only are these modders increasing the life span of the games but they are also getting more people to buy the them. FACT! I'm one of them since I've purchased several Sim racing games only becuase they have had extra (MODDED!) content that I really wanted to try. And now they suddenly decided to chop of that hand that has been feeding them money. Feeding them money for FREE!There's problaby some guy in the marketing department completely unaware of how gamers think of course that came up with the idea and managed to pitch it to the board. And that's fine of course but how the board decided that it was a great idea and also how they are actually going to make MORE money out of cutting out the mod support is completely beyond me. It's probably due to the fact that I can't think like a zombie but who knows.I completely agree to having a hard red line against modding in the online part since we are talking about real money that gets involved. I have zero sympathy for cheaters e t c so that's not an issue for me.But since we are talking about the single player offline mode it's just too much to swallow.I'm only one voice the gaming universe but for me this means that it will be no RDR2 for me.

2017-06-15,0,0,251,False,Not Recommended,Graphics are great the idea is great implementation is flawed. I've bought this game three times PS3 PS4 and now PC. I kind of regret that even though the PC version is by far the best.First off the pricing model is horrible if you're not the type of person to regularly play this game and have millions saved up because you've already bought everything you want. I usually play for a week or two when new DLC comes out so that means I have to grind to be able to afford even a fraction of what's in the DLC. By the time I can afford to enjoy the new DLC I'm already over playing the game for the time being. This is to encourage you to buy Shark Cards which give a pretty bad return relative to how much real life money they cost.My second problem ties in to the first. If you do want to grind it's not very user friendly. Loading screens are too long and occasionally it'll drop you into someone else's missions even if you're the host of your own. It's happened before that me and two other friends would be doing missions finishing quickly because we know what we're doing and when we're going on to another mission it'll take all three of us and put us in one guys game taking host away from me. This is ridiculous. I can't recommend this because that would tell Rockstar that it's okay to release an incomplete game three times. They've done amazing stuff with the graphics and the attention to detail but the multiplayer aspect of the game is very basic and very shallow.,Grand Theft Auto V

The mods and the modding community should've received more respect since hackers do their thing anyway and banning the mods won't do absolutely nothing to fix this security problem. Unbalanced gameplay favors hacking and modding in the first place and there's a real problem with the devs and R* not the players.It's a very bad decision from R* and Take Two and they'll be put on my list fron now on next to EA and Ubisoft.

2017-06-15,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,Thanks for the wonderful experience OpenIV Team you guys have made this game and several others so much more memorable. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone based on the behavior of Take Two Interactive and the buggy unmoderated experience gta online provides. This game is a cash cow owned by people who just don't care so i'd advise you go play another game with a more modding friendly approach if you really want a game that'll last more than 48 hours of gameplay. Rest in peace OpenIV you had a great ten years... *UPDATE* Take two has revoked their cease and desist and the public outcry was heard after all of the backlash now openIV is back in development and my review for the game will change when thedistribution returns!

Oh and the reason I'm saying don't get this game is because of a ""wonderful"" decision by Take Two. Basically the only reason to get this game on PC is for the mods and thanks to a cease and desist order Take Two has basically killed off most of the GTA mods. There wasn't any reason to do that other than their greed and desire for people to start playing their micro transaction filled hellhole of a multiplayer.

2017-01-14,0,0,733,False,Not Recommended,Dont buy it if you like using mods or having to restart a mission from start everytime you die simply you will get a false ban from doing nothing or not and even if you dont get banned stay aware and becareful because you might be next. If you dont get a ban then play like normal and see what bad changes Rockstar has made to ruin this game honestly just get GTA 4 and not 5. You now what else Rockstar does? yeah lets do Martins 4th mission and you finally hack the laptop and you get on your way to LSIA and restart from the start though this only happens on some missions and heist like the Prison Break heist where when you get killed in the Prision at any part or even if youre out of the prison you have to restart all over again.

2017-06-18,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,I loved previous GTA games but I never did manage to enjoy this one. The DRM killed it for me I only played once in single player and it took me 30 minutes just to start the game because of the DRM. I got stuck waiting in the menu for half an hour because of ridiculous DRM. By the time the game finally loaded I was so annoyed I couldn't even try to enjoy the game and I closed it after a few minutes.Now they've started attacking modders who are trying to enjoy the game. I can't in good concious recommend this game and you really shouldn't give them more money to continue trying to attack consumers. The game itself may very well be good but due to the devs policies trying to actually play it and enjoy it is extremely difficult. If you really want to play this I would highly recommend pirating it over buying it. I deeply regret having bought it and wish I'd have pirated it I might have had a lot of fun with it if I didn't try only the legal version.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-14,0,0,256,False,Not Recommended,The only reason I bought this game was to mod it. LSPDFR Graphics mods different guns cars maps...

I kept playing it because I could mod the singleplayer TO ADD THE VEHICLES YOU HAVE SEEN FIT TO NOT EVEN ADD TO SINGLE PLAYER let alone all the other mods the amazing community has made for GTA V and GTA IV over the last 10 or so years. Placing a cease and desist on the tool the modding community needs to mod your game that has existed SINCE GTA IV is purely an attempt to bring the large portion of players who no longer give a damn for your cash grabbing GTA Online and I refuse to support 2k and Rockstar moving forward.

There's no good reason to spend a single penny on this game at this point in time when after a dlc/expansion (sp excluded) the game literally now has less features less playability and the singleplayer is completely nerfed and barred from any and all mods all under the guise of protecting players. In reality it's all a push towards a multiplayer only demo (that you pay full price for) where you again pay in game for any chance to actually use any of the features of which there are now significantly less after mod banning. They took an amazing game and turned it into complete garbage. These changes affect their other games as well Anything Take 2 or Rockstar is going to be developing in the future (it seems retroactively as well) will be extremely anti community and anti paying customer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-14,0,0,1354,False,Recommended,Unfortunately there are still hackers in game and ALOT .. I mean A LOT!!! of Griefers that kill you randomly for no reason online. Rockstar is supposed to sort them out as bad players when reported so that good players play on servers with good players.. and bad players (like the griefers) are put on the bad servers with likeminded sociopaths and psycho's who shoot everyone &amp everything for no reason. But their system does not seem to work. PERHAPS if all the actual players weren't shown as blips on radar and didn't have HUGE target sign names above their heads it would help them not be shot down immediately by these looney's. you know blending in with the other NPC's. But the griefers don't care about the NPC's and just go after you the player character getting their joy from making other players annoyed while they try to just play the game. Can be pretty frustrating for those starting out. Still a good game definately recomend playing the singleplayer storyline. for ONLINE mode just be prepared for alot of frustration as you are gunned down constantly by other players for no apparent reason at all. If rockstar would actually do what they say and sort that trash out so they aren't mixed in with those just trying to play it would be nice. But I think the VIP missions may have added more fuel for it as it encourages EVERYONE to go chasing down these groups and their crates etc. to get money and RP. Another annoyance you may find is that those with higher RP (Reputation Points) which is used more as a leveling system have MUCH more health and are alot tougher and resillient than those with lower RP.. So the same bullet will do MUCH more damage to a new player's body and pretty much kill them instantly but STRANGELY.. you could probably shoot a higher lvl (HIGH RP) player several times with same bullets and have hardly any effect stacking the deck in their favor adding to their grief killing spree tendencies. Horribly unbalanced in that respect. Still those horrible balancing aspects aside. Can be pretty fun to play and good graphics if your rig (computer) can handle the higher settings (which many can't). Myself I risk game crashes by using settings higher than recommended using more memory for the asthetic beauty and immersion that it adds. I don't like seeing fuzziness or square pixelation on my screen.. it drives me crazy! so I run on higher settings and deal with the consequences.. GOOD LUCK. Oh.. another negative though I still recommend the game... is VERY HEAVILY Pay 2 win. Everything is rediculously expensive (a paper bag for a mask will cost you $1500 dollars. Yes you heard me that thrown away paper bag from buger shot or cluck'n'bell that you poked eye holes in to make a mask for you to rob a convenience store in.... cost you $1.5K .. Not quite sure why you can't just make your own from the dumptster outside.. but hey... Rob 2 convenience stores &amp you can afford it. Wait... what?.. yep.. it will take 2 store robberies to pay for the paper bag you used as a mask to rob them. As for appartments and cars.. SUPER costly. But it's ok you can just PLOP DOWN REAL CASH for Sharkcards through their store. Or.. you can grind it out until you have enough money to buy stuff on your own. Hence the P2W downside. Alot of cool perks are P2W targeted like military vehicle help that cost you millions but you don't get to keep.. so you have to spend each time you want it etc. Which is why you'll just see me on a cheap a$$ motorcycle... getting gunned down by players hiding in their armored vehicles impervious to me. (like it mattered... because I was exposed and not trying to shoot them anyway when I was gunned down like an evil clown). So that's my personal experience with the game. Hope yours is better.,Grand Theft Auto V

So how are they any better than online modders?Other games companies have a free attitude towards singleplayer modding as long as the person doing it realises that any modded version of the game that has problems is not the responsibility of the devs. As long as that message has gotten across then what do the devs care what people do with their game in singleplayer? Besides we as customers purchase the game. Just like anything else you buy ownership in a sale transfers to the person buying to do with as they wish.

Take Two and their subsiduary Rockstar Games are trying to pad their own pockets even more by requiring the most prominent mod in their most popular game which is currently the fourth best selling game of all time to cease and desist. This is a serious blow to the freedom of the single player community as mods are one of the only reasons I likely many others purchased this game. Furthermore this is a statement by the producers of this game and all other games that they currently own including games like Kerbal Space Program that they do not care about us the gamers and loyal customers who have already paid at least $60 for the right to play this game.

2016-11-25,0,0,198,False,Not Recommended,"Buy Only for singleplayer.Online sucks. unlike most i dont have a whole speech about how i got banned. That didnt happen. What did is that the way they have the entire system set up is that you have to make money entirely from heists. Any attempt to actually enjoy the executives mode or biker mode are ruined by the playerbase that has collectivly decided that anybody attempting to anything but shoot each other is a bad thing and target you and anybody working with you. While i understand that the ability to interfear with those things is a part of it being targeted by jets and people with armored vehicles over crap that costs less than the ammo they waste to do it has ultimately ruined online mode for me. Things would be different if those things were available in private or friend only modes. But with them being limited to the public mode only you need a huge team of people and literally a fighter jet just to be able to move the smallest amounts of crap for said modes. ultimately limiting those modes to people that have either bought so much in game cash that they dont need to Modders (Which dont get banned for some reason yet normal people do. Weird.) or said jerkoffs who have made it so people like me who want to sit down and play the game without having to arrange a literal military escort not want to even touch said modes. Along with the fact that you more often than not get shot on sight make the whole ""online experince"" feel like a place you have to throw money into just to watch it burn.EDIT Over the release of the last couple DLCS ive began to notice a trend that rockstar pushes cash cards over actually gameplay with most of the dlcs slowly turning into.Go to Factory/Office/BunkerOrder suppliescollect suppliesAvoid s because of the emphasis on blowing up each others stuff to encorage loss of incomesomehow make get there.Wait foreverdeliver said br&gt Avoid s again because of the toxic communitymake a tiny sum of cash that frankly isnt worth all the time put into itSo in conclusionF*ck off rockstar.

Online mode is also great but can be a pain in the neck. Ever since biker update modder seems to be increasing. Of course you can always use a trick or two to create ""private"" public session but i recommend play in friend/invite only session with your friends. the downside is you can't do CEO and MC business' except VIP mission and MC wall mission and no random events. About the players it reflect the world perfectly. You can find not only nice people who willing to help and teach you a thing or two but also scumbags who like to kill you with no reason. From my experience the latter is unfortunately is increasing including modder.

Take Two took a look at those players who were responsible for their games continued popularity on twitch and youtube and gave them a giant middle finger. They've earned themselves a spot next to the grimers from EA and Activision that milk their viewers for money and continously disrespect and over their players.

The brazen nature of their hacking seems to suggest that R* isn't doing much regarding banning them. On top of this the community is incredibly toxic and makes playing thoroughly unpleasant. Also everything is geared towards getting you to pay for the in game money though the not so micro transactions or face a gruelling grind putting up with obnoxiously kids who are too young for the game and hackers spoiling that process.

Besides the Online updates after the Heist update has been rehash in new names. You grind hours to make a paltry 400k in 8 real hours while supercars jets and planes cost 4 20 times as much as that amount.

Which is basically impossible to get anyone that's confident or not trolling.They have destroyed the modern community in role playing community of FiveM. Ahmad I quite enjoyed laying because I didn't have to buy everything with physical money by buying Shark cards or grinding for ing weeks on end because I can only play maybe 4 hours a week.There are tons of other games out there and not this point I rarely pick up Grand Theft Auto V anymore. And if I do I'm playing story mode and it's modded so I can actually enjoy the vehicles that are added in the DLC.This bad review is more of a message to Rockstar and the publishers.

2017-06-15,0,0,1798,False,Not Recommended,"This is an update to my review as of August 25th 2017.I had hoped to modify this review to be more positive but Rockstar Games has again take moves that are abjectly anti consumer.Rockstar has made ""adjustments"" to the in game account balance of its players. THis is fine as an anti cheat measure if 1. Applied accurately.2. Applied in a timely manner.The fact of the matter is however R* is applying these adjustments to players as punishment for events out of their control. In January 2017 I was sexually assaulted by a Neo Nazi in game. I am not exaggerating this player was tattooed with Nazi symbols and his crew embled was the Nazi flag. He literally me by using mods to force certain animations on our characters while raining money bags.Now I'm not a sensitive person so of course I laughed my off while taking screenshots before moving along with my life.The story is to point out how immensely flawed Rockstar's online service is and the inherently faulty logic of adjusting a ""victim""'s account SEVEN MONTHS after an incident occurs. Suspiciously right before the release of what will undoubtedly be the most expensive DLC ever. Get your hands off our mods you dirty apes.Seriously though Rockstar's actions relating to GTA Online have been a downward spiral of anti player changes. From its inception two major issues have plagued GTA Online Matchmaking and cheating.The root cause of these issues is the P2P nature of the online service. The poor matchmaking and reliance on the connectivity of 3 27 strangers leades to the game's reputation of ""loading screen simulator"". Rockstar has not taken any steps to prevent online modding (""hacking"") instead preferring a punative approach by banning any user that signs in to GTA Online with modded files. With no ban appeal process there ""coincidentally"" also leads to increased sales.Thanks to allowing rampant in game ""inflation"" Rockstar has continuously pushed the monetary cost of new content introduced in DLCs. This has lead to a viscious circle where a user has the choice to benefit from a modder's ""generosity"" spend literally hundreds of hours repeating the same task or purchase Rockstar's ""Shark Cards"" which had NOT scaled up to the increased cost of items. A single car in GTA Online can now cost 80 USD. Every development decision is keyed towards selling Shark Cards.Now I refrained from posting my thoughts in this venue because as the unwilling beneficiary of illegitimate money I was still able to enjoy my time in GTA Online. But Take Two has just issued C&amp D letters against the developers of modding tools for GTAV. While I don't use these mods myself I strongly support open community development. It is unacceptable to litigisously attack independent mod developers whose work only enhances the game experience and ultimately drives sales.Shame on you Take Two and Rockstar.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,0,0,42,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto 5 is BRILLIANT and Addicting. It's one of the best 3rd Party games out there for the PC. The Best thing is that IT'S NOT GIMPED. Heck from what I've seen this game is SUPER optimized now I'm not saying your toaster can play this game but by golly you probably could try and the game could be playable. At least from what I've seen. The Scaling is much better than what GTAIV offered anyway. Going from Controller to Keyboard is seemlessly easy but I find myself using the Keyboard and Mouse more than the Controller because it's SO MUCH FUN with it. Some might find Driving to be better with a Controller but I don't find it any more difficult than walking in this game although that's probably because I've been playing with mostly my Razer Tartarus and Naga for the most part. There are some things that are different from this version than the Console Version for one you can have a Custom Radio Station. This isn't just playing Music from a folder or Steam Music. No it's an ACTUAL Radio Station in the game. They even added Commercial Breaks News Breaks and a DJ for the Station as if the Music was MEANT to be in the game. So you can put the entire Vice City Soundtrack or Parts of it and Rock on Driving around GTA V but hearing the good ol' Flock of Seagulls as you do it. It's freakin' awesome.The Online Portion is neat too as if the Game didn't already offer COUNTLESS HOURS of Gameplay from the Single Player Campaign now you can do all of that over again WITH YOUR OWN CUSTOM CHARACTER. Now this was in the console release but this time the online portion is COMPLETE. That's right no more Delays We have Heists Team Deathmatch Races and more. It's amazing. The Game also has this App you can download from the iTunes or Google Play store to upgrade your Dog or Do GTAOnline stuff but It's not required if I remember correctly I hardly used it. In fact I rarely used Chop if at all during my main playthrough on the PS3 but he's there if you want to use him but keep in mind to ""train"" him you MUST use the App as there really isn't any other way to do it in game (to my knowledge). Overall this is a GREAT game for the PC and it's not in any shape way or form gimpped and stripped down of features from the Console version. I would go as far as to say that this is the DEFINITIVE way to play the game. It is by far the Best version of Grand Theft Auto V bar none. If you don't have this game GET IT!

So i have to go to singleplayer (loading time) and then start my private session again (loading time).If you want something nice in Multiplayer get ready to grind some money in the same mission over and over again. Or you can just BUY MONEY. I m serious buy money for a game that allready costs 60 .So you pay about 15 for a car that costs 1.25m$. And you didnt even get the chance to customize it.Also singleplayer gets boring after about 6H when the story is done. And no its not easy to mod the game anymore since the DEVS actually think that this was a good idea.Please don t buy that game. If you still wanna play it. Crack it somewhere and go for Singleplayer.

2017-06-15,0,0,129,False,Not Recommended,"Now as you probably have figured from other reviews posted Take Two has just basically killed and buried the GTA V modding scene by sending a cease and desist letter to the (former) popular modding tool OpenIV. The creators of OpenIV were basically forced to take down to download.Yes they could have taken it to court and probably would have won the case but to do that to restore a status quo would be a waste of their time.So you're probably asking what does this mean to me? If you had no intentions of modding the single player content probably nothing since online ""mods"" (aka hacks) did not have anything to do with OpenIV and OpenIV was specifically designed to only work in offline and to automatically disable online functionalities if you had mods.On the other hand if you had hoped that you could do basically anything extra in offline say bye to that with OpenIV taken from us there will be a large migration time to another modding tool and (I think) many modders won't or can't put the time and effort to basically rebuild their mods. So at least for the time being you can't be a part of LSPD or participate in ANY other wonderful things that the modding community had made.Lastly I would like to thank all previous/current/future (If there will be any) modders for their wonderful efforts to make this game a better and a longer experience. The time you spent on your mods is invaluable but rest knowing that me and many other individuals in community have enjoyed your creations.

But I'm sorry to say that ends here. I cannot support a publishing company that is so greedy enough to with peoples hard dedicated work just because they aren't making a profit out of it. Did they really think that doing this will make more people actually play online and purchase their stupid shark cards. What about the hundreds of creators on youtube and across social media who use single player mods to entertain and make great videos. If you wanted to make change happen throughout GTA 5 Take Two congratulations you have. Just not in the way you think. Now less people will be playing GTA Online and any other game you have but there will be more hacking in Online due to retaliation.

2017-06-18,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V never really caught me with its multiplayer. Ideally this was a game that seemed like it would be enjoyable but you quickly find out that the MP is a grind fest. Having fun and dicking around is no longer the name of the game. Loading times are also EVERYWHERE. An SSD is a requirement! Add on the fact that you can pay straight up real life money for in game currency which is simply a disgusting system to scrap up more money. I play video games for fun not to slog through BS to play what I payed for or hell pay MORE just to keep up. They can claim this was done to make producing more content for the game a viable option but I refuse to accept it. The additions to the game (basically a bunch of models with simple stat changes or the bank heist mode and biker gangs) are weak and honestly rather pointless in my eyes. The best part is that none of this is even added into the single player mode. (Which was SUPPOSED to get more content but never did....hmmmm)Now with the recent drama of Rockstar taking down the modding of single player we've lost another piece of what made this series so great. The company has become money hungry and lost the soul of caring for its fans. Everything is just another paycheck.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's riddled with hackers the community is extremely toxic it's painfully slow (and frequently breaks) and the UI and method for connecting with others is absolutely the worst. Add to that the fact that you can't play by yourself or with a group of friends because certain activities require you to be in a public lobby.It's a damn shame MP is so awful because they genuinely have some neat activities. But when it takes 30 minutes (I'm being hyperbolical but it is an inordinate amount of time) to load and connect and then has to take another 30 minutes to load and connect every time you want to do something? No thanks. When in game resources cost extravagant amounts of money that you can't readily earn in game (and you're constantly reminded that R* is willing to sell you in game cash for real money making this a pay to win title)? No thanks. When matchmaking and event lineups barely work if at all? No thanks.

They even wrote code to try and despawn cars that are spawned in single player. It's a great looking and playing game but the fact that literally everything that is fun in the game is paywalled with shark cards. No rockstar your missions heists and events are not fun to grind.

Along with that Rockstar or should I say TakeTwo no longer cares about their playerbase and instead of providing quality content they release a quantity of online DLC which is sub par and intentionally make it expensive as TakeTwo realizes they can use GTA Online as a cash cow through microtransactions. On top of that TakeTwo has issued a cease and desist letter to OpenIV which was a mod manager that has been around for 10 years for GTA V and GTA IV their reason? It affected online which is a blatant lie OpenIV is mainly used for single player mods that deal with graphic enhancements and other things related to single player which is automatically blocked by Rockstar if you try to go on GTA Online. There are still mod menus and people cheating online as you dont even need OpenIV for mod menus. So due to Rockstar or TakeTwo screwing the mod community which is a huge reason why people even bought GTA V on PC as well as not taking preventative measures for mod menus along with turning GTA Online into nothing but microtransactions I cant recommend this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

While Rockstar makes great content the way in which Take 2 (the publisher) monetizes it is nothing short of egregious.If you buy this game you'll get about a 20 hour campaign (main and side missions) and get some basic satisfaction out of it. Maybe worth $35.00 in my personal opinion.After the single player is complete then the ""real"" fun begins... online. But... wait... what are these Shark Cards? Oh you know unbelievably expensive ways to convert your real hard earned 9 to 5 cash into worthless digital currency. So... if you don't have a job that provides you lots of burnable cash run.But wait you might say this cash can still be earned legitimately in game right? Sure! Just spend hours upon hours of your time in which your time (at the minimum wage equivalency just to give the benefit of the doubt in the game's favor) causes you to spend more money on the game than you would have with Shark Cards. (You know what they say time money.)But this cash must be required to keep the game going right? It's not feeding some excessively greedy money hoarding in excesses so large it's not possible to reinvest it all back into the development of the company right? Even Take 2 said they're really ""under monetizing GTA V"" so... they're probably taking a loss right?$500 million in microtransactions per year. No there is no way to spin that.Adios ya dopes.

In order to enter this private lobby option you'll have to go to story mode then pause the game and go to the online tab. if you go straight into online you'll end up in a public lobby with hackers/modders ruining your session their bugs stand between session so you better restart the game if you entered a public lobby cause it will bug even your story mode if you don't restart the game.Rockstard please put your public lobbies in quarantine negate acess do like umbrella corporation did with raccoon city throw a missile there destroy it.

I also imagined first person camera will be on par with others ""old action games"" but it far far behind. On plus weapons attachments because it makes game more challenging and keep you watching if there is any upgrades to your favourite G36 like a silencer or extended magazine. Definitely I would call ""GTA Online"" as a ""Loading mode"" because most of the time you might see a screen with a spinner in bottom left corner. I wasn't expecting much from players behavior but for role playing servers known from SAMP there is a lot of differences. Missions in Online are okay but again they are rarely free mode but rather focused on co play with others. And in single player I would say missions were boring and after completing the story you don't have much to do so... yup it is boring.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-23,0,0,578,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly I don't like jumping on these hate bandwagons and I've played and loved gta 5 since it first launched on the last gen consoles back in 2013. That is without saying that the decision by take two of taking down OpenIV was terrible for the consumer and for their company.I seriously don't understand what their hopes were with banning SINGLEPLAYER mods they weren't taking away revenue I'd say mods gave people more reason to buy the game. However it's not exactly impossible to use mods still you can download OpenIV from https //www.gta5 mods.com/tools/openiv and use it like you normally would. The only issue is the obvious absence of support and updates making modding much more difficult. I can imagine eventually there would be huge compatibility errors with OpenIV and Gta 5 stopping mods from working as a whole.Now I still would recommend this game if you weren't planning to mod singleplayer and just wanted to play the multiplayer however unless you plan on grinding for hours upon hours using hacks or spending more on shark cards than the game costs you aren't going to make much progress online. As Gta online has progressed the prices of the new so called ""free"" dlc items have become unattainable through usual money making methods in a way to make you buy shark cards. In the new gun running dlc pretty much everything is upwards of a million and a shark card worth a million will cost you about 12. And I can see the prices of new dlc items going up much more as well.In conclusion Gta 5 is still a very great game with an amazing story mode but it would seem impossible for a new player to make reasonable progress online unless you can find a hacker or download hacks yourself and give yourself the money or buy a huge amount of shark cards.",Grand Theft Auto V

However that is not to say the game is without flaw. Starting fresh online is not an easy task and missing even a couple updates can put you at an incredible disadvantage for example R* came out with the Gun Running update a few days ago from when this post was written and there are already an incredible amount of people running around in online with explosive ammo thermal scoped heavy sniper rifles waiting to gun any person or vehicle down in only a shot or two. Now imagine being a brand new player and being thrown into a new lobby where every other player is abusing the meta which you are millions of ingame dollars away from so you have the choice to grind or buy shark cards.

Now there's a cease and desist for the biggest modding engine in the game that almost every mod runs on. They're saying that modding the games we bought is illegal.

Since Rockstar is all about GTA V Online now they've stopped giving a about singleplayer so playing the same thing over and over with no change and no new content becomes really repetative. I like many others are very dissapointed in both Rockstar and Take Two for getting rid of modding in their games something that we all enjoy doing. I bought this game THREE times once on the PS3 again on the PS4 and once more on the PC BECAUSE OF THE MODDING OPPERTUNITY. Thoughout this time mind you no singleplayer DLC has ever come out.

2015-11-11,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is essentially two games. There's singleplayer which is alright for a few hours of fun and then there's online which is completely broken and unplayable. Across both the driving and exploration is fun the selection of cars are cool and even if gimmicky I have to give due credit to the enormous array of mini games and random side content that a lot of games are lacking these days. In particular the radio's commercials and announcements are a treasure trove of quality comedy entertainment. That said these simpler things that keep you satisfied for a short time are what might earn my recommendation for a $20 game not a $60 one.Specifically for each mode Story mode or singleplayer follows three characters. One is bland one is very well developed and somewhat likeable and the other is just stupid. It seems like the writers went to great lengths to continuously push Trevor's psychopathy past the limits of coherence to prove how edgy he is and considering his awful babble is present in over a third of the game it puts you off pretty fast. I don't mean that he's offensive and crude (though more on that if you read on) he's just poorly written and comes across as what a 12 year old wannabe bully with no real concept of the world thinks is the ideal alpha male. Constant insults and forced innuendo that don't even make sense toward his loyal (for some reason) goons lack of any perceivable motive or personality besides trying to be hardcore and subpar acting are just the surface. It would not be too much further a stretch for parnetheses to show up on your screen whenever he appears that say ""Please remember player this man is edgy."" the game tries so hard to get this idea across. He's hardly the only one either as Franklin's compadres in his side of the story drive it from average to ridiculous and juvenile in short order as well with similar lack of any real personality. The third character Michael's genuinely interesting story was enough to keep me engaged for a while but the final straw for this game's story came for me when a government official enlists the help of a random stranger he doesn't know (Trevor) to help him torture some guy in a warehouse for information he probably doesn't have. Not the worst story arc in itself but the fact you must play through this in graphic detail as you waterboard shock and maim someone confirmed in my mind that Rockstar has put aside their past approach of making a good game that might unfortunately come across as offensive to some in favor of making an intentionally offensive game that accidentally might be good. The hype and the sales this game has when it essentially boils down to a fluffed shock value gag is unreal. I'll take a page from their book and make sure there's no ambiguity with what I'm trying to say the story is trash.Multiplayer could have been fun as the positive elements of the game mixed with friends seemed like it had a lot of potential. Within a few minutes of joining a lobby however I witnessed a hacker infinikill someone who apparently him off while two other players casually discussed in the public chat which script menus they were using and that the two week ban one of them just returned from was such a drag. I have been playing games online consistently for years across many systems and have only ever once up until that point personally encountered a hacker/scripter. That was in an alpha for an indie game that cost $10. This AAA title managed to triple that number in half an hour. They say no mods online but they clearly don't put much effort into enforcing it. It's one of the most purchased games on Steam so I guess they've just said ""Who cares?"" at this point and have called it a success.Just skip this game.",Grand Theft Auto V
2016-06-30,0,0,175,False,Recommended,Pros It's quite a good game and the effort for Rockstar to always update the game and fix the optimization issues is wonderful.Although it does not have a big phenomenal impact like San Andreas did it still worth the money. Cons The online content is a bit dull and the presence of modders might ruined the online experience. It's nothing much you can do when you're online except for racing shooting people and changing clothes.

2016-01-11,0,0,447,False,Not Recommended,"Not recommending this game was a tough decision tipped in that direction mostly by price if money is not an issue for you then the game may be worth the price just to see the stunningly detailed world of Los Santos. This was my first hands on experience with GTA though by no means the first I'd heard of it it simply wasn't a thing that peaked my interest several of my friends and my sister however were massively excited for the pc port and talked me into purchasing the game. A $60 Triple A purchase isn't something I've been capable of doing without budget tweaking in years though so the game was a massive risk for me and I knew that going in. After 200+ hours and 80 ish levels of discovering and learning the world of GTA and Rockstar my thoughts can be summed up thusly. I'd never thought I'd use the words beautiful jaw dropping and stunningly gorgeous so many times when referring to Grand Theft Auto nor did I think I'd use ""tedious"" and ""grindy"". Here's a few more of my thoughts in no particular order. Holy crap the people that rail against this game as the beacon of societies moral degradation are even more idiotic than I thought they were to begin with. We spent half out time doing missions and half our time doing the same kind of silly stuff you'd see Achievement Hunters or other Lets Players doing I'm not sure how dropping boats on roofs with cargobobs is turning me into a psychopath but okay. Rockstar deserves every bit of praise they get for being legendary world builders. There just are no words for what they've done here and everyone should take a spin around Los Santos and Blaine County. Rockstar's business practices are a little shady at times. (recently the steam ""Sale"" where they jacked up the price to $80 then cut it back to $59 and threw in a shark card also the shark cards in general. Money is the whole point of the game that is the definition of pay to win in a full price release no less) Rockstar does not know how to MMO particularly not for sustained player interest. Nor do they know how to control the rampant hacking OH GOD the hacking. It would double the lenght of this already dreafully long review to go into how bad the cheating is and the equally terrible response to it. That last bit being my major disappointment in the game. Doing a bit of research and you'll find thread after thread reddit after reddit of people saying the same thing the game is gorgeous and right on the cusp of being referred to in the same vain as Skyrim or Azeroth or any other world you'd want to return to time and time again and god do I want to love it but it gets so tiresome. There's a reason why there's only tens of thousands of concurrent players and not hundreds. The best paying missions in the game give $20 ish thousand dollars and the heists $200k. There are only 5 heists and the likelihood is you'll want to grind Pacific Standard until your eyes bleed. Also you can't die and need four people for the heists. If you die you'll have to start the whole 20 minute shabang all over again. So if you don't have a dedicated team or you aren't very good then you'll be stuck with grinding $20k missions. Most of these mission take 5 minutes or less making the burnout that much faster. The base content in the game is pretty easy to get I had a high end apartment after my first day but both the new content that's added regularly (cars and clothes) and the stuff there to act as long term goals can top $5 million. There's a reason the shark cards exist and money cheats are absolutely everywhere in public lobbies. Rockstar has said that they won't be adding new heists at least not anytime soon as they are difficult to produce. Which really is the crux of the issue. Your main goal in the game is to make money and level up to do that you need to do missions there are other ways to gain xp/money but the amounts are trivial much like repeating the starting missions over and over you'd be holding yourself back and grinding even more. There are 70+ missions in the game and only 3 of those are worth your time. Somethings not quite balanced there. I felt wrong complaining to myself for the longest time the game has so many missions and this huge world that everyone else is having fun in why am I bored? And then it hit me every other great mmo out there has meat to it because of it's side activities whether it's crafting or exploring or building so on and so on. GTA has these to an extend you can arm wrestle your friends or play a round of golf or tennis. You can go to your apartment and watch the chaos on a public lobby unfold below you if spectating is more your style. With the exception of the last one it's all very hollow there's no reason to do any of it more than once for the novelty. I think therein lies my problem the game is frustrating because it's hollow. Like the city itself it's a beautiful shell that you want to be immersed in you want to love but in the end you can't and that to me is infinity more frustrating than playing a terrible game. Sadly I think the truly immersive MMO's out there have spoiled me and the world of GTA just seems shallow and repetitive to me.",Grand Theft Auto V

Hope whatever money exchanged hands and is in your pockets was worth killing the single most enjoyable thing about your games. User created mods fix your games' weak points and make them more enjoyable and customizable people buy this game to mod it. The mods make your game 2x more fantastic. Now you just lost your entire fanbase. Mods are already restricted to single player. Hackers using mods online have been violating terms of service since day 1. Now we all have to pay for this rediculous and spontaneous claim to shut down modding. Hope you enjoy losing a large amount of future profit. Check out that Steam rating you deserve worse.

2016-02-16,1,1,76,False,Not Recommended,Meh. It is a beatiful sweet lookin game with brilliant gunplay sounds graphics mechanics .... but ... Multiplayer. I dont think that there are any more hackerless servers in the world tbh. There is always that one dude either dropping moneybags on top of everyones head or in the worse scenario dropping nukes everywhere and thus making your multiplayer experience that much better. Honestly .. why should you even play heists for as little as 400 000 dollars when there is a dude that gives you bambbschillion dollars in few seconds. Playing with random players on random sessions is no fun. On the other hand friend sessions can be entertaining and fun. As for me i dont recommend this game since i bought it to play multiplayer with my friends on public sessions but i ended up playing on private sessions with my friends because i dont like getting killed every couple of minutes by that one dude with a magical ability to kill everyone in the server in a split second or god mode jet pilot. No idea why cant rockstar buy normal anticheat or something that works. To sum it up with a question ... Should i buy it ? Yes unless you want it just to play multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

The prepare to die in online mode because everybody is at least a level a 100 and has fully upgraded weapons and hydra's. Online is filled with s who literally can't control themselves around a player and not kill them. Everybody uses homing launchers. Has a tricked out ride. And a million sticky bombs. And if you retaliate. They get all pissy and will not leave you alone for the rest of your time playing. Online is a filled with hackers and modders. But most of the time they're cool and just spawn in money. Although you can get banned for picking it up. Which has not happened to me but has happened to other people who have written reviews. If you're looking for a review for the single player. I'm gonna make it quick. It gets boring as soon as you get to play as Trevor. It's funny but repetitive and garbage. I only bought this game for online. A lot of people changed the reviews for this game to bad reviews because of the modding situation. I could honestly care less.

Gta 5 multiplayer cashgrab they should honestly rename shark cards to whale cards because that is how rockstar sees you as some casino whale they can squeeze every last penny out of. Every new update has several vehicles that are in every way better than what has been out previously but ofcourse these new vehicles come with a price tag anywhere between 1 and 5 mil and guess what? 71 euro for 1mil ingame. Besides the cash grab online has had issues with hackers for the longest time do you enjoy getting randomly blown up along with everyone else on the server? play some online. Okay lets ignore freeplay and do some races against 5mil custom vehicles that you have no chance of winning against.Be warned though because your loading screen is going to take about 30 minutes but atleast when all the custom cars leave you in their dust you can have a cruise around the city because for some stupid reason the game loads the entire map for every single race ever wondered why the loading screens are 30 min?

Needless to say I would've expected Rockstar would do something regarding hackers who ruined the free sessions. This is a major problem that was meant to be fixed however lately I noticed the hackers decreased considerably in the lost couple of months that's due to rockstar doing their job. I appreciate all the free DLC's which kept this game going for the last 4 years . I would rate the graphics 9/10 especially if you play on 4K monitor the image quality is quite stunning.

2018-02-20,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,Honestly I've sunk a fair amount of time into this game and at it's current stage cannot recommend it.TL DR The multiplayer is what bogs this game down. The single player alone may be worst picking it up on sale.If you are buying this game for the single player only you may be satisfied. Rockstar brings the high level of polish and quality you have come to expect from them. The main reason I am reviewing this game negatively is the multiplayer and boy where do I start.This games multiplayer is custom tailored to try and make you buy Shark Cards. If you do not pay for real world money you will grind and grind and grind for more money in heists and missions (or more recently in CEO and faction missions in the over world). It is a ridiculous time sink if you do not pay money. The most interesting things in the game (helis tanks etc.) are extremely expensive. Hiests are gated by having high end apartments which will take the new player forever to unlock. The progression from rags to riches in this game is rough.The grind may be bearable though if the multiplayer was implemented correctly which it unfortunately is not. I have never seen a game implement multiplayer so oddly before. It is as if Rockstar purposefully ignored all major lessons learned by multiplayer games in the last ten years. I'll list some major things out... Loading into a free roam takes ages and the game forces you to do this when you disconnect from an instanced matchmaking game. Every time. There are 3 independently developed user interfaces for doing missions/etc the in game phone the ESC menus and standing on their mission location in the over world. This leads to some confusing methods for setting up a game. Disconnects. It is impossible to do hiests with anything other than a dedicated hiest party (like in Discord). If ANYONE disconnects the mission halts. You literally cannot complete hiests without the dedicated number of players. And these missions are often LONG and DIFFICULT. Instanced matches (like for TDM) end with a randomly generated list of new matches at the end for players to pick through. Without giving the players the option of a map vote. So I hope you RNG the map you want to play next. Hackers and banning. Hackers plague the online free roams and often mess with other players (i.e. teleporting you etc.) They can also give you money (against your will) which is a bannable offense for YOU! And good luck pleading that with Rockstar. Game requires Rockstar Social Club membership in which you can also do game invites! How many interfaces to they need! This is also where you will friend people you meet but you have to do it through their overlay (again another menu). Inviting people to matches. The hosting interface tries first to pull interested people from your current free roam. Which suprise nobody is ever interested because they are currently playing the game. If you DC in a free roam the game will load you into single player! Which takes just as long and can lock you in story mode cutscenes depending on your progression in the game. The you have to load BACK into free roam and guess how long that takes.I probably have more to say but I'll end my rant there. And most of my gripes are not system related as I have a very powerful PC.,Grand Theft Auto V

The GTA that we all will remember as being THE GTA.Grand Theft Auto was always some kind of magic formula for me. I love GTA series overall. I played countless hours in GTA III VC SA. Less on IV and V. Therefore 3D era will be in my heart forever. 100% completion of each of 3D era GTA is A MUST to get best experience.Now lets get to bad apple GTA Online.Online is a place where a person who bought a ""Starter Pack"" with most expensive ""Shark Card"" (which is a bad trade to be honest) can obliterate you in a ""press X"" fashion. While you a player with more than 1k+ combined hours of gameplay on oldgen and nextgen GTA V/Online can do nothing. That is called ""Orbital Cannon"". Want to do same to your opponent? Welp best hope is to get some sweet microtransactions to go as grinding will increase your hour count by more than it must.And i am genuinely disappointed because of all this militarized vehicles and futuristic nonsense. It is just infuriating when you drive your sweet top range car on export mission and some player flying over on deluxo shooting homing missiles at you. GTA was already a parody on real life but was in a borders of real world stuff. In other words in our universe with all the social/political problems dialed all the way up. But this. THIS ONE IS JUST CRAZY.Modders are a problem. But not so much as griefers or KD freaks as R* give everyone an opportunity to successfully obliterate everyone with Opressor and Hydra esque plane. Just give them enough money and here you go! Your griefing tool will be delivered in no time. Thank you for using Pegasus Lifestyle Management.In conclusion every new car plane boat office weapon mod heist and pretty much everything including clothes (yeah CLOTHES) will cost you more with each next DLC.

It never fails to glue you to your seat and play till you get tired.That effect is achieved with very fluid gameplay and storyline (three characters with different levels of morale allow you to feel the game from multiple sides) and also by using online components.The down sides are the controls and wonky camera that got me killed a few times. Vehicle controls were made for controllers and mouse steering feels half broken. I also dislike responsivness of characters due to animation time that makes you feel frozen for miliseconds before you can take any action.It is a GTA game with its common flaws and up sides that has been pumped nearly to its maximum with unmatched amount of actual entertainment value.

If you don't pay attention to those and don't activate the correct settings for your hardware IE GPU Your game will stutter. Other than that! IF get your settings correctly run the game it's frickin' beautiful. IF you can activate your dang DX11 the game turns up the awesome possum visuals. Personally I don't get the chance to play a whole lot because of college. This game is addicting and very fun This is why I haven't played much. Never tried online yet but I'm kind of waiting to complete the game first. This game also triggers deep emotional states such as aggressive road raging cursing laughing so hard you almost really die cry (either deep down inside or deep on the outside) several WTF moments thrills and other emotional experiences. There's a lot I MEAN A LOT TO DO in this game. Most of the negative reviews are because some can't figure out their PCs hardware stuff stuttering and so forth. Just think of those people as console peasants that are struggling to join the PC Master Race. This game is lit. 10/10 I plan on an instructional video at some point showing how to gain a constant FPS without dips or stutters. Until then here is what YOU can do to make the game run For STARTERS 1. Go to Control Panel2. click on Hardware and Sound3. click on NVIDIA Control Panel4. click on Manage 3D Settings5. Find Grand Theft Auto V (gta5.exe) IF you don't have the game in the drop down menu then ADD it to the menu.6. NEXT you need to use these specific settings IF you run SLI message me for a fix. 3D SETTINGS for GTAV Maximum pre rendered frames ...1 Power management mode...Prefer Maximum Performance Shader cache...On Texture filtering Anistrophic sample optimization...Off Texture filtering Negative LOD bias...Clamp Vertical Sync...Adaptive7. Click Apply and exit out of NVIDIA Control PanelMy in game graphical settings will be something that I will have to post on my profile.

Grand theft auto as much as id love to give a history lesson and mention the old days of 2D or the ""Manhunt"" series i wont bore you with that. If you dont own this game yet then you need an honest description of what it is and what it is not. What it is Grand theft auto 5 is an open world playground sim with a criminal backdrop and story. It is a game about doing crazy things in vehicles with the third person shooter aspect being a sideline and not as refined as the vehicle portion (Which is what one would expect from a game titled Grand theft auto) The storyline of GTA5 is heralded as one of the greatest in the series and of many games period and it is good no lie the characters are made up of people who are painfully relateable while still matching the series out of proportion style. The radios all play good real life music with commercials being farces of things ""PLAY SLAUGHTERHOUSE 5 ITS LIKE SLAUGHTERHOUSE 4 BUT WITH A 5 IN ITS NAME AND MORE EXPENSIVE"" That Kinda thing the game is not in the slightest bit serious. GTA online is the real gem for people like me who like open world multiplayer with a vast array of jobs and heists for you and your mates its hard to get bored (After the first few levels of doing nothing but ripping off 7/11's) the character and vehicle customization isnt the best of any game ive played but all are above par. and you will feel very cool being whatever kind of criminal you see yourself as from the executive who is corrupt to high heaven to the thug on the street this game's online portion is incredibly satisfying in the customization department. The missions are varied and fun ranging from hits to repos to jacking planes or attacking military bases to even heists that have multiple stages. What it is NOT GTA 5 and online both are fun playgrounds for you to go and blow things up or run from the cops in but they are not some things youd expect from a game reportably about crime. There is no stealth in these games sans for being able to ""hide"" from the cops in a wonky system where you get a metal gear style radar on your screen and have to avoid randomly spawning policemen to shake them. Theres no sneaking into a job or quietly taking enemies down (A system for this does exist but doesnt work at all) Once you kill someone every enemy is a terminator with a laser gun that can shoot you in the head from another car or from a half mile away this is not a game to buy expecting actual criminal work or stealth this is a playground. In multiplayer you are always designated by a blip on the radar totally disabling your ability to hide or blend in from other players (30 people in a sandbox filled with roaming civilians and you cannot hide among them) and this system only helps the bullies of servers because they basically get freely marked targets. The game has a not at all working punishment system to try to deal with this that more often sticks the victims in the corner than the perps. My biggest peeve with gta lies here in a game about criminals and nice cars the multiplayer is basically call of duty with driveable tanks. theres no room for players wanting to play as hitmen or do deals or anything of the sort outside of jobs (Missions that only include your squad) the game is essentially a free for all with nothing to do with crime. No stealth no hiding from people being morons in public servers and very few jobs that allow players to truly interact on a real life crime basis mean that this game is firmly delegated to the playground style of games with old titles like mercenaries and saints row also filling this category. My personal biggest beef with this game is how not free you are. You cant make a private server with mods you can make private servers with the same rules as normal servers. You have a level creator and can only make races with it and deathmatches not missions. We have alot of awesome missions with objective that make it impossible to go at it any way but the way the devs want. ""Get diamonds"" missions has ""Approach this spot on foot"" ""Get diamonds"" ""Get in specific boat (not yours no other escape allowed)"" ""Drive specific boat on specific path to specific place"". For a game with so much customizing and different tools at your disposal the massive multitude of missions that dont let you use it at all is a huge bummer. You can call in special vehicles but cant choose where they spawn and they have very few spawn areas for them and all special vehicles are totally uncustomizable (Ones you have to call in using pegasus)And lastly the game devs support for modders is trash. In the eyes of rockstar developers modders are simply hackers with a nice name and instead of trying to create a community of modders they strike down any attempt to do so. A group of modders recently tried to create an alternate gta online client (which would still need gta to be purchased to use hence no ability to be used for piracy) and this independant client would allow mods in online and rockstar not only stopped the project but banned all members for life for their ""attempted aiding piracy"" My last beef with this game is tha utter ignorance of things that are not ""bugs"" but arent ""fixed or working"" parts of the game. You can buy all ammo for any weapon before any mission but cant buy a parachute or jerry can (and jerry cans disappear on death very often for no reason) desync bugs where your plane has exploded on your friends screen (and killed them) but you are fine have been there since day 1 and have not been addressed. You still cant start a private session while in gta online you have to exit go to singleplayer then select it. Rockstar's overall attitude towards its own game is a puzzling one as they add free dlc on a monthly basis but shun modders of any kind and pretend broken parts of the game are not there at all. Conclusion As i stated above most people own this game its a well known brand from a well known developer and if a big goofy playground with no stealth and wonky shooting physics and multiplayer rules suits you you will love it alot.Despite my few peeves this game is very special and I love playing it with my friends but we never join public servers and we all wish that stealth and more criminal ventures were possible in ""Freemode"" rather than being delegated to repeatable missions. And of course gotta hand it to rockstar for never charging a penny for the massive amount of content released for GTA online seeing a AAA title without DLC? Free updates? Priceless.",Grand Theft Auto V

But I think it was worth it I played it more then most of the other games I spent simmilar money on.I am not a huge fun of the online part mostly becouse of the amount of loading screen I have to watch but with friends it is fun and from time to time I log in and play.The single player part is fantastic I really enjoyed the story line and the caracters are much more engaging then the previous ones. My only dissapoitment is the lack of single player DLCs which would be much more wellcomed then the online ones. I'd even enjoy an update on single player AI and interiors plus some additional minigames like casino and so on and some content from the online.

2017-12-08,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,A 5 year old game that takes years to load just to be greeted by a bunch of moders and hackers in almost every gamemode. Slow grinding by which I mean doing the same heist over and over again or transporting stolen cars bunker stock etc. etc. It's very frustrating to actually get into a normal game and play.Most of the game is loading screens and if you dare alt+tab watch a video and be idle for longer than 1 second after an hour of loading screen time (sometimes when leaving a session it gets bugged and the game never loads) it kicks you of the server and you have to load all this crap all over again.The game just crashed as I am writing this. I would only recommend this for 15 or perhaps even less. 30% loading 30% trying to get into a lobby with all your friend as THERE IS NO PARTY SYSTEM 30% finding another lobby because the one you were just in was a modder and his friends having loads of fun taking a p s at you and at last 10% of some gameplay.Now a new problem emerges. After playing for 10 20 minutes the game crashes and says my game data is corrupted. I verified the data 5 times and reinstalled it once with no results. After this I decided to contact rockstar support. For some reason I can't reach rockstar support websites so I tried it on twitter where I was told to use their support website even though I told them that I can't connect to it. Eventually they told me to contact my ISP where I was told that there was no problem on their side. I have no idea what the problem could be and rockstar doesn't seem concerned with it at all so I am leaving this game since it's just a mess.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,63,False,Not Recommended,"If this was 2015 I would have recommended GTA V to you on the spot but as is I cannot recommend this game. The base game is fun singleplayer is a great ride but like all rides you eventually have to get off and when you get off you are greated with Online. GTA Online is the single most horrible gaming experience I've ever had. It took me three seconds to be attack by a hacker. When I then blew up the car the hacker was in (he promptly survived anyways) I was forced to empty my entire bank account to ""pay for damages"". What kind of buisness model is that?! A game about car chases and crime but if we destroy each other's cars we have to pay out of pocket. What's more Take Two has forced Rockstar to cut any extra single player content and instead work on making new stuff for us to spend money on in GTA Online. ""Oh you can buy a buisness now"" What does it do? ""Let's you buy more cars and a helicopter!"". There's no substance to GTA Online and it might as well have just been a matchmaking racing game since that's the only good part about it. This is coming off the heel of Take Two pursuing legal action against Open IV and failing to actually target hackers. It's the equivelent of blowing up any old mosque to kill ISIS.

By yourself there's nothing to do but luckily I have two friends to play with who make the matchmaking for heists bearable. Yes some people are but luckily there's an option to make yourself neutral I guess where no one can hurt you and vice versa. Money is not that hard to earn so don't buy those stupid shark cards for $100. Definitely not worth.

To top that it appears Rockstar's automated ban system is flawed as . People getting banned for no reason and whatnot. Anyway that does not mean that online mode is complete crap.

2017-06-15,0,0,343,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V is a fun and entertaining game. That is if you have a group of friends to regularly play with in a private session. I'll skip to a Pro/Con list because it's easier for people to skim. I'll post my long review at the bottom. If you have any questions feel free to PM me or comment I'll respond.Pros Entertaining Fun with a group of friends Customization for almost every vehicle and clothes. Fun races/stunts. Hours of fun___________________Cons Takes forever to get money to do anything. Laziness of devs to fix issues to improve the game. Shark Card farm. Take Two and Rockstar have taken up a position of Anti Modding which will eventually kill their game. Level Grinding is ridiculous. Poor decisions with content i.e. ""mini racers"" is only 4 people Shark Cards. Public lobbies are terrible. Everything in game is ridiculously expensive so they can sell shark cards. So much more..._________________Rockstar and Take Two repeatedly have shown little interest to actually improving the experience of players. This is seen in how much they push Shark Cards. Everything is ridiculously expensive money is a grindfest to get and every time they release a DLC they push more shark cards because everything is even more expensive. They make tons of weapons and vehicles out of reach of new players and force them to grind to ridiculously high levels to obtain. But then also make them expensive as hell so it takes even longer to acquire. Stunt races are a lot of fun especially with friends. But that's an idea they took from what people were doing with the default races and then decided to find a way to make some money off it. So they added in new stunt vehicles and then added in Rockstar created Stun Races which are fun but just another way to keep people playing without fixing the problems. Problems like open lobbies.There are so many problems with open lobbies. For starters if there's a hacker in the lobby you're in and they drop a ton of money for you. That can get you banned. Even if you're not intentionally picking it up or trying to get it. Then there are the real hackers who abuse aimbots god mode cheap vehicles and other cheats to teleport you around the map to die. Even if you're in your apartment they can still get you. There's a lot more but I genuinely just don't care. TL DR If you and a bunch of friends can get the game for dirt cheap get it. It can be fun. But I wouldn't pay anything over $25 for it and even still only if I had a ton of friends that wanted to play it together.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-10,1,1,269,False,Not Recommended,Gta V ONLINE is probably the grindiest game you'll ever play earning money in this game is damn near impossible and is centered around you spending real dollars to get in game cash via shark cards. Sure it's possible to get cool things without paying but it takes a ridiculous amount of time in doing so.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-14,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,Online Hackers completely ruin the online experience and almost make it unbarable I would say that in every online session there is at the LEAST one hacker. Typical hackers will spawn money on people taking away the point of earning your items other times they will just interfere with you trying to play the game i.e they will teleport you or clip through walls in passive mode and kill you. Eventually they get bored and leave and if you can deal with that then enjoy. Story mode Highly worthwhile to play and the attention to detail in the game is fantastic. However once you beat the game you are looking forward to the online play and it was AMAZING fun until the glamour of it was ruined by hackers. 60 dollars is actually a worthy asking price just for the single player alone. If Rockstar can figure out how to get rid of the hacker problem i'd say that this game would be almost perfect in every way shape and form.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-26,0,0,461,False,Not Recommended,03/2018. 457 HRS later. LVL 127. I was doing a Heist Mission with friends (Humane Labs Raid) when suddenly I was banned from the game in which I had done nothing wrong. I was on a mission and got banned for no reason. I never used any type of mods or cheating system in this game. To make it brief this game is a piece of trash the system is complete garbage no wonder there are so many modders Rockstar just wants to screw their loyal players. Oh and BTW during this time there was a random massive ban wave occuring in which I was a victim of. It seems that this ban wave is connected with the new DLC and Tunables update. As of writing this review there has not been any news nor statement from Rockstar ever since the start of the random ban wave (which was 48+ hrs ago). If this is not resolved in the upcoming days I will not buy another Rockstar game ever again.TLDR This game is complete trash! Do no buy this game! PeriodTo Rockstar Given that Rockstar is a company with a big reputation becuase of the past GTA games they have completely forgotten its player base and focused more on their microtransactions (shark cards). You have become so greedy you became so lazy rolling out half DLC content onto a game that is already 5 years old and that's on top of the random crashes this game currently has. They seriously has some quality control issues. If they're going to release a new DLC they should at least make sure that it is well tested and ready day one.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story... well kinda sucked in my opinion. I had a hard time relating to any of the characters unlike other GTA games where NIko and CJ became an extention of myself. The whole script left me feeling like I'm playing a bad written action movie with OKAY graphics. Yes just okay it all seems plastic and bright (Maybe they were going for that because it takes place in L.A.) Don't even get me stared on shark cards and the most Toxic gaming community next to League of Legends and call of duty.

2017-07-06,0,0,578,False,Not Recommended,This game was great at times but it has gone to When you PvP people complain about you when you die people laugh at you when you try to have fun a modder kills you (Rockstar hasn't done to remedy this). The most recent update gets rid of support for a common modding tool but this doesn't get rid of modders and cheats. They also added a flying motorcycle with rockets on it that nearly costs you GTA$6 million to get and have the rockets. Once the people get it there isn't a damn thing you can do to properly combat it and nearly everyone has it except the legitimate players. So now instead of just being greifed from the extremely common modder you also have to dodge flying fuc k ing motorcycles.I don't know what I'm going to do. This last update was the last straw.

2017-06-19,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,I have been playing this game across many platforms and still do to this day but now after hearing the news of mods being done for I am seriously apposed with the decision by take two and it makes no sense for this because people have been using openiv mods for ten years now and to see something this succesful just be washed away by a big company is really sad. I am making this review because I loved playing with mods in the single player and the mods simply made the game better. They would probably argue about modders in online but just step up your countermeasurS to prevent them. Just look at the gta modding community and see how passionate they are about what they create for the game. So with take two removing mods they just killed the game for many people and got themselfs a hole buttload of negative attention and it will affect them also without mods in this game it seriously detracts from playing it and for me it just lost about 30 bucks in value.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,233,False,Not Recommended,They banned mods for single player and multiplayer. Terrible idea! I can understand banning mods for online with the normal game but if people want to mod and have mods for an entirely different version of the game there shouldn't be a problem there. Combine this with the way Rockstar has changed and skewed the amount of money you earn for missions and I can't recommend it. When I first bought this game for PS3 it was pretty quick and easy to earn some fat cash. BUT over the years Rockstar kept changing the payouts so now you have to invest much more time to earn money. Combine that with the outrageous prices for vehicles weapons and outfits and it's pretty easy to see that this is all done to push the consumer to buying their Shark Cards. The game does run nicely but the banning of mods for single player is a deal breaker for me.,Grand Theft Auto V

Best GTA imo 3 protagonists keeps it fresh missions are fun the graphics are decent and the controls are ported well for the PC. Multiplayer is lacking a bit quite a few modders but still playable.

2017-09-01,0,0,1044,False,Not Recommended,I deleted and rewrote my review after 800+ hours of play I experienced enough to make me change my opinion. First off GTA V is one of the most sold videogame in history and there's a good reason for that the game is pure GTA style like its older episodes with improvements over improvements everything in single player is close to perfection but its dark side comes after you join the online part of the game. While it's still very well developed it's poorly managed and maintained featuring one of the worst ever communities absent support and human touch lack of effort to improve it. It's so hard to not recommend a masterpiece like this but I think Rockstar went a bit too far the online con's are more effective than the single player's pro's. Here's a shortened list of them.PROSGRAND THEFT AUTO The name says it all call it violent and controverse but the entire game series is just a masterpiece no PC versions ever failed to provide fun and freedom mixed with style. This game is the definitive version of GTA until the next one comes...SINGLE PLAYER This is the first GTA truly splitting the game in two single player and online. The single player is just as good as all other GTAs were back then great graphics nice story very good mechanics a lot of variety and longevity. Here's the masterpiece part of the game and totally worth to play!GAMEPLAY The gameplay is great overall and was improved a lot after GTA IV. It's more arcade but perfectly fitting into the game's action which was the smartest change to make it successful online too. It's always funny to drive around the city move and shoot on foot the new first person view is something to try at least once.GRAPHICS Looking very good even after 5 years from its release. Actually I can tell you its gfx engine works much better than IV and looking a lot better too!UPDATES AND DLC The game is constantly updated and the biggest updates (marked as free DLC) can add a lot of contents and new activities today's online is a very different game than Day 1 online and they are free! I loved the effort on adding new contents that's something rare to find even in online games less complete than GTA.CONSONLINE This is a sort of introduction to the next con's since they are online related. Most of aspects of Online are terrible one of my worst ever experience which is a shame due to the quality of the game itself. If GTA Online is half the price you pay (the other half being single player) the game is not worth to buy especially for Rockstar's strategiesCHEATERS AND COMMUNITY The game is a mess I used to play some free to play back then those f2p where banned cheaters could easily make a new free account and ruin the game to others. GTA's price is about 70$ full price and it has a worse anticheater and more cheaters. How's that possible? Even the servers are very slow and problematic no admins or GM anywhere that means pure anarchy and bullying in a public room full of cheaters you may be the one kicked out.BANS CUSTOMERS SUPPORT AND ANTICHEAT Here I had my worst ever experience a ban. I have never been banned from anywhere for over a decade I was shocked to find myself banned and given no reason. I can understand false positive bans happen but I was disappointed by the way they manage bans. Beside the many false bans cried all over forums you have no right to complain about it the customer support will just copy and paste the same answer claiming the anticheat does no mistakes bans can't be appealed and enjoy your ban. That's far from being a customers support that's called arrogance especially when the anticheat fails to get rid of real cheaters you are just a number with a wallet. I was eventually unbanned a week later that would have never happened if there weren't so many false bans that day which sounds to be the only way to communicate with Rockstar. I am very disappointed they give no informations about bans knowing if it was a program or a virus causing it would help everyone. GTA made billions with its sales how's possible they can't provide a decent anticheat and a better customers support with all these money? No free to play I played before were worse than this made me regret spending money on GTA and expecting higher quality.ROCKSTAR I have always considered Rockstar as good and smart as Valve when it comes to game developing I still believe Rockstar did great on past GTAs and single players but proved to be very bad and greedy as multiplayer hoster. No customers support arrogance over being always right very slow and laggy servers no administration schemes absent anticheat with cheaters spreading all over the place (and they are able to mess with your account and online permanence) very expensive cards. So far it's the worse company I experienced online and while I can understand they are new to multiplayer I will never accept their arrogance especially during my ban's experience. If I could still recommend the game for its single player I prefer not to recommend it because I don't think Rockstar deserves these money. That's so painful to say for a Rockstar's fan.JUMPING THE SHARK WITH VEHICLES Not as bad as the other problems but I believe Rockstar jumped the shark about vehicles and DLC. Even if past GTAs weren't the state of the art of realism they never featured flying jet bikes shooting automated rockets or an orbital cannon instantly killing anywhere flying cars Batmobiles cars with parachute. That's just too much and obviously added to make people buy them (or buy cards). Its multiplayer is already messed with the absence of admins and moderators it's completely ruined in anarchy with such stuff especially when it goes to cheaters too.Final word Dr Jekyll Single player and Mr Hyde online a masterpiece and a disaster I only recommend this game for its single player highly not recommended if you want to play online while my opinion was 50/50 I prefer to not recommend this game because I believe the company does not deserve these money. You can try to play online alone with your closest friends but you will always live with the fear of an unfair ban and a case closed mark on it.Feel free to comment if you want more details about my opinion and experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-25,0,0,349,False,Recommended,Single Player reviewDamn this was a great game to play though some kinda cringeworthy moments on 'sensitive' subjects but a gret story to keep you entertained. You got Mike an ex criminal with serious anger managemnet issues Trevor a trailer park resident with anger issues but a different way of dealing with them and Franklin who seems to be the only person with their head on straight.The graphics are breathtaking the city is alive (I took a taxi cab ride to a location whilst I was eating and watched cops chase people muggers etc around the city) the TV channels are amusing and again if you want something to watch whilst eating IRL this is a nice diversion. Go out hunting get attacked by Mountain Lions explore the wilderness in someone elses' 4x4 retrieve radioactive parts from the bottom of the sea tehre's always something you can be doing.I like the apprach they have to the game as well. In a couple of areas I was struggling to get though and noticed that when I re started at the checkpoint things got a little bit easier hell at one popint it gave me the option to skip. It's a nice touch that'll help people make it through the story even if they're not the best of the best gamers.One thing I will say is in SP don't bother storing cars or such as it doesn't save these like your personal vehicle and you can throw a lot of money at them to have it vanish after you leave it for a mission. Pimp out the characters' own personal vehicle and that'll stay with you.,Grand Theft Auto V

When you play this game in single player it really shines if you've never tried the multiplayer you will get immersed in the story and mechanics and come to love the game world. IF you find a multiplayer session with your friends and no hackers then you will enjoy some of the experiences you have together. GTA also releases quarterly updates that add new mechanics and a small ammount of new clothes. Great chaos and interactivity with the world create a good dynamic that really captures what GTA is.Bad Notice I say IF you find a session with no hacker. Hacking in GTA online is absolutely horrible almost any session you join that is public will have at least one and they can do anything they want. They can take your money and your levels blow up all of your things and they can get you banned. If you're banned due to a hacker YOU WILL NOT GET THE GAME BACK. Rockstar refuses to talk to anyone that has been banned they seriously have some of the worst customer service I've ever witnessed.Now I now your saying ""Well I'll just play in private games with my friends then."" I just wish that were the case but most of the games last 6 months of content cannot be accessed in private games. So you have to join public lobbys try to make money get hacked lose everything and the vicious cycle continues.Ugly Rockstars money grubbing policies are absolutely horrible they constantly try as hard as they can to encourage you to buy shark cards. Their latest scandal had me actually take the time out of my day to write this review though they have completely banned the single player modding community. Single player and Multiplayer are seperate communities. You have bought and paid for a video game you now own the game and can do what you want with it. According to rockstar you cant. So I'm refusing to be a part of that and cannot condone the game anymore because of it.If they reverse their last policy towards single player modding I will change this review. As you can see though theres still a decent list of problems when you dont even include it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-05,0,0,239,False,Recommended,All you people crying about the game being full price on the Summer Sale after being on sale for 10 20 minutes should direct your comments to Steam not Rockstar. Steam is not immune to making mistakes. In addition this is the most robust highly optimized game released on PC in a very long time &amp that's a simple fact. There's not many games released to date that can show you just what your graphics hardware is capable of better than GTA5. If all devs/publishers followed Rockstar's lead we wouldn't have release after release being made available to the masses. This game is worth every penny of the $60 it sells for and if I were Rockstar I'd never put it on sale. $60 is a VERY fair price for what you get (Shark card or not...) Compared to the gambit of available games on the market todaay GTA5 is probablly the best if you take graphics performance storyline charcter development etc. into account. The single player campeign is fun (hilarious at times) and never boring that's more than I can say for most recent games. I'm not a big fan of multiplayer so I appreciate a long and intresting single player campeign and GTA5 has it in spades. I highly reccomend this game. Well done Rockstar!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

They even said so in their own blog here http //www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52429/asked answered the rockstar editor gta online updatesThis game was enhanced with many mods including graphics mods to make the game look better and Take Two decided to kill off the mod community. Very nice.Modding controversy a side...This is the weakest GTA game in the series. The soundtrack is horrible the map may be the biggest map in GTA history but there is very little you can do in the map. It's just a big empty space where only a small fraction of it is interactive. What's the point of a big massive map if it is barely interactive? I rather have a smaller map with alot more interactive objects in it like how the older games had restaurants you can walk inside for example. The graphics are good and the game is a very good port but it becomes meaningless since the game seems boring with nothing really to do. There isn't even options to change the game's FOV since I prefer a wider FOV to help with motion sickness.As for GTA Online. The character creator is horrible. There is very little options to customize your character to make them look the way you want it. The interface is horrible with a ton of time wasted on waiting for other players and even then online is filled with trolls. The game also forces you to buy a shark card (microtransactions) to get ahead in the game since the other ways to make money in game is limited.Overall it's the worst GTA. You are better off finding a used copy of Vice City or San Andreas on PS2 or an original PC copy if you are lucky. Those are a much better GTA experience even with the removed songs due to licensing issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

Everything's alright in terms of gameplay and the PC version does offer very good looking graphical additions that the consoles do not. Even after having all this said I would've wanted to recommend the game but now I've changed my mind. The game isn't worth getting due to the turn they've taken with the online mode. It's practically just pay2win or grind for 100's of hours to get what you want. The singleplayer is not worth 60 usd alone since they've also refused to release SP DLC and instead focus on hoarding in money through ""free"" online updates that bring new cars/properties for millions of in game cash which you can buy for real money or grind a good 10 hours for one item. Also want to point out the fact that there are many ""hackers/modders"" in the online section giving players free money that they get banned for not the modder unless he's reported. So you're taking a risk by playing online you could be banned although innocent..Do not get this game unless you really want the Singleplayer experience.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-27,0,0,1179,False,Recommended,"PROS Single Player Story The story is fun engaging with several very interesting characters. Side missions tend to be very fun as well. Beautiful world There is a lot of places to visit and explore with beautiful scenery and a world that feels alive. Activities galore Tennis Golf Cycling Triathlon Diving Sky Diving Movies etc etc. There is a lot to do. Chaos galore Huge selection of weapons to cause chaos to your heart's content. Vehicles customization Design your vehicles like you want with several options.GTA Online Crew Fun With so much activities there is always something to do with your friends. ""Jobs"" Death matches Races Adversary modes and more create a great place to compete. Vehicles customization A big pro in GTA Online as well especially since you can show it off to your friends. Public Sessions Random chaos with missions can create a fun place to play with friends or solo.CONS Single Player Short Main Story If you are just going to focus on the main story and that is it it can feel pretty short. No DLC/Expension Even though this has been a major request over the years it does not look like the singleplayer will receive any new content story wise.GTA Online Balance Several weapons and vehicles is not balanced and with recent updates a power creep can be seen. ""Hackers"" This has been an on/off problem since the launch where at times you won't see one hack other times each session will have at least one with teleporting/god mode/spawning hacks. Community Due to the nature of the game you will often run into toxic players. ""Cost"" Even though DLC is free for online the cost of vehicles and locations has increased over time and for many it results in either a grind or buying ""Shark Cards"" to get the money in game.Overall I can recommend this game even with the cons of GTA Online. There is some ways to avoid some of the problems (Changing sessions muting voice etc) and that is good enough for me.At some point the power creep/balance/price of items might get too much for people (if not fixed) but considering I got 900+ hours out of this game I got my money's worth out of it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,Once upon a time Rockstar was a tiny company coming up into the world with a quirky series it had charm and wit and an open world to explore. But the real gem the #1 thing that kept their games being boughjt and played years down the line was Modding. With modding you could near anything with the world from add cars to flying around as superman. Now it seems their ego has grown larger than their reason. It was a long time coming really. Once they monotized online play it was all a downward spiral from there. Now in 2017 they finally pulled the trigger on the last bit that made Rockstar games fun and disabled all modding in an admitted attempt to get EVEN MORE money out of people. This wasnt some naive move the ceo od the parent company TAKE 2 stated this was all to get people to spend more on online play. So with that this game has become worthless and is no longer worthy of being played or the company endorsed in any future games. They set their priorities and greed won.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-29,0,0,161,False,Recommended,Ok so to start off this reveiw I have owned the game for about a year and just recently started playing. Within 5 days I have incured almost around 70 hours. This game is probably the best game I've ever played I constantly find myself absoulutely astounded by the detail in which Rockstar put into this game. I love every little thing about it from the TV Shows and radio hosts offering a sarcastic mirror on society in a way that's smart and funy to the little things like how the spedometer works or the audio ques. Every little last detail was thought of and don't get me started on the gfx and lighting.HOWEVER I have run into MANY modders. Some fun teleporting around and ing with player models some not fun running around in god mode or dropping random players money invalidating the entire purpose of Online Mode.And even worse with the modding side of GTA V Online was my friend getting banned within two days of owning the game. I loved this game so much I went on /r/globaloffensivetrade and traded my CSGO Shadow Daggs for a copy of the game so I could play with a friend of mine. We completed the Pacific Standard Job and she was banned for two weeks on the spot. I wanted to go back and complete the loyalty challenge now that I had a full team of four friends to play with but Rockstar really messed us up there. Many phone calls and a useless support ticket with a link that leads nowhere later and I guess we just have to wait out the ban.CONCLUSION This game is amazing and I adore every last little detail about it but Rockstar support really does suck.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-08-30,0,0,648,False,Not Recommended,Poor stewardship of GTA Online and poor service of its customers in general tarnish what is otherwise a great visually amazing game and work of satire. Rockstar ought to pay attention to what people are trying to do with the game after a release and try to make those changes. But they don't.The GTA Online experience has proven to be a mess. The protocol they designed for the game is a problem for scalability instead of helping it. It takes too long to get into this game and as is often the case back into a game that was aborted for whatever reason.That's not saying I won't buy GTA6 or whatever comes next it's just disappointing that the company behind the game it treats the buyers of its game like statistics rather than customers. They're as bad as any fictional company they've created within the game.I was one of many people who were insta banned (playing 10 seconds of the game) without explanation or cause. They've got obvious problems in the platform if that happens.On balance I don't think the frustrations are ultimately worth it. This game would be better as a standalone single player experience with a rich API that developers could freely modify and build online experiences around. Let's hope Rockstar gets it right in the next game but even they don't people will tolerate the t.I'm giving this a thumbs down just on the basis I don't think people should put up with it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-08,0,0,542,False,Not Recommended,Online (even just with friends) is ruined due to Rockstar's automatic ban policy which produces false positives. I received a 10 day ban on a fresh untouched install of GTA V. No mods were installed and nothing but normal game play took place in private sessions.All tickets filed for bans receive an instant reply and are marked as closed obviously never being reviewed by people. So if you get banned due to their system making a mistake which seems to be happening to a lot of people lately (August September 2016) you have no recourse.Truly appalling customer support from a AAA studio.,Grand Theft Auto V

Got the game as a gift after I won some silly twitch giveaway.I was inspired to make a review due to the recent backlash surrounding the game however I'm just going to be blunt about how I feel about the game.It's a boring and overly big game world that is a chore to play and the reason I don't have more game time is because I stopped playing it because it's that boring. If you like running around and shooting people in the open world for 1000 hours I question your game tastes.The story mode is better but it's still pretty much crap with an overly lame attempt at having interesting characters by throwing in a crazy into the mix overall have fun driving to every mission on the other side of the overly big open world just to be thrown right back to where you are at after you pew pew some.Game is a technical marvel and is a pretty game but the minute to minute game play makes this a chore you might be better off playing a Visceral Cleanup Detail game even over this.There are better games to waste your money on don't buy this just because your friends have it or because it's popular have the ability to resist the sparkle to see the underneath.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'll just say that the base game is great but gets boring very quickly. I bought this game on PC strictly for the single player mods and that kept me coming back significantly extending the replay value. Now that the mods I enjoyed are no longer supported I have absolutely no reason to even have this game installed on my computer. The online mode is full of hackers and just sucks in general so I cannot in good faith recommend purchasing this game new to anybody anymore.If you've never played this game before please purchase it second hand so that you are not feeding into the publisher's greed.

This ga(y)me was probably made over the course of a weekend fueled by day drinking and DMT. The story is about Frank and his gang of gundam warriors trying to invade Voltrons hideout in Michigan. Like how. The controls are ing broken. They removed Down B so now I cant even shine properly. The gay orgy scenes were way too short the director was a ing moron. The whole plot revolves around Trevor getting a new hat and it's not even cotton. Michael doesn't even have a character like he's on the box but not in the game I don't know. You c'ant eat or kamikaze. Also the police have back acne. (BacKnee). There's only 4 songs in the whole game and they're all just Ed Sheeran Gun Syncs. As for the guns they're actually decent but I don't like the way the reload animations look. Looks like a homeless man farting but then by mistake. It's just awkward.The girls don't exist. There's no uplifting message about friendship like in San Andreas which made me feel incredibly medcially sad. The most glaring issue however is that the game is a complete rip off of ""Yeezus"" which is probably my favorite movie of all time.

2016-12-27,0,0,360,False,Not Recommended,Worst customer service (or lack of there). I got hit with an online ban assumably for recieving free money from (other) people modding the game. Here is the email recieved.As a result your account has been suspended from playing GTA Online on PC for 30 days. In addition to being suspended all GTA Online characters progress and inventory on PC will be reset.All GTA Online suspension banning and character reset decisions are final and may not be appealed. For more information on the GTA Online Suspension and Ban Policy please see https //support.rockstargames.com/hc/en us/articles/229514247.When I attempted to contact them as to what it was I actually did wrong customer support hit me with the same message. No matter what someone did they deserve to know what they are being punished for and this is just wrong. Don't make the same mistake I did do not spend a dime on the shark cards. They apparently will take any chance they can to wipe your account and make you start over so the greedy money grubbers can get a better chance at making more money off the shark cards. It should not be possible for someone else modding the game to cause you to get into trouble. So sure the game is fun (of course except for the hackers that ruin it) but all I am saying is don't spend anymore real money on it.Edit It gets even worse my friend (who has played 100% legit and even avoids money drops from modders by switching lobbys asap when he sees one) recently had his account hacked and the hacker did things worthy of a ban. After making tickets to get his account back Rockstar STILL wouldn't lift the ban (30 days) and still wiped his account of all his hard work. Rockstar does not care at all about their players and just want to make money. Please keep all this in mind so these things can be avoided or at the very least expected or keep you prepared for the possibility just another reason not to spend a dime past the purchase price.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,1881,False,Not Recommended,Take Two Interactive. The parent company of Rockstar Games. This company has done one of the absolute worst things to their best selling game series Grand Theft Auto. Take Two has given the creators of OpenIV a Cease and Desist letter stating that GTA modding is now considered illegal. Personally I have 3 copies of GTAV Xbox 360 Xbox One and PC. All three are very good renditions of the true spirit that GTA is... until Online came about. GTA Online was fantastic on paper multi player worlds with destruction ridden cities and real time playability with your buds. Great. Dont ing force players into multiplayer by trashing the Single Player DLC and COMPLETELY GETTING RID OF MODDING BECAUSE YOU WANT MORE PROFIT. It's t. I know that many many people who bought the Steam version of this game ONLY bought it to mod it me included. Now OpenIV is not completely shut down they have just stopped distributing it as well as adding a note before the program launches stating a legal claim telling you to uninstall it. Of course you have the choice to not uninstall it and keep using it as normal but the fact that it has to be there is pointless. To cut this whole thing short GTA modding is not illegal it does not affect the playability of the multiplayer in any way nor does it create any game breaking functions. I hope that Take Two takes initiative on this matter.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-11,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,This game is amazing with all of it's content and various outlandish antics but at the same time for a game to be out since 2015 and the cheating being this out of control... It's sad. Almost EVERY game that i enter online has 1 or more people using cheats like god mode money hacks pulling you out of your car and spawning police with tasers blowing you up constantly so you cant leave the session and much much more. It almot makes the game unplayable. To make money online so you can get more content is something almost unattainable because of this. Nothing like having to deliver your 100k worth of stolen goods to a destination only to be stopped by a modder that can ruin your day with a touch of a key press. Rockstar save your game. i enjoy playing this game but you dont do a damn thing about all the cheaters in this game and that reflects on you as a company. Introduce battle eye something! it's not hard to find out what program people are using and making an anti cheat system around that.

2017-08-18,0,0,295,False,Not Recommended,As great as the single player game is I can't recommend it based on how scummy GTA Online is as an entity. R* will release a multiplayer expansion with vehicles weapons etc refuse to port those items to singleplayer (because it doesn't have microtransactions) and then have the audacity to deliberately break mods that allow these items to be used by singleplayer users by modifying the game's base code. Rewards earned from missions in GTA Online are pathetic and getting anywhere requires a huge investment of either time or money. Any new players are pretty much left with only spending money as an option because grinding to a level where you can hope to be competitive takes hundreds of hours. Planned single player content seems to have been cancelled in favour of developing more content pack leeches to apply to the starved corpses of the GTA Online community. Oh those new cars sure look awesome. Better invest another 30 hours.Ultimately I have no real issue with adopting an MMO like business model. But when free to play games like War Thunder genuinely have a fairer grind than a 40 triple A title I can't overlook it. If you enjoy GTA online like a lot of my friends do that's awesome and I genuinely hope you're getting fun out of it but it's one of those games that bores me beyond belief with how long anything takes and how boring the steps are to get there. Owning a yacht or a jet fighter or whatever is probably really fun. But I don't have another 200 hours to spend being mostly bored so I guess I'll never know.,Grand Theft Auto V

When you add up the time spent in this game you quickly realize that you spend the same amount of time sitting through loading screens as actually playing the game.

The game unlike GTA4 is very well optimized.Redoing all the things I did on console was nothing but a pleasure because the story is ritch and engaging all the characters are really memorable and crazy worthy of the best Tarantino.The gameplay especially the gunplay really is at the top of the series this time.The aim is free( at least with mouse and keyboard I haven't tried the pad) and the headshots are almost necessary to quickly kill the opponents without being overwhelmed so the gunplay is not watered down like it used to be in the previous installments.Sure GTA San Andreas is bigger and more of a ""jaw dropping game"" considering the time it came out it has more thing to do from a single player game perspective but the thing you do in GTA 5 are much more refined and polished.In my opinion this is the best GTA game overall.Then there is the online mode which unfortunately is at the same time the best and the worst part of this game.For what it concern the things to do it is probably one of the most expansive online enviroment ever seen in a game so much to do with a lot of updates and new modes coo op vs random sanbox fun it has it all.However all this magnificence falls flat on his face due to the loading time being almost unbereable the matchmaking can take forever especially in heists when you want to be the host leader and you HAVE to be the leader if you want to complete them in the cronological order.It's highly recommended to play the heists with friends or you can stumble in situations like this waiting for players in the room heist finally begins one dumbass/troll leaves or bad player dies as soon as the heat begins and you have to do all from scratch including all the horrible loading times the first starting as soon as one leaves...it can be BAD.In conclusion amazing single player game and an online mode that it can be summarized mostly in a heaven/hell experience.",Grand Theft Auto V

I bought this game to play online with friends.GTA online is one of the most frustrating things i have experienced. Rockstar releases amazing content but puts massive price tags on them pushing players to either grind for hours on end or buy a shark card. The shark cards are so ridiculous that it annoys me that ive actually purchased them in the past. You pay 40 for a game and yet to actually play it you need to pay even more.

The single player story doesn't bore you and it also has multiple endings. The online portion is also great granted you have friends that will play with you. My only qualms are that the online servers can be extremely slow and that the game isn't completely optimized in all areas of the map. Sometimes you'll be sitting at 60fps and get random drops to 30 40 50fps just for changing the angle at which you're viewing the same street.

2016-08-26,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,"This game just as with any open world pvp can be challenging to anyone who is expecting an experience other than people gunning you down just for the lol's and get R3Kt noob! Police in this game are a joke at higher levels. There is no real punishment for gunning down lower level players even with a bounty system because you will most likely just be giving they're partner that money instead of making any chance of them feeling remorse or loss. I may not agree or even like this but I can forgive it because in open world pvp I just expect people to be like this. What I really don't forgive is that you at a lower level you have no way to be really competitive as far as defending yourself. You will just get gunned down by people in armored cars over and over and over and over with no way to damage them in there armored cars. Police in this city with rampant explosive use should have been issued explosives rpgs or something to deal with criminals to help protect semi law abiding lowbies. You will only be able to start defending yourself once you have unlocked some explosives later. That is assuming you can scrape the money up for them if you are playing solo. Again I have to accept a lot of this because rockstar was probably just making a solo game that went multiplayer. The racing however is a blast the new maps and the old maps are really a lot of fun especially with friends. I can't tell you how many random things happened while racing that just make you laugh your butt off or make your friends downright livid because you ran them off the side of the track or somehow recovered when they tried to do the same to you. Unlocking a new pad and vehicles is a lot of fun in the online despite the rampant crap bags out for lol's. One of my favorite things was playing heists with my friends it was one of the main reasons I bought GTA V so I could round out my friend s crew. There is even the ability once you can afford it to be a VIP to lead a criminal empire where you run contraband steal cargo and various other less then legal ways for your company to earn money. This was a really interesting idea because it is an online multiplayer feature only. VIP lets others who are playing on your server try to disrupt your efforts or for you to disrupt them. It is even encouraged with extra cash and RP for killing the VIP or destroying / preventing they're work from being completed. All of this is fine. What is not fine is that when in the online multiplayer having someone who is either running around pwning dem noobs or doing VIP work (which you as an online player are encouraged to interfere with them) decides they don't like it when you kill them or disrupt them and they use hax / exploits to get you or your friends account banned by exploiting rockstars cheat detection system. This causes your account to get flagged for cheating and auto banned. Then when you contact rockstar about said ban you get the run around and around and around and AROUND. Your repeated requests to know why your account or your friends account was banned are met with ""it s a bot sir we don't know why the account was banned but it will be unbanned when the time is up."" Ok fine I m done with asking... waits for ban to be lifted starts enjoying the heists with his friends ""ok guys good heist give me a moment to set up a new one"" friends notice a VIP work in progress on the server and decide to earn some extra cash and RP by interfering with them GET BANNED for no apparent reason after being shot down by the VIP and respawning.I am so done with this...",Grand Theft Auto V

This was all made in order for rockstar to make money from their multiple microtransactions. I enjoyed myself for a while in online because hackers were giving away money to people for free and I could buy a lot of cool things. This made online enjoyable and fun. Otherwise it is horrible.

2018-03-20,0,0,64,False,Recommended,This is only gonna be a Single Player Review as frankly I'm in for the story but not for the grind. The Open World Alright then lets kill of with the open world. Let's face it. No one does Open World as Rockstar does. They pulled it off with outstanding detail and I really felt like it was a world that is lived in. To the grand city scapes of Los Santos to the coastline of the Alamo Sea GTA is filled with vivid geographical areas that stand out to be different in everyway to the cars the culture the dressing everything is strickingly unique. The graphics on the PC version are simply outstanding although the character models are a bit old gen which can be totally go unnoticed. The 24 Hours Day city with an on going moon cycle and a great dynamic weather is really unrivaled. That said A+ for Open world and the grahpics department. Story The story is a take on the contemporary world and they've nailed it. The way the story is told is great with Rockstar's Signature on the go Dialogue system and the way the cinematics are seemelesly integrated into the gameplay without any interraction key for the NPCs in the game is just well done and simply works great. Overall it was a great story with lots of sides mission and fantastic level design. Especially the Heists are wonderfully done integrating all 3 characters in a very natural manner. There was only 1 bug in the entire game that I have encountered which I was able to fix with a little digging in the forums. Verdict In case you didn't see this coming here's my final thoughts. This game was a blast for me from starting to end and I took my time to get to the end. It took me about 50 hours to beat it and I did get the game on a sale which I'd recommend you get it that way as it is a 5 year old game. Also I have not played much of the GTA Online and I don't think I will. Single player itself is well worth your money. Hope you all enjoy the game ),Grand Theft Auto V
2017-08-22,0,0,261,False,Not Recommended,Single Player is great having the right equipment makes your game look amazing. Online however is another story.In my hours of gameplay it seems as if every other online lobby you join has some sort of modder who teleports you anywhere and does whatever he wants in the game. Getting banned or reported doesnt deter them either. Controls for this game on keyboard i guess it takes on getting used to but i prefer a gamepad. I wish i had not bought this version and instead ported my character from ps3 to xbox one but saddly you can only port it once to pc. I wouldnt recommend getting this game on PC and suggest console. The only positive thing about this PC version is in the online you can type to communicate with players where you cant do that well or fast on console.,Grand Theft Auto V

These modders come in all shapes and forms but the most common and the most rampant is the 'Game Ruiner' their purpose for playing with mods is to solely to ruin the game for others this has been going on for some time now however I have come to realise it will not get better but only continue to get worse.

And I have been in love ever since. If you enjoy Singleplayer or Multiplayer you can have fun on this game due to the endless modding and storyline in Singleplayer or even the long lasting Multiplayer free roam experience. I won't lie though Online tends to be full of modders these days so expect to run into them. And in order to purchase cars or housing online you will have to do tons of grinding. But if you're able to look passed those two things then I would highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,428,False,Not Recommended,Purchased this game on the 360 XB1 and PC. Have 426 hours logged on Steam alone and used to play GTAO a lot with friends but hackers started ruining it by blowing up player owned cars under other people's names and forcing them into the Bad Sport pool which placed you in lobbies with s for an extended period of time. Not to mention all the other game breaking hacks they do. Social Club/servers suck too as of late. Loads you into a game then keeps you at the waiting screen and if you're lucky you'll get to play the game and have to grind a lot to get money to buy the overpriced garbage DLC items. Or just simply buy Shark Cards cause it why not? Then they took away modding. Something that has made many other games live on well past their life expectancy. Counter Strike was made because of a guy who modded Half Life. It's one of the unique features of playing on the PC. I wouldn't put it past these guys to bring back mods but set them up in a shop so you have to buy them. Wouldn't be the first ones to pull that stunt.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,164,False,Not Recommended,Wait for a sale do not buy this 4 year old game for full price. If you have never played it before then play it for the single player and avoid the multiplayer like the plague. The single player is great fun and will have your attention for a good amount of time. The multiplayer however is quite another story. It is quite clear that the balance of multiplayer has been meddled with in order to cram in the awful microtransactions that don't even give you that much cash in the grand scheme of things. In order to buy everything your character would need such as vehicles house luxuries and guns you would need at least a couple hundred million. The 99$ microtransaction card that gives you money only give you 8 million meaning you would have to pay ridiculous amounts of money to get to that point. Of course you could always just grind but the problem is you can only really get around 20k max per mission if you are not doing something that takes really long or are doing the easy to mess up heists that usually give money in the hundred thousands (the highest one is 2 mil). So it would also take a ridiculous amount of time to get to the point mentioned previously. And it's because of that awful grind/pricetag that modders run amuck in the game. Some of them are genuinely nice guys who are only trying to fight the microtransactions by giving players money who later get banned because take two interactive does not want to lose their cash cow. Then there are the bad modders who just go around killing people with some sort of advantage. They are indeed a problem (that probably would have been lessened if there were no microtransactions) however take two's way of dealing with it is just plain idiotic. Instead of finding the mod tools that the bad modders use they put out a cease and desist on OpenIV. OpenIV is how almost every SINGLEPLAYER mod works and without that system every mod using it will not work. OpenIV does not even effect multiplayer because it only works through the games singleplayer files meaning that take two ruined the modding scene for literally no reason. The multiplayer could have been the best part of this game were it not for take two's greed with the microtransactions however it will remain ruined. (Also modding has been supported and promoted by Rockstar themselves meaning that they are not at fault for take two's actions. Rockstar was also against microtransactions for the online but were forced to implement it by their publisher take two. Rockstar is completely fine and you should find other ways to support them.)Don't give take two interactive your money. It sets a bad precedent that gouging us is ok.,Grand Theft Auto V

It was so much fun to be able to just jump into the game hop on a motorcycle crank up the music on my headphones and go flying down the road weaving in and out of cars. I had so much fun playing out adventures in my head. This was almost solely possible because of the hard thankless and dedicated efforts of the modding community.The modding community brings so much with it to almost any game out there. Games like GTA5 only get exponentially better thanks to mods. When people watch aa video on youtube of GTA5 and think I really want that game now. I want to live out that adventure myself almost without fail there is a mod or two present.This is not to say the base game is not worth anything. The base game is a work of art worth every penny of the two purchases I have personally made. However mods exponentially raise this game to legendary status offering vast replayability even better graphics if your machine can handle them and more adventures for people to experience. Mods are only a benefit when a game follows the desired format of gameplay.The only time modding becomes a detriment at all is when certain items are locked away by developers. Why? It can be for challenge understandable but that is still up to the player if they want to remove this challenge themselves. However this is not the answer in this case. It could be content which is in a proper DLC which once purchased in a single purchase is yours forever and should be attainable now just as easily as the rest of the game. This is without question a fair possibility however it also is not the case. The other option is that content is restricted for the sake of financial unlock (aka. microtransactions). This is where GTA5 online comes into play...In all openness I think I have put MAYBE half an hour into GTA5 online. Why? because it's not fun unless you are doing a specific thing with friends. It is ludicrously hard to attain items in GTA5 online because of how expensive everything is. Probably one of the most financially rewarding part of GTA5 online are the heists. Oh by the way you must have a high end apartment to access these which costs range from 200 000 to over 1 000 000. The time it takes to get this much capital to even access the heists is ludicrous for beginning people. But don't worry. If you look just a little above in the shark cards section you can see that after buying the game you can spend $75 to get enough credits to buy one. It will save you tons of time... Sound worth it to you when you can download a mod in a few minutes and enjoy an apartment of your own in single player? I think not... This is the reasoning behind the banning of modding in GTA5. Because it takes away from the microtransaction profit.The whole notion of microtransactions are a cash grab. You have already purchased the game. Now they are locking away access to parts of that game behind more transactions. It is a pure cash grab and seriously takes away from the enjoyment of the game. People are not going to want to play a game if they must purchase something within the game that they already purchased (most more than once already because they loved it so much). The only time I see microtransactions as a viable and fair options is in a free or drastically low price game where you can purchase purely cosmetic items because you like how they look not because they give you a numerical edge in the game.Because of the removal of mods in GTA5 I am not sure I will even play this game again. Would I recommend it to someone? For experiencing the single player campaign/story sure. It is a great story with good progression. For everything else (mainly online) no. After experiencing the story the replayability of this game will be almost null. You can mess around a little bit but you are so limited now with what you can do there is almost nothing to do. You can't even access a sizeable amount of the game content unless you brave the grind of online or shell out hundreds of dollars to buy stuff online which oh by the way I hope you have insurance on incase what you purchase happens to get destroyed by some other player running around with a bazooka for fun.Let me be clear here. I am totally against any form of online cheating. That ruins the fun for everyone. I totally back Rockstar on everything they do against cheaters online. I am also pretty sure Rockstar had nothing to do with banning mods in a game. From what I know that is all Take Two. However the only reason to remove it from single player is to push players towards a microtransaction laden online which is not acceptable.If modding is allowed again I will most certainly recommend this game to anyone even with the microtransactions kept in online. The single player with mods is just so good and you do not need to even touch online to have fun. I repeat I am not sure I have even played more than half an hour of online myself or ever will. I certainly will never buy one of the cash cards. As of now however I cannot recommend this game. It is a good game but so much has been taken away and locked behind a microtransaction content only accessible online wall.,Grand Theft Auto V

The multiplayer is a mess of ruined potential. Instead of offering single player DLC it makes more monetary sense to add a car to multiplayer at a high price and wipe their asses with all that shark card money. Just when I thought there bs couldn't keep going they decided to send a cease and desist to the team behind a popular modding tool for GTAV. It wasn't enough to ban you from online for using it in single player no they had to also take the tool down. Don't support this kind of behavior with your money.

2017-06-17,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar made a fantastic game then turned it into a microtransactional sinkhole. Single player DLC was promised at release but four years later all they have added to the game is a chain of cosmetic gimmicks designed to squeeze every penny possible from their fanbase. With this game's success Rockstar has morphed from a game developer to slumlord meting out underwhelming content in paid piecemeal installments. Worse still they are currently trying to kneecap the vibrant modding community which offers fresh exciting and open content in stark contrast to their official and insipid leavings. Modders enliven games and energize thier fans and embody the spirit of what made the internet such a vibrant community before startups became titans. Don't let it just be a commodity.

If this does continue with KSP they probably will see tons of sales decreasing.This review will mostly be on DLC/Content I have been playing since the start of GTAIV and that game never brought in overpriced DLC which was at like 8 dollars each for the amount of story content as 1/4 of GTAIV's. Then came Red Dead which brought in no micro transactions and one great DLC. But their also was the pointless purchasable DLC like playing poker ($9.99) in multiplayer and a horse dlc ($.79). Lastly came GTA V where desired content by the players was delayed (heists) money was added to online lied to about story DLC only updated story content once or twice for early online content and we are STILL MISSING OUR STOCK MARKET IN ONLINE SINCE RELEASE (ok that doesn't really matter). Later along GTA V release came the overpriced (ingame money) DLC and CEO/President/VP DLC which were supposed to be a way to collect money together but barely give any reward as it is.,Grand Theft Auto V

I preordered the PC version and loved the game ever since. the first summer it was out on pc you could not play in a public lobby without modders ruining the game for everybody. So by christmas of 2015 they ""cracked down"". by this point my friends list and I had menus and we were able to kick people in the lobby with it so we would kick other hackers and that all we used it for (and maybe some money but who wouldnt?). then we all got banned for ten days. I have not cheated since then and have not revieced a ban. i got my warning and learned my lesson. But now you see theres the problem you let people off too easy who dont care about getting banned. i did so i stopped but clearly others dont and clearly you dont rockstar because instead of punishing those who cheat with an actually GOOD anti cheat system (which is where your money should go instead of hiring lawyers to right a cease and desist to a modding company that makes SINGLE PLAYER MODS which you said in the beggining you supported and also you cant acces online with them it says ""you have modified game files""). Dont punish the modding commuity for your mistakes. I hope you enjoy losing all the customers you just away. In the end yes this game WAS great now they ruined it.

2017-06-15,0,0,42,False,Not Recommended,I already own GTA 5 on console and the only reason i purchased this on PC was to experience the mods available for single player. As i have no interest in GTA online and seeing as Take2 has decided to kill the one mod required for the majority of GTA mods in order to encourage people people to play the garbage fire cash grab that is GTA onine I can no longer reccomend people buy this game. I've always found it downright despicable that they have kept new content in the game a GTA online exclusive in an unforetunately successful attempt to force people into buying shark cards which are a ripoff. There is also the fact that from the beginning we've been promised new single player content and have not recieved it for the sole reason that GTA online dlc earns them more money via people having to buy shark cards to afford the new content.OpenIV was a mod that allowed people to experience GTA online content in single player and is without doubt the main reason for most people purchasing the game on pc in the first place.

A lot of PC players bought it just for the mods but it seems they are getting rid of mods by ordering a cease &amp desist on Open IV. Idiots. They want us to buy more sharkcards and give into the big money grab they complain they haven't been making enough from these ridiculous microtransactions. Then the 2nd big ""FU"" to PC players comes in when they don't release RDR2 on PC after petitions with thousands of signatures and people begging. Probably because they can't make enough through microtransactions on PC. What a shame. Rockstar used to be great devs but they have gone into the toilet along with the quality of their games. GTA 4 had much more attention to detail than this pile of poo. Just because it's full of content doesn't mean it's fun or good.

2017-06-15,0,0,568,False,Not Recommended,Used to like this game.Played MP for a while and then got bored because the game forces you to grind ridiculously for money so basically the only way to get it in a reasonable amount of time is to either get money from cheaters or buy shark cards which is t because I already spent 60 buying this on PC and had it on PS3 before so I have payed twice for the game and Rockstar still want more from my wallet.Anyway discovered mods and moved to SP didn't even play the story on my PC yet just been messing with mods and now most of the mods that I use are gone. Why? Because Take Two aren't satisfied with earning literally billions of dollars since the game was released and want to push more people into the multiplayer to leech from their wallets as well with the Shark Cards.In short Take Two have no idea what they are trying to do they just want more money and that is ruining the game for a lot of people.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,I enjoyed the single player and the multiplayer was OK when with friends. I was looking forward to messing with the new special vehicles as I haven't played it for a while but have been watching some lets plays recently. I probably would've even bought a shark card or two as I have done in other games before.That was before I heard about the fact that Take Two the owner of rockstar has decided to litigate against a modder for daring to create a mod that inserts Textures into their game. Textures. I would understand if they were going after cheat or crack creators but going after innocent modders is just plain bad for everyone. Hopefully they'll understand this eventually and rescind their earlier actions but until then I can't recommend a game made by people who go after harmless people.,Grand Theft Auto V

That is also a bull crap move making people purchase a shark cash card when hackers in game just drop money on you without your consent. Rockstar support and programmers certainly dont have the time or intelligence to deal with all the crap things with this game.

2017-06-15,0,0,1976,False,Not Recommended,I've been meaning to write a review for this game for a long time but have never been able to decide if I would recommend this or not. I have played far too many hours in the singleplayer and enjoy that immensely but the online expirience was dodgy to begin with and has been getting progressively worse with each passing month. Two things cemented my answer.The first thing being the most recent update to the game the update builds a massive paywall to overcome and actively discourages cooperation in favor of going it alone to accomplish difficult tasks for little reward. The power creep on weapons and vehicles is completely insurmountable. Online is a depressing time sink and for a while I sought refuge by playing around with singleplayer using mods to increase game lifespan. With the cease and desist request thrown at OpenIV for seemingly no reward and at the expense of an entire community of people who mod singleplayer I cannot recommend this game for PC at all. Singleplayer mods were the only reason anyone would buy this game for PC over console. Console has a much more secure online expirience with the PC online expirience vulnerable to modders sabotaging your account and even taking personal information and IP addresses.If I were to recommend the game it would be to get it for console because of the more secure online expirience. But I don't recommend the online expirience as a whole it isn't very fun and as of now I can't recommend singleplayer for more than a few dozen hours without mods there isn't much to do.,Grand Theft Auto V

I disliked GTA3 however because it's transition to 3D graphics is incredibly buggy and the playability is extremely frustrating. Not so with GTA5! The POSITIVES It has an exceptional story with very complex and interesting characters you get to play as three of them that work together in order to complete tasks. GTAV stays true to the quirky little aspects of GTA we all expect (like the funny radio stations) and it remains a HUGE open world with lots of things to do. I spent four hours seeing how many cars I could blow up on a highway before police ended my shenanigans. The NEGATIVES The controls are not clear when completing certain tasks or operating certain machinery even with the in game instructions. I'm playing using a PC keyboard (I have a Steam controller however haven't tried it with this game yet.) I often found myself using google for simple things such as ""How do I swim upwards in GTA5?""

2017-12-28,0,0,683,False,Recommended,If I could only play one more game forever I would without doubt go for GTA V/Online. And I HAVEN'T SPENT ANY MONEY EXCEPT BUYING THE GAME. Here's why.Yes Rockstar are now making it very expensive for players to get stuff in game and beginning to twist players arms to buy shark cards (a shame) but as of yet I've never needed to buy a shark card you just need to invest time to earn the money in game. The reason I don't mind this is because the satisfaction when you DO save enough money and the stuff you buy has a lot more value representing hours and hours put into the game. The path to making money revolves heavily around the key principle spend money to make money. You need to do CEO/MC missions to make money easily. No shark cards just earning in game. Now to the rest of the game. The brilliance of the game is simply how much there is to do... The single player alone is phenomenal with one of the best game stories I've ever played along with brilliant voice acting fun gameplay and a top soundtrack (that you can control...). Yeah there's the obvious pasttimes driving around lobbing sticky bombs everywhere and shooting everything that moves slightly but there's so much more.You can go mountain biking play tennis base jump try and fill up a swimming pool with cars pick up an innocent player in their car with a cargobob and carry them away rob stores customise cars start a business lead a motorcycle crew get into smuggling and gunrunning buy a plane get repeated phone calls from Simeone... Enjoyed Burnout? Well you can basically DO Burnout in GTA normal races stunt races boat races races in cars that can jump and glide and that have rocket boosters race planes etc. Grab a BMX and learn to do freestyle BMX riding (yeah you really can) or find some buildings to do parkour on become a law enforcer and follow the police around assisting them (in what can onyl be described has the most hazardous police environment known to mankind).And now we get to Doomsday and there is basically a whole new story mode out but now you can play with your friends.

There is a keybind page though that's a lie. The keys that'll you want to rebind can't be rebound. The keys that are just fine you can rebind of course.Third the load screens.Even with the fastest hardrives on the market this game takes forever too load.Sure the map is huge and will require a load screen but why do I have to reload EVERY DAMN MISSION?!?!?!?!?This is beyond frustrating as well as just poor design choice.I've already loaded the world don't make me reload it a thousand times because my team keeps dying then ragequiting Last and not least only way to earn money is to buy SharkCards.This game is pointless unless you have hundreds of dollars to spend. DO NOT BUY as long as they have SharkCards in their current format as well as matchmaking.The matchmaking is horrible and a sad excuse for an AAA game.I have no problem with purchasable ingame currency my problem is making SharkCards the only real way to gain ingame currency.Thank you for letting me know not to spend money on Rockstar games in the future.You've lost a 20 year long fan.Still I give this game 3 out of 5 stars because it is still a half decent game.",Grand Theft Auto V

The music in this game is just fantastic too with a few songs I'd never before that are now some of my favorites. The gameplay was smooth on a mid range system always entertaining and hilarious at times and I don't recall any real bugs or issues that I came across (this is playing within the last year). As a single player game I highly recommend GTA 5.Multiplayer on the other hand is absolute trash. I'd read about what I'd be getting into so there were no real surprises but what Rockstar has done with GTA Online is just shameful. Hackers/modders are rampant and will wreck your gameplay. I started GTA Online a couple weeks ago and just can't do it anymore it's so frustrating and the player base (modders and cheaters) is just trash. It's not only me who is frustrated by it I've seen so many people rage quit out of GTA Online after getting targeted and harassed by modders.Why Rockstar doesn't hammer the modders and cheaters is beyond me. They just don't seem to care that the rest of their players are affected by it. I guess as long as the boatloads of Shark Card money keeps coming in who cares right?

2015-04-22,0,0,152,False,Recommended,List of my thoughts. Overall story mode is awsome multiplayer looks promising but still needs work.Pros good story interesting and funny main charachters shooting feels good driving feels good similar to flatout with real feeling of speed vehicle damage found only 1 bug in 35h of gameplay from release in story mode you can literally drive wherever you wantCons game would benefit from few confirmation windows here and there gamepad keybinding is awful multiplayer still needs some work (not only bug wise) multiplayer needs some sort of game browser! Currently lobby gathers players mostly by spamming invites if you host the game you are not guaranteed to be host at the start of the next race (even with stay host option on) no party system game does not compensate for lag in multiplayer. If your game stutters game threats that like you were standing still almost everyone is lagging due to poorly optimised game hackers toxic community alt+tab can randomly cause the game to give you constant frame drops untill restarting experienced tiny amount of game crashesFew facts you complete story mode with about 60% of map completion after that you can do random missions and collections etc. It took me about 35h to complete main storyline.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,The sad part is this game started out as an actual game. A good one even! But once the vanilla single player story is over it stops being a game and turns into a cash grab. I paid good money to own this game but apparently that's not enough. GTA Online is a joke. 40 minute wait times for public queues into mission you can use to grind up what paltry rewards the game decides you're worthy of provided you happen to win. The matchmaking is abysmal not just by happenstance but by design. Its all to sell shark cards. That's it that's what the game is now. Shark cards. GTA Online is unplayable without paying extra for shark cards. I've played games that are actually free that are less aggressive about forcing you to pay extra for a fun online experience than GTA Online. And maybe that would be tolerable if you could get more content out of the single player campaign by modding it. But now Take 2 has put a stop to that because people having fun offline doesn't sell shark cards! Forget this game. Forget shark cards. It not worth the price tag anymore. Don't buy the next one either if Take 2 has anything to do with it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a great game don't get me wrong. However the singleplayer modding community that helps keep the GTA games alive and popular being shut down is inexcusable. Take Two Interactive if you are reading this. Please listen to a person who has been a long time fan of the Grand Theft Auto series of games. This is a huge mistake. You are shooting yourselves in the foot by doing this. People buy older games in the series like San Andreas and GTA IV mainly due to the modding capabilities. These games are still fantastic games but by doing this you are removing a large chunk of potential customers who want to revisit these classics with mods and customization. San Andreas and older games do not even have online multiplayer. What could you possibly have to gain by alienating one of your biggest groups of fans by shutting down something that these people who have put their talents and time into creating new content for these games WITHOUT PAY. These people are not doing this for money they are doing this because they love your product. Taking that freedom and ability to customize your game is basically a slap in the face to an entire group of people who may have even wanted to work for you and make the next GTA game.I love Grand Theft Auto V and I am honestly disappointed in this decision that you have made.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,215,False,Not Recommended,I strongly suggest anyone thinking about buying this to avoid it the single player experience only lasts so long and then you'll only have regrets.There's so much wrong about the online section of this game GTA Online is wrong from the start being an boring and slow grind anything requires in game currency and nothing is cheap everything literally costs millions of in game dollars with the more expensive stuff being in the billions they literally force you to buy shark cards in order to do anything unless you're willing to grind for hours for each step you want to take that is if you don't get banned or have cash or items taken from you because of suspected cheating or misbehavior in reality you don't even need to log into the game and someday when you come back you'll notice something is gone or you're banned that's how good (sarcasm) the anti cheat is on GTA Online the other problem is how Rockstar is turning from an company that did not cared about controversies to an company that does not cares about the consumer if anything happens and you need support expect an scripted bot awnser and nothing in the way of help.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-01,0,0,459,False,Not Recommended,"This game is one in just about every way one of the most frustrating video games ever made. The potential is massive but is away by greed from the developer and a toxic community filled with griefing and modding. The developers promised single player DLC which was a straight up lie. The online could be fun if it wasn't filled with grieffers or people modding the server so badly you cant even play. Rockstar claims all of the online DLC is free but that is not the full truth at all. Everything is massively over priced and the payout for jobs is pathetic. You can do activities in free mode to make money like selling cars or collecting crates but all that system does is nickel and dime you out of all your meger profits. Say by chance you do manage to grind up enough crates to actually sell for a decent profit you better have some friends to help you because the game is designed to punish you as much as possible for playing alone. Either impossible to defeat NPCs will spawn while your given an unarmed plane or your given so many vehicles to deliver you have no chance. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY SHARK CARDS!!!!!!! who ever decided on the pricing for them is an absolute scum bag. $100 real life dollars for a paltry 8 million in game. I know that sounds like alot but consider that a good portion of the dlc vehicles cost over 3 million on there own without factoring in customization. The arrogance that this company has displayed charging this much and taking advantage of its own customers is disgusting. Sorry for that rant and i know some will just say ""git gud"" or just dont play but the core game with a couple of minor tweaks could be one of the best games ever made.

2017-08-09,0,0,496,False,Not Recommended,The only way to justify purchasing this game is if you haven't played the single player story. Multiplayer is really only fun if you have a few friends to play some mini games with... If you've never played it you may be able to get 50hrs of petty entertainment before the problems begin to sour your experience. Otherwise the fundamental multiplayer experience and progression is simply not functional. The multiplayer is broken. Rockstar has taken a lot of action under the flag of punishing the money spawning modders that ruined the multiplayer economy but it has resulted in innocent players with hundreds of game hours being banned extreme price inflation for vehicles (making them vastly unavailable to anyone that doesn't receive modded money drops) and blocking user created mods that actually improve your experience. The most tragic part is that these attempts will never stop the rampant money dropping modders and negatively effects the honest player more than anyone else.,Grand Theft Auto V

Protecting your property is important I understand this. However there's a fine line between trusting your players and not even considering the consumers players anymore. I think this move of putting a cease and desist against OpenIV is a poor move one that will surely change the course of this game's history forever. I think Rockstar can learn from this by providing future multiplayer experiences that don't punish the player for wanting to play the game and not spend extra money to get the cool things. This game was fun and OpenIV was adding potential for more fun. Unfortunately I'll have to look elsewhere to have open ended fun in video games and I'd honestly recommend you do too.,Grand Theft Auto V

It was obvious from the start that every Online expansion was just overpriced vehicles clothing and property accompanied with a few new missions but this latest one takes the cake. It is blatantly clear that Rockstar is trying to milk every possible cent out of the players wallets by including ""Free to Play"" type functionality into the newest content( to get the newest weapon upgrades intorduced by the DLC you need to buy a bunker then a Mobile Operations Center and after all that as if it was not enough you need to either wait for 180 real life hours(in game time stops if you go offline) to unlock all the weapon customisations or pay additional outrageous prices to fast track the whole process which in the end costs over 13 million ingame dollars or turned into shark cards over 250 euros). The way things are going with the Online expansions next we'll get energy bars in the game so that we need to wait a couple hours in between the missions we do. That is the only thing separating GTA Online from an ordinary cash grab ""Free to Play"" mobile game. After over 500 hours played it's a real shame seeing such a great game end up in such a pitiful state.",Grand Theft Auto V

You aren't anything special.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-25,0,0,365,False,Not Recommended,edit take two's persistent push of (not so) micro transactions in a PAID GAME has locked most of the enjoyable features in online mode. Mods brought much needed content to the sparse singleplayer that is until take two cease and decisted openIV the backbone of gta IV/V modding (note this has no effect on preventing cheaters). To sum up it appears take two is milking one of the greatest games ever made for every penny and destroying what its developers (rockstar) wanted the game to be.Truly a great game its story mode does an excellent job of populating the world with wildly varing characters but struggles to have a coherent plot. on the other hand online mode is the real meat and potatoes of the game having much more replay value and giving the player more things to do.The main problems with the game are long loading times (and lots of them) and an increased emphasis on in game purchases in newer updates as more expensive stuff is added.additionally i highly recommend using a controller for driving/flying/boating and mouse and keyboard for shooting,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,"Rockstar is my favorite developper and publisher. With a pedigree as impressive as the GTA series Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne why would you not expect the very best from them ? More importantly after over a decade of publishing games that felt and were complete with great stories and amazing content only ever releasing DLCs that not only were great but felt like completely different and new games one of which is actually my favorite zombie game you'd would have to be crazy not to expect anything else than an amazing and perfect game and eagerly await each dlc. In any case that's how I felt back when Grand Theft Auto V came out. At first I was overwhelmed I had never seen a game with such a big scope so much to do and so much to see the game looked amazing and felt amazing and the missions were great but the more time passed and the more I realised the game didn't have nearly as much soul as Red Dead Redemption GTA IV or even San Andreas had the game didn't have that unique charm of the wild west or of the gloomy and dark vibes of Liberty City and its fun and crazy vibe paled in comparison of those in San Andreas. Of course the missions and visuals were much more impressive but that's to be expected from a game coming out in 2013 for which we had been waiting for for 6 years now. The first thing that worried me was when I entered a police car and noticed we couldn't do police operations not a big deal I thought there'll be some more things to do paramedics firetruck or the train for sure so on I go ready to stop the train and get inside. I run up to it and with my pistol I shoot the driver... nothing happens the train just keeps going at this point I'm baffled there's no way they did this right ? Surely there's a bug or it's because I shot the driver and there's no one to stop the train so on I go and decide to wait for another one and I start to follow it it has to stop at some point so I follow it and follow it and follow it and obviously it never stops. Now I'm legitimately disapointed and confused why would Rockstar bring back the train and showcase it in a trailer and not let you drive it ? I go on a hunt for a paramedic and fire truck same thing you can't do anything with them. What the hell Rockstar ? I also notice that this game has nowhere near as much side and has taken a few steps backwards compared to GTA IV and even San Andreas you can't enter restaurents the army won't come for you when you're at max star level the game has serious lack of interiors and you can't buy and get new houses unless it works with the story the activites like pool bowling air hockey Poker black jack and so on have been dropped and there's only tenis and golf left there are animals to kill and hunt but there isn't any point because you can't skin them to sell their pelts the people and police are all inging crazy and as soon as I even touch their model they want to beat the crap out of me that's if they don't pull out a handgun you don't see police doing police thing anymore and when they do they don't arrest and make a cool scene like in IV they just pull up shoot the guy and leave and god forbid you try to help cause if you do it'll be your turn soon you also can't crouch anymore peopel don't react anymore when you shoot them aside from dying when it used to be that they would lose balance and if you shot armor wearing police they'd stagger and shoot their gun from the stagger all the police does to stop you is ram your and you seemingly can't avoid it even if you have the fastest car in the game peopel apparently die after being hit in the face two times which makes it hard to have a cool fight you can't turn the engine of the car off anymore etc. I just didn't believe all the details that made the previous games amazing had been thrown out the window at least I was going to get a good story I thought.Joke's on me though cause the story isn't even all that great the characters don't ever really grow and at the end of the story without spoiling you're kind of at the same place as you were in the beginning so even though you do all those cool missions it apparently doesn't matter at all. It's a real shame because the characters are probably the most interesting ones we got in a GTA game but because the game is shorter than GTA IV and it's divided in 3 protagonists we don't have nearly enough time to really grow attached to any of them. Oh well surely the definitely incoming DLC will fix that.That's what bothers me the most we KNEW a DLC would come there had to be one it had even been trademarked and the voice actors had teased it on twitter and then... silence. Nothing it's been 4 years now and there is no DLC in sight even worst it's not coming anymore for sure because Red Dead 2 is on the horizon and they would never release a DLC that could hurt the sales of their next upcoming game and why did they never release it ? Because they just decided to sit on their because the online mode made enough money off of the shark cards anyway so why bother ? All they want us to do is take their stupid online mode with its 10 minutes long loadings and its god awful player base buy those stupid cards and vehicles they put in the game and shut up. At least I can mod singleplayer and do what I want right ?It hurts right ? Grand Theft Auto has always been huge when it came to mods even since San Andreas where modders gave birth to the first ever online Grand Theft Auto game which might have inspired Rockstar to make the online mod in their next games people made and created the craziest for GTA especially in GTA IV when people made zombie mods tsunami mods earthquake mods they made models for npcs and players recreated real life cars with the outmost care and details and made all sorts of visual mods like the famous ENB mod in GTA V they doubled down on the sillyness and made some mods that turned the player into Iron Man the Flash that let players finally drive the train like they wanted and put in features that should have been in the game in the first place they started what is now one of the biggest feature of GTA Online that is GTA RP and now T2 and Rockstar comes in and says "" you"" and is stopping modders starting with the OpenIV team. Well you too Take Two and Rockstar it is such a shame because even for all its faults you made one of the most well crafted games of all time but then you do all this you cancel the singleplayer dlc you shove those microtransactions down our throats for that terrible online mode where the grind is eternal and awful and then after people have sunk hundreds of not thousands of hours you go and ban their accounts for seemingly no reason and take away everything they worked for make probably the worst story I've ever gotten from a Rockstar game wich is baffling considering Red Dead Redemption came only a few years before GTA V and it had the best one take away all those amazing details GTA IV San Andreas Vice City and Red Dead Redemption had and have one of the most disapointing and underwhelming radio soundtrack I've heard in a GTA making an all around very disapointing game. Rockstar used to be my favorite developper and publisher not anymore.**TLDR Rockstar used to be great they used to make amazing story they used to make incredible and perfect games they used to stand up for modders and even feature them on their website they used to make great singleplayer dlcs they used to pour love and details and content in their games. Not anymore.**",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-11,0,0,210,False,Recommended,I played this game on Xbox One for 3 years before owning it on Steam and I'd put at least 1600 hours into the online alone. Most of the time I have on the Steam version was spent in the story mode but just based on that alone I'd say this game is definitely worth the price.The online part of this game has brought me some of the best fun I've had in a game in years. It's a huge grind to get anywhere near enough money to buy the things you want online but at least the grind itself is super fun. Free DLCs are added every few months too which helps justify the price point a lot more and keeps me coming back.Apart from horrible loading times and a lot of people on here saying they were banned for no reason (I've had no bad experiences with any of that) there's not a lot wrong with this game.One of the best games I've ever owned. 10/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-22,0,0,131,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar treats their customers horribly. I would expect after being banned from online gameplay after I joined a lobby full of hackers on accident and did not do anything to get just some kind of relief. I finally got unbanned after two weeks and i played for a few hours in an invite only lobby with my friend (to avoid hackers) and I wake up this morning with a email from Rockstar saying that they suspect suspicious activity from my account. I log onto online a little later and what do you know. I'm banned for a month this time. I honestly think that unless you're just buying this to play by yourself in offline mode this game is not worth purchasing and a waste of 60+ dollars. I would honestly like a refund and this game off my library. I have this game on Xbox 360 as well and have only found a problem with making money. It is very hard to make a ton of cash to buy the new vehicles and whatnot. If you want them you must buy the Shark Cards. That is true on PC too. I personally refuse to buy any Shark Cards because it is a waste of money and I don't have that kind of money to waste. Thank you for reading my review.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-14,0,0,263,False,Not Recommended,A once great game has now become boring expensive and disengaging. It's storyline was mediocre and now GTA Online is just a pay to play/win type scenario especially if you're new. Sure the DLC is all free and that's great but there's a downside to these years of free content that's been provided to us. The notorious shark cards. I was lucky enough to save my money from Heists (back when GTA Online was fun and innovative) so I could try all the new upcoming content. But now it's just the same old just a different day that's being peddled to us. Everything is a less than rewarding grind if you don't fork up your hard earned money towards Shark Cards the DLC is now lacking innovation and creativity being complete copy and paste reskins of the CEO's update so far with the same tasks we've already been completing just in a different style and fashion. All in all GTA Online was living up to its full potential but the community just watched it get flushed down the toilet. Not to mention we had to make a stand to save OpenIV and the modding community. When we said we were tired of modders we meant online cheaters... not independent content creators! Idiots. Goes to show you even further how they knew mods were likely one of the reasons their shark cards weren't selling like they wanted/needed. Because players would rather play 100% FREE content like LSPDFR.,Grand Theft Auto V

It takes forever to join/create a heist. Half of the time you get kicked out due to some weird connection error or because a round has already started meaning you have to load GTA Online again. If you eventually get around to actually playing it you'll be around with total nuts who really don't get the word 'Team'. Restarting rounds over and over again because someone on your team keeps playing like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2016-11-27,0,0,373,False,Recommended,Nothing really to say the game is worth buying if on sale and I highly consider making sure you have atleast a few friends constantly playing because playing online alone gets boring as hell after 10 hours. You also need a lot of grinding to buy anything cool but it doesn't really matter because you're gonna probably see modders in a lot lobbies (which is also a bit frustrating if they start spawning things everywhere) and they sometimes will start dropping money to the entire lobby.,Grand Theft Auto V

Some may say that GTA 4 had more realistic world and it may be true but if you consider everything else they did in GTA 5.. yeah its a good game. Nice story bigger world more variables heists online (allthou microtransactions are poor).This game is worth every dollar even at full price.,Grand Theft Auto V
