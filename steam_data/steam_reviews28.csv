2017-10-20,0,0,189,True,Not Recommended,As you can see I have a lot of hours in this game. I refuse to look at it at this point. Its pretty rewarding when you win but you have nothing to show for it when you do. Stats are erased monthly or something. It's literally just playing just to get coins to unlock loot boxes that will give you the 5th shirt in a row. Was kinda fun at first but eventaully it just gets repetitive. Nothing to keep you interested game's mostly just based on luck and what you can loot. If you're thinking of buying this game because you watched shroud get 16 kills in a game and it looked fun dont. Game is mostly just landing looting running for miles until you get shot from nowhere from a guy with a supressor. Devs suck and like I said the game gets boring. I would have a lot less hours but my group of friends were addicted to this game until they too got bored of it. No incentive to keep playing. Try Fornite honestly at least its free and there's a building component to it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-14,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,I'm genuinely confused as to why so many people play this game religiously! It's poorly optimised and the controls are trash. It comes to something when half of the Twitch streamers pan the game regularly for being utter crap.I play one or two KotH games and this just feels really awful in comparison to things like H1Z1 which in it's own right is far from perfect.Personally I couldn't recommend this game to anyone until it's gone through extensive development. Maybe give it twelve months? The issue then however is that the game will likely be completely dead.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-16,0,0,684,True,Recommended,It's hard not to give this game a great review after 400+ hours of enjoyment. PUBG has set the stage for other games to come. Not only is the game great but the support on Twitter and the PUBG Forums is by far the best I've ever seen. When you have a dev team and a community behind a game like how PUBG does you have greatness. This game is still in BETA and has so much going for it. There is a reason why this game has broken records already on Steam and it's not even a finished product.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,394,True,Not Recommended,Pubg overall is a great game and has great art direction. However the constant influx of chinese players on NA EU and other servers make the game unenjoyable. It constantly prevents communication especially in random duos and squads and is taken advantage of by hackers and more. Additionally in the start of the game the rubber banding is outrageous and you can barely move or pick items up for around 5 minutes easily allowing you to get killed leading to skewed statistics and a less enjoyable experience overall. If fixes were in place to prevent such problems and there was a better anti cheat and the rubberbanding is fixed this game would become amazing however where it stands right now (even with the 1.0 version on the test server) it is not enjoyable and extremely agitating to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-09,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is good and enjoyable to play. The issue is that despite the game being popular and out for some time there is a truly ungodly amount of lag. I have a stable connection with decent speeds and this game is forever lagging. People lag through doors being closed fist fights and can be stood still through an entire clip of an Uzi before they band to the other side of the building and kill you.Then there are the bugs. Holy God the bugs. People are clipping through everything guns randomly don't work and you can be firing madly through your scope and be hitting nothing but dirt because the game thinks you're prone when you are stood up.Not recommended on the sole basis that the developers seem to think that because it's popular they can sit and release a new map and forget that this is still early access and full of issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-27,0,0,158,False,Recommended,"Ahhh pubg. Some days you hate it's guts other days you feel like a badass. So let me start this review off with the fact that pubg is a Battle Royale game mode. 90 100 Players go in 1 comes out holding a banner that says ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"". So if your expecting it to be anything like COD or Battlefield let me clear up the air. It's not at all like either of those games. In pubg you go from building to buidling looting up getting in little skrimishs with other players over loot and slowly building up your gear. There is currently 2 maps in this game but there is places in these 2 maps that to this day I still have not explored. And keep in mind that each game you have one life. If you die your staying dead for good. And thats one of the reasons I find this game so much fun The Tension. Spending 10 15 minutes getting your favorite weapons then be in that tense situation where you might die and lose it all. It's heart pumping and very exciting. Even better if you play with friends. You are going to yell and scream at each other but trust me it's really nice to have someone watching your back and you don't have to poop your pants each time you get shot at from no where. As you can probably tell I love this game. But thats not too say it dosent have issues. There is a plentiful of bugs and glitches in this game not too even mention the obnoxius hackers that you might meet from time to time. But my number 1 issue with this game is the Price Point. It should in no way shape or form be $30 for this much content. There is 1 mode 2 maps and a handful of weapons. This game should be 20 25 dollars hell some could argue it could even go for 15. But there really isn't any games I can think of that really and I mean REALLY get your heart pumping. Each time I get top 10 I my pants. And there is no better feeling (besides shoving your donger into your dogs lubed up ) than winning a match. Knowing that you beat all those other players that out of the 100 players that went into that match you came out the king. The gunfights are fun and intense (Although most of the grenades are useless). Each major city has it's own feel to it (although nearly a lot of buldings share the same layout). The cars.... well thats not the finest point this game has as the driving is next to Watch Dogs in terms of quality....This game is amazing it really is. If the devs are smart it can live for ages as it has so far done better than any other Battle Royale game. Are you going to have moments in which you want to bash your skull against your desk at least 10 times? Yes. Is there going to be times that you want to beat the everliving out of that that just stole your win? Yep. But the game is damm fun even when your not having the best of luck. So do I recommend it? Heck Flippen Yes. Just try to atleast have one friend that also has the game. If I managed to encourage you to use your 30 bucks that you went through blood sweat and tears to obtain slap a comment and Heck I'll even play some rounds with you. So some wise words before I blast. Always down teamates Gilly Suit is broken as heck make sure to make as much noise as possible and pan is god tier.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you are considering buying it then take a look around for some gameplay there is plenty of it by now. One person specifically i can reccomend would be Aculite he is mainly PUBG based and puts out a new video everyday so you will never be short of PUBG content.This game is amazing when played by yourself and amazing when played with some friends all round a decent game. However there are some things that need to be fixed such as Desync but I think most games have that so it's nothing out of the ordinary it could also do with being a little bit better optimised but that's nothing that time can't fix when the devs fix it up. If you are looking for something fresh and new that gives you and adrenaline rush and a sense of adventure then this is definitely the game for you! If you purchase this game based upon my review then happy gaming!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-12,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,I have been playing this game for over 20 hours and have experienced a certain number of issues and bugs. My main issue is that every time I drop into the game the map doesn't fully load and a lot of textures and buildings are missing. It takes about two minutes for the game map to load in and by that time other players have the opportunity to collect loot while I sit there and wait. It isn't just my game either other players have posted on forums that they have the same issue. I asked my friend who has played the game longer than I have and has told me many players have the same issue. He gave me a few methods to try and solve this issue but none of them has worked. I hope that this issue gets fixed but until then I am going to stop playing this game until I see more improvements.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-28,0,0,348,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY Game is over run with Chinese hackers (teleporters / aimbots) Lag from 150+ ping from lack of region lock (shots don't hit target) Base game unstable &amp unfinished (regular crash to desktop) Developers unable to fix game breaking issues (many games are unplayable)Yes it might look good on Youtube but you've watched a polished video. Getting killed by hackers ends most games (someone appearing behind you in a closed room or a sniper shot with a handgun) skyhigh ping makes simple tasks like walking through doors or picking up weapons frustratingly impossible the program physically crashes to desktop at least once a session requiring a full PC restart and because developer Bluehole is rushing to put PubG on Xbox the major issues in the PC game aren't being worked on or fixed. Buy it if you want but be aware you're buying an unfinished potato that will make you want a refund once the shiny new game feels ware off.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It lacks polish has poor network code and isn't representational of a war shooter. The company responsible is probably up to their ears in server hosting costs which is why they're pushing for DLC revenue this speaks to a game that isn't sustainable.Don't waste your money on this.

2017-11-23,0,0,27,True,Not Recommended,"I voted this for my custom ""Most Boring Game I've Played"" catagory for a reason. Lets start from the begining the plane ride. You gotta make sure that no one else is going where you are because if you don't you'll get killed with a shotgun from a different house. Then if you find a good place to loot you start wel looting. Since the loot is randomized you have no idea about what kind of loot you're gonna get. You'll look around for a good 5 to 10 mins looking for a back pack and it'll usally be level 1. You'll search far and wide for either first aids a scope or a car. Speaking of cars if you're one of the lucky guys who landed in the circle like I said you're lucky! If you're not then you gotaa run run alot. The game pretty much just becomes a walking simulator. If you do find a car you'll usally get shot up in the first 1 5 mins of riding it. If you do get in a top ten situation its alot of waiting and just being prone. Then after 10 mins of that you'll get domed by a fully stacked level 3 god or streamer. So honestly this game is a waste of time and money. I kept going back to this game hoping praying that it'll get better but it never did. Its also full of glitches I don't wanna get into cause this review is already super long. 2.75/5 Stars.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You have to find everything in the world such as Weapons Attachments Ammo Clothes Vehicles and Consumables. The map will shrink every few minutes and push people into a small circle each time or you die. You only get one life so be prepared to be when you die to glitch bug or hackers. Its early access and the stability of the game shows it. Honestly there isn't much to the game but has a lot of replay value.

2017-08-25,0,0,458,True,Not Recommended,No other game has drawn me in like this game has. The simple nature of this game hides a very complex underbelly that rewards trial and error. Every gun has a purpose every step could mean life or death. Every move you make could be your last. Play this game is rewarding and beyond frustrating depending on luck. There are problems with the game but this game is in early access. Some problems are listed below. Poor performance Hackers and cheaters Poor server performanceThere have been some gripes about the Gamescon paid loot box however no skill items can be gained from those boxes. Only cosmetic items. The developer promised no paid boxes before early access and the promise was broken. The developers have weekly and monthly updates adding in balance patches more weapons and a new map with new vehicles. However the developer seems to focus on eSports rather than fixing the game. eSports should be the very last thing addressed however the developer seems to want have eSports before a stable well optimized game. Overall I would recommend this game if you have at least two other friends to play with. Even with the issues I have made my money back from playing this game by selling loot boxes in the Steam Market. I believe the issues will be addressed soon when the full release comes out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,443,True,Recommended,For being released only a few days ago to the public it has definetly outdone H1Z1 in my opinion. It can only get better from here and I can wait to see the improvments. With it being an early game still it does have its' imperfections but most are tolerable. Though in one game i played I jumped in a corner where there were boxes stacked up. I jumped on them so I could get a good line of sight and I got stuck xD.

2017-03-24,0,0,77,True,Recommended,Even though H1z1 and Battlegrounds are in the same genre theyre still pretty different.H1z1 is more arcady and action oriented while Battlegrounds is more tactical and slower paced. I like to compare it to other shooters. H1z1 feels like Call of Duty you basically dash around looking for kills. Jump out of driving cars shoot while moving/jumping and lesser logical things. It has a smaller variety of weapons and is more simplistic.Battlegrounds on the other hand is more like Counterstrike. Its more tactical and aim intensive. Small mistakes cost your life. Jumping out of driving cars hurts/kills you. Randomly shooting around gets you flanked fast. This game is more complicated with a bigger variety of weapons and add ons.This game has way less development time compared to h1z1 and already feels much more solid while h1z1 already has a more solid playerbase as of right now. I honestly prefer this game over h1z1 as of now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,22,True,Recommended,The (almost) perfect mix of arma and H1Z1. Best battle royale game I've played. For an alpha it's sure advanced little to no glitches way less than h1z1 which is funny because this game just came into alpha. I started by playing th solo gamemode which took a while to get you used to. Ctrl+T is useful to mute people in the waiting lobby from ear you. After my 7th game I finally placed first. I decided to play squad with 3 other random people and every pair I got matched with was really fun and supportive! 2 times in perticular were really fun because I got put in a twitch streamers group and another time I got put in a hardcore clan's group (but they were really nice even though I was too shy to talk) I carried them anyway 7 kills for the win baby nah they helped out a lot too. Everyone is 1000x nicer on here than most other games and there are very few glitches from my perspective it's just the occasional lag which once in a while (rarely) your in a gun fight and one of the dude's goes zipping around but it's not that bad. Unlike other battle royale games it's much more forgiving and you can hop right back into one and people don't run up to you and muder you instantly with a shotgun like in h1z1 unless your being dumb and go in the most populated area. Overall it was the most fun I've had in a game since Halo Reach came out and It's very nice for alpha honestly I wouldn't mind this being the final game product because its already better than h1z1 but there adding more loot and making more fixes and so its going to be even better which makes me happy!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,93,True,Recommended,I sold my CS skins for this game because I knew it was a better game than H1Z1. This is still really early in development so it needs some patches as it requires a FPS stability and FPS boost. Other than performance this game is amazing to play! The gunplay is amazing and the gun customization is a great touch for a battle royale game. After a good few of patches this game will be perfect. Highly recommended!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The ever collapsing ring of play keeps action focused and fast paced. Cons Servers can be *very* laggy sometimes to the point where you teleport in one place and can't move anywhere. Related to latency sometimes you can't pick up items/enter vehicles reliably. Since this is early access the game engine isn't fully optimized so FPS stays in the 60's even on lower settings.

2017-11-04,0,0,353,True,Not Recommended,Although this is a good game that I have had a lot of funs with a few problems hold it back from being truly great. To start the game is riddled with bugs and hackers but that is to be expected of an early access title and hopefully they will get ironed out by the time the game is released. In addition the battle points (BP) the you receive is heavy skewed toward queuing as a solo player with them receiving more the two times the BP as people in solos. This creates a system where you are punished for having friends. Lastly you are locked in a solos duos or squads the problem being that the game can but does not support differing amounts of people like 3 or 5. Now I know that the game can t have to many squad size options but at least don t make a group of 3 queue vs teams of 4 it s unfair and unnecessary. In conclusion I like the game but cannot recommend this game is its current state.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have a very slow internet with 3 mbps speed but for some reason this game lagged. A couple of my friends said that it is due to my laptop and some of them told me that the game is lagging due to my slow internet. Unfortunately I had to request for a refund of this game. I played it for 1 hour but the issue was that i joined the game where there was just 10 20 secs left that could be due to my internet and during the landing just on reaching close to the land my game always got froze. I went up ahead and used my mobile hotspot which gave me aroung 30 mbps speed which is still decent speed but the issue was still same. At this point of time I don't know what to blame. I hope there is a bit stability fixes so that I can play this because this is one of my best games which I want to play. My laptop was on high performance with my antivirus not running and it was plugged in too. I have a i3 4010U 1.70GHz processor with 4 Gb RAM and a 2 Gb integrated graphics card.

2017-03-23,0,0,295,True,Recommended,After testing through the BETA &amp Finally today purchasing and having now just finished my first full game on official release here is what I have to say in a few bullet points. Price is a little high for an EA Game however if you don't want to pay 28 you can go to the official site and pay through them and only pay 25 The game is amazing it's like another world. It looked amazing on lowest settings gun play is on point as &amp the overall combat is really intense and how it should be they really nailed it with the PVP. However perhaps they should consider removing rain as it causes FPS drops and the game is not yet optimized. Pressing tab causes a few seconds of a freeze that puts you in a very vulnerable position. ESPECIALLY if you're like me and play double monitors. Otherwise amazing 10/10. This is the game I've been waiting for.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-14,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Please switch to TABG or Fortnite or just stop playing Battle Royale because right now at least PUBG is a piece of hot garbage that should never be touched. The game is horribly optimized on evrey level if your internet and PC aren't top teir you probably shouldn't try. And even if you get in the game has pour textures stiff animations and huge bugs evreywhere. Same goes for combat which is slow and cluncky. Honestly if the game was cheap or at least free I wouldn't write this but the game is constantly shoving Loot Boxes DLC and Season Passes at any chance they get. Not to mention that they sued Epic for a genre that already existed. PUBG's creators are incredibly greedy. It's hard to believe.Right now Fortnite is free and TABG is around 5$.

2017-10-26,0,0,66,True,Not Recommended,"The game has nice realistic gun mechanics(real tight view of iron sites and ACOG chevron crosshair functions) compared to insurgency. But for gameplay wise the optimization at the moment needs improvement even with high end PC hardware trying to get at least 120 144 FPS is diffcult. For low end systems the typical FPS drop exprience walking around in the open FPS only improves when you are near &amp looking at a surface any scope above the red dot will kill your FPS. As for audio for the sake of realism it's quite loud lowering your volume will make it diffcult to hear good luck.It's going to take lots of practice just to get it right because you need to be checking tons of angles/corners while running around(this includes checking for players at a extremely far distance(if you play on low settings good luck with that) and getting used to aimming at moving targets that are very small(compared to other games I've played) will take practice(for some situations you need to aim a little further ahead of their direction they are walking in) There's no practice range unless you get into the lobby and pick up guns avaliable.The wide open field design of the main map + long range scopes + powerful guns that will kill you it's not fun. The game is filled with hackers at the moment that kill you with 2 bullets from an SMG vs someone with full armor. The only fun you will have is either camping and waiting out for atleast 30 50 players killing each other off to make it to top 10 or going for roadkills for your whole match.This game is pretty much hunger games with guns(due to the many players camping in various) and DayZ on steroids.The game isn't ready to be at full release and it's going to take until the end/near end of 2017 just to fix everything before it goes into full release in 2018. With all of it's unique features bugs and livestreamers abusing their privilege of getting people banned for ""stream sniping"" it's ridicolous you can be a streamer call out someone for doing said action even though they didn't they still get banned. As for custom games it's understandable they want to make that feature special and exculsive by having streamers host them(it's like a special occasion) Custom games isn't avaliable to everyone else until full release. There's no gamemode for practicing aim either. You'll just have be lucky and get into a streamer's game or volunteer to test stuff if you have some who can host.'As for feedback from the community. The next patch tends to come around every week(assuming they want to get as much feedback before next week) But again it's not a good idea to wait a whole week to relase the next patch they should of double checked before releasing their next patch update(s) The typical thing tends to happen next patch is released more bugs arise next patch will have to wait until next week and not 2 or 3 days frfom that day. For features that people want. I'm clueless as to who they listen to.The price of this game it's not worth 36.99 CAD",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I still prob wont play it just lil slow for me and a lot of luck based mixed with skill instead of just raw skill. but still good fun and the moments it has are very heart pounding and fun even if some matches you spend 15 minutes running around from people finding loot only to be killed in under 2 seconds of combat to go and do it again.... i like faster pace games these days i guess. but like i said still a great game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-21,0,0,336,False,Not Recommended,"Got convinced to buy it because friends rated it so highly. Held off in the past as it apparently ran terrible but with the latest patch now ""runs and looks great"".How wrong they were.Runs decently enough on high/ultra but still looks absolutely terrible. The sound is pretty horrific. Whilst the gun sounds just 'ok' everything else sounds utter garbage. The game engine feels like I'm playing Day Z back in the day when it was an ARMA mod. Everything feels so awkward and clunky. Animations look again awkward.I get this isn't a tripple A blockbuster game and it's in constant developement but in its current state I wouldn't recommend. It's going to take a hell of a lot of work to make this look and play like a game that was made in 2017/2018. Save your 30.FINAL UPDATE After sinking over 300 hours into this game and now trying the Blackout beta there is genuinely no reason to keep this game installed. This game is clunky and slow by comparison to the fast and fluid play of Blackout. Never thought COD would be able to do a decent BR but they've proved everyone wrong. PUBG's vision will never be realised. The dev team isn't capable of polishing up the game when the foundations the game is built around are so terrible.Slow uinintuitive movement. Vaulting feels awkward. Rewards players for sitting and hiding but hey thats 'tactical' right? This game won't withstand the onslaught of tripple A devs implimenting BR game modes into their games. PUBG will always be here but I think if the game survives with 100/200k peak players consistently it could be deemed a success.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-24,0,0,731,False,Not Recommended,This game was a lot more fun when it was in early access back in june since now with the 1.0 patch the few guns that were fun to shoot are now nerfed to the floorr for example the m416 is the only viable assault rifle option for close and min range combat the SCAR and the M16 are relatively good for close range combat but their muzzle velocity (bullet speed) received a big nerf if you shoot a target that is 400 500m away it will take your bullet around 2 seconds to reach wich doesn't feel fun nor realistic since those guns should have a muzzle velocity of around 870m/s... So basically a lot of guns are not good anymore and gunplay feels rather boring now.Another important point to mention is the abundance of BUGS and the poor server performance you will encounter in this game. You might join a game where everything goes perfect no lag no rubberbanding but then you will join a different match where the rubberbanding persists until there are 80 players remaining.And the final point probably the most important one THE CHINESE...No matter what game mode you play or in what server you are you will find a pretty good amount of cheaters and i bet you 80% of those will have a chinese name in the many hours i've spent playing this game with friends we have been wiped out multiple times by one of these scumbags and the worst thing is that the creator of the game seems to dislike the idea of the quickest solution you can implement to stop this problem which is region locking.But i guess the game has its good things kills are somewhat satisfying playing with friends is really fun Q times are very fast and you can make a bit of money off crates.And if you're wondering why i have so many hours played in this game its simply because i play with friends D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The developers say they don't want the game realistic? Then why make headshots deadly? A shot in the Head is NOTHING speacial! It's a completely idiotic thing that emerged from some dumb old memes... When you give someone a headshot what does it do? SUPER kill him? Why not a throat shot? spine shot? heart shot? And if the head is so vulnurable... then why not actually cover more than 20% of your head with a nutshell? Why is something as UNIMPORTANT as a heart protected by a vest while your INCREDIBLY important brain is protected by garbage?Seriously screw you developers! No matter how you turn it emptying a Micro UZI into someone and then getting headshot by that person with a freaking PISTOL is beyond ridiculous. Just a joke how i literally NEVER die when i run over open fields but when i am in a cover and shoot at someone who i BARELY see through 2 windows and 20 obstacles that person INSTANTLY turns around and headshots me...Freaking fix your problems with the game already and stop the t EA excuse. You sold your game we demand that you make it actually playable. Shooter with 1000 ms ping servers are NOT playable. Shooter with cheaters in them ALSO NOT PLAYABLE!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Fully polished game of the start? I just hope this game won't get stuck in Early access for like 5 years. Pros No grind. What ever i do in this match will have zero effect on next match. This is big for me because players that have played this game for a while don't have any advantage over anyone.(except knowledge and skill.) Hope it stays this way. Patches and Updates means Devs did not just drop this game. Cons Yes there is plenty of work to be done optimizing game performance on lower end of hardware. Jumping.

2017-11-26,0,0,313,True,Not Recommended,I used to really enjoy this game and I have played it for over 240 hours. I'm constantly on and off of this game because I can't beat the terrible optimization. (GTX 960 i7 6700k) and still at 50 fps on LOW. I can assure you right now this is not just because of my computer because it wasn't like this when it first came out and many other people are having the same problems as me. I feel like I'm falling in a ditch when I play this game and at times the servers can be very laggy and you will have terrible d sync. Overall give it a 4/10 score.

2017-09-23,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,"The Game Playerunkown's Battlegrouns is a fun fast action survival game. It contains a similar nostalgia to games such as DayZ. As you jump out the plane and descend to the island you look around to make sure no one will get to the loot first. You play quickly to gather supplies to gain advantages in gun battles. The gun battles are mostly intense and as you get close to victory every gun battle means more. You attempt to play from the shadows and only engage when needed. Finally it's down to a handful you lay down in the grass and crawl 100 meters to get into the next zone......... This is where the game lacks there is no skill involved it's simply a aim battle or you get shot in the back. This needs adjusted possibly to make the point always close onto a town? This would spicy up gameplay and make it much more interesting even allowing the circle to change sizes near the end of the game would be great. This would allow a sniper to be an effective gun near end game instead of people blindly throwing grenades. However I will most likly continue playing this game for the laughs i have with my friends. Nothing is funnier than messing with others!Thoughts on the Company Bluehole Inc. fell short when critizing Unreal for adopting the Battle Royale gamemode into their own game Fortnite. The engine used to create PUBG is Unreal Engine and critizing the company who gave you rights to use your engine is sad. Epic's Fortnite looks fantastic and attempts to add in a new spin when it comes to theiir version of Battle Royale. You can quickly build cover and weapons function completely different than other ""Battle Royale"" type games.The history of PUBG is a very interesting but as many recall H1Z1 created their own version of Battle Royale as well. PUBG was the furthest from the first and the whole concept is based off a movie to begin with.*This idea was not an original conept to start with*This game is honestly just garbage",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It takes skill its not pay to win it is very slightly luck (to the minimalist) and can become very heated and intense. Lets start with the pros.Pros The 4 things I listed aboveGood aiming mechanicsGood weapon balancingUpdates that keep the game freshLoud sounds so you can hear where an enemy isTHE MUTE TOGGLE.Meh Decent driving physicsGood sounds (but sound noises dont really matter as much as how well you can hear them so I put this in the meh section)Cons Bad accessory balancing. (Backpack level 1 3 Helmet level 1 3 Vest level 1 3)Cars unbalanced as hell (WHY DO YOU NEED A MINIBUS THAT DRIVES AROUND THE SPEED OF A CRICKET)Bad hit registration.Streamers in general cause a lot of issues in the community causing false bans sometimes.Pretty rough on bad computersOverall the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion hit registration isnt as bad as in CS GO or anything just a little off putting.

Vaulting does not always work2. wtf are the chineese doing on the NA servers? they lag so much and just scream at you in chineese as you kill them! Have you devs actually played your game on a public NA server? There are 99 people and 67 of them are chineese half way across the globe. make it so it auto detects your region.3. Why are people allowed to make it so the grass and trees dissapear three feet from them? I can have a guille suit and be hiding in the grass in a bush and someone 100 meters away snipes me with an m16 and when i look at the death cam thier foilage was set to extremely low and their view distance too and they can see a hairy guy laying out on a polygonal hill.4.inconsistancy. From cars to grenades you name it it is inconsistant. I can be behind a wall 3 rooms away from a grenade and it can kill me. I can be driving on a motor cycle and all of a sudden on a paved road i flip out of controll and die.5.

It is not perfect (after all it is early access but it is damn close) but outside of the little bugs and such this game is just so much fun! The concept is so simple but so enticing and you just want to keep going back for more. I just purchased PUBG about 2 weeks ago and have over 60+ hours played already (mind you I have a full time job and family I support) and I really wish I had bought it sooner. I am having a total blast. I have personally been playing in 1st Person I feel it is more challenging and no 3rd person camera advantages. (My kids have some friends that will only play in 3rd person so I have played some 3rd) But not trying to take from either mode they are both just so much damn fun. The RNG hates me but even so I am still just truly having so much fun with PUBG.This game is growing so fast and I now understand why. 611 676 All time peak as of 8/13/2017.I would strongly recommend this game!BTW the Chicken Dinner is delicious too it s even more delicious if you can have it all to yourself in a solo matchEnjoy!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Games good strange things happen when the game gets updated for example low fps when you are trying to grab the gun right in front of you and you cant seem to just grab it right off the floor where you clearly see it and China.

2018-03-31,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,This game is a hot mess from a technical standpoint. Was looking forward to enjoying this game after playing PUBG mobile but thought a PC version controlled with the mouse and keyboard would be an amazing experience. How so wrong I was from the moment I downloaded the game I had tried every possible solution to solving the stuttering that occurred ingame. Every few seconds a microstutter would occur and cause your character to jump around slightly this in an intense firefight would mean you are on the losing end 9/10 times. This leads on to the optimization of the game NOT GREAT my pc specs are quite high and can run GTA at 1440p no problem. I have an RX 480 8GB version with a i5 6600k and this game totally destroys all hope of being able to run it smoothly even with everything on very low settings I was unable to hit 120fps the refresh rate of my monitor and I can tell you the game is not graphically exciting in anyway.As for the gameplay the controls were tight and the whole concept is intriguing but held back by its technical flaws I was never truly able to appreciate its beauty. If the problems were resolved in a later update then I may consider repurchasing the title to give it another chance. As for now I DO NOT recommend this game as it will give you more headache than enjoyment. For the price its not a bad buy luckily I was able to get a refund or I might as well have thrown that money into the sea and just forgotten about.For now just enjoy the free of charge nature of PUBG mobile as they have done a terrific job of fitting a game of that size into a mobile genre aside from the mediocre controls that a touch screen can provide its an enjoyable ride with friends.Hopefully they get their act together and sort out the mess that is the PC version however doubful that may be as they have found ways of making more cash from the xbox and mobile versions.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-25,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,TL DR if you want to shoot people and don't like wasting time on t play Counterstrike or Battlefield.Gameplay spend 2 minutes queuing up and parachuting down land away from your team mates spend 2 minutes looking for a weapon maybe wound 1 guy get killed by his squad. There is no ing reason you can't just spawn on the ground with a weapon and save 5 ing minutes of your life per match. Weapon damage is random weapon range is completely inadequate for a game based on a large open world map it feels like you are trying to play a Battfefield map in Counterstrike. Like CawaDoody this game caters to filthy casuals by making luck a huge factor in gameplay since you rely on finding randomly placed weapons to fight randomly placed enemies.Performance You get random lagspikes and rubber banding in pretty much every match annoying but not unplayable. The game looks like absolute on ultra with horrible object pop in and vomit inducing aliasing for a game where you have to stare into distance a lot this is completely unacceptable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-10,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,This game takes you back to the start screen every time you die. It might seem petty but going through 3 loading/connecting screens before a actual match even begins to load is really stupid. If there was just a button that put you in another match when you died/lost it would he much smoother and much less agonizing. The playable area shrinks really fast. There's nothing like spending the entire play time running to a safe zone just to be told that's it's shrinking again. Then getting shot in the back by someone who has the same issue as you but slightly worse. Cars aren't common enough. Which really is a blessing as much as it is a curse. Overall I think the game will turn out really good when it's done. But right now it's still rough.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-09,0,0,411,True,Recommended,I have played many EA titles and this seems to be the only one I have ever played where the updates have actually improved the optimization of the game. It is by no means totally optimized or even remotely close to being fully optimized but I have seen actual improvement from when I bought the game at release which is a good thing. I would ignore the people with less than 50ish hours complaining about hackers and RNG being terrible and what not. Obviously there are hackers but they are few and far between. The RNG part of it just as often gives you the win as it gives you the loss.The only thing to me that is currently making the game less fun is the huge latency/ping issues going on. I already love the game in its current state (im a battle royale junky) but if you are somebody frusturated by latency issues in its current state you may find a lot of frusturation. However as I said earlier the updates are actually making the game better and not just pushing out as much content as possible (i.e. ark) and the game already feels better than even a month or so ago.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-06,0,0,383,True,Recommended,I really wish people would stop hating this game based on the fact they introduced micro transactions. Monthly updates they do listen to the community whether people choose to believe that or not if there is a problem with the game they tend to fix it within a few hours. They add what we want yeah they added creates you can still unbox normal ones that are free and don't cost anything to open you don't have to buy them it's only clothes.But the game is amazing other than the vac wave after summer sales cs go was unplayable at ranks higher than lem due to the amount of hackers and nothing was being done instead of fixing lag and hit boxes valve added gloves and more ways to make money. Battlegrounds is the best of it's kind in battle arena genres evident by the sales and positive reviews. I shouldn't have to go into why this game is amazing other people have already done that. But stop saying you don't recommend this game because of the micro transactions that make no difference to the competitiveness and play of the game. If people want to buy keys for clothes they will. You don't have too it doesn't effect you you can still get the other creates for free.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also they already might have a lack of active players.I got this game as a present and it was nice in EA. Now most of it is just rubbish. I wish i could give it back and to give the money that was payed for it back to my friend so we might have used the money for something good.Also try to stay away from any PUBG Communities most of them are toxic or hard try players.I know most of this may be my own opinion but listen to my advice and do yourself a favor Dont ever give any money for this Game/Devs/Company.

2018-06-21,0,0,888,False,Recommended,I love this game because there is nothing else like it... but that said... it's the most broken laggy awkward piece of garbage game I have ever played in my life. And yet... I am totally addicted.The devs constantly release updates making this game worse and worse... breaking things and nerfing / buffing guns in ways that make the gameplay stupid and frustrating. You can spend months learning the backwards and unrealistic weapon system they have created only to have them turn everything upside down and turn you into a noob again. On top of that gameplay dynamics (like the bullet drop system) are broken in ways that make me sick. For example If a person if strafing while ADS (walking VERY slowly side to side) and you put your crosshairs on their head from 50 yards away your bullet will miss. Sure they tried to take into account bullet speed trajectory ballistics and moving targets... but they failed so miserably trying to make this aspect of shooting ANYWHERE NEAR reality that it's not even funny. Using sniper rifles (or any rifle at range) is so laggy and delayed that they are practically unusable. Not only is this worse than ANY first person shooter I have ever played it is laggy and inconsistent which makes it even worse. Also with NO ping matching system in effect you are playing against people who have faster pings than you (a MAJORLY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE in close quarters combat) and people with slower pings than you (Which makes combat awkward and unreliable since they are shooting at you or at least where you were 600ms ago which makes you able to die when you are around corners and behind cover.) This is the result of client side hit detection laggy crap servers and pubg being too afraid to region lock the servers to keep players on the servers that reside on the continent that they are playing on. Clearly PUBG Corp is just in it for the money and won't do pingmatching or region locking (like EVERY OTHER FIRST PERSON SHOOTER ON THE PLANET IMPLEMENTED 20 YEARS AGO) because they're too afraid to off their largest customer base China. Chinese players cheat the most and play on NA servers which makes fighting them very frustrating and unfair (due to the reasons mentioned above). But hey China has the most customers which means the most $$ to milk out of people with their rip off crate **SHOULD BE ILLEGAL** gambling system and now even bigger rip off season pass.All in all this game is unlike any other game which is why it is still popular but the company is clearly 1000% just in it for the money and try their best to ruin the fun for everyone. Mostly every development they have made in the last 9 months has been CLEARLY just to milk the players for cash while neglecting to fix OBVIOUS problems and ignoring their players' feedback.I CAN'T WAIT until another developer makes a similar game (realistic graphics loot etc) that doesn't have these money hungry bastards behind it who seem to be master marketers and amateur coders. Until then I guess I'll keep putting up with this laggy broken scam of a game because hey... There's just nothing better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes it takes time to get good and figure it out. When i first got the game I would rage quit constantly. YOU NEED TO PRACTICE!! If you have bad performance maybe turn your resolution down! This went from one of my least favorite games to I can't stop playing this game. I even play with a xbox one controller yet i am still ranked in the top .86% on solo third person perspective. That's my entire career playing this game even with letting friends play for hours and my first 50 hours of getting slaughtered. TRUST ME... this game is a solid 9/10 by now with all of the updates and effort the developers have put into making it better. The only thing i would ask for is better controller support (I can't set my aim down sight setting to left trigger hold). And also $2.50 for a key to unlock a crate? come on... you would be making plenty of money charging $1. But most of these things end up getting fixed.

2017-07-01,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is promising but the current state of it is garbage.Half of my review centers on the fact that it is the most demanding game out there resource wise (Because it has barely any optimisation). My specs are just a bit above the minimum requirments and for me it's still unplayable AT TIMES. I can get decent matches sometimes. I like that the DEV's keep on trying every month to make it better but I was expecting heavy optimization focus month by month. Performance wise it's barely any modification..... even if they say they make great imrpovements. That's 1/4 of the patch notes. The rest (3/4) of the patch notes are game balance changes (Why isn't this postponed until the game runs decently?) new maps (Why isn't this postponed until they get close to the full release?) or new mechanics (Why isn't this postponed until the game runs decently?). Answers for all of this is simple. A lot of people (With good PC's bought the game now. They will focus on delivering content for those that can actually play the game. So great for you guys be happy enjoy it. I will have to stay and wait for 6 months to a year maybe until I can play it decently.The other half of the review centers on other issues Ghost bullets + Ghost punches (I'm so tired of dying just because the server doesn't register the shots/punches) Worst possible clunky mechanics for melee weapons. Throwables (Grenades/Smoke grenades/Flashbangs) are utterly useless in my opinion. By the time you position and throw a grenade you can be shot 2 or 3 times. The throwing mechanic is just bad. Hackers. I understand they are trying to deal with them but they just keep popping back out.Pro's I find it enjoyable to drive the bike. It can get to a decent 100+ km/h speed. Not the most realistic crashes/jumps but it's fun. When I'm tired of the points I listed above I just drive until the circle is too small and the players with good aim kill me. I just wanna drive and be free man.....All in all it's a good bike driving simulator. (Until its full release).... (Or whenever it will playable),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you drop from the plane in the beginning and land good luck hitting anything moving because either you the enemies or both are teleporting all over the screen because of desync between client and server.Then there's just the plain latency with the game. You can use this website (https //pubg.disquse.ru/) to test your ping against their servers. If you have more than 150 200 ping on any server steer clear of that region. There's literally only 2 servers on that entire list that gives me less than 150 ping and you cannot choose which server you play on. Only the region.Then there's the item spawns. The item spawns are so pathetically and are spawned procedurally. But because of massive lag and desync when you land a lot of times the game doesn't even spawn weapons in that area. I have played so many games where I literally clean out several houses and can't find a single gun. Or if i do it's almost always a handgun. Not to mention because items are spawned procedurally the developers and dictate whether or not you get good loot spawns or not by just turning down the % on certain guns loot table for your account.The desync causes massive problems when you're shooting at enemies. You could unload half a magazine into someone then suddenly die and guess what. You probably did no damage to your enemy because the game didn't even register your shots.This game is ridiculously broken. Aside from the lag and desync then there's bugs.There's a damage bug where even if you have full level 3 armor and helmet you can still take full damage from whatever gun you're being shot with. There's also bugs where you can get stuck in rocks stuck in walls and doors. There's texture bugs where people can't even see buildings and can see players running around in buildings through the walls. Then there's cheaters. People aimbot wallhack you name it. People also glitch the game where they can stand inside the ceiling and shoot you through the floor and you can't even really see them except just barely parts of the soles of their feet that are clipping through the floor.Do not buy this game if you're looking to have fun. It isn't ready and Bluehole should not be charging people money for a game in this state.If you're wondering how bad the lag is see below https //www.youtube.com/watch?v MLZKMZzVnsshttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v 8ZzijG1Dkpkhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v rEL51EX18s8https //www.youtube.com/watch?v o0s1WZ 97O0https //www.youtube.com/watch?v J5y2k41MDeg,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-08,0,0,25,True,Not Recommended,2/5It's an okay game needs a lot of improvement before the final release. Game loses connection to the network often or has other bugs such as unable to enter doorways.Although you can switch the mode by default your automatic weapon is a single tap weaponMy last biggest issue with the game is why don't the devs add a simple kill cam? When your down to the last few or sometimes even halfway you'll get sniped from somewhere faraway and never know where you were killed from.With all these issues aside it is a fun and enjoyable game to pass the time however I would not recommend this game until some serious improvements are made.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If im getting shot at i should know where tf the enemy is. Like what the hell dude if im getting shot at my back i would know the enemy would be behind me because the bullet would be stuck in back! I know it would be unfair to add the direction of where the enemy is by being shot but can you ******* add a feature or texture where when you get shot you would see blood pouring out of a certain area of your body so you would have a theory of where the person is shooting you at? If you guys add this in BIG THANK YOU if not WHERE IS THE LOGIC IN THE GAME??? Or at least that would be what im questioning right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,0,True,Recommended,So one night me and some friends went out for a night of partying at one point we choose to go back to my place and continue our little drinking session so we get to my place and in my drunken state i turn on my pc and see that this game is on sale.Drunk me then proceede to say it and asked one of my friends who i knew had the game if it was any good? in which he was very quick to say it was one of the greatest games he has ever played so after hearing that drunk me choose to buy the game and i quickly loaded up a few rounds to just learn the controlsLet's skip forward to the next day right? i get up take a shower and all that and i turn on my PC to see that drunk me bought this game.So now that i am pretty much sobered up i choose to take a proper game and see how long i can last and if it's any fun so i load up a game. And i get myself some gear which was an AK a pump action shotgun and an M9 Beretta.I also picked up a helmet a bulletproof vest and yada yada.After then running for around 15 min without seeing anybody and trying to stay inside of the force field so i don't die i finnaly see a guy all by his lonesome which i starts to shoot at with the AK.Somehow i manage to hit everything but him? so i hide behind a tree to change to my shotgun and he suddenly comes jumping around the tree which i was hiding behind he then proceedes to take a few shots at me and i die?So i am now dead and all i now see is he starting to teabag me and nacking my before running off into the wild to kill more people.....First game went as smooth as it could ever go.... 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's funnier to play than CS GO because you have to move all the time so you don't get sniped from a AWM from a 1km distance.

2017-09-05,0,0,43,True,Recommended,Product received for free. A great and fun game. I suck at shooters due to some colorblind and poor sight issues but with this game I can bring things close quarters enough to where i can find/see people enough (especially with how loud moving around is). There is only one life and as soon as you die you can move on to the next game. There is virutally NO WAIT TIME for matches when searching ever. The devs have so many plans for this game that are crazy amazing. I used to play H1Z1 KotK (some) and this FAR outshines that game (along with the weird similar one Ark had made). It is still i nits early stages but already is great. I have a not so great processor and can run it decently on bare minimal settings (though sometimes I have a render issue at the beginning for a minute or so). After some research found out the game can at times use 8gb of ram (which is all the ram I have). It's a very thrilling and exciitng type of game. This is better thanany crappy call of duty or battlefield game any day and anyone who tells you otherwise just needs to get gud. Devs are VERY GOOD with banning and taking care of modders/cheatters and any problems with servers including bugs anmd such they fix very qucikly and address almost right away. There is no pay to win aspects the only thing you can pay for is crates that will give you some cosmetic items that do nothing more than be cosmetic. Games have 100 people in them typically and you choose where you drop in at from a plane going across the map. I'd say 8.5/10 just because opitimzation issues are a thing currently and can be bit bad for ppl with lower end processors or ppl on just high settings even when capable of running those settings and highly recommend for sooter fans and peopole who like one life only survival games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-22,0,0,219,True,Not Recommended,Let me start off by saying that the game has potential it definitely does but could I recommend PUBG to you right now? Definitely not and here's why The game is filled with bugs ranging from glitchy textures to game crashes after every couple of rounds Performance. I get that it's an Early Access game and they all come with performance issues but I feel like we should be asking more from a dev who certainly has the money and tools to fix this. Sound. So apparently you can get tinnitus from playing this game? If that's not a sign that something needs fixing then I don't know what is. Lag and latency issues. In a game like this where every second you could get shot from 15 different angles and your reaction time is crucial de sync and lag issues shouldn't be a thing it should be the first thing that the devs address. Instead we're getting 50 more pants and t shirts and the de sync isn't going away anytime soon.

2017-06-18,0,0,67,True,Recommended,I love this game.Nothing gets your heart racing as much as this game unfortunately it is plagued with I don't know what to call it unless it is hacked.loss of audio from from a single headphone channel and plagued with enemies that I can't seem to hit with all the advantages that can possibly be gained from every item avaliable from the game.If this isn't aimbotted I don't know what else could explain it and as much as I enjoy it and despite getting into the top 10 20% of the time I have never won a game.I would just warn players that if there was ever a chance of winning it is perhaps dimished by what I could only measure as some god like ability that you could never have a chance of countering.My best place of #2 was meet with some godlike countering abilities at the very least and the fact I haven't made it further only adds to my conclusion that there is perhaps some players altering the odds in their favour.I think there is nothing quite like this game unfortunately made unplayable by whatever it is that is making the odds of winning so unlikely my time is better spent elsewhere I will in the future invest in a console version hoping this will be rectified but I will forever be suspicious that this game is not tweaked to advantage a certain few.Is it worth your money probably but is it worth your time probably not.Just to add you need a hefty graphics card to play this game I haven't had much trouble as meeting the graphics standards with anyother game than this one with an amd rx460 you can expect to run the lowest settings at 1080p and pretty much every other game medium to high to ultra I think this game desperately needs optimisation.Glad I can get away with playing this at the lowest settings but so many other games look soo much better and detail it makes me wonder where the focus is perhaps this is something the developers will delve into later but it seems almost a crux point when it comes to playability.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There will be moments when u think a death is BS or something doesn't work probably but that just comes with a early access game.People moaning about micro transactions are actually stupid.

2018-03-25,0,0,25,False,Not Recommended,When I frist started playing this game I really enjoyed it and wanted to get better at it. I found the iea of parachuting in and then working with whatever you found to be exciting and loved the feeling of finding some great weapons and armour and then going about seeing how long I could last.Graphics are pretty good but frame rrate does drop sometimes but the game is only just out of early access so I expected all this. What I didnt expect was for the game to suddenly stop working after the last patch. Now it gets to the opening credits and crashes nearly every time. When I do get to play (about once in twenty loads) the game will crash once I try to exit back to the main menu and back we go again to trying many times for a lucky chance at playing the game.Many people seem to be having problems with the game and thats why I cant recommend spending 26.99 on a game that is probaly going to cause you issues somewhere. I hope they sort this game out soon but right now save your money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-25,0,0,433,False,Not Recommended,This game has some of the most satisfying ways to kill people! Unfortunately everyone and their moms hack on this game. I know PC games that that is a common scenario but this game is the worst with it(excluding CS GO). Its lag is unbearable and honestly its not really any fun anymore. This is exactly why everyone is jumping off this bandwagon. I'm on my way out too now. If you plan to play seriously then this game will infuriate you unless you choose to purchase some of the hacks online. If you don't care about that stuff then you may still enjoy this game. I might take some games too seriously and thats my issue but I can't even enjoy this game anymore. Maybe everyone is not hacking but I can spend a whole 2 clips shooting at people that should be ez pz kills and then i just get slaughtered... I've been playing shooters on PC since Counter Strike 1.5 and I doubt I'm that garbage at shooters... but i digress I can't enjoy a game that just isn't fair to play anymore.

I do shoot terrible sometimes but not EVERY SINGLE TIME...I spend 30 hours on this game for nothing but I am more sad about the money I actually spend to buy this game which is 30 euros (in my opinion highly overpriced). The game is firstly not worth the money not even 15 euros (it's only expensive because of the popularity). All in all it could have been an amazing game (popularity aside) but things like this stupid things actually is what makes me hate it (PUBG Mobile at least has more realistic hit boxes and you can kill someone on close range).

2017-12-14,0,0,506,True,Recommended,Highly recommend this game. I run 65 90 fps on 2560 x 1440 everything on ultra and shadows on low. Does this game need a little work with optimization yes but remember it's early access and it's only been out for 9 months. Now keep this in mind it's in early access and already out on console. What does that tell you about this game? It's going somewhere! I use to be that H1z1 player but that game is nothing compared to this game. Yes there's a bit of lag but it clears up. This game actually takes skills to play and a decent PC setup. If you see people complaining about fps lag and such. There's always something that can fix it. Stop playing on a 4k 2560 x 1440 monitors that your pc cannot handle. Run it on 1920 x 1080 with high settings or just let your invidia driver program handle the optimization. Choose servers that are in your region instead of playing ones far away. Keep in mind of ping/weather for those regions could effect server lag. I for one would give it a 10/10 if they fixed the small lag and scripters. Hackers will always be in a game no matter what but nothing compared to h1z1 and csgo like my god there's a lot on those. So in this case I would give a 8.5/10. If you have anything less 1070 with an exception of the 980ti do not bother playing on high/ultra settings or if you have a bad cpu. A lot of people will be complaing because they expect to play them at those settings with knowing its in early access and that their pc's are pretty trash.

2018-02-04,0,0,102,False,Recommended,My Very First Shooter and I picked a good one. I've heard some have described this one as a horror movie where everyone is the last survivor and everyone else is the monsters and that is definately true of single player where any noise is a potential opening for a quick death. But what describes both single player and the wacky hijinx of multiplayer is the force of Rogue like on game.Having a random plane path generally random loot random circle of death placement random red zone etc forces you to think on your feet gives opportunity and keeps things fresh hour after hour where death isn't a real drag as again Rogue like like you just reque. Gunned down in the beginning as you search two whole buildings and only find melee and smoke grenades? Smoke 5 dudes only to die on the move to the second circle? Die in a fingernail biting battle of inches for 2nd? Ya in ya out a multiplayer Shooter Roguelike all without killing skill or punishing new players.I like how the maps work with the little details of each settlement and the general design of each makes for some neat stories and strategies especially considering they're largely a collection of asset flips with some bespoke key features.There are problems. Performance issues still haunt the game like lag upon landing the far corners of the map are nearly useless to bother with since it's so far from a circle that's not in the same corner and the flipping of crates on the Steam marketplace while *quite* profitable (I've more than paid off the $30 entrance fee) is attracting cheaters that already are a bane to on line shooters despite Blue Hole's best efforts.So yeah it's flawed but it's incredibly addictive with its tamed simulation and mountains of tension. I can't wait until the new map is out and the hunt for my next Chicken Dinner to continue on a new map.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-06,0,0,167,False,Not Recommended,BE in mind that this is a pretty long paragraph soo yea...I am rewriting this review because it really is a terrible game. Player Unknown's Battle Grounds should never of been released because I feel cheated for my money here are some of my reason. I can go into 5 buildings find nothing except a pistol or crossy. Someone else can go into a Crap Shack and find an AR. That is so unbalanced. It should never be like that. One person able to go into a small building and find a Good gun where as the person who goes into the more buildings gets nothing. The toxic players Now im not really talking about what they say but more of what they do. If you are apart of a squad and there teammate is in DBNO state and you finish them off. Now I get it if you are down to like the last 25 but people just keep on doing it. You also get people who wait in a corner for 5 mintues because they are a sweaty tryhard My next point is the D Sync so many times I have been screwed over by it. I go around a corner 2 sec later dead. Peak a corner 2 sec later dead. Its happened time and time again. Spawns now this is kinda continuation of my first point. I hate how nothing spawns. This game is suppose to be fun and how are you suppose to do that with a Lv 1 vest and a smoke gerande.

2017-07-19,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,"As it stands now I personally cannot reccommend this game in good faith as the game currently stands. Now whether or not the problems that led are my fault or the games fault I am writing this with my experience in the game thus far in mind.Pros Plethora of weapons and customization Very tactical combat due to Arma heritage Does the ""Battle Royale"" style of game very well Can go in alone or with friends or play custom games Very pretty environment (should you have the horsepower to use those graphical settings)Neutral You will die a lot due to being surprised ambushed or picked off from someone who is half a mile away and there is nothing you can do about it The controls are somewhat clunky and take a little time to get used to (Thanks Arma...) The Blue Screen of Death is fast as hell and you better have a good head start or you will be hurting (or dead) Cons*NOTE* These cons are subjective as I do not know if this happens much to others or not. These come from my experience over the 30+ hours playtime. Your experience may differ from mine Lag. I am not sure if they have yet to really get the kinks out server side or it's just my side but LAG is all too prevalent in the game. It is frequent and bad enough to bring the flow of the game to a screeching halt and break the immersion. On top of this it has led to my death multiple times and having to start a new match without even getting to actually play that round. Graphics. Now remember how I said that the environment was pretty? Well it can take quite a while to load all of the assets and that can break game immersion too. My computer is no slouch either. It's a decent machine with a 6th gen i5 8GB of Ram and a GTX960 but the game only runs smoothly on the lowest settings. Like the lag the graphics can (and most cases it will) halt and freeze the game until it is done loading and can lead to you dying before getting the chance to get going. On top of this while loading the assets the buildings look like a 4 year old tried to waterpaint each one but kept sneezing on it with each stroke. Stress.HO BOY is this game going to stress you out. Now to be fair some might enjoy the heart pounding and stress that comes with playing this game but for me it borders on anxeity. When you are running around doing well and surviving you feel great. When you start having to be careful trying to sneak around everything makes you jump. EVERYTHING. Then add someone who kills you since they were behind you the entire time and ends it all for you. Repeat that 30x and you will forcefully say you need to stop for the day. It doesn't feel good. This can largely be avoided if you play with friends but if you play solo better start going to the therapist amigo.TL DR The game is good but lag graphical work load and stress ruin it. I will update this when these issues are or are not resolved. I will also continue playing the game since let's face it I'm a game addict at times. The stress can be handled with various means on the player side but network lag and the graphical workload need to be optimized before the game can reach its true potential. There is a lot to like about the game but the main issues are too big to ignore.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-13,0,0,180,False,Not Recommended,This is the first Hentai I've seen that doesn't make me feel a slight sense of shame just for liking it. It's so well done the relationship between the two main characters is actually believable. Their thoughts behavior even the dialog is relatable if slightly exaggerated. This is a story of two people a student and a teacher who are falling madly in love with each other and are afraid of the consequences a relationship like theirs will have on their life.Most importantly the sex is passionate. The kissing is the best I've ever seen in hentai and they are just all over each other. It kind of reminds me of a high school relationship. Sex is new hormones are raging and the two just can't stay away from each other. They seemed glued together and all they want to do is which is exactly what I get from our two main characters. Since a student/teacher relationship is so taboo they don't know how to proceed or what to do with their feelings. Again just like a young and newly sexually active couple. It also doesn't waste too much time with the plot yet still gets you interested and the character development often occurs during the sex scenes. It some how manages to have an engaging story without interrupting the mood. Especially when compared to a lot of other Hentai the ratio of erotica and plot/character development leans greatly towards the former.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have hours and hours on this game (and I'm going to continue to play this game). The game has a pretty easy learning curve but once you get up there in place it gets much harder and you win rarely (unless you're a GOD at the game). I personally enjoy it more with friends appropriate mostly for teenagers. This game is much better optimized and you need a fairly decent computer to run it.

2017-12-26,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Just got this game for Christmas. As a FPS it's pretty sloppy. Everything handles like it's coated in butter. Expect a lot of sliding. I frequently place in the Top 20 not because I'm good but because that's how long it takes me to locate another player. The timers really need to be shortened. Once you're in the middle of the circle and you have all the gear you need there's nothing to do for the next 20 minutes except sit in a bush and go grab a sandwich. It's mostly wait wait wait wait wait die to camper. I can't give it a thumbs down because maybe some people like that sort of thing. Basically the game goes like this when you teleport to the airplane a bunch of Asian people shout in your ear. Then you find one gun and a bicycle helmet and spend the next 20 minutes holding down sprint. Then you get killed by someone who has been lying prone in a bush since the game started. Restart.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-29,0,0,105,False,Recommended,I've sunk about 10 hours this past week into Pubg when the 1.0 released and I must say to the devs well done.Pros Gameplay is fun and addicting I get over 40 FPS on my crappy computer Squad and duo feature allow for even more fun with friends The new map Miramar is a great addition to the game and is way better in my opinion to their first map A lot of guns(AKM Scar M416 M16 etc.) keep the shooting fun but challenging Not too expensiveCons Servers are laggy as balls as of this moment(12/24/17). I rubberband constantly until the player count drops to under 80. Makes it almost unplayable Not relatively cheap either Game is kind of optomized but not to the level it should be atOverall the game is really good but my major complaint as of right now is the lagging. If that would be fixed I would love the game even more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-15,0,0,2842,False,Recommended,PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive) after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60 70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...This is what will happen every game you'll feel rage anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one. Pros1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet Deciding your next 'safe spot' etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil bullet travel time and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.Cons1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can't help your 4 gigs RAM PC. In terms of GPU one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops crashes and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high end rigs. It happens randomly I don't measure the frequency.UPDATE Although the game is still quite laggy minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080. Most performance issues are related to server lag instead of PC after June 27 update.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood spurts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my pointWelcome to the battlegrounds. &amp &amp &amp &amp &amp,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,22,True,Recommended,The game is like DayZ Mod and H1Z1 had a baby with is superior to both his parents. It brings back the old good feelings of DayZ Mod while beeing intense as H1Z1 although this game is not nearly as bugged as H1Z1. The game is great fun and I really enjoy it playing with a friend or two.It is an early access game so bugs are pretty much to be expected. Some Hitboxes of objects need work (Shooting at invisible boxes around an object) and most definitely flipping cars. We also noticed getting the animation for getting injured including all fancy sounds but not actually beeing attacked or losing health.The one thing which needs to be done is optimization. I have an old PC which still is above the requirements and the game runs poorly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-12,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,"Runs like absolute trash. Dont believe their minimum specs. To run this game decently you at least need a gtx 1050 ti. Not to mention the servers are awful. It can take up to 1 seccond for a shot to register when you try to shoot someone. So far range moving targest and quickscoping are almost impossible. That 1 seccond also doesent count for your ping aswell. If you have slow internet (200 ping) you will not and I repeat NOT be able to be competetive in this game or even play at all. One other awful thing is landing. Once you land you cant get any weapons because the weapons take 15 SECCONDS TO LOAD IN. My only reccomdation if you get this game is update your graphics drivers to the latest version. AMD and Nvidia updated their drivers to make their cards run this game slightly better. And believe me slightly better is better than nothing slightly better doesent mean good either. I want to manually make this game run better myself because bluehole games wont do it. Ill basically sum down everything they said into one sentence they stated ""If you try to change the game file you will be banned"" So bacially I cant go into the textures folder and change it so my game runs better. On the subject of getting banned There are so many hakers on this game its insane. So Yes Hacking wont get you banned But changing the Texture file of the game to make it run better will. Like really bluehole games? Anyway back to the hackers. Every other game it seems like you are getting killed by one. There anti cheat system is garbage and does not work at all. Next I need to tallk about physics. These are the worst physics of any game ove ever played. The parachute is impossible to control and marking a place on the map and flying to that exact place is extremly hard.

2017-03-30,0,0,197,True,Recommended,love this game so much it can get so intense. I once avenged my 2 buddies who went down in battle. they had pushed towards a small town on the shoreline just next to the major military base. I was lurking behind to cover out backs as we proceed to take the town. As my buddies pushed in they were picked off one by one just on the outskirts of the small village. but i was still a ways away so i couldnt get to their aid quick enough to revive them.They hide died.I made my way to their death sites. I was on the outskirts inbetween their graves. i knew there were stil at least 3 enemies hiding waiting for me but in my grief i did not care about caution with my double barel shotgun and enough ammo to kill 10 people i began hunting them. i find one enemy inside a building looking away from me. i shoot him through the window from outside. i reload and turn the corner to the otherside of the house to find his buddy who fell to my shells. two down one left. i turn 2 more corners to find their car so listen for the last man. he comes up along side it not knowing im waiting on the other side of the car when he met his demise... It felt good to avange my fallen comrades. But none the less i was alone and sad.i ended up placing 6th that game.

2017-09-16,0,0,169,True,Not Recommended,In 1998 I was kidnapped by a man in a horse mask. For around 3 years I was his prisoner. He did unspeakable evils to me. He made me watch Troll 2 on VHS but he played it at half speed and forced me to drink 3 litres of Monster Energy every day. He would often come at me with sticks and barbed wire and run them down my poor pale soft smooth flesh.Occasionally he would cook me fish fingers. I HATE fish fingers. When serving me fish fingers he would undercook them and then force me to eat them. But nothing I experienced in those 3 years was as bad as this game. This game sucks my This game makes me want to shoot my This game makes me want to kill myself sometimes. So.. what I'm tryna say is that I'd rather be captured locked up and tortured by a man in a horse mask than play this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You will be on your enemy's screen a solid second after you get behind cover and then die when they shoot your afterimage. Good luck having a close quarters battle because with the mix of particle effects tanking you fps and the server itself because two people next to eachother is more than it can handle you'd be lucky if you get a single shot off in the direction of your enemy. Matchmaking does not exist so you'll either fight a potato who has never seen a computer before this firefight or shroud level pro players who will kill you before they even register on your screen.

2017-08-23,0,0,112,True,Recommended,The game is so good most will play the crap out of it til' they get tired of it and come on here and review that they don't like it anymore. Those people suck. Then you have another group who have played it so much and love it that they suddenly hate it now because the developers want to survive past early access by finding other revenue streams even though it is not pay2play microtransactions. They are the worst. If YOU are into shooters and love a competitive shooter this is for you and you will love and potentially hate it. But no doubt you'll love it at first until you get tired of it. That's how good the game is. The only problem I find with the game is that it's still in eearly access and that it needs new modes and new maps. But that requires the developers to scale their business which is very expensive. I want new modes that are just as fun and original like a zombie mode or a more confined version of a map that is action packed. I hope they include assasinationg animations and new features to wearble items like double pistol holsters for double pistol action with animation pistol whips. Features like these will prolong the gameplay years from now. So the game is fine. Buy it play it and if you get tired of it go play something else or get some friends because that's where this game shines the most.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-16,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"This game has a bad rep from the few players who have been banned for no reason people who claim ""there are way too many hackers"" and poor optimization. The game is really fun though once you get used to the gun mechanics. I always find myself wanting to keep playing matches because of the new mini royale mode. I think they actually did a good job with adding Sanhok despite the mistakes Bluehole has made in other areas of the game like porting it to Xbox instead of further optimizing the game or addressing the bugs. PUBG really lacked the speed that their main competitor Fortnite had but Sanhok is a whole new map with even faster flow than the original mode. Had Bluehole fixed more bugs instead of taking time to develop loot crates than this might be my favorite game. After all the bugs aren't bad enough to make this game unplayable or even not fun. Its still an amazing game with the potential to rise back up to being the most popular game on Steam again.EDIT The Fix PUBG campaign is bringing this game onto the road of recovery. Really wanna see how it turns out and I think if you were skeptical of this game before the campaign will bring it to a much beter level of playability.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It was for a time but a lack of updates and microtransactions ruined it. This game had so much potential and it has been a shame to see it go to waste. Instead of listening to their player base Bluehole listened to their marketing team. They added crates and made the majority of them need a key that costs $2.50 to open they ignored optimization problems fixed bugs only when nessesary told the playerbase that it would update these concerns in the future and with the new update added a $10 battle pass. The damage has been done and they will never have as many people playing the game as they used to but if they want to try and make an honest effort to rebuild that playerbase they need to start acting like a game that you have to pay money for. They complain about Fortnite copying thier format but they do the same thing with their battle pass. You want to bring players back give them a game that is worth $30.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-27,0,0,246,False,Recommended,"I give this game a positive review but it is borderline negative. First of all it is still a fun game. The game mechanics are cool and the gunplay ist extraordinary. I like the notch of realism this game provides albeit spraying an m416 real life will not provide the same results as ingame. Same is viable for the other Assault Rifles and Light Machineguns ingame. Ballistics and also the ""time to kill"" is balanced quite well altough they should remove the limb hits if you hit someone with 5.56 or 7.62 both will penetrate the Hand/Arm etc. and will result in a body hit. Well I guess it is as realistic as I would take it in a game. For the gunplay remove the spray'n pray make single shot more viable and make continuus full auto not sustainable because in real life it isnt it takes an excessive amount of force to control an full auto spray on an assault rifle and it is still pretty hard on a sub machinegun. 2 5 bullets full auto burst are pretty much doable for a trained soldiert. Real life you get the best results with double tapping followed by a head/pelvic shot. knock the vest penetrate the vest kill. But all in all I like the mechanics. I also like the smaller map sanhook because you get in a game have loot and also action thats the best part. Also the update with private servers for everyone ist cool. But why not implement the war mode all the time which is great for training aim and guns. The negative part which is why this review has a wee bit of a negative lean is the server/client/client synchro. It happes far to often that you get shot behind walls or else. And its not all because of cheaters mostly it is due to the bad sync. It can be pretty depressing to survive a hot drop have like 2 8 kills or sth and then just die to a guy in a house sitting in a corner and the best part about that sometimes its so laggy that you dont see him on your screen but the other player sees you bam dead where was he? darn. You guys should probably add something like a faint breathing sound or occasional rattling from clothing. Because no one is dead silent or can move dead silent.

2018-09-30,0,0,1220,False,Not Recommended,So you might wanna take a look at my gaming hour 1100+ hrs. Yea I'm absolutely a veteran.I had so much great memories on this game not because the game itself but meeting people around the world..With that being said it's still a game. Graphic is great and detailed However with GTX1070 it still sometimes drops to unacceptable 30FPS. I do know frame drop is common in battle royale game even in COD Black Out but frame drop in this game is way too common. Devs make changes in this game way too often adding non sense weapon and functions adding unnecessary textures which people even wont notice.. Because of the Unreal Engine eveytime a small change in game leads to a huge update like 5 12 gigs. I know in the states or south Korea the internet is fast but there're lots of people playing with network. Cheating No more need to say. STILL a serious problem Crashing So common that sometimes you literally just cant tell what the cause is. It happens so much. Lack of respect to Chinese players who devote more than 60 precent of PUBG's selling. Physics is terrible player moves like a moron/robot You cant feel that sense of smoothness like playing COD/R6 Siege/Battlefield. I really want to see COD Black Out and Battlefield V beat PUBG down to Gamers today are too desperate for good games to play this never be fixed and poorly coded garbage. I'm one of those players and I'm done with it. DONT WASTE MONEY.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now were on a plane about to jump in an epic fasion to prove whos number one Racist comments and insults from the plane. I jump and fall AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! im on the ground always watching my back finding new weapons I will surley win. A wall comes at me then through me? I cant keep up run out of health and die.... Will play this forever.In all seriousness I really like the flow of the game It reminds me of alot of Mod DayZ before standalone Games can last anywhere from 3 minutes to 35 minutes. where stealth and patience can get you really far showing how many people are left and how quickly they drop like flies is amazing and scary knowing that your in that group of players. There is so much cover and then adding in weather effects to enhance gameplay and keep it interesting. I guess I feel its like short burst pvp for dayz without running around for 2 4 hours not to mention you can run in groups. Its worth the money.Pros Solid gameplay for early release Gun mechanics are very smooth and accurate Movement is suprisingly fluent though it is slightly stiff Jumping from the plane is simply amazing choosing when to jump is scary. As of now its quick to get into a game. Your not forced to spectate after death you can jump into another game right away. Sounds are very good you can hear someone running around shooting driving etc not to mention where the sounds are coming from. Healing takes 3 7 seconds and you have to wait for it to finish makes the risk vs reward aspect so much better.Cons When the Fight area circle is going to be reduced the Blue wall is way to fast they should slow it down a little bit. It can pass you and goes faster then you while you loose health and die. no FOV option ""Though you can see really far this could hurt lower end pc users"" if graphics on low its hard to make out anything from a distance. When graphics are on low from a distance some of the taller bushes look like players ""increasing AA textures helped with this"". Some guns do very low damage even to unarmored players.I feel this game will improve in time its already very fun and feels rewarding even if you loose. I give it 4/5",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-23,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,OK so I broke down to buy this game after enjoying playing the mobile version for the past few weeks. Thinking cool this would be better. Actually the mobile game is better than the PC version. WOW... really? Yep.Let me explain. This is a VERY fast paced game which you need to spend time finding gear and killing others to survive. OK yeah that's a known right? Mobile version... I run over the gear and I pick up the best that fits what I've configured to autopick up. PC version... Oh look here... hmmm lets pick up this... and this... and crap I didn't want that... let me manually drop this... and crud I picked up a backpack v1 when I had a v2 equiped... GRRR!That's just one example. There are a lot more. The mobile version is more streamlined for good action focusing on the game play vs trying to manually inventory manage everything like the PC version.Also when you drop a gun in PC version it doesn't take off the mods you've attached. That's right you gotta pull them off before you switch to another gun then re apply them again (all manual)This is going to be one of the rare cases in which I'd say the mobile app is better than PC.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-18,0,0,110,False,Recommended,"PUBG is one of the premier battle royale games available to play right now. Throughout this review I'm gonna do my best not to compare it to Fortnite too much.SettingsPlayer controls are something you need to be careful of. One way to describe controlling your player is that the player feels like it's running on ice. When you're sprinting and come to a stop the player slides a little forward. Perhaps PUBG wanted players to come to a gradual halt but they should definitely look at games like GTA V on how they do that with their in game characters. Graphically the game is just above average. It's nothing too amazing coming from the Unreal Engine. PUBG have come a long way with their optimisation though and I have to hand it to them for that.PvPCompared to Fortnite PUBG is the more realistic and strategic battle royale game of the two. It's the ""Battlefield"" of the COD vs BF comparison. You can't go into fights without a strategy. The PvP is often dominated by riflemen from long range or a shotty by a camper. You'll sometimes come by a handful of players darting through the houses with SMGs but that briefly sums up the PvP in the game.Player SurvivalPUBG's player health and perks aren't plentiful. All players have health (obviously) but one thing that PUBG has that's unique is the perk system. There are two perks you can get while in a match healing and speed boost. These perks can be obtained by taking energy drinks and supplements. These perks aren't permanent either and will gradually go away throughout the match. Sometimes you may come across situations where you need to dive and swim. The oxygen system keeps you from staying underwater forever but it can be a bit glitchy at times as you may still lose oxygen even when your head's above water. For obvious reasons don't swim too much in a match.Weapons &amp ArmourThe weapons are in a weird place at this current time. On paper two of the game's shotguns are the least powerful weapons in the game. I'm not sure about you but you'd have less chance of survival after a point blank shot in the chest from a shotgun shell than a pistol bullet. One of these weak shotgun's is the S12K and I guess PUBG decided to make it weak because it's an automatic shotgun. You can only imagine how powerful an automatic shotgun would be if the damage count was increased. Speaking of shotguns all of them are terrible to use and take considerable amounts of luck and skill (yes luck) to use. The only one worth having is the S1897 because the rest are either too weak or require decent accuracy before having to wait around to reload. The pistols aren't worth using unless you really can't find anything else to use. They're incredibly weak and rightfully so. The SMGs can be used as a close range substitute for a shotgun. If a whole clip lands on another player chances are they're dead. An assault rifle is perfect for mid long range as their firing modes can be toggled. The snipers of course require absolute precision and skill. Perhaps save them for when you have more experience and time played in the game. Overall the weapons aren't too bad with the exception of shotguns being unreliable more often than you think. Half the weapon attachments are useless only go for the sights/scopes suppressors and magazines.The armour and equipment in game is sorted by levels. All your clothes come with a capacity amount so it's necessary to keep your clothes on. It's also a bonus if you've won a jacket from a crate drop as it allows you to carry more items. A little naughty of PUBG to have a cosmetic item provide a capacity advantage over newcomers. Back to the equipment levelling system the backpack vests and helmets all range from 1 3. To be honest I've been in too many fights where I felt like having armour on made no difference.The looting system in game has improved. Most of the time when I've looted an area I'm kitted out with the necessary gear.MapsErangel is a forest map that's based in Russia. It's a map that has plenty of opportunities to hide and take cover. If you're in the middle of nowhere and you're being fired upon chances are there's a tree next to you that you can hide behind. If you wanna hide from someone and you're in an open field of grass prone. Surprisingly it works far too often. You also have plenty of towns to loot from as well as a whole prison island to hunt other players on.Miramar is a desert map based in Central America. It's a lot more open than Erangel but there are more towns and villages for you to loot in. Early complaints about how open the map was made PUBG add more buildings and places of interest to loot from.Sanhok is a jungle themed map set in Southeast Asia. It's half the size of the other two maps which makes for fast paced battle royale. It's something that's necessary to cater for the market with Fortnite dominating. It feels like Erangel but shrunk down it's an excellent map with tons of looting opportunities and great areas to fight other players.Out of the three maps Sanhok is my personal favourite. Unfortunately PUBG has removed map selection with the release of Sanhok and you'll have to select regular battle royale maps (Erangel/Miramar) or mini royale (Sanhok). I personally prefer map selection because who doesn't wanna play on a map of your choice?GamemodesYou have the options of solo duos squads and x man squads (x number of people in your squad). You also have the option to select whether to play in third person or first person. Third person allows 360 degree camera rotation and wall peeking. First person only allows 180 degree camera rotation and is challenging because it doesn't allow wall peeking so you need to be more aware of your surroundings. PUBG have also introduced limited time modes which are usually featured on the weekends only. These LTMs have variables such as a particular map squad amount weapons to use and player perspective. They're quite fun but it'd be better if PUBG allowed more time for these modes.Levelling SystemPUBG introduced a leveling system and revamped how you can receive rewards in the Sanhok update. As a casual player it's extremely difficult to level up daily. You have 3 daily missions you can do to try get more experience but they don't provide enough experience in my opinion. The leveling system heavily relies on paying for the Event Pass. There are way more opportunities to earn experience and rewards by paying extra money for a game you've paid for which isn't exactly polished. It's a bad move by PUBG who are a multi million dollar company already from game sales alone because it makes Fortnite a more viable option for the consumer. I really do like the idea of missions because that's something I liked about Fortnite. It allows me to try new things and makes games more challenging.SummaryI only recommend this because there's no better realistic battle royale that requires thorough strategy. While it's a game that still feels like it's in early access PUBG is definitely doing their best to listen to their playerbase and honestly their only direction from here is up.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-06,0,0,17,False,Recommended,WOW. This game really is difficult and truly challenging I haven't really played that much but I haven't come across any cheaters just obnoxious voice chat users. If you want an immersive unspoken rule filled game then this is for you it really is great to not play for a few days hop back on and parachute down (probably die) and just play a for a little while. Playing with friends is even better something i haven't done much though but it is really great to work with a team and mess around. 8.9 out of ten. The game takes time to pick up but you never forget your basic knowldege e.g opening doors how to use scopes what guns are the best and how to use them. There is also a lot of stuff that i just learned (that you can go into first person while playing in third person how to lean and even how to zoom in scope. Watching YouTubers play the game also improves your play so I would advise watching JackFrags or Pewdiepie or something. Overall this game is great for a challenge so I would advise buying it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Seriously I can t even get a single hit on most people. I have tried and tried and tried. WTF is is going on!!! The only way I can kill is by hiding and getting an extremely close up stealth kill e.g. by waiting for a long time behind a door and killing from within the same room from behind giving me 1 to 3 seconds head start shooting on the enemy. Even then many still have time to see where the shots are coming from turn around return fire and cause me serious damage. I wait for several minutes to line up the shot shoot them from near zero range and still they do not drop!!!!!!!!WTF IS GOING ON WITH THIS GAME!!!!!! Im fine playing other games and am ""average"" but when i cant get a single kill from zero range shooting people in the back and others can kill me with one shot to the head from half a k away while im driving in a vehcile I have serious concerns.

2017-09-11,0,0,979,True,Not Recommended,"I love this game so much however they really need to do something about and I know this sounds racist the Chinese on the NA server. I am so sick of every lobby I head into everyone shouting ""AMERICA #2 CHINA #1"" and then everyone on my squad only speaks Chinese. Then after I do not say anything to them since I do not understand what they are saying they kill me just a shotgun to the head from my own teammate because I don't speak Chinese! Seriously Bluehole fix this ing problem! I love this game and I want to continue to support it but I can't make it more than 10 minutes into the game before being killed by a teammate! Whenever I have played with english speakers on the NA server I am not killed by friendly fire. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY MAKE REGION LOCK A THING.EDIT I have not been killed by friendly fire in awhile now only once the other day out of my 4 matches I think people are learning they're going to get banned.EDIT AGAIN Editing again because the players in this game have become again. Some other company is taking over the Chinese version of this game and hopefully the Chinese players with them. Don't waste your time playing this game 99% of the time you won't be in a lobby with someone who speaks english and 100% of the time that happens you'll be team killed. Not worth the $30 to have 2 minute matches before I'm killed by my teammate for my stuff. Fun the 1% you are able to play with an english player but otherwise this game is ed. Won't be playing until the Chinese players are off the North American server. Also you report them they tell you without further proof they wont ban them I have recorded every single match of this game now due to team kills and never have been asked to submit proof found some of the same guys later still unbanned.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-03,0,0,932,False,Not Recommended,Honestly this game is a great idea....but ruined by a massive hacking community. ESP and aimhacks abound by the thousands (millions according to BattleEye) making for an unfair and unfun experience. I've been here for over 300 hours so understand that I love this game and want it to be good but you can't do it this way. Well actually you can and here's the disappointing part Hackers are only banned by user account so they just re buy the game when they get banned. When they do this BlueHole banks another copy of the game removing their incentive to stop the hacking. With 1.5 million hackers banned by BattleEye (nowhere near the actual total that use Windows 7 and go around BattleEye) Bluehole is making millions allowing them to ruin the product. When they region lock this game and when they get the hacks under control it will be a good game. Until then don't give them your money.***UPDATEHacking is still rampant and server performance has somehow gotten steadily worse. Desync and disconnects run rampant and the game just isn't fun anymore but hey they released a HUGE PILE of pay for cosmetics that function flawlessly...not questionable at all.

2017-12-25,0,0,75,False,Recommended,Dear reader at first as I'm writting this review i currently have played the game for around 16 hours. Overall I do recommend the game to anyone who enjoys battle royale styled games. There are many positive but also some negative points to it which I will come back to later.General The game is one of the if not the most most played games on Steam in the end of 2017 and that is in my opinion well deserved. The graphics are very neat to look at but for a price if your PC isn't at least somewhere around the highend class you'll probably not going to see much from those. The optimisation is indeed terrible. From crashes to horrible lags and even bluescreens. If you do have a nice PC you may very well play on Ultra Settings at around 90 100 FPS. (I'd recommend playing on medium Players are better visible and make easier of a target.) The sounds are well made and do help alot with orientation. (Supressors finally make sense to use &lt 3 but more to that later.)Weapons First things first every weapon has its place in the game and is useful in certain situations. None of the weapons are useless and none (as far as I can tell) overpowered. There is plenty of customization oppertunities which all are atachable to a certain gun. The good ones are rarer than the others. (obvoiusly) But still none of them give you an unfair advantage. There mostly fair distributed.Gameplay The gameplay is impovable. There is rubberbanding all over the place. Even if it's just in the beginning phase it's very annoing and can lead to certain unfair deaths. Lags and Crashes are definetly part of the game. But thankfully you may reconnect after a crash but still needs to be fixed. Glitches with fullscreen bugs that make you do stuff you don't want to etc. Fall Damageglitches. They are so annoying. You can manage to die from sliding down a little ledge or a little hill just because your feet somehow don't touch the ground by walking of them... Please fix!But there is also positive things about it! Bulletdrop and velocity is something that I personally really enjoy and it works. Many sights are ajustable on different ranges. Great Hitboxes as far as I can tell. Fair distribiuted goods all over the map.As a conclusion I give PUBG a solid 7.5/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-10,0,0,665,True,Recommended,"There's four people left. Your heart is pounding your hands trembling. You've never made it this far.Your partner died in a fierce firefight on the outskirts of Po i. You're on your own now. The circle is closing again. This time you have to leave your cover. 10 seconds now. You chug your last red bull check your magazine and know you have to move. You know where one player is but not the other two. It's time. You sprint for the nearest cover a rock in the center of the clearing. Immediately shots crack by your head. You see a player to the north peeking from a tree firing round after round trying desperately to end your quest for the elusive chicken dinner. You make it to the rock as a firefight erupts and a squad ends the life of your would be assailant. It's 2v1 now. The squad instantly switches to you and one player lays down fire while the other flanks your left. You see it coming. Leading your shots as you've learned you strike first and send him to the ground knocked out. This is it. The final two. You're sweating nervous. You tell yourself to focus. He moves first to a tree just 50 yards in front of you. You dash for the tree to your left so he can't get an angle on you. He peeks but you're ready. You take some serious damage but four of your well placed M16 rounds seal the deal. A wave of relief washes over. You stare at the winner screen with pride as your dead partner cheers for you over voice comms. You collect your points and retire to the menu. As you stare at the menu and finish coming down from the victory rush you know there's only one thing left to do. You and your friend hit the ready button and prepare for another epic entry into the fray of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS. Quick review time! Pros A unique experience every match Gunplay feels great on par with Battlefield and similar games Fast paced quick to get into a match Vehicles aren't OP or necessary to win a match Cover works great and foliage is actually useful More fun (and more difficult) with friends Weekly developer updatesCons Optimization (Runs significantly better on Intel chips) Server lag issues sometimes making it nearly unplayable (Rubber banding dsyncing crashing) No rejoin option if your game does happen to crash Cheaters (I personally have only had a few ""fishy"" incidents but it does seem like a lot of people out there are affected by cheating.) While there is a ways to go on the optimization this game is remarkably well put together for an early access title. It's an absolute blast. Hopefully the hype train doesn't slow down for a while on this one and we see it turned into a finished well polished product that isn't a complete cash grab with neon pink and purple M16 skins and terrible mechanics. Jump on the hype train while it's here it's worth the $30 price of admission.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I find myself increadibly excited for my first game after seeing others play it and after i complete the character customization i hop onto a solo eu server (i am the UK). As i wait in the loading screen i can hear many foot steps and i understand this to be the game's lobby. i see this as a sign that the loading is almost complete as what happens for similar games such as rust. after a minuite of this i hear the plane but i am still veiwing the (responding) loading screen. i think by now you can guess what happens. i get the audio of falling of landing of a single pair of foot steps and finally being punched to death. all while veiwing the loading screen. eventually as if to rub it in i get the visual of the ""better luck next time"" screen and i am prompted to return to the main menu.ok im going to cut the now games 3 and 4 went the exact same way exept i ran it in roblox quality and in game 3 i managed to punch my attacker back through the loading screen and gained a score of 5 for hitting someone. ifound that hilarious for about 10 seconds. game 2 just crashed.conclusion is this game a ing joke?? and before you ask my specs they are decent enough and i shouldnt need to spend hundreds of pounds on some t to play a game that is overpriced in the first place.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,100,True,Recommended,Dang there is so much to say about this game right now. I can say that this game is fun but its so bland to just say that. I have like 3 reasons (I have more but I don't want to keep rambling).1. The game is so much fun to have friends because if your friends get winner chicken dinner you and your friends have the feeling that you are the best in this game and that will make you to play this game even more which this would lead to the second reason.2. How fun the learning experiences you're having when playing this game. One of the reason I liike this game is that it is a learning experience. For example learing the map so that you will know where to loot is and where people would go so that when you play you will know where you can land and you can have an idea what loot is. The weapons are also a learning experience also because you need to know that some weapons are better close range and some weapons are better for long range. With that in mind leads to the third reason which is the gameplay.3. The gameplay. I love the gameplay. Its like the hunger games and the controls to this game are easy and eaiser to learn than H1Z1. What pubg has that H1Z1 does not have it the the weapons shooting is more consitent than H1Z1. The shooting in pubg is more consitent what I mean is that you will know when you hit the person. While in H1Z1 its very inconsisent because your shots will shot places that you did not even shoot at and that makes people made when playing this becasue shooting in this game does not make sense at all. Overall. i would recommend this game to everyone that loves something similar to the hunger games and that the gameplay is better and not only that is just going to get better because its still in early access so they're improvements that can be made to this game. 9/10 rating,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Just shoot in the general direction and you will probably hit. Hackers are everywhere. There is no point trying to play to the end game as you will get taken out by a guy following you from miles away through walls/hills. If I ever complained about hackers in CSGO I take it all back. Pubg has 100000x more. Blue Hole are cashing in on the game. Weapon skins instead of fixing well known bugs.

It was ok when the game was early acess and I got hit with random lag dropped frame rate loads of objects appearing out of nowhere and loads of bugs but now we should be seeing improvement not things getting worse. By far the worst thing I have had to deal with is the hackers. I haven't went one night without getting aimbotted or shot through the map. When you're in shelter and people shoot you through the roof with a shotgun from the outside. This game has potential but at this point even if you have a good game your next 10 will probably suck do to hackers and issues. i keep waiting for the fan base to leave and all that's left is the hackers. I know of at least 4 people that have already stopped playing due to that very reason.

But the gameplay itself is fun. It can be very unforgiving at first but once you learn the best places to drop and the tactics you need to come out on top you'll have a great time. Gun play is excellent (except when you're too close to a wall and your gun goes haywire). Weapon variety is pretty ok with the devs adding new ones every month though usually these are restricted to crate drops.This is one of few Early Access titles that are genuinely making the most out of the platform constantly updating with significant improvements and bug fixes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-26,0,0,30,False,Recommended,I'm going to be honest with this review. Before I bought this game I thought it was stupid I called it a running simulator I called it over rated i said it wasn't worth thity bucks and that it should be free to play instead. However after playing it for a bit of time my views have completely changed. I'm also rather surprised this game has such mixed reviews. My opinion does still stand that the game is slightly over rated but so are all the tiple A titles that come out in the mainstream game market. This game is worth the thirty dollars especially since I have made some of that money back even my brother has actually made a ten dollar profit from selling the in game items. As for the game itself it is extremely fun and doubles triples quadruples in value as you add friends and play in squads. The game mechanics have improved over time graphics have been optomized and with two maps in rotation now the diversity is getting much better. it's very easy to get lost in playing this game and is extremely rewarding to place high in the last standing and especially to win. for those who hate on the game I'd have to say they haven't taken it for what it is a challenge. Yes it's not easy and is slightly wonky but the concept the game mechanics and the direction the game continues to move in is excellent and promissing. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-12,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Considering this game costs a huge cost of 26.00 the game really hasn't made me think it was worth it. Considering that there are other free battle royale games such as Fortnite and H1Z1 this game really isn't anything good. Don't get me wrong the gameplay is solid and does offer fun and the situation applys with COD and Battlefield. If you like short paced gameplay with more guns and killing and less realistic then play Fortnite but if you prefer slow paced more realistic games then PUBG would be a good game for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At the start of the game you and all the other players in the server jumping out from a plane with a parachute and then you need to pick up some good things so you can survive so long as possible It's like hungergames if you have watched the movies. You can also drive cars motorbikes and boat and sometimes it falls some airdrops from the sky that have good things in it. It's some cheaters in the game but I recommend it anyway to 100% cuz it's so f***ing funny! ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-19,0,0,272,False,Recommended,I would recommend this game quite frankly I adore it for many reasons. The game is constantly expanding and the games are engaging and fun. Here are my divided advantages to disadvantages Advantages The large variety of weapons and attachments allows the player to choose which weapon to use depending on their preference and what for instance grips they prefer or scopes they prefer on which weapons. The combat and bullet time/drop system is great and is unique to each gun so its not just a copy and paste on each weapon. The maps are brilliant there are 2 currently and a third in development and provide us users with different combat situations (Miramar is the best map because it has the win94). The use of vehicles is amazing and thoroughly enjoy using them/ attacking them. The graphics are simply phenomenal if you have/are getting this game and can run it on max just go first person and look at the detail on the guns its amazing. I've seen plenty of complaints about the FPS i haven't got an issue with them but I'd say make sure your computer is good enough to run it so you won't encounter these problems.Disadvantages Vehicles are buggy. Although I said they are great fun they can be very infuriating when they glitch and break. For instance I recently had a game where my car got stuck on its back and hopped damaging the vehicle eventually killing it and me. I was not impressed. The game can crash. I won't tag on 'often' because its only happened to me 3 times and I've had it for some time but the crashes are undoubtedly there.In conclusion I would definately recommend this game IF you have a good computer to run it on.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-28,0,0,16,False,Recommended,As a lot of people here do I got the game under the influence of friends at first I was quite disappointed as well the server's laggy extremely poor optimization people said they encountered hacks and I've been lucky enough not encountering any. However over the time I did see the optimization getting a lot better the servers are getting a lot less laggy while hacks still exist it's not like there are no hacks in other games at all.To respond to my friend who thought at least 8 months back that he could do well in CS but cannot do so in PUBG here's my answer to him as well as to any other person who also has this confusion PUBG is an Army Simulation Battle Royale so everything counts towards how a bullet goes out wind recoil gravity ammo's velocity and speed ballistics etc. It's different from Counter Strike because in CS the ballistics are not affected that much since the entire map is only couple hundred square feet. This is also why games like Battlefield and heck Fortnite doesn't require much of skill from games like Counter Strike.To respond to why PUBG can be bought in Mainland China for so cheap my answer is that you need to know 1. what kind of a market MLC really is and 2. there are rumors that Steam is going to make MLC a seperate region basically like what every other gaming platform did. The second one is certainly not what we who have friends in MLC want to see but it's certainly a better solution to both sides.Overall play fortnite that's how they do it now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-13,0,0,475,True,Not Recommended,This review is written in alpha stage 4 million copies sold. I've just read on forums that there's just 30 35 devs and so they have no time to deal with cheaters. So ... why the heck don't you hire hundred of devs more when we paid you so much money to do the game right? Isn't that what is early access for?The game itself is fun. Or at least it was fun until you realize how many people are cheating. These days you almost have no chance to make it to the end and not meet cheater who will kill you by one headshot from a pretty fast turnaround. You might say it's alpha right? Yes it is but it's multiplayer so it's basically unplayable without cheats. You need to count that like 60 percent of your time in the game will be a total disappointment and just 30 will be the usual one and the rest (about 10 percent) will be the enjoyable game you paid for.So let's forget about that 60 percent made by cheaters there's a chance you meet one early in a game so it won't feel that bad. The 20 percent of usual disappointment is pretty important too. Sure you can play alone but it's not that funny as playing in a group but there's no squad management at all. Basically you get to group with some random guys or worse with a group of friends who are on Skype so they don't communicate with you at all and when they spot you found some good stuff they just kill you and loot you. There's no penalty for teamkill and there's no way how to play in a squad unless you have a bunch of friends to play with (which I actually have so the game is not unplayable for me from time to time when we all have time).So if this is what you are looking for buy the game and enjoy. I must say the 30 euros I paid gave me a lot of fun but I can't play this anymore because it's too frustrating and the devs are concentrating more on twitch stuff and marketing then fixing what makes the game playable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes there is hackers like in every game to ever exist. Bluehole has more to do besides control the cheaters. Only reason I would not recommend is for the extremely rage inducing bugs like jumping out of a car when it is moving fast and dying or loot not showing up when you can clearly see that they have loot on their body.

2017-07-18,0,0,987,True,Not Recommended,At first I was trilled by the game the graphics seemed cool my friends were playing the game it seemed like a nice concept 100 players in a map seemed nice but like...the more I played this ..the more I found issues with the game.Mainly I think that theres a lot of issues with lag aim+where's your bullets are actually going and what appear on screen vs what should be seen on screen. As a free game it would be ok I guess but I don't think it's worth the price I paid for the game...anyway...It is just kind of frustrating...like... The 8x scope or even the 4x scope...unless the enemy is not moving much or moving toward you you cant hit with that you like need to aim ahead (cause bullet takes 4ever to reach) and above (cause bullet falls...) the dude...+the lag factor + the fact that the enemy is just moving in different ways + the over exaggerated recoil...it is just kind of lame... The aim system is kind of dumb...you move a bit and you lose like 30% of your aim easy...meaning that if you run to the guy while shooting with a rifle...you miss all your hits...which is annoying... You cant shoot though things...meaning like that you will miss all of you point blank shotgun hits if theres like a book in the corner of your screen or w/e... The non aim and aim is not at the same location (you need to re aim if you zoom). Some vegetation just kind of disappear if you are far enough (in a circle around you)...making people think they are hidden safe in the vegetation...while they are not... You can't use scope while in vegetation... (unless in a hill vegetation is in scope) ...but wait you can aim (with no scope) with...tapping right click...(...just what is the point of having a scope if you can't use it...) People just kind of blink around because of lag...(Very true at the start with 100 players. The lag becomes less heavy as the number of players dwindles.) (...w/e your settings doesn't drop the lag...) Shooting while jumping from a building and landing from that building is probably more accurate than running+shooting. You can't jump/climb...w/e... above stuff half your height...or like need to jump for stuff at your knee level...it is kind of exaggerated... You only see a small number of people parachuting with you (you don't see them all) meaning someone could land near you without you knowing at the start...even if you looked thoughtfully at your surrounding...(you need time to find a gun...so its really kind of annoying). To aim properly theres way too many keys to hit...crouch key + aim key + hold your breath key... and like just aiming longer at a target doesnt really makes you aim better... Shooting at a guy though a wooden lattice stair railing blocks all damage and you cant crouch + shoot though most windows cause you know...moving your gun slightly above the railing and through the window would be too hard for your character so most of the time it just hits the wall beow the window and that blocks all damage... There's a lag rush when landing with you parachute. And so on...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-17,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Honestly I don't know what Nintendo is doing anymore. After BOTW I though that they were going to right their wrongs after the atrocity that was Mortal Kombat XL (seriously where was Sans Undertale (Nes) ?) and maybe they were going to make a come back after their stocks plummeted. This game is terrible. That's it. You don't really need to get into any detail when it comes to this game. It's very obvious that Nintendo was spending all their money on Skyrim Switch Edition and just made this game to cash in on Paladins Battlegrounds (Come on Reggie you didn't even try to change the name)! This game is about as deep as a grated lump of cheddar cheese. The people behind this game must have had the brain capacity of a Tuna Sweetcorn Sandwich.TL DR Great RPG all around.

2017-09-03,0,0,4,False,Recommended,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I get a huge migraine playing this game.Its lack of brightness/gamma sliders and the intense glare from the ground (why is the ground shiny?) gives me a horrible headache/migraine after playing for more than an hour at a time.The game is also very unoptimized. I'm running a decent rig that can run most modern games on ultra yet this game lags when there's an explosion (running it on low). I personally don't like the main menu but it is slick. I know many people who like that sort of thing. In its current state I would say DO NOT get it. When these problems are addressed I definately would suggest getting it.Current state 7/10. 3 points for poor optimization/graphics options.I will return to review the game when it is released. Stay tuned!FULL RELEASE REVIEW They have REALLY improved upon this game. The optimization/graphics doesn't suck anymore (with the exception of network lag which continues to be a problem to this day). PUBG is finally the game it should be and I'm happy they stuck with it. If I'm being honest I was expecting them to take the money and run but that is not the case with this game.I wish there were more modes though. The only mode available is being deployed across one of the two maps and scavenging homes to find weapons. What about a version of the game where you are spawned in with a pistol already in your hand? This makes everyone a threat. Or what about a close quarters game mode where you throw a bunch of people into a building and it's essentially a free for all until one man stands?There are MANY creative directions this game could have gone and they didn't really take advantage of that. I truly hope they do look into improving upon the game in the near future because what they have right now is great albeit repetetive.9/10 An awesome game still plagued by poor network structure and uninspired game modes. I cannot wait for the future of PUBG!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,59,True,Recommended,PUBG is probably the most fun and the most frustrating game I've ever played. It is in theory a very easy game get guns shoot people don't get shot. But just like every shooter on the market usually it doesn't work out like that. Even if you are very good at PUBG you are still going to lose. A lot. As far as players of this game I haven't been playing very long but I am yet to win a game. I've gotten close to be sure but I've never gotten the coveted chicken dinner. And yet I still find myself coming back. I've never lost at a game so much and still loved it. As this game gets closer to full release I fully expect it to become better and better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Now I'm going to get started by saying I really like this game. It's fun honestly it is.But it's a massive turnoff to do insanely well get down to the last 10 people and then have someone shoot you in the back. Now don't get me wrong it's PVP so what do I expect right? I just don't really like how unfair the game can be which by all means it really is. You spawn in drop from the plane and go to the nearest house. First thing you'll probably see (In my case) was usually just a P1911 or one of the two shotguns. Your neighbor who dropped into the house across the street finds a Scar L an AKM a Kar98k with x8 scope and three medkits. How am I supposed to deal with that? I don't I die. That aspect of the game just isn't fun. However say you kill said neighbor with your shotgun you'll have a blast. This game is fun if you're good at it like most games are but the problem for me is I'm just not. I'm gonna get shot in the back killed from miles away die to a kid with a machete etc. I'm not good at this so for me it's not fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,1068,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS or PUBG is basically comparable to games like H1Z1 King of the kill. It's running on Unreal engine 4 and is running really stable atleast on my PC. It's quite easy to learn and offers a lot of fun and is a game easy to find people to group up with. The game itself offers loads of equipment and features you won't find in other comparable games. After a short downtime of updates the developers started to improve the game again and added some new stuff such as the new map Miramar. I can definetly give this game a positive rating except a few downsides such as the hacker cancer mainly appearing when playing against asians. And no that's not racist just the truth. I would never say that every asian is cheating in this game but enough do it. Still a great game and definetly worth it to buy. Regards,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-22,0,0,861,False,Not Recommended,It was great at first but replay value isn't too high. It's a lot of fun but very similar to a 'big map counterstrike' almost. Definite performance issues time to time. Been almost a year I think since I got it and only recently was the 2nd map announced and/or released.With over 10 million copies and at least 300 000 000$ they can't make maps any faster?Also the only in game customization is clothes. Of which there's quite a few but they all look similar.(white tshirt vs blue tshirt) And to buy these clothes you open chests. I believe I've received 10 15 duplicate clothes out of 30 35? Oh but you can buy these chests with some in game currency which you have to pay $$ more. There are often times when you enter a match and cannot find a weapon or a bag etc and it really reduces your chances of surviving against anyone. So you basically parachuted in ran around a little while picking crap up off the ground from building to building and then someone shoots you you can't even turn around you die. (hackers make this really annoying and there is a decent amount of them)The above example of a single round game just wasted 20 minutes of your life.Worth 30$? I would say 10.*Edit June 2018It's fun but only 2 maps in a year or more? Every other update is a make it or break it scenario. There's been a couple times where either myself or my gf have to take a week or two break from it as one of our computer configurations just causes random crashes. Since other games play ok we have to default to it being a problem with the update.Still fun they need to make the events permanent and make regular groups groups of 10 instead of 4.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,75,True,Recommended,"Here's probably the most balanced review of the game so far.Pros 1. The core game is there. There isn't any major flaws to the gameplay or core concepts.2. It's only $30. Yes it is an early access title but with the consistent updates as of now it isn't bad. (On a personal note it's not one of my favorite games but it's still a good game and I will continue to play it.)3. New content is announced monthly*.4. The developer seems to care about the well being of the game.Pros Summary There is no major issues to the game as of now and it's a perfectly fine game by today's standards.Cons 1. There are SOME minor connection issues and lag. HOWEVER do not listen to these people claiming to ""have decent internet and I shot him in the head twice"". I have 8Mb/s internet not bytes but bits. So I have slow internet. Technically speaking I shouldn't be able to watch 1080p videos on Youtube. BUT THE GAME IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR ME. I have however had a few instances where things shouldn't have happened (example getting shot while it appeared I was behind a wall or shots not registering) but it is debatable as to whether or not it was the server or my internet. Otherwise there's no lag with opening doors getting into vehicles or picking up items as other have stated on other reviews.2. Only one map. While the map is large it feels very empty. Two new maps have been announced but it sounds like they won't be released until the game is officially released.3. Poor optimization. My computer is close to high end. Not really but I can run ARMA3 on ultra graphics with a fairly stable 40fps. PUBG on medium low graphics also grants me 40fps.4. THE ING COMMUNITY. Everyone is a whiny little snot bag who can't read. The current fiasco as of writing this is about the new crates for unlocking COSMETIC items. Of the three new crates one requires you to purchase a key for $2.50USD in addition to spending in game BP (Battle Points) to buy the crate. Now the complaint people have right now about this is the developer PLAYERUNKNOWN said that no microtransactions with be in the game until the full release. So these whiny little snot bags I mentioned yea... they didn't read the developer's clearly written out statement about the new crates. PLAYERUNKNOWN said ""Proceeds from the sale of the keys to open the Gamescom Invitational Crate will be used to provide funds needed to organize the event to provide a prize pool for the invitational winners to support a selection of charities.""Apparently no one ing read that part and assumed the ""godsend game developer"" turned rogue all of a sudden for a ing cash grab. I choose to believe that they are staying true to this statement and honestly they could take a little bit of the money and I'd be okay with that too. Remember they are simply COSMETIC items. That and everyone seems to care about their ""rank"" which will guaranteed be wiped at the full release as it is already wiped every month. Whiny snot bags. (I only used this phrase because I didn't want my bleeped out) Sidenote to the crate stuff I feel people have way to much BP as of now so instead of wiping the BP at release I think it was a good call to introduce more crates to get people to spend some of it. Give them something to earn and unlock. Instead of useless rank. Cons Summary It's an early access game with the expected amount of bugs and glitches and server issues like every other game out there. But because people don't understand game development they assume that ""since they sold like 4 million copies they should have enough money to fix everything"". The community isn't nearly as trash as MOBA's are but it's not far off. Also the developer needs to grow a pair and not apologize for this crate fiasco. He did nothing wrong.General Summary It's a good game. Try it or watch stuff on youtube or twitch. If you're interested definitely get it.*Not entirely sure on the monthly thing. My friends made it sound monthly I just don't follow it that much.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,403,True,Recommended,Coming from a Dayz and Miscreated player Quite easily one of the best games I have ever played!!! It basically stream lines the adrenaline rushing PvP with none of the having to find food and water and travel large distances to find someone. Definatley give this game a try if you love survival PVP.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,234,True,Recommended,H1Z1!? Whats that game?! This is the game to play if you're into the whole battle royale scene! First off i would like to point out that yes this is an early access game there will be some problems with it. Its not finished by all means. But it does have a promising start. I am running on a low med end rig (Gigabyte GA 970A DS3P Motherboard AMDFX 8320 x8 core processor 3.5ghz Radeon HIS R9 280 IceQ OC 3GB GDDR5 Ram 12ghz). It runs very well with my settings at med to high. I am getting around 45 60 fps. here are some Pros and cons i feel thus far. Pros Can create your own character off the startLots of weapons to chose from all fully customizable with parts you find.Armor/backpacks are all over (find the lvl 2 + lvl 3s fast lol)Driving into someone with a vehicle actually kills them. You earn game points to spend on crates for cosmetics (instead of having to buy the currency)Its actually anjoyable being stealthy in this game. it can pay off if you find a supressor for a good rifle. There are alot more to go over i can't list them all. This game is worth it just trust me. Cons Game still needs some preformance tuning but will work on most rigs. Minor server lag issuesMust rebind some crutial keys. You can get hit with your own vehicle trying to get out. (WARNING...come to a complete stop)landing with your parachute can be a painOther than the very few cons i have i would recomend this game to anyone that asks. for me i would give it a 7.5/10 Yes this game is fun! Yes it has its flaws! BUT I will not be playing H1Z1 anylonger. This game will now be my number 1 battle royale game. Well worth the $30.00!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-26,0,0,338,False,Not Recommended,Trying to be a game like rocket league where they stop adding new content except for crates and a very occasional map but the biggest difference between this game and rocket league is the lack of progression system/ranks. Rocket league is still popular even though the core game has stayed the same for years. The playerbase has improved and gotten better making it harder to rank up but more incentive to play. This game has nothing...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-29,0,0,1073,False,Recommended,After 830+ hours (not counting time on the test server) I can fairly say this game is great. It is hands down the best battle royal game availble at this time. It's very sad to see this game's reviews go from positive to mixed. People complain about bugs but I rarely have large issues. Maybe an occasional small weird thing will happen but nothing that has ever made the game unplayable. No matter how many copies this game has sold It is still made by an indie studio. And at the end of the day its probably one of the most impressive games to come out of an idie studio. As for optimization I realize this game isnt the most optimized game on steam. As a programmer myself I can say optimization is extremly difficult. People think they arent working to improve it but they are constanly working to improve it and showing results with every release. (trust me Ive been playing since launch. It used to run like ) it runs 100% fine on my mid range gaming PC. If you're trying to run this on your 2010 business laptop you're going to have a bad time. I'm sorry but that's just how life is going to be and there's no amount of money that'll make that possible. Game budgets aren't everything. The game will continue to improve as time goes on. The devs DO care about the game and are constanly bringing new content in even ahead of schedule. They even listen to the fans and are doing things they didnt plan to do like adding a map selection option. (even I'll admit the desert map isnt that great.) I think the new smaller map thats coming soon will be extremely nice but I guess we'll have to see. My only complant about this game is that my social life has gone down the because all i do is work and play PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-31,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,"I'd love to recommend this game...because with friends it is quite fun. There are glaring CONS though... PROS Excellent Co op game many games you can play with friends requires you to 'compete' with your own teammates or rage at each other for simple human error...this game is more fun the more you stick together. Beautiful 'concept' the idea of the game is great and with some major server bugs and region fixes.... it could be 100x better. CONS Lag for gameplay 100% reliant on latency (shot placement) this is a game breaking flaw. RNG unless you have multiple monitors and do some hardcore homework/studying about spawn rates/locations... the chances of having better gear than the final 10 20 people is 1 out of (# of players in the game). That being said I have won solo games with literally 0 shots fired. It is frustrating to get 'winning' gear (ie. lvl2+ helm armor pack scar sks consumables) but simultaneously find 0 attachments (or ammo) for your weapons (get good with ironsights). BUGS OMFG THE BUGS where do I start.....? Everything from the very start of the game (parachuting/landing) til the very end (hitboxes/lag) and some wild in between (the comedy of driving)....this game is in worse shape than many early access games...yet they want full price for a ""FINISHED PRODUCT"" (if you've played at all this idea is laughable).**OVERALL** Wait for like an 80%+ discount AND make sure to have 3 reliable friends to play with. Solo IS fun for a bit but that fun dwindles incredibly fast. ....or just play Fortnite.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,89,False,Not Recommended,Quite possibly the worst team and communications behind a game I ve EVER seen. BlueHole and their mascot PlayerUnknown have apparently acquired business degrees as LegoLand. $35 game with loot boxes similar to CSGO in the level of scummy borderline criminal percentages of getting good loot. Now they re adding a BattlePass oh no wait Event Pass. Which is a great idea! No idea why it is a paid DLC and not part of the game we paid decent money for but hey whatever to squeeze the teet of the consumer out of more money I guess.This game popularised the Battle Royale genre in modern gaming but that doesn t give them the ability to stop caring about their community no matter the size. They consistently neglect their product in favour of trying to monopolise the market. It s a gaming version of the Fine Brothers taking a claim and owning React . PUBG needs to stop riding their own crotch and puffing their chest out thinking they ve made it to the top. Attacking other companies for copying such as their lawsuit with Epic Games is laughable and shallow. Games came before this games will come after. Pubg just captured people s interest which is it slowly loosing with poor decisions.If any developer reads this play some Fortnite and chill out babe then start making unique things AND fix what s currently horrifically broken in your game xx.Minecraft hunger games did it first don t me,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Whats the point of having ultra settings if you need to steal a computer from NASA to get those settings to even sorta run. game looting is just horribe takes me the entire city of poch inki to find an assault rifle just so i can die to someone with a shotgun to the back. I have never had such a bad experience looting in a battle royale game some houses are just fu cking pans and pistols. thank you for giving me the worst experience i could have ever gotten from a measly 30 dollars. i would suggest 1k concurrent H1Z1 over this game and fortnite is definately better.

2017-10-26,0,0,144,True,Not Recommended,Welcome to PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS! Or as I like to call it Loot and Die Simulator 2017! Seriously that's all you will do in this game. You spend 20 minutes looting the crap out of buildings MAYBE you encounter one or two enemies who you are able to overcome but as soon as the circle closes in you realise that you will not be surviving. This may not be because of your skill maybe you have played shooters before. No you won't survive because this game is OPTIMIZATION HELL.You want 60 fps? Too bad even when you set everything on lowest quality you still only get 40 50 except for when you use a 1080/1080ti and a new ryzen or i7 or whatever. Then you can MAYBE play the game on higher settings maybe even highest. Too bad that you will still have frame drops everytime you shoot and 9 out of 10 battles are decided by who had less technical problems. But that's all okay isn't it? PLAYERUNKOWN and Bluehole are working on the game right? YES! THEY ARE! So don't worry. The game will become better with new updates which are released weekly. WRONG! They apparently don't have motivation to work on important parts of the game anymore with all the money they now have. But here is something for you Loot Crates! Everyone loves Loot Crates right? Especially if you have to pay to open them and get that sweet sweet gamble. Will I get a 20 dollar jacket or a 10 cent hat? I don't know! What a fun experience!And when they are adding a patch that has nothing to do with loot crates? Yeah they implement the most important stuff. Your game runs on 30 fps because you can't afford a new 2000 dollar PC? No problem we got you fam! Here have this new vault animation! That's not enough? Okay here have this new foggy weather! We do stuff for the players!Don't buy this s h i t t y game before they try to fix anything optimization wise. Luckily I got my 30 dollars back through the crates I opened (hey just because I'm blaming them for implementing something like that doesn't mean I won't use it) and now this game will sit in my library until the game is a) improved quite a bit or b) I become desperate in what I want to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Even on high settings the textures look like garbage (however this may just be my pc).

And im glad I did. Thee optimization is some much better than 6 months ago i now get 60 fps solid on low settings in 1080p textures load in and dont look like clay.

Best when played in a Duo or a Squad but also Solo player battle royale available as well. I was not much of a multiplayer gamer for a long time but PUBG brought my love for multiplayer gaming back.

2017-10-14,0,0,370,True,Recommended,"This is like the game itself an ""early access"" review. Outside of the ever present issues associated with meteoric growth and it being early access and being in BETA PubG is exactly what you see. Over 10 million people have jumped in with more than 2.2 million concurrent users this weekend (Oct'17) so it is obvious this game is a juggernaut.This game concept is in it's umpteeth revision by it's creator but this time this time! he made all the calls and started from the ground up to recreate the ultimate Battle Royal experience. The game play is fast intense challenging and offers opportunites for all levels of playstyles from a Leroy Jenkins to the slithering sneaky snake in the grass. Weapon selection is likewise vast and distributed is a unpredictable pattern over a player map that also varies in terrain. Solo's Duo's and 4 man squads compete agianst the same on an island chain where the play are shrinks continuously as the game progresses forcing remaing players into an ever smaller play area. The tension becomes thick and heart rates soar.You win? you Lose? You start over. Every time. Every time you jump from the plane that carries you to the island you are an equal. You have just as much chance of getting all the good gear as anyone else ( learning curve excluded because yeah it takes a while to get good at looting so there is a grind but not like a traditional grind). You also are initially able to go where ever you feel you can on the vast play field. Most games present a grind of hours and weeks to ""get the good stuff"" in PubG eventhe first time player can gather all the best gear in the game which the expert player will then thank them for after they kill them.Final words for now..... for goodness sake people lower your ecpectations about BETA and Early Access games. They will be buggy and problematic. It just is. Despite the rapid expansion and barrels of cash PubG has brought in that doesn't turn into a room full of programmers overnight or even in months. If the issues facing these EA games are apt to infuriate you I highly reccomend that you wait until the game is completed and ready for the market. However I suspect you are like one of the 10+ millions who have jumped and so will you eh? So just roll with it have fun... you will die most of the time. Chicken dinners are rare. I do reccomend but with that EA caution.( oh yeah one more thought... the one thing that will kill this game is the cheating... as said we're still BEAT but situation has gotten out of hand. The industry as a whole needs to figure out how to exclude the avenues used to create these exploits.)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-12,0,0,56,True,Recommended,PLEASE READ EDIT BELOW AFTER READING THIS REVEIW THANKSOverall the game scores well in most areas. Lacks a little in graphics/FOD loading but its early access.I must admit i went into this game unsure to what to expect. First game after setting up graphics/controls etc. I was loaded in with 99 other players and dropped in by paracute with many mic'd players shouting and being childish but im sure you can mute them through options but gives more satifaction putting a bullet through their head when you get the chance. So decending down i opened my chute landed and went to the ground like a bat out of hell looting grabbed a pistol as another player ran into the same house after a fast load of the magazine the player dropped and here comes the adrenaline rush. And that's me hooked. Also 3rd game got me 2nd place which was very pleasing.Killing a player is satisfying and gun mechanics are really good for early access. Every weapon ive used has a good balance of rate of fire and bullet placement/handling due to the weapon your carrying. Looting is good also im sure this will become better over time. Only downfall i really dont like is the map shinks way to quick and would like it to be least double the amount of time or at least be able to choose a server that has different time locks for area depletion. As I'm a player that like's exploration before being forced to a choke point to fight. So to wrap up if you like open world 3rd/1st person shooters like Dayz or H1Z1 you'll like Player Unknown. Its loads faster than Dayz and better in PVP by far. Also the updates seem to be coming thick and fast from what I've seen and what I've read. I can see this game becoming big for 2017 and beyond.*******EDIT********There is a growing amount of AIMBOTTING already taking place and is destroying the gameplay. People are auto killing you with pistols over 100's of metres away with headshots. They also can track your location and shot you through walls. Ive found since playing its a 50/50 chance of dieing from an AIMBOTTER in a match. Its really tainting the game and this will sink fast as a game unless sorted by the devs,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-01,0,0,815,False,Recommended,"Lets be honest besides the things they still need to fix the devs did an awesome job so far.Sometimes in bad language sometimes fair and explainable.Devs made the good and realisable things come true (even it was ""just"" making Bullet Loops for the Win94)They work against cheaters had banwaves coming in always giving statements to the current situation.Giving everyone the chance to play on Testserver in every region is great. When i think of lol its just for invited players. Also u have to play on NA servers there with high ping (for me an EU Player)Besides the GC Crate they never tried to make skin money out of the game in EA.Always tried to fix reported Bugs asap even tho some of the reported bugs didnt get fixed yet it seems like they are doing their best.People complaining about Devs giving us new weapons but dont fix server lags should start to accept that there are different kind of groups of devs. Designer for Weapons are not the one fixing server problems.All in all u could say they made a very promising game coming out of EA into 1.0. Yet there are some things the need to fix but i have to admit id rather play PUBG (in EA and current 1.0) than playing a fully released game i need to buy DLCs all the time to get all the stuff i need. Id rather play PUBG than a game fully released for 40 60 bucks with a little less amount of bugs.They made IMO the best Battle Royal game ive played so far and i dont see anything coming to stop me from playing soon. I hope this game makes it through the next years giving me the fun and the salt i need to survive DIm always open for critics if u disagree im happy to hear what u think.Happy 1.0 release day guys )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-25,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,heard so much about this game and all i can say is that i am dissapointed. The gameplay loop itself is pretty great but you have to embrace the fact that there is a painfully slow progression. And the gathering of cosmetic items is so unfair. First you need to grind and be able to pay for the crate then cross your fingers that you get an opened crate else you will need to pay extra real money for it to open. Then to add insult to injury the next crate you buy will be double the price and theres only a limited amount of crates to open. No ingame drops or obtainable cosmetics anywhere else. Yes its only cosmetics but for this game to be a early access title and have so many microtransactions and still look like a early access title it insults its all its players. You are paying for early access game with a TON of microtransactions with cosmetics that probably only with real money you will get.

2017-09-30,0,0,640,True,Recommended,This game is the single most addictive gamesince team fortress 2. I have nlot put so many hours into a game this fast since tf2 and maybe overwatch. Absolute blast. It has iots bugs but to be expected and the patches roll out like clockwork so no abandoned game here. Que times are nearly INSTANT and while launching the game may take a little bit of time for some (my friends have complained about it) i have relatively short boot ups but i have an SSD so to be expected. The game closes instantly not really a selling point but something that struck me as a nice detail. I have had some t network lag moments where i get hit after being behind cover. But considering I have easilly played over 300 games it has only happend 4 times max. You get HILLARIOUS moments with friends and enemies alike (voice chat is usually cancer at the start but turn it on once you drop in its worth it). Easy mute buttons CTRL+M mutes the game CTRL+T mutes players and same buttons to undo the mute. I will say there is definatly a learning curve for the controlls I was learning a new controlwhat felt like daily for a month i swear haha. Once you learn the controlls and the weapon attatchments and the amo the game becomes natural and sinmce yyou can instantly get into a game afte losing one you can rage for a minute after losing a close one then you are distracted ebcause you are back in. HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY IT WITH this is a game best played in a team. I prefer duos but squads are so much fun as well. The feeling you get when you win is unsurpassed by any game. No other game makes you feel as accomplished when you win a game. Especially when you have a ton of kills and just outplayerd the hell out of the enemy. 150% recomended.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,188,True,Recommended,Ok before you let all the recent negative reviews deture you from trying this game I'd like to clarify some things about the game and the devs decision to add microtransactions. Yes it's an early access title so as expected there are issues however they not only add new content every month but they fix bugs and issues that are reoccurring every patch. I personally admire the direction this game is going and how the devs are using early access to listen to the community and what they want with the game and how to fix it. The devs also don't plan to keep the game in early access for years much like many indie titles we've seen in the past and have been keeping to a set release schedule (does change sometimes for a couple days occasionally if the update isn't finished) as well as an official release date that they will try to hit to the best of their ability. To knock the game and the devs only on the basis of adding a temporary ( 1 2 months) micro transaction to help them fund a tournament as well as support charity is wrong. While I don't support the decision entirely as they did promise to not add micro transaction untill the official release the game content and the devs on this game are golden. Like I said the case is temporary and they won't be releasing any more paid contents until release this allows them to test systems for the release of the microtransaction system. Plus this is purely cosmetic and doesn't change gameplay much if at all. If you don't like the paid content dont buy it don't leave a bad review complaining about a minor temporary addition that goes back on one promise made the game is still good and improving and the devs are loyal to the community. The devs will hear your cries with or without the reviews. In conclusion I disagree with the addition of the microtransactions partially as they did go back on a promise and many indie titles before now have caused many gamers pain from crashing the hype train and mistrust between the devs and community can ruin a game. However adding the groundwork now and testing the pay system will allow the games paid cosmetics and such to be better at launch and it is only temporary to fund a gathering for the gamers who love the game and would like to compete with others who are also passionate about the game. Plus some funds will go to charity the two combined reasons slightly outweigh the negative in my eyes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,67,True,Recommended,First thing. This goes for most early access games. I support alot of these but they attract the worst type of ignorant players you can imagine. Game is broken scam unoptimized whatever they can think of. People simply don't/refuse to understand the purpose if early access. It's a sad fact and try to educate them. You can imagine the responses you'll get. Anyway on to PUBG. Battle Royale with 100 players dropped over an island. Grab weapons/armor/meds and then it's last man/team standing and you can choose between 1PP/3PP so whatever you prefer it's there. There is a circle that closes in to force players closer and closer. The game is an adrenaline rush like few games can offer. Granted i'm terrible but if i reach top 10 i consider it a minor victory. Game performs quite well if you got the pc to back it up. Keep in mind optimization is an ongoing process so think of that if you run a midrange rig. I highly recommend PUBG and again. Look around other early access titles and you'll see what i mean. Hope you get this and that you'll have a great time. I'll see you in my scope,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But there are some issues that lower the skill level and makes playing the game frustrating. I have done a PROs and CONs list for all the points PROs very beauftiful map and assets very good weapon handling many weapon mods and wepaons to use ranking system (hidden) different modes (1st Person only 3rd Person modes Solos Duos Squads) skill ceiling very high pretty realistic gameplay (but not ultra complicated controls like Arma)CONs desychronisation of player models lag (cheating)Now I will explain the CONs points since the PRO points pretty much speak for themself. Desync is pretty bad. You shoot an enemy but the game does not register the hit because the player model is different between the two clients. This is especially frustrating when using shotguns or high damage sniper rifles.The lag is insane right now (30.11.2017 EU Server). In the beginning of a round players teleport around because of lag spikes. Even when 80% of the players are dead the lag still continues to appear. Example I shoot at someone and the hit does not register the next second he disappeared. Another second later I die to the guy who now shoots me from the left 20 meters away. It is unplayable at this point. And the lag does not only occur while shooting. Sometimes the game just freezes and sets you back 20 meters while you are running. Doors don't react when you try to close them. It just sucks!I personally did not encounter a cheater in this game but many people talk about it. It also happens to many streamers. I don't know how much of an issue it is right now but the price of 29.99$ for this game favours cheaters a lot (because cheap to rebuy).I personally have given up playing this game. It sucks that the lag is such a huge issue and for me it makes it impossible to play. I would NOT recommend buying this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-09,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,From reading reviews before I bought the game it seems that the company apparently doesn't give a about the community and cares more about catering to streamers to attract more people to buy the game. Also there were cosmetic items for sale before the game was even released even though the company promised they wouldn't do that. To protest this I'm just running around in boxers in the game. I only bought the game as one of my friends wanted me to play it with him and the game itself is somewhat fun but I can't recommend it as the devs suck.

2018-05-27,0,0,728,False,Not Recommended,Previously I loved this game. It was immersive competitive and a great game to come to with friends to have a good time. The gunplay was phenomenal and you'd constantly learn new ways to outsmart your opponents. While some of these things still hold true PUBG has a bad habit of fiddling with things that they shouldn't be. Instead of focusing all their attention on optimization and fixing bugs they do things like develop new microtransaction crates or change their gun mechanics drastically.I'm bewildered as to why after going through an entire beta with hundreds of thousands of players putting hundreds of hours in as to why they would adjust such an essential part of the game.If you're looking for consistency in a game this is not the one for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Gameplay is fun and graphics and audio are good as well. Easy to learn but hard to master. Tricky for when you're just starting out but like I said controls are easy to learn. This game is probably also a lot more fun with friends (I don't know because almost none of my friends play this game). Also the queue times are low which is nice.

2018-06-21,0,0,465,False,Not Recommended,"This is my first review of any game ever on steam. I think? I dunno. Its been awhile either way. So here we go Do not buy this game. Here is a list of reasons why Optimization is absolute garbage. People with i7s and 1080ti's have FPS problems The number of crates is insane to get skins. The drop rates in this crates is garbage. And the multiple keys you have to buy to get them open gets pricey especially when you get the same red shirt 4 times in a row or a dirty tank top 3 times in a row. The servers always go down during NA peak time for maintenance Cheaters are a massive problem still Desync on this game is a daily occurance. With 1 life to give it usually ends your game for that session. The dev chooses microtransactions over fixing the game $10 dollar Shroud and Dr.Disrespect crates $10 dollar event pass that is less bang for your buck than Fortnites Battle pass. The mobile version is infintely more optimized has more features (like a shooting range which people have wanted for ages) is free and is more fun to play.I have around 450 hours in this game.

2017-03-26,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,I only managed to play one game of this with a friend before the problems started.First off the game should look fantastic but the terrible frame rate at higher settings forced me to drop down to Low before I could even get a stable 30 (running a AMD RX480 8GB) which massively took away from the atmosphere that should have been created.In my 30 minutes of gameplay I did have a lot of fun as I ran from buliding to building looking for weapons and armour before I went into an old school and was instantly destroyed by a group of 4 people constantly throwing grenades into the room I was in.After this game the problems started to arrise. I closed the game for a short amount of time whilst I waited for another friend to come online but when we were all ready to launch back up and play it again for some reason the game refused to launch for me. I was waiting for about 5 minutes with steam telling me that I was in game before it decided to launch. My sigh of relief was broken almost immediately as I realised that the game had frozen just after the Bluehole logo. I closed the game closed steam and then logged back in to try and run the game again only to have the same thing happen to me again I tried this 3 more times before restarting my computer and giving it another go. This time I managed to get all the way to the main menu of the game and join my group of friends and search for a game except it crashed the moment I entered the loading screen when we found a game. I thought that something might have gone wrong with files of the game so I uninstalled it and re installed it again only to have the game crash on me again.This is a real shame as the limitted amount of gameplay that I got to play was actually very fun and made me want to go back to it as soon as I had died. I would not recommend this game as it is now as some of my friends are having very similar problems to me with both bad frame rates or crashing when trying to launch instead I will wait a few months for the Dev to have more time looking at all of the problems everyone is having and try to fix them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-17,0,0,171,False,Recommended,"Player Unkown's ""Battlegrounds"" is a good game with a semi competent developer with a bad publisher and harbours a sort of awful community. Considering the game is publish and developed by PUBG Corp. (then Bluehole) I might have some explaining to do.Let's start with the good stuff though the game itself. PUBG is a very well oiled game. The guns are differnet the gameplay is exciting if at times a bit discouraging. It's fun. Apparently it's also deep enough for people to say they're really good at it. Apparently it also has a cheater issue though I don't know how you'd tell. The kill cams the game has are really janky and while you could spectate the person who killed you I don't really care to be honest. One problem with the game is that it is a kind of one trick pony. It does Battle Royale well but it does nothing else. There's no little deathmatch practice mode there's no racing component nothing. If you're a Battle Royale purist I guess that's fine but it gets a bit boring after a bit.As for story there is none. There's no reason why you're there and the game doesn't give you one. I like to pretend that my character is some school teacher that got abducted by these weird Russian guys to fight to the death in some forest in Eastern Europe. But now they have 2 other maps so whatever. The maps are alright as well big too. 2 are 16 kilometers by 16 kilometers and the newest one is 4 kilometers by 4 kilometers. They all have their merrits though I'd say the weakest one is the Desert one. Erangal. It's just too big. You see the Eastern European one that has a name that escapes me is a little smaller than the desert one but has 400 vehicle spawns wheras Erangal has 240 vehicle spawns. So I hope you like walking if you play on that map. As for how it runs I don't have any issues on my R9 380 AMD FX 8350 12 gbs of ram on an HDD. It runs fine for me on high as long as I have Google Chrome off anyway. The looks of PUBG aren't that impressive though. PUBG doesn't have an aesthetic really. It doesn't have an art style. Because almost every asset is bought off the Unity asset store. This isn't a big deal but compared to its brother Fortnite PUBG is an ugly game. It's pretty boring and uninspired in that regard. The cosmetic scene is a little weird. I'd say PUBG is a pretty bad company overall if you're a consumer anyway. They frequently go back on their word on how cosmetics will work doing frankly weird stuff like banning steam trading and selling keys when they said they wouldn't. Of course now they've copied Fortnite's battle pass system which seems kind of gross. It's their toy they can do what they want with it but it seems pretty odd to sell a game for 30 dollars and then to sell a monthly pass for 10 bucks to go with it. That's PUBG or at least what I think it is. Yeah that sounds about right.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is horrible and has zero optimisation. During early access at least i could get 70 fps on medium.

2017-04-24,0,0,34,True,Recommended,Fun little game. you and 90ish people get thrown out of a plane on a map. you land where you want. Once you touch ground everyone is against you or your team! search for loot and weapons in house/buildings/air drops. after while you need to relocate to the battleground. as time goes by the battleground limits get smaller until a player or team is/are last man standing.I like how the loot is quickly acquired you can manage to find good stuff at random locations unlike some games where the loot is at highly crowded areas.the gun fights feel realistic enough. the health and heal system is good in my opinionI think that the games are too quick sometimes... you barely got anything that you have to relocate non stop and you don't get enough time to make up your strategy. Some games you'll always be running/driving like crazy to make it in the damn white circle totally blowing away your cover.the driving controls also feel a bit clunky at the momentme and one of my friend played 5 or 6 rounds and made it to the final 4 once so you can manage to survive even if you're brand new at the game.

Easy fix game is still enjoyable as loading only takes like 30 seconds to a minute.

2018-03-02,0,0,564,False,Recommended,I can't say I'm a pro at this game but I can give some tips for it considering it is one of my favorite games. PUBG I have grinded hours on end. This action packed game can have many high and low ends but over all I would say its a great game. However however I would need to say that they need to make this game easier to run. (More Smooth) On top of that I feel like they should adjust somethings with the Regions. Team communication is crusial so I belive they need to add some feature that adds more of it. (Region Lock China) With that many things will change and lots of players I know will be very releaved. The cheating system is also pretty bad. When someone locks onto your head follows you with it and completly eats your with no recoil in top 5 yehh thats dissapointing. But for the most part this game keeps on getting better and better with every path they send out. The bugs can be bad indeed but i'm sure they'll be patched sooner or later. PS allowing you to choose which map would be pretty useful. D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-23,0,0,2096,False,Recommended,Recently i've read a lot of negative reviews about this game. However i cannot confirm most of these reviews.. Most of the time people talk about bugs and bad server tick rates.. i have not really experienced any of those. Of course sometimes you're sitting in the plane and can't jump out sometimes your car is doing weird things but overall it's not as full of bugs as people say. I'm using a GTX 1060 (6GB Vram) and an Intel i5 8400 and most of the time i have more than 100 fps except for big cities like Yasnaya or Poch1nki (edit apparently this name is being censored by steam) ... And for those saying it was full of cheaters well.. you're probably just bad or don't have enough experience with weapons. PUBG is permantly trying to get rid of cheaters for instance you can't play PUBG with family shared accounts anymore. On the other hand its kinda true that it's still 30 and they probably added weapons to make more profit but this money can also be spend to reinvest on the game.. unlike fortnite they only get money when people buy the game or when you sell/buy a weapon skin on the steam market (taxes). They are currently working on a new map which again requires money. Speaking about Fortnite.. it has become a competitor to PUBG and therefore PUBG is constantly losing players earning less money. If you're thinking about buying this game you should only do it if you're certain about your CPU/GPU and believe in PUBG's developing progress. In my opinion there are a lot of games on steam which are being improved all the time and are worth buying for they are being worked on all the time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However its got alot of people playing and they're an unappologetically unPC kind of crowd to which I like. The game itself feels cheap but functional the gem of it is just the expierence and suspense of being apart of the surviving crowd as the combat zone shrinks and keeps you on the move.

2017-10-21,0,0,649,True,Not Recommended,This game is horrible. I've played in multiple tournaments and put a good amount of time into this game. The lag at the beggining makes it take four tries to pick anything up and everyone will be teleporting around the area. The desync is so bad you'll be fully behind cover for a full second and then somehow die from a shot that already went past you. I've killed so many people that were behind cover its incredible. The parachute mechanics are so bad that you'll often find yourself stuck in your parachute while someone has enough time to pick up a gun and shoot you or possibly just punch you out. There is a cut shoot mechanic which would solve these problems if it 1) gave you the option or 2) took less than about 3 seconds of floating before the shoot was actually cut.The aim and gun mechanics are fine however the vehicles are hot garbage. I have plenty of clips of me driving on the road (you know the flatest surface in the game) going directly straight and flipping out of no where as if I ramped off of an invisible rock. Sometimes they just glitch back and forth and explode for a little extra flavour and variety in your gameplay experience. Hackers aren't nearly as big of an issue as people make it out to be (I've only seen 2 in my time) but it seems like people are hacking all the time because of how terrible the mechanics and lag is that most of the time you end up just never wanting to play the game again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For an early access game this has far surpassed thousands of games in uniqueness and quality. The devs have constant communication making it easy for the community to voice any concerns and for the devs to release any information about the game.

(they should add C4 breakable walls Fun limited game mods like CSGO Mode like u have to defuse a bomb or tactical game mode like rainbow six siege)I know they have kind get money from the game but still if you add more content people are gonnna come to your game and play it (this game is not free but it doent make as much money as the other free games that have better content)At the end In my idea Dont download this game Now probbly in future but not now becuse its on the fall and it keeps coming down.if you want to download it try it out its not free but its waste of money get pubg when its on discount it may probbly worth it that time.I thought Pubg is fun becuse i watched Shroud play it but no no no its not fun for me but i still watch this game on shrouds channel becuse he is a good guy and i want to support him!thanks for reading this review 4 10 this game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Every game people with names like 19285083719836 or Qi_Fong_dong3 get 40 kills and win They probably have good gaming chairs because they just kill you from 10 kilometers away through the ground. Bluemicrodick is also milking their player base for money with the battle pass and weapon skins that you buy. They focus more on introducing cosmetics then they do fixing netcode and bugs that the game has. Although I do enjoy this game the only thing that can save it is not adding new maps or cosmetics but fixing the core problems and region locking China.The player base is quickly declinging and if Blue doesnt do anything their game will soon be dead... https //steamdb.info/app/578080/graphs/,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-18,0,0,116,False,Recommended,Before 1.0 and the mass ban wave PUBG was unstable slithering with cheaters full of game breaking bugs and overall a game that you wanted to enjoy but simply couldn't. After all the recent patches and improvments almost all of those problems are gone. FPS can sometimes be a slight issue but that is expected for such a large map with millions of interactable objects being loaded at once. For reference with a (nothing overclocked) i5 6600k 16gb DDR4 and a 1060 6gb running Windows 8 I can cling on to 60fps without v sync but at times especially in the first 5 10 minutes of the match it can drop to around 30 for a few seconds every so often. I can't complain though it used to be a hell of a lot worse and it seems to be improving every patch so If played right it is a really enjoyable game with tons to do and so many opportunities to kill. In your first few games you'll probably want to drop somewhere remote to gear up and then approach people once you are ready bad idea. You'll end up finding almost nothing and then you won't see anyone until the last 20 people. The best way to learn to play this game is to throw yourself head first literally. Drop into the most populated spots (usually just the biggest areas on the map) and get straight into it. You'll get far fast.You have the ability to make the match what you want it to be just by dropping in a certain area and that's what makes this game stand out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-20,0,0,187,False,Recommended,"This game is super unique and it's always fun even when it's punishing. The strategy involved for such a game is much more interesting then what you commonly see in first/third person shooters.The early access version definitely has some bugs in spots but it's pretty polished overall and feels like a complete game already. If they released what's currently out as the full version I wouldn't be too upset so don't go in thinking it's super broken or anything.It's something that I keep coming back to as well so they must be doing something right. Highly recommended.Edit Now that the full version is out a lot of the bugs have been fixed and the game looks &amp feels a lot better than it did in early access. The features they've added are also especially cool such as being able to vault over walls and fences and being able to climb up short ledges. You can use this to climb on boxes (or other things in the environment) to get to higher locations or you can use it to jump out of windows for a quick &amp easy escape from a building. It changes a lot of the dynamic of the game in a good way and makes things a bit more interesting.Another new feature they've added in the full version which I really like is the replay system. After a match is over you can see a recorded version of the match. The recording is limited to a radius around your player but the radius is pretty large and it feels like you can see everything you would want to see in reference to how you did vs. other players.You're also able to see the location of all players on the map which is cool for seeing how popular certain areas on the map are becoming. for the players in your range you can spectate their gameplay or you can choose to ""follow"" their character (allowing you to rotate the camera). There is also a free look option if you hit spacebar.One of my favorite things in the replays would be all of the iconography on the map. You will see lines drawn whenever players fire their weapons seeing the exact trajectory of the bullets and when somebody takes a hit you'll see a red aura pulse from their icon.The replay system is very useful especially for new players who are looking to see what they did wrong and how to adjust their strategies.Overall aside from these new features the game is still very much the game it was in early access except it's more polished it runs better and there's also now a second map. The game just seems to be continuing to grow and expand and I would consider it even more highly recommended now than ever before.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It feels surreal you really get into the game and it is one of the only game that really requires you to sit down and focus on to get good at.

2017-03-30,0,0,891,True,Recommended,So as it seems there have been a lot of people reviewing the game stating that the performance more specifically the lack there of is seemingly sub par. I for one don't find this too be true with my rig running a 4790K/ gtx780 and 16gb of ddr3 clocked at 1600. The game runs at over 60fps in open areas and a little over 30 in highly populated areas such as cities and the developers have already addressed the issue with being a high CPU overload that the GPU could easily take on. The performance I get is already more than playable and very enjoyable with the game being in its beta state. The developers will be rolling out updates in the following months that should move more of the CPU front load to the GPU and make a much more silky smooth expierence for us players. I would highly recommend purchasing this title if you are a fan of the batlle royal or fps survival genre. Please don't be discouraged by the reviews stating they refunded due to unplayability on their so called high end machines because my mid range machine can run the game at ultra with decent performance.

I felt like it was something I'd enjoy but wasn't sure. First I can say week I didn't like it much and would play about 3 or so matches quit play siege and maybe play again for al little later. Took a break came back now I'm hooked on it. Just gotta get some people to play with I've enjoyed it more than Arma 3 which was my first pc purchase and I regret that Shooting takes some getting used to and it's more technical than fortnite but it's good. Shots feel better placed than a lot of those BR games but sometimes I feel like lag kills me. All in all it's a good game for people who've came from something else and looking for a game to break the ice as far as PC games. Drop school and hacienda every single time you'll get wrecked but it's what gets you good. Went from getting 0 kills to like 3 on squads doesnt sound like much but thats a lot in this game.

Very popular so almost always a full lobby but its impossible to play when half the server is either ping abusing by jumping on a different continents server or just straight hacking the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-22,0,0,300,True,Not Recommended,So let me start off by saying this game was a ton of fun. Here comes the but...... but the hackers you have to deal with now are starting to outweigh the fun. In the current state of the game I'm running into an aimbot roughly 1 in 5 games on a good night. The devs are also slow moving on mechanical updates to the game. I'm hoping this is just due to the approaching release and not a 7 days to die style 'we've got your money already so we'll just keeping making minor updates for years' approach. Current state not worth the money but give the devs a few months and check back in. I have high hopes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Second thing is that the shop is EMPTY basicly on the phone you have so much stuff (Gun Skins Shirts... ect) but here you cant even get a shirt. You can buy the crate with gold but not the key wich is so unfair.And also you should made a tutorial to the game for me it took a VERY long time to figure out howto use the scope but my friend by an accident turned the scope on. I dont want a refund or anything but i am very disappointed at the game.

2017-08-15,0,0,172,True,Recommended,Lots of fun but is pretty buggy. If you intend on buying this get ready to be extremely mad at times and really happy other times. It's very promising that it's in early access while still running fairly smoothly. You will encounter FPS drops (with my GTX 1070 and i7 6700k I usually average 80 100 FPS on high settings 50 70 FPS on Ultra settings. However this does not prevent it from dropping to 40 or lower in some situations) and you will encounter awkward vehicle mechanics buggy spectating the rare cheater and netcode/lag issues. Sometimes you will be killed and you confidently feel like you should have lived. That being said this game is incredibly fun. Playing solo or with friends is a great experience and getting Chicken Dinners is very rewarding. This game has the potential to become a very mainstream PC game for the foreseeable future. Keep in mind EARLY ACCESS there are bugs and various issues but they will be sorted out eventually. Would recommend however recently there have been stupid bannings for their new strict cheating rules.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-07,0,0,255,False,Not Recommended,A solid game countered by flaws which can ruin the games fun. Here are two of the major ones that need addressing Area of Play Both maps are rather large which is a good thing. The bad thing is that players are given too large of a range to drop from. This leads to a lot of fighting within the first few minutes amongst those who land close together then almost no fights because the survivors are so far apart. Not as much of a problem in Erangel but in Miramar it can be difficult to run into people for a large portion of the game.My way to fix it would be to limit the drop range by having the plane travel less of a distance on the map rather than have the plane cross the entire map.Hacking This is something many people complain about often followed by region lock China . But I m not here to moan about Chinese players. What the game lacks is a strong regularly updated anti cheat.I personally run into hackers quite often maybe 1 every 5 games which is a lot. I usually encounter them when I manage to make it into the last 10/20. The ones using aimbot are very blatant. The ones using wall hacks are easy enough to spot once you look for the right things.I still enjoy the game but these are two issues that I think need to be looked into ensure players have more enjoyable matches.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-07,0,0,80,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is an amazing take on the battle royale genre. This game requires lots of skill and strategy in order to even get close to a victory. You can play solo duos squads or no fill ssquads which alll are fun in their own right. To add on to this there are also seperate gamemodes which are events like 50v50 or 5 teams of 10 which is on right now or the zombie gamemode. There is a lot of versatility in the game. The game has weapons for every playstyle all the way down to the sights and attachments on the guns.

Consider that it's running Unreal Engine 4 it also has very good physics.Cheaters i have encountered none so far and i'm used to playing against them since ive tried many Chinese Knockoffs such as Rules of survival Knives out and Ring of Elysium/Europa.Game is dying they say?? takes only 3 seconds to fill a 100 player game on 5 00 am in South East Asia.And there are no filler bots.Game Mechanics is very challenging and amazing i dare say CS GO feels arcadey after playing this. There's bullet drop Crosshair Zeroing and the guns are all useful.You could even kill someone from afar with a handgun if you really know how to use it.Bugs no there are no game breaking bugs that causes you to lose.A little glitch here and there like every open world game.The servers though aren't as consistent when launching the game.But in game it's smooth sailingBest Battle Royale game",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I moved up to the ledge sighted in held shift on their head to steady it and... The game freezes and then crashes. I didn't even get to one shot off!! That about sums it up for me. Play this game if you want to get angry and fill your system with rage on a regular basis. Close range action is just plain aweful. The game is so choppy and jumpy when you first parachute in. Instead of trying to punch someone you might try yelling at the person through the mike. It's probably more effective.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-31,0,0,239,True,Recommended,PUBG is a walking or working simulator at its core but I don t wish to go against the grain too much here. In any case you better have friends to become head Slav of the bunch. Drop in alone with a friend or three and fight to the last man/men standing. Simple as that. My tirade with PUBG has mainly to do with the fact that it is still in an alpha state. Still. Through several recent updates developers have tweaked some latency issues and hit registration but the game is desperately incomplete with choppy frame rates and an egregious amount of cheaters. But hey at least there s less people botting. Don t let that all fool you into thinking the game is anywhere near being dead (au contraire). Chicken dinners are decadent meals sought after by hundreds of thousands. A new desert map is on the horizon in addition to a deadlier blue circle of death. Despite the alpha state the devs care to make this game playable even if it means igniting debate over paid cosmetic crates.In summary play with friends.

2018-03-28,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,They definitly gave it a try but a small dev team and a game engine that doesn't support the style very well. Fortnite did exactly what they didn't they took suggestions from thier community and didn't dedicate 80% of thier focus to lootboxes. The small dev team is swimming in cash and could probably care less about the game itself and more about the money made off lootboxes and Chinease hackers. Everyone asked for a region lock and its a simple concept that aparently isn't comprehensible. I played this game for 30 hours and did enjoy some of it but with hackers and bugs everywhere in a game that's been out for almost a year this is unacceptable. I play fortnite now becuase they don't have lag and hackers everywhere. Now whatever you try to change is too little too late.

They don't seem to be interested in imporving the game there are a litany of bugs and technical issues. I have to open task manager just to play the game otherwise it tries to do first time set up every time and gets stuck in a loop. The servers are not up to standard and honestly I wish they would stop messing about with stuff for streamers (stuff in custom) and get the basics sorted. Also f*** microtransactions.I loved this game because I love the concept and they were the first to get the formula right also I don't particularly like fortnite. There will be loads of battle royal games though so I'll look forward to the next one with a modern military setting.Originaly I recomended it see original review below It's been review bobmed twice incase you havent heard it's a good game but it was first review bombed because chinese players got an ad for a third party VPN as the chinese servers are really slow and laggy. Now that chinese players go on other servers (for better lag) the americans and the aussies are reviw bombing because they dont want th chinese on their servers. Long story short the review score has very little to do with the actual game which is a good game that is not well optimised and does have bugs but creates tension like nothing else.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The subquests range in difficulty from easy to very hard. It is intended to be a quest which nearly any member can start but which only the most accomplished and willing players can complete.The cook in Lumbridge has a surprisingly small number of ingredients to hand in his kitchen possibly as a result of an endless stream of newcomers with light fingers taking anything that isn't nailed down from his kitchen.Luckily in the past a kind Cook's Assistant was willing to help him in his culinary duties but a problem has now appeared that could spell... a Recipe For Disaster!Almost all members may attempt to solve his tricky predicament and be rewarded accordingly but only the very elite of Questers will be able to put an end to his problem permanently!Note Make sure you have at least one inventory slot free before the Culinaromancer dies. If you have a full inventory on finishing the quest (i.e. in the unlikely event that you kill the Culinaromancer without having to eat any food) you will not receive the reward item.

2018-05-30,0,0,895,False,Not Recommended,"Not only 2/3 weeks ago I gave this game a positive rating because I could see the reviews plummeting. Somehow in those 2/3 weeks the game has hit a brand new low for me and I feel inclined to change my recommendation. The servers are performing terribly lots of rubber banding having to vault over things several times getting caught on terrain. Vehicles perform much worse now than they did a year ago? In the update that comes tomorrow they are removing map select for Erangel forcing me to queue between a map I don't want to play and a map I do. Every single time I land on the map I don't want to play I'm going to consider if I even want to continue playing PUBG at all since I can't even play what I want anymore. They are introducing a ""battle pass"" which is a system suited for a F2P game into a game that cost $30. So they are expecting you to PAY to grind for cosmetics. Yes the progression system is locked behind a paywall. There is absolutely no other way to look at this new venture than as a cash grab on Bluehole's behalf. I love the game but forcing ppl to grind for cosmetics purely because of the sunken cost fallacy is a low I didn't think Bluehole would stoop to. Whatever price the pass costs would actually be acceptable if the new cosmetic crates released would retain value like they used to. I could have just sold crates to cover the cost of the pass but now the crates are worth .04 so its not possible. Really upset with the direction the game has taken. Right now is soo not a good time for BH to be pushing people's buttons due to the sheer lack of games out right now. No reason to play this buggy problem filled mess over just about any other game now even if it is the best BR on the market.old review Played since closed beta quit for a while because of the crazy desync/lag. Came back for 1.0 patch and things arn't perfect but they have certainly improved. I believe this game deserves a positive rating because the game itself is actually fun as hell and even if nothing got better from this point forward I've had a lot of fun with the game made money and learned quite a lot about tactics.

There are tons of problems for instance you get in a fire fight hide behind a while and take 3 4 more shots and die and you are clearly behind the wall desync is HUGE in the game. They cant seem to put out a decent anti cheat so if you were to ever try and play this game at a competitive level you get wrecked by wall hacks and no recoil macros. they add emotes and gun skins but refuse to fix the acutal gameplay.

Fun (For the most part) gameplay. Rewarding (You aren't given anything the other players aren't and due to that you rely on your own skills)CONS As of now it's a bloody mess to run properly between weird glitches rubber banding lag and odd occurences (Gun damage not being read properly and so on) it can be difficult to accept some of it's oddities. But if you can get over that it's my main drawback. Frustrating for those looking for something easy (This is not an easy game be ready to die... a lot.) Somewhat chaotic and toxic community (I would recommend finding a group to play with if you want to do squad games because playing with randoms isn't ideal for people uncomfertable with language both profane and racist in the worst degree... But this is the internet we are talking about you probably already knew that.)OVERALL I think for $30 you are not going to find a better Co op shooter this side of Steam (Besides more intense titles such as Arma and so on)It's simple plain shootem' up fun and I wouldn't have it any other way.I'll see you on the Battlegrounds with a pan in my hand dressed only in my underwear and a motorcycle helmet and a smile on my face.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-06,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,I've tried many times to like this game probably gonna try it again in the future but i just can't reccomend it.It's a buggy cheater infested poorly optimized mess with frequent hiccups both from the game itself and from the servers. And it doesn't even have the qualities to justify these performances the graphics the models the animations are all average at best so it's not like it has to load some overcomplicated stuff.The movement is slow both walking and aiming it always feels like you're contantly moving through molasses shooting feels like a dice roll sometimes the shots register sometimes they don't CQC fights are a nightmare due to these factors.Even when it works it has the alluring chance of you getting into an exciting gunfight or sniping a guy from a long distance but these moments are rare most of the time the fights are one sided as you're dead before you even realize where the shots are coming from and the fights generally last less than a minute the remaining 30+ minutes that you don't spend looting you spend running from point A to point B hoping not to get sniped by a guy camping on a hill since the start of the game.I regret giving this game more than one chance i cannot reccomend it unless you have friends to play with and are fine with potentially walking around for 30+ minutes only to get killed by things you had no control over. Even then try other battle royales that are FTP before spending 30 on this.TLDR Game is a mess controls like and is boring unless you have somebody to play with or are a masochist try other FTP BR games before deciding to spend money on this.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,264,True,Recommended,"So first things first. If you are reading this then you are at least considering this game. Don't believe all the negative reviews. People upset over something really dumb that has no actual impact on the gameplay IE crates. Thats what all the negative reviews are about. This game especially when played with a squad reminds me of old school socom on playstation 2. Tactical. Hair raising frustrating. Socom in an open world while scavanging your weapons. This game doesn't do much new or bring a ton new to the ""survival"" type games except one thing the circle. A circle appears randomly on this huge island and you have to stay in it. Sounds simple and it is. But its genius. I hated the other survival type games because well everyone camped. Now there is certainly camping here too but the circle that is ever moving makes the game move along and makes the players funnel from all over this massive island to get into the circle or they die. For being an alpha it runs pretty damn good. I have a newer gaming laptop and it runs on ultra holding 60fps just great.

2018-02-12,0,0,180,False,Recommended,I've been playing PUBG for a while now on and off. It's a tricky one to review because it's never going to be a GOTY contender but then again few games can get the heart racing like PUBG does. The game itself is a lot of fun. When you get that chicken dinner it's a great feeling but even coming in the top 10 can give you satisfaction. Some of the most enjoyable games i've played are ones when i didn't win the round. The gameplay is fun and addictive whilst each round feels unique and plays out differently. there's a lot to learn and skill forms a large part of being a successful player but each round requires good luck and favourable drops from the RNG gods. At it's core PUBG is a game of decisions the way you react to situations is often the deciding factor to how the round will play out for you. Some parts of the game are still a bit clunky and performance issues seem to persist for a lot of players. I ll often be enjoying a silky smooth game only to run into rando lag spike and frame drops despite my PC being more than capable. I've recently started having issues where i get stuck in the load screen whilst in the lobby and the plane which is frustrating. the loot boxes are dog crap. the chances of getting anything you want is far too small and they seriously need to up the odds. All in all PUBG is a great game thats fun to play and will have you putting your fist through the monitor in no time at all. it can be rough around the edges but it will keep you coming back time and time again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I adore this game in a sense for being such a good example of Battle Royale done right but when you not only begin charging microtransactions in an early access game let alone go back on your word about not doing it you don't deserve any more money. Meanwhile the game is buggy and glitchy as hell. Games crash frequently every patch brings a gamebreaking update in some way that doesn't get patched for a day and I've played games where textures never fully loaded for a high of ten minutes meaning I couldn't loot let alone walk or see much since it lagged like hell. And no I don't have a toaster GTX 970 i7 6500U 8GB Ra.

I played the Arma 3 mod before h1z1 was even considered and that was fun because it was free was a mod and had no microtransactions. nowadays it feels they are more focused on squeezing pennies out of every possible avenue (including bullsh*t lawsuits) then actually making the game good. had a LOT of potential that I feel they just dropped the ball on.

Hackers and FPS dips are frequent but this is to be expected for a relatively new game. A region look would not go unwanted as the EU servers and NA servers are being bombarded with loads of players with insanely high ping.23/04/18 Bluehole have failed to add much to keep this game fresh causing a significant but not detrimental dip in the player base they add a few new game modes every now and again but they are only available for a short time. Now they seem insistant on fixing something is not broken. 05/07/18 The game has become a in game purchase mess and continues to spit on its fanbase adding pointless attachments and threatening to completely de balance the game. The crate system was ok to begin with as it was not integral yet the money grabbing is becoming more and more apparent. The problem with hackers and low optimisation for some has still not been addressed with game mode and map development consistently being slow.

It takes a while to get used to but once you have gotten used to it all is dandy and you should be able to survive and pull off kills. Don't expect to get Pro and be winning games left right and centre with like 10 hours gameplay since it is quite challenging and it beats every other BR out there. It's better to play with a squad since playing solos can get boring and i would say it is easier to learn with squads since you don't have to watch every corner for people since you have other eyes. 10/10 Would recommend for the average player.

Since there is so many people playing it the server's in NA are always full so your going to get matched with people from China and have a ton of ping however this will probably be fixed by the time you read this reveiw. some of my friends bought this tittle just so they could play with all low settings and have 100 fps witch is playable but I don't think it's worth it. On the lowest settings it looks like and it can be hard to see people far all way from you if your going to get this tittle I would recommend investing in a new GPU to get the full experience (I have a gtx 1060 and I can run it at 200 300 fps on all of the highest settings)Overall this is a great game and though it's had some road bumps along the way the devs are working hard to make it the best possible experience for all palayers ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In pubg i can get crates that are free and that you can pay for. So sell the pay for crates to people who want them and make some money for your self and buy some new games or what ever you want and the crates that are free open them and if you dont want the item sell it someone out there might want it or turn it into bp and try to get a new crate. in fortnite can i sell my skins and make money off of it?

First of all the game itself is definitely the best battle royale game on PC and I can tell that Bluehole is working on the game really hard and trying to make it better but the work they've done are not enough. As a Chinese I'm very sad that all the cheaters now are basically from China and I understand why people would want to region lock China. There are still a lot of improvements need to be done like game models vechicles weather system safe zone etc. And the most important one is anti cheat. I've enjoyed the game a lot and I'm a top 800 DUO FPP player on NA server I hope the game can get better and better. I still have faith in Bluehole.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So it was us and some other guy. We were pumped first Chicken Dinner? Maybe? But alas. It was not to be as PUBG crashed on me just as we were pushing the final circle. Now from a purely shallow perspective as I don't understand what went wrong it's infuriating. But Who knows. Who knows....... sad days.That being said It is an awesome game the event modes are awesome and yeah. Just a few negatives Cheaters/hackers(though the devs are as far as I can tell pretty thoroughly engaged in this battle so its moreover a few toxic community members to blame)More and different maps can make a battle royale game like PUBG a whole different game based on what map you pick(which is a big plus map selection!)Game crashing Its happened to me a few times but never at a key moment until now.

2017-03-24,0,0,995,True,Recommended,I want to start by saying great game!The adrenaline pump you get in this game is crazy.I've played a lot of Arma 3 Battle Royale which is an awesome mod. So good job PLAYERUNKNOWN for doing a standalone game for this genre.I highly recommend this game it's in Early Access so of course it will have some issues. So the big one is of course the performance. This game should at least get a solid 60 FPS where ever you are at all times. My preference is to have 100+ FPS. There are some minor problems as well like getting into cars sometimes is very slow and sometimes it doesn't even register that i'm trying to get in. I have a strong belief that you will fix this as time goes on. I also feel like the pace is a little faster than Arma 3 tho but it's okay. And I can not wait for the first person only servers to come. Because this 3rd person stuff I don't like you are not supposed to have the ability to look around a corner without looking around it physically. When I play Arma 3 Battle Royal I always aim for the first person only servers. It feels like no one have the upper hand when you always in first person. But nevertheless AWESOME GAME!Keep up the good work.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-25,0,0,264,True,Recommended,This game all over h1z1. but to get a rifle and make the top 80 is half the battle. some of the servers are laggy but in early access and on peak times i guess its normal. the rewards seem a bit random get points from a game use to receive a box open the box and a new shirt is in your inventory.. it could do with a bit of extra hype rare item etc to keep the solo players coming back. over all 9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-25,0,0,28,True,Recommended,Well this is my first attempt to write a review so this by itself says a lot about the game.When PUBG first came out I thought it was just another random indie steam game.I thought is was just another shooter amidst the hundreds of shooters on steam.I rejected it at first glance.The a while later I noticed it was the most streamed game on twitch.I thought myself no way.It looked silly really and I couldnt find the point of the game.Later I saw a bunch of guys playing it at a local internet cafe. I still wasnt sold.And the just a bit later I saw my mates playing it day and night.I told the are you guys serious you cant be spending all you day with this crap.The assured me the game was fun but I dismissed them again.And then at a night of my day off I was getting really bored.I thought about buying the game to kill some time.I thought the game would be a waste of money but then again I was really bored so I bought it.I went for a duo match with my buddy.Long story short by the end of the match I was hooked.Everything about this game makes sence and it is a really tence game that makes your heart beat at every moment.There is no right or wrong way of playing.There is no high score for most kills.You just have to stay alive more than other players.Plain and simple survival.The map is huge with tons of features.Sometimes I think every deatail of the map has a story to say.So for the final verdict I reccomend the game to every shooter fan.I am a really hard guy to change opinion and this game changed my opinion from bottom to top.Its the only game I play since that night.PS Even thought the game is still in alpha I believe it is quite polished and I havent encountered any bugs whatsoever.Maybe a few fps drops here and there but only rarely.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Wish the game would reward people that bought the game rather than trying to suck us dry for more money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-28,0,0,689,False,Recommended,Ah Battlegrounds. You are a tempting lady to say the least. I love to love you and I love to hate you. Well hate your maker rather. PUBG as a game is really fun in my humble opinion. Sure it has it's share of bugs (some that are getting more annoying by the day) but all in all it's a great experience with friends.The Good * Overall game play is addicting* Variety of situations you can and will find yourself in are never ending* The pacing of the game is really good for those of us that enjoy both intense and laid back gameplay* Gun play is really fun and very satisfying when you get a kill* New content (maps and loot) are only getting better as the game matures* Cheaters were rampant. Nearly every game I played I saw or was killed by one. However PUBG Corp's initiative to diminish their impact seems to be working as I rarely encounter one these days.The Bad * Bluehole / PUBG Corp. are now starting to treat this game as a cash grab and it's really starting to show. They are fixing bugs which is nice but they are creating more annoying bugs in the process.* Lag is getting worse. It cancels jumps teleports you meters away from where you thought you were and kills you after you've been behind cover for even as much as a second or two.* Can not connect to lobby without several retries* Not being able to see all your friends on the in game friends/team UI is really annoying* Did I mention this game is turning into a cash grab?* Updates are rolled out during North America prime time of play and with very little warning. This shuts down the servers for 3 4 hours and no play is possible. They offer regional servers so why not roll out the update regionally during each regions lowest activity time? Software Deployment 101.* With the exception of the newest map Sanhok testing of patches is barely given adequate time before rolled out to the production servers. Sometimes only a day on the test servers before moved to production. As a software engineer this is bothersome. Especially for a user base as large as PUBG has.* Speaking of Sanhok and testing PUBG stated several times that they are going to be spending lots of time and testing cycles on it so it is as perfect as possible. And for the most part they have succeeded. It's is a well designed and beautiful map. My favorite experience yet. HOWEVER there are very obvious cosmetic flaws in the form of floating assets all over. If this is PUBG Corp's idea of perfect then I'm not surprised the game and company are in the states they are.* They are working on optimizing the game but still a long way from it. I receive FPS drops frequently on my mid range rig. I don't expect to achieve a steady 144 FPS the entire time but going from 110 FPS to 45 FPS just by looking a different direction is jarring and limits my ability to win a fire fightConclusion This game is really fun if you can take it light heartedly and enjoy it for what it is. It is no where near a Triple A title and I suppose it's priced as such but with how popular it was and still is you'd think they would have been able to make it better than it currently is. All in all I will say I recommend it because I still have a lot of fun in it but PUBG Corp is really starting to sour my taste of it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is amazing. yes there are moments when you wonder why am i playing this? why when there are so many bugs. for me i play this because it is a journey. ive done alo in my life. my childhood on the farm for instanc. but seeing this game come from a mess and startign to actually be a decent and playable game is amazing. vaulting for example. a new feature that is being tested works almost flawlesslley. you cant expect a game like this on this scale with so many different objects from the butterflies that make you think its a perrson to the random airdrops. all this takes time and effort but most importantly it takes patience which alot of people here dont have. Im rating this a 8.7 out of 10 because there are still bugs that need ironing but i have high hopes for this game. for new people comign to this and hearing that its bad or that its good dont hesitate. you can always refund (just say you dont meet specs ) ) try the game make your own opinion on this. another point yes this game is not optimized. i run a 6500t with 1050TI and 32gb Ram. i still take quite some time to load in but again all the testing on the test servers im experiencing increased frame rates and bette performance. please dont listen to the reviews of people review it for yourself. if you have to ask a friend with it to library share it with you. this game can be shared. you have to use theri PUBG account but it atleast lets your try the game before buying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-30,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,Playing games for 20 years now so i've seen alot but this is one of the worst product i have ever played.Scroll down for comparison with _Fortnite_.Problems with PUBG Terrible inventory system Terrible pick up mechanism Therefor terrible looting experience Terrible perfomance Playing the game on a brand new system made in the end of 2017. Newest drivers everything. Fresh install. Yet the game force crash when i open up the map or the inventory. This is not tolerable. After searching for hours found others who also had this problem the only solution is to delete some cfg files + altering some .ini files.Untolerable. At the same even with the terrible perfomance the game looks rubbish. Seriously its beyond words how ugly every single object in this game. Textures got more jagged edges than a jaw of a shark even on max settings. You think Battle Royal is fast paced action filled? You're wrong in this game you can run in a straight line for 25 minutes never meet a single person then get killed in 1 3 seconds. Cheaters no region lock lack of meaningful updates terrible loot crate system with high price maps are terrible with zero foliage...Fortnite made _every_ problem of Pubg non existent fixing everything. Colod coded items + Chests works much better. Added complexivity layer with the building mechanism. Truely fast paced action orianted gameplay. Zero bugs Runs great even on potato Even the lowest settings are decent And the list could go on forever...Yeah Fortnite got the idea from Pubg so what?

A good chunk of them are hacking too and they'll just buy another cheap account if they get banned. Have fun getting full auto sprayed from 400m out by a chinese name or just a name of numbers. Have fun watching a death cam of your killer sitting in yourr molotov before getting shot by an m24 and two point blank shotgun (with choke) shells all while taking no damage. Funny thing about that apparently we're all racist according to Brendan Greed for wanting region lock so we can communicate with our teammates actually hit our targets play with people of similar ping and not get tk'ed by the Chinese for our loot.

ESPECIALLY IN THE TPP (Third Person Perspective). And some of them are not even trying to hide. They just shoot you from across the map with a shotgun while looking at the ground SpeedHacks (I've seen someone using it in a van and the van was going insanely fast). In January ALONE +1.000.000 Players were banned from the gameBut even with all those problems it's still very fun just stressful sometimes.So if you have the money and friends just go for it. But if you don't have one of the two i wouldn't hardly recommend it. I hope I helped on your choice of whether buy it or not.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-29,0,0,205,False,Not Recommended,This is an awesome game with major potential but and this is a serious but there are major issues with the game at the moment. and yes it is in alpha but with the size and revenue it has grown at these issues should have been addressed long time ago.Pros Awesome game to jam with your friends. Teamwork is essential and all the random stuff you can do even while playing to win is awesome.Weapon animations are really well thought out and well executedVehicles each have their own quirks and ways to drive them.The entensity of making it to final circle and taking a win in awesome.Cons Hit reg (and this is a big flaw) is absolutely abysmal if you are not local to whichever regional servers you are connecting to and even then hit boxes are about as on target as a idiot with no arms at times _ Aiming for the head is like pulling a slot machine lever as to whether its going to hit or not. Edit Hit reg is even more of a joke now thanks to the 'fixes' weve had. Its now not just a case of hitboxes but whether your damn shot will even register!And you wil be introduced to a whole new form of cancer with the shotgun rng players. 2 shots will almost drop you with armour and without your as good as dead with minimal aim if any at all required unless again you have a bad ping then its less than useless.Rendering is also a serious issue if you are on the end of any scope and not behind a hill or tree anyone with low graphics will see you stick out brighter than a flashbang which makes hiding at a distance next to useless at all times.They introduced micro transactions for what after promising integrity? They had millions already and zero need to add them in especially to not fix major game issues with servers that break daily at the moment.These are the main serious gripes i currently have with the game that i hope will be fixed soon enough and hopefully without a doubt before its 'official release' because as i said its an awesome but extremely enfuriating where half a clip later from an AK and 2 shots from your opponent you're deadEdit Months on (including its auspicious 1.0 release) after my initial review and were sitting with new issues like more cheaters than the devs know what to do with 100 000 and a 'new' auto heal cheat surfaces afew days thereafter. GG but thats besides the fact that full blown serial killers are more stable than PUBG on a good day.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-29,0,0,86,False,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN""S BATTLEGROUNDS is a great battle royale game that not only revolutionized the genre but is a great deal of fun. There is a lot wrong with PUBG and a lot of good in PUBG. The gunplay is one of the best in not only the battle royale genre but in the FPS genre as well. The bullet drop and bullet velocity mechanics provide a sense of realistic shooting that should be important to this type of game. The variety of guns is also great to play with however due to the way the guns are balanced some guns are more favored than others so over many games you will see the same guns being played not because people want to use them but because if they don't then they won't have a chance to win. Besides this the looting meachanics are simple but work and vehicles are nice as the map is pretty large. The downsides of this game is hacking and hit registration. Hackers are a major problem when it comes to any multiplayer game but in PUBG it is a really big problem. Combine with this and the inconsistent hit reg makes the experience a bit frustrating at best and infuriating at worse. But every game has its ups and downs and it's all up to the consumer to decide wether or not these downsides outwiegh the goodsides. In my opinion PUBG is a great game with flaws it is still in development with updates coming out somewhat regularly. If you are able to deal with the frustrating parts of PUBG then you should buy this game. $30 for a game that you can play over and over with variety in engagements weaponry and opponents is a great deal and you should really pick it up if you can easpecially on sale.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Moreover after reporting these cheaters you don't have any feedback report of what became of that player. if they ckecked it or banned... or nothing..Another thing is that this game has one of the worst player base ever seen. Most of the games you start looting for about 15 mins finding yourself only to give what you got to the first cheater around the corner. Wall hacks autoaim and many others cheats are in full use in this game. Don't take me wrong the game is good but the lack of moderation has destroyed a good game. I found myself playing with guys that they found right using cheats just because they don't know how to play but want to have fun. So these players don't care if the destroy others' enjoyment of the game they just want to be there and have ""fun"" using cheats to get kills.

2018-01-02,0,0,284,False,Recommended,Lets be honest PUBG is great! I got the game a month after it was released on early access and was hooked at the start. I did leave every now and then because i felt like updates were slow and the only way i could hvae more fun was waiting for the next new weapon or game feature. Then 1.0 happened. Not to mention the extra hour delay we had to wair for the servers the day of but i noticed somthing different..... ing Asians. Im not a racist but this bothers me. Other games are region locked so that you can only play within your own servers making the ping super low. In PUBG you can switch to whichever region you wont with the click of your mouse. Hence all these squinty eyed s flooding our servers bringing there hackers and our women!

In terms of skills it is far more demanding than other games at least in my opinion and stays fresh because every game follows a certain pattern but individual interactions vary greatly.

Granted there are many issues players have encountered with the game (network lag bugs rubberbanding etc). Although Bluehole Studios is constantly waiting for feedback to fix these problems and they start investigating them asap. This usually takes them an hour to a day depending on how big of a problem it is. They also roll out monthly and weekly patches so the game feels better and better as these get implemented into the game. Overall Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is great and even though it followed the early access t it is quickly becoming a full game.

2017-05-31,0,0,613,True,Recommended,PUBG is a battle royal game. You start off in a lobby where you wait for around a minute mute the voice chat it's just racist remarks and ear Then you are put into a plane with 100 others where you can jump off at any moment. You will start to free fall and after a bit you can parachute. Now you are on the island looting and killing is now what you have to do. This game is a lot better than H1 a lot more polished and realistic but still fun. Driving is amazing and you can pull off crazy stunts. Only complaint is optimization it's got a lot better but for some of my friends with lower end PCs which can still run most games today at high ultra struggle a bit getting between 30 50 frames. This game is very CPU intensive! I recommend this game to anyone wanting to try out some Battle Royale. The development team is very active and with Player Unknown himself as the creator this game will go far!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-26,0,0,238,False,Not Recommended,This game has been in full release for a few months now and there are still some glaring issues. The first is that this game is very badly optimized even after all the time in beta and the few moths in release they have made little to no effort to fix many of the problems. I dont have a very powerful system by any means its sort of middle of the road but it still runs other games that are know for having perfomance issues like fallout 4 for example on high settings. other issues include but are not limited to lag server connection issues kill cams are just bad vehicles still dont work properly animations are clunky server tick rate is awful hackers are everywhere toxic community and so on. instead of trying to fix issues like these they decide to add weapon skins make a mobile version (which runs better overall somehow) added pay to open crates and a new map coming.the crate are a whole other issue. they put in a crate drop system similar to other games where you spend in game money that you earn to get a random item. not bad however... most of the time you waste the credits you earn to get a pay to open key crate. the keys cost $2.50 EACH and these crates just pile up in your inventory. then there is also a parachute skin but it costs ***$4.99$*** (on sale) with no extra content. just the chute.I still like the game though and for $30 you get what you pay for. but keep in mind all of the above.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The last game that gave me this kind of feeling was Counter Strike like 15 years ago! That feeling of sheer fun the feeling of playing a game cause I'm having a REAL good time and not just to progress learn skills perks gain more life better loots etc... When a game ends I'm getting into another just cause I'm pretty close to unlock that something but beceause I just WANT MORE of it! Just like in CS everyone starts with the same chances of winning it relies on a couple of very simple facts like timing reflexes and PUBG even add a little luck in it cause your initial scavenging can pretty much dictate how the game will go.The fact that every game is different is a blast to me. As I said I know that ""passion"" will fade a bit but I think that pretty much like CS it'll be a game I'll keep installed and come back to every now and then!

The game can only play a very limited amount of audio files at once sometimes you won't hear people moving around you. The graphics are mediocre but it needs the best hardware to run decently. When you land somewhere it takes a few seconds for the game to load the loot on the ground even if you play from SSD. Even the new features are full of bugs and usually it takes months to fix something.At this point I can't recommend this game. There are already a bunch of better Battle Royale games out there play something else.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-28,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Game is good but there is problems with the regions. Due to the high number of asian players the devs have refused to lock people within SEA to SEA servers (but claimed that it is somehow xenophobic for us to not want them on NA/EU servers)I don't think that region locks should apply to just SEA I want all regions to be locked to where they come from. If you are from north america you should be on north american servers. If 2 friends are from different regions let them choose what region to go and if your in a squad where the majority is SEA force SEA servers. This should be the standard for ALL regions due to ping issues in a game where this stuff matters greatly. I see NO reason why SEA should be playing on NA servers at all and if servers in one region such as SEA or Oceania are worse than NA servers please just improve the servers over there instead of having them play on NA servers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's impoved but when you have an alternative that runs smoothly it's hard not to switch over.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That being said i'd be pretty too. As far as microtransactions go Yes they exist ingame no you don't have to participate. There are 2 crates the ""locked"" one that requires the purchase of a key and one that you can open without making a purchase. Additionally a percentage of the purchases go to charity so it beats the hell out of CSGO or Dota or Tf2 microtransactions.Anyways ..Great last man standing style game with random loot that ensures that no two matches are alike.

I had basically set up the perfect trap but I'm still f*ckin scared like you wouldn't believe. I can hear the dude coming closer and closer and my heart just hurts man. So this dude walks down the stairs and I successfully kill him. So I'm calming myself down cause he is dead. I take his stuff and go out. BAMM Sniper outa nowhere hits me Almost causing me to have a heart attack. So i run to the nearest tree for cover but I need to move cause I'm not in the safe zone and the electric wall things are closing in. So i run back to the house sprint to the front door and try to make the run for the safe zone. Sniper still shooting me in my back Me experience a freakin heart attack Make that sh*t with the most itsy bitsy of health. No medkids no nothing At least I lost the sniper But In front of me are 26 men remaining in total war with each other. So I'm trying to sneak by in to this house begging for no enemies and that there are medkits. I find a medkit and I'm like super happy and completely oblivious to the fact that I'm in the middle of an airstrike i sneak out the house. So then death starts raining from above I am basically on life support cause my heart can't take that sh*t. So now I'm running through some epic Micheal bay sh*t to safety. Miraculously I survive that hell and Take cover behind a tree to recover. I slowly start moving towards the remaining 18 dudes. I find a bike and i am thinking hey that's pretty f*ckin neat. So I am now a total badass with my bike crossing through the field but then I hit a bump my bike did a triple backflip and I'm dead So 10 outa 10 best horror game I have ever played.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,298,True,Recommended,Ok ... so there is a wave on no recomending this game because of the recent add of microtransactions ... as if this will stop microtransactions in the game ... you are not obligated to buy anything to play the game like all other players. The game is fun even to people who dont particularly love PVP like me . This game has issues and bugs that probably will be fixed with time among them the most anoying is the performance that jumps all around and the server lag. Play this with friends if you want a more fun experience play it the way you want ... go tactical and silent or go yolo ... it will be fun either way. I recomend this game it is without any doubt the best BR so far. It seems a bit expensive ... but you have to consider the amount of time and fun you will get out of this ... i even offered it to a couple of friends. So go for it ... it is a must if you enjoy BR styled games .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-05,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Anyone who has read anything about this crate situation please know that all income from key sales go to charity and to fund a tournament. So not only are they helping out humanity which ya know most people don't they are using this as an opportunity to test crates before they officially release them after the games launch. Which is a win win in my opinion. There's no need to get so personally offended by a company who makes a game you like to the point of raising virtual pitchforks. Take a step back and gain some perspective. No one is out to get you or take advantage of you or force your money out of your wallet into the game developers pockets. They are simply trying to make full use of this oppurtunity for more exposure fullscale testing and donating to a good cause. I'm sure they're fully aware how much money this game has made and will make with the key and crate system. And yet they decided to share it with a charity. That plus the ongoing support for this game they've shown in every aspect from advertising to patches to acknowleding their mistakes and apologizing so openly has proven to me that this team is made up of decent human beings who actually care about the game they're making and the people who play it as well as the people unfortunate enough to not be able to play.Thank you for your time.PS Good luck with your never ending journey devs. We all want this game to succeed. Especially the ones so adamant against the crates otherwise why would they care so much?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-10,0,0,532,True,Recommended,All these Negative comments regarding microtransactions and paid crates. they are only available until the 27th of August 2017. these people are idiots you dont have to buy them they dont help you win the game they are purely cosmetic and there are two other unpaid crates you can open for free. besides the stuff inside isn't even that appealing and you will most likely want earth tone basic looking stuff anyway....

2017-08-05,0,0,1159,True,Recommended,Don't listen to all the nerds crying over micro transactions. They don't have any affect whatsoever on the gameplay and are purely cosmetic items. There also optional!! These are just angry people who are looking for something to complain about. The game is great. It has a bit of a steep learning curve so watch some you tubes or twitch before you jump in so you get the basic idea of it. The Devs have 0 tolerance for cheating which is a breath of fresh air. They update the game often and they are available to chat with on twitch twitter and all social meadia if you just look. Just keep in mind it's an early access game. It's going to have it's problems. But its a hell of a lot better than most AAA titles.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-05,0,0,753,True,Recommended,I crap on the naysayers and the complainers about the whole microtransaction system. It really isn't a system either. They are doing a charity even in the month of August during a competition and if you would like to purchase a $2.50 crate for clothes you can put on your character you can. This has no benefit whatsoever to gameplay. Your skill is your skill and that is how you win. I ask what else can you cry about...please get it all out and stop the madness. Evidently your playing the game cause you like it so why dont you just enjoy it and get over it. $30 for the game and that is all you pay if that is all you wanna pay. Now on to gameplay. This game is kickass! Has everything you want in a shooter and brings tons of realistic tactics and tons of suspense. I have not played a game like this that has put me into a nervous wreck since I first played Search and Destroy for COD Modern Warfare 4. Just plain and simple great gameplay. This game is always being worked on and patched. They listen to the community and release content every month. Heck its even in Early Access and it has a huge fan base and player base. That right there speaks volumes for what it is they are doing right.So please think twice about the negative reviews you are giving just because of the pay for a charity event clothing box you get for this month. It has nothing to do with overall gameplay or what this game is. To me that is a huge mistake to give it a bad review based on that merit alone.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,168,True,Recommended,The experiences i have had in this game are nothing short of incredible. i've havent been the best player but i still enjoy the game to the fullest. here are some of the moments in the game that i feel really show the quality of this game. while camping in a building i witnessed a teammate phase his jeep through the wall of a house resulting in the near immediate detonation of the vehicle. this sort of freedom is seldom seen in many games. once while storming a house full of enemies i gunned down an enemy. i entered the room which the enemy had fallen upon entering the room i was gunned down by my teammate. seconds later while my teammate was reviving me after his very efficent kill he was gunned down by another one of our teammates. that teammate then fled the house leaving us to bleed out. the ability to formulate effective strategies with your team is another high point of the game. another example of good teamplay is when i was downed behind cover. the enemies couldnt see me allowing my teammate to have an oppurtunity to revive me. however he selflessly focused on shooting the other team while i bled out two feet away from him. my fourth and final experience i believe really highlights the games very solid driving mechanics. while in a dacia with my squad we came across another team and their jeep. they promptly plunged their jeep into the side of our dacia. the jeep pushed us a great distance sideways. after exchanging shots between the two vehicles both detonated catapulting my body a signifanct distance across the map. the game also appropriately gave me credit from the deaths of my teammates. overall the game's focus on realistic combat and physics as well as it's focus on teamplay make the experience a true treasure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,223,False,Not Recommended,First of all... I love this game and it blows my mind how much people are playing it right now.. BUUUUUT At the same time it blows my mind that The game is unplayable for people with 8gb of memory card and i5 i myself have problems with FPS on lowest settings with i5 3340 ( not sure exactly if its correct procesor ) 8gb of memory space and GTX 1060 6gb !!! I can run any game without lags even witcher 3 on max settings on 60fps without lag or anything.. Now i know it s not yet finished or at least not in full version but im not completely sure if it s gonna help in any way that i will have stable 60fps with render at start of the game.. So DONT BUY THIS GAME if you dont have enough power in your pc. For me it ruined the game and i hate it.. I really do hate this game for how poorly it is optimized. And dont tell me that go and buy new pc with my PC i should be able to run games for next 3 4 years without problems at max high settings without problems but this unfinished piece of is not able to run properly even on lowest settings.. And i have seen games with much better graphics also not yet released WITHOUT THOSE PROBLEMS AND WITH GOOD OPTIMALIZATION!! Dont waste your time in this game go play something better this game doesnt deserve your attention at least for now only if you have beast pc then you can play it properly but even then physics in this game are also so .. Movement of your character is just crazy when you FLY instead of jump. Running feels like if you were hovering instead of being on the ground like if you were in plane AND IM NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT BLOODY MOTORBIKES!! Dont use motorbikes if you know what is best for you you will throw you pc out of window i promise that! Its like if you were on rollercoaster all the ing time. If you really wanna play this game consider if you can run it properly and also try free to play game fortnite maybe you will like it more and not waste 30 on unfinished game. Anyway GL HF i really hope that it will get patched soon so everyone can play it as they are supposed to play it.. We will see at 20th of december. And if it will be still unplayable I will give you an update on it.. SO WAIT TILL THEN IF YOU DONT ALREADY OWN THE GAME.. GL HFUPDATE 21.12.2017 So today is the day when it should be all just past and we will get a working full game with no bugs no fps drops and lots of fun.. Did we get it?? ING NOT!!! THE GAME ISNT WORKING AT ALL!!! First the servers were down for half a day THEN when we were able to play the ING GAME IT WAS BROKEN!! THE GAME IS BROKEN!!! ITS ING MESS FOR 30 !! Dont bother buying and playing this game.. So lets go step by step. As we all know the game wasnt optimized in early access.. Is it now? Nope its not still FPS drops are real my character was teleporting on map and after landing couldnt move for 10 sec.. Also enemys were teleporting so you are pretty much unable to kill them.. Next is gamma... WTF IS WITH THIS GAMMA!! I land in building and cant see . Cant see and hear enemy behind me DID I HEAR OR SEE HIM??? NOPE!!! THIS GAME! YOU BLUEHOLE I WANT MY MONEY BACK.. Next is this new map.. I dont know how much time and work went into this map but its as ... You have nowhere to hide it absolutely crushes the game concept to gide and camp.. Its possible only behind vehicle on hill or in building thats all no trees small amount of hills its just empty.. And at last.. SOUND.. Still unable to hear enemy which is just next to you. Still unable to see from where is enemy shooting at you and the new sounds oh god help this company its gonna fall as fast as it grew.. Give me back my moneyUpdate n3.

I love that it's already better than H1Z1 and it's only been out for 1 1/2 month. I'm glad i can easily teamate with my friends and play duo. I like how the squads are setup also Where if you play with a squad of two there will also be other players with a squad of two. This game honestly is breath taking and is worth every single penny. If i'd known about this game earlier i would've bought it immediatly! Please refund H1Z1 and get this game. The sad part is i refunded H1Z1 to buy in game clothing for this game. That shows how much i'd hate on H1Z1 and i'd rather play this game. I hope my review was helpful.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This review will disapear in a heartbeat under the oceanic stream of hate and love this game is generating. I'd be astounded if it even got one point of acknowledgement. It's skyrocketed to this mainstream status for a reason. Many people are annoyed with the game and give bad ratings but the majority of them got their moneys worth and may even still be playing long after writing their negative two cents. The game has it's low points in many of the fights and you'll die to very unfare situations. But despite this you will crave for another round. It's intense and addicting and few games have matched this consistant and distinct ""fear for your life"" experience the game gives you. 100 games later and you'll still feel that tension.

2017-09-30,0,0,95,True,Recommended,"A lot of people are bashing the game right now for its's policy with stream sniping. Plz consider that only those who get banned will ever write a review and the hundrets of thousands of players who just play will never write anything. Also I guess that a lot of the people who were banned ""for no reason"" in reality actually stream sniped but who would ever admit that right ? The whole things isn't nearly as important in the game as some people in the reviews make you think it is.But now to the game itself Well there is not a lot to say other than that it is a lot of fun. You can play it alone in a duo or in a squad and all of it is great. Performance is not optimal but if you lower the settings in will run well (i7 4770k and R9 290 here). Bugs do exist but they mostly are minor. For a eraly access game this is definitely better than avg. Gameplay can be really punishing and rewarding at the same time. Nothing is comparable to the feeling of being in the late game and getting those sweet kills.Guns feel great and time to kill is well balanced. Better gun balancing than csgo already imo because every gun is at least usable. Meanwhile csgo is able to release 2 stat changes for weapons and hundrets of skins/ year. One of the games I had the most fun with recently was definitely worth selling my Csgo skins for this.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But in the end this game delievers fun clenching moments from time to time. Other times you have China man over here shooting you across the map not ADS or anything. If thats not an issue for you have fun making friends with the garbage toxic community or try and learn a whole new f**king language becasue you have half othe the foreign countries on your server. Aside from that wonderful note you can also enjoy the many and I mean many unrealistic nonsense bugs. I've gotten stuck on countless things tarps in rocks (which then killed me from falling even though I was on a rock...) even from parachuting I've ""Landed"" then rubber banded off the building I was on to my death. They still haven't fixed the issue with rubber banding in the begining right after landing. I have issues grabbing ammo and weapons immdeiatly after dropping. Hand motion happens and so does noise but its not obtained in my inv. My main frustration is that amougnst this the Dev's have decieded to release a ""Patch"" which just place a MICROTRANSACTION system for CLOTHING. So no play to play but after you grind for you BP then blow it on a crate have fun finding out you need a key that costs $2.50USD or sell it on steam for whatever and then get something else...why not fix your game. You have a player count of how many?! Step up and take control Dominate this game. I'd love Dev updates like (Hate to say it don't wanna be that guy but..) Fortnite obviously a whole different game(ish) with a similar concept of BR it has frequent Dev info updates patches issues notification via socail media sources. You can feel the love they are giving out for their game. Could I get some of that with the $30.00USD I spent of this? I spent $30.00USD on the PvE and got EA for the BR for Fortnite Thats way more play time solo (co op) but doesn't have that realistic taste PUBG has and thats why you have me as a player. All together Thumbs Down No Unless on sale.Update PUBG has now been ""enhanced by NVIDA GFORCE EXPERIENCE"".What I've encountered The game is still full of aim assisted/macro/insta heal hackers and has not gotten any reigon lock what so ever. You play with players around the world who have spiking pings and on death cams you die by a missed shot off by 3 5 inches. Pro jk They added more clothes which are ugly and they still cant optmize their game gotta get that $$$.Update new map coming and they still haven't fixed anything in the game they made optimization worse and it is ing trash.

The biggest con to the game right now is all the Asians that flood the NA servers.. I've heard about a region lock (which IMO would make the game 100x better.

Lag dors wont open hard to get into vehicles and most of the time you'll be annoyed because stuff will get stuck. VERY VERY Expensive clothing is it okay to pay 1000$ for some clothes? I don't think so. You'll sometimes get stuck in random objects like chairs tables and such things.For conclusion This is a great game really and I would recommend you to buy it.I think this game has a really great potential and I think in this pace it will be the best selling game of 2017.Don't wait just buy it it's just 30$ and you will enjoy every second I don't promise you a fluent experience and ""perfect gameplay"" but remember it's an early access game and the devs need more time to solve some issues.Thanks for reading!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-14,0,0,1463,True,Recommended,Awesome game. What can I say I can't stop playing. Already have 418 hours logged at time of writing this review. I can't believe I spent that much time on this game but at the same time it doesnt feel like I did. Maybe that's attributed to how fun the game is or how each game starts off new as opposed to other game where you have to gain experience. The graphics of this game is just right where it isn't all animated or clunky stuffed with bunch of unnecessary visuals. The mechanics are pretty fluid in this game and is very easy to adapt to if you've play any other 1st person shooter on the PC. Updates/patches are coming in just about a weekly basis... adding minor tweaks improving game play. But if I just bought this early access game now I wouldnt have guessed that this game needed any tweaks. In summary I recommend getting this game. Frankly I cant think of a better way to spend $30 on endless fun. Strike that I recommend you having all your friends pick it up since this game is exponentially more fun when you have your own squad to create new shanningans in game and win chicken dinners.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-14,0,0,787,True,Recommended,"I like this game iam not much good at it but then its still fun to find new bits of the earth that i havent died on. Think i need to get an app done to show all my death locations... going to be one busy map. Good game to play with friends as long as they dont shout at you for getting them killed though this happens less offten now the bikes dont flip up and fly so high to be able to wave at aeroplane pilots when they fall over a blade of grass. I don't get into the anger at the micro transactions i havent made any purchases and more importantly we are not forced to. so if you dont like them ignore them it will make no difference to your game.OK streemers... well i have seen lots of recent reveiws about people getting banned as they ""streem sniped"" someone. I have a large player base that i play with accross europe and the US and have NEVER come accross this and i have played a few hours more than is healthy for me. I cant see how you can follow soneone on a streem and match that to the Playerunknowns battle you are in. Theres no player list for a start and no surver names to pick its random. I could understand it on Battlefied.... i only learned you could do this today... given it good try and its fun LOL never even occured to me. Sorry to the guy i constantly shot in the back today... even when he changed servers... twice. But i guess if your so stupid that you pubilish your location an actions for the whole world to see you are going to get shot in the bum.To anyone looking to get this game its fun with friends and a bit scary if your going solo. But do not let the negative comments about streemers put you I do not beleive this is happneing frequently and is very over represented on steam reviews at the moment. Developers i think you should ban people for hacking but this streem killing thing is a bit of a silly reason to ban anyone.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-14,0,0,392,True,Recommended,"As a college aged student I can say without a doubt that I have had my fair share of video game experience when it came to my childhood. I used to love playing first person shooters with the friends on console back in the day and after school became more important I started to drift from that unhealthy lifestyle. This platform and blockbuster title of a game has allowed for me to not only rekindle that passion I had for competitive FPS games but wedge some friendly competition in the mix as well. This game will either have you on the edge of your seat ready to jump at the sight of enemy movement or throwing it across the room as you get knocked out by someone from only God knows where. The dynamic enviroment of gunplay in this game is unlike any other I have played. Mixed with character movement such as leaning around obstacles or crawling through thick brush to avoid detection from enemies closeby can make for quite an entertaining exchange of bullets and frustrating callouts such as "" He's over there dude!"" (As if that helps). This game makes the player feel as though they are legend wether it is saving your teamate from death flying sky high on a dirtbike while sending it over a mountain to make it to the safe zone or even breaking a keyboard because you could have sworn you picked up that gun before the enemy did. Now as for my credibility I have many chicken dinners under my belt as well as some high kill games. Does this mean I still die when 80+ players are alive every now and then? Yes. Does this mean I get frustrated because of latency issues or common bugs? Yes. This game is still an Early Access Title. Don't expect a polished Triple AAA title that can handle any issue at a moments notice. The Devs are working very hard to not only please the player base but entertain them as well. Stop judging the game based off of popular Twitch Streamer's Opinions about viewers chasing them down ingame for an unfair advantage or whatever it may be. The question you should ask yourself is this ""Do I want to spend consecutive hours with friends yelling and working together to chase that ever so distant chicken dinner or do I want to go back to the same fps I have invested thousands of hours into with the same guns and boring game mechanics?"" Not ""man I don't know if I want this game but this Dr. Guy said it is horrible because he died ingame one time"" Or ""man this grim reaper guy seems really upset that a player honked his horn and drove around his area and got banned so I shouldn't get this game because I don't want to get banned."" That is absurd. Judge the game based on the amount of fun you could potentially have or the amount of nail biting heart racing swearing like a sailor victory lap around the computer chicken dinner win streak moments. Don't let controversy over disciplinary actions and judgments handed out by the games developers push you away. Those issues will work themselves out in due time. The fact that I keep coming back to this game and I find the same amount of entertainment as I did when I first started playing it back in may makes me think I will continue to love this game no matter what state it is in. (As long as I find a gun at the start of the round and my latency is fine.) The only bone to pick that I have is for melee weapon balance. If you like close quater melee action this might not be your game. Unless you wield a beloved pan you best run Forrest run because the other melee weapons don't quite fit in to the arsenal just yet. This game could be argued to be unbalanced yet very fair and walking that thin line is what makes it so fun. The player decides his or her fate not the weapon balance or gameplay mechanics. Over time players will learn tricks and tactics to give themselves the advantage no matter what is thrown at them and that is why I believe this game will truly make you a legend. Go try this game it costs half the amount of popular titles now a days and yet in this game you can open the crates for cosmetic items over time for free just based on points you earn from your performance ingame. Nothing feels more rewarding then winning a game and getting free clothes that make you look like a pimp from a different era.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Battle Royal is NOT YOUR GENRE YOU DONT OWN THAT GENRE and you dont claim the rights to that genre. Instead of filing some stupid lawsuits why not spend that money of yours into increasing your team so you can get the game optimized properly. Seriously the amount of bugs ON TOP OF THAT THE NEVER ENDING GAME HACKERS AIMBOTS ESPs And MAP PINGS. It's called competition for a reason if your niche goes somewhere else like go to EPIC because they listen more to the community rather than focusing on owning the traffic why not improve the game graphics performance security and all. BLUEHOLE BUTT HURT STUDIOS thats the tag you are carrying right now like some child crying because someone has took their candy away from them well guess what.. You made a fool out yourselves. $100 Million USD is not enough to improve the game? Blatant hacking blatant cheating paid lootboxes. You guys are getting GREEDIER every moment. Best to Boycott you guys there will be a better battle royal that is not greedy and selfish as you guys. So yeah to those who wants to buy this game don't I am removing this from my library and forget about it. And Boycott this game others who are playing here I suggest you guys stop playing this game and move to other battle royal games theres Ring Of Elysium Fortnite there's tons of them. This people this PUBG does not deserve your money nor your attention best to boycott this guys and end them they don't care about the community they only care about putting money in their pockets. You want a good example? Who the hell wants a paid loot box inside a game they already paid for themselves I understand if it's keys but seriously random loot boxes!!! On top of that almost all of the lootboxes requires a key they want you to spend more to this game but guess what the income from those are not used to improve the game like hell an example of that is blatant hacking and aimbots which by the way was resolve by EPIC games. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. This people would rather concntrate on filing a case againts their competitors rather than fixing the game itself they are only after MONEY this GREEDY CORPORATE BASTARDS DONT CARE ABOUT THE GAMING COMMUNITY BOYCOTT THEM.UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW THIS GAME WILL DIE FULL OF ING HACKERS HACKERS EVERY WHERE BE IT ON NA AS SEA OC EUROPE THERES TONS OF HACKERS AND THE INTERACTIVE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEY DON'T LISTEN TO COSTUMER FEEDBACK THIS GAME IS A TOTAL RIP OFF I WOULD'NT ADVISE BUYING THIS GAME SPENT 500+ HOURS ONLY TO GET PAWNED BY ING HACKERS ESP AIMBOT NOCLIP LIKE WTF STUDIOS!There's an 8 man squad event but guess what YOU CAN ONLY INVITE 4 IN YOUR SQUAD WTF IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE LIKE SERIOUSLY 8MAN SQUAD YET YOU ARE RESTRICTED TO 4 MAN SQUAD YOU CAN'T INVITE MORE THAN THAT.

For a game that has one map and one mode experiences can vary each round. Whenever you win one you'll feel like you truly accomplished something but it's heartbreaking to lose at the end as well.The game is fun and I think you'd enjoy it as long as you're aware that it still needs work and isn't fully optimized which means it may not run smooth. It's getting better after each patch so they're definitely going in the right direction.Yes microtransactions are in the game. It's for one loot box and cosmetic only.

It's not without its issues but it's a foundation for an excellent game. The biggest issues in my opinion right now are network related.

Servers are OVERLOADED with cheaters therefore there is also the problem with ping ! Veichles need to be reworked as soon as possible ! The game is not smooth enough you need double SLI 1080 Ti for this thing to work on more than 50fps on medium.(its a meme ofc).Now lets talk about positive sides!

PUBG has cases that give you almost a 100% chance on getting a grey shirt. Almost everything in PUBG that has a greater rarity then green is worth upwards of $300.

2018-02-19,0,0,72,False,Recommended,Very fun for those who enjoy co op slow to fast pace tactical shooters. Its multiplayer maps are very large making egagements fun and challenging at the same time. While the game has a good core basis the game falls flat with its buggy lobbies. These range from the game randomly shuttting down to just getting kicked from lobbies for no reason. The game also has a very obvious hacking problem. This becomes clear after only about an hour of playtime. While these are major problems that the developers should adress I can not fault the core gameplay itself for these issues. It is a fun to play game and I would certainly recommend to players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,150,True,Recommended,Pubg is by far the best survival game. U can solo duo and squads of 4 team players. You start off by parachuting into the island and gathering equipment. Eliminating any enemies that you counter. Trying to reach the spot when your the last survival player on the island. You get rewarded with alot of Battle Points. Battle Points The battle points that you gain from a game depends on what your playing. If your in a solo game then your recieving more points than you would in duo and squad games. Squads If your teaming with friends or online friends into a Q for pubg. Team communications is key. As I reviewed with R6S and CS GO. Team communication and making sure you get the callouts is the most important thing ever. If you have a teamate getting shot at and there not giving the call out then your not able to assist him. Overall this is a wonderful game to get if your into survival games. Make sure you also have friends that will or already have this game. As it will get boring playing by yourself after a while.I do recommend people to get this game. D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The servers are also extremely laggy (unplayable during peak hours) given the size of the playerbase you'd think they would make something like this a priority but it isn't. If you're ok with spending more time in the lobby trying to get a stable game then this is pretty much the game for you!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-27,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,While a great deal of players are having fun with this game tye fact of the matter is that it has some pretty major lingering issues. The server tick (the rate at which the game world is updated for players) is abysmally low. This is a core issue that will affect litterally everything you try to do in the game. Other issues with object hitboxes and collision have been becoming apparent as well. It's not unheard of to be able to shoot through a fence one way but not the other. Or to be able to crouch jump through some walls of houses.If you're one of the twelve people on Earth that haven't purchased this game yet just wait. Let the rest of us ride this one out for you until these issues get sorted out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-25,0,0,108,True,Not Recommended,"*Overview*In my honest opinion the game's been going downhill.The streamers have been overhyping it to death ignoring the real problems with the game.The gunplay is pretty great but you'll get the same gunplay experience from the Arma series.The community has major problems including hackers.*More Detail*The real problems with the game are 1. The fact that the game feels extremely repititive when playing solo. This is negated somewhat when playing with friends as you have people to mess with but playing by yourself in any of the modes shows the other flaws. 2. The game rewards camping. The circle while being a good idea to keep players enclosed makes 3 gameplay types possible/relevant. They are either dying super early in a large city going to some place to run all game or just camping for as long as possible. In the community aspect the developers and community staff are more focused on skins new weapons that do nothing to change the game and hosting ridiculous amounts of ""professional tournaments"" for a game that is casual for many reasons including the fact that practicing a weapon WILL get you killed. Plus the crybaby streamers can get ANYBODY banned by telling devs that a person who killed them in a game is ""stream sniping."" Onto a more positive note the gunplay is great. The bullet drop feels accurate most of the guns handle well but things like aimduels to test your skills with the gunplay are virtually non existent. Last note about dev team they are quite self righteous they tried to attack Epic Games for making a Battle Royale game.*Glitches*The glitches in this game are either godawful or downright hilarious. You can either get extreme lag and such or you could get a glitch where all of the buildings become invisible and allow you to move through them (even with vehicles!). They can REALLY make the game fun if they happen or destroy the game.*Conclusion*The game has some fun moments but the community and corporation (yes PUBG corp. is a thing somehow) are the main destroyers of the game's fun. Also get this game only if you are going to play with friends. Playing without them makes the game far less enjoyable.If you've made it this far congratulations! You have made it through my incessant ramblings that took way too long to express through text. Thank you for reading.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-16,0,0,326,True,Recommended,"OVER 1.5 million playersI'll preface this review by saying Battlegrounds by no means complete not well optimized in it's current state. However that does not mean it is unenjoyable or unplayable. Despite my short amount of time in game I can confidently say is much better than it's counterpart H1Z1 King of the Kill for a number of reasons 1. Its weapon variety is much healthier and (somewhat) balanced in customability strengths and weaknesses (and will evidently grow in number).2. Some central mechanics of the game are much more realistic and less buggy in comparison to its counterpart (you can't jump out of cars that are flying at the speed of light and live weapons actually hit where you aim at least along the vertical axis bullet drop is a thing!). 3. There are tons of servers already and they are more often than not at least playable (I've only had one account of having to leave the game due to horrendous lag).4. Graphically it's a beautiful game at its highest settings although it is nearly impossible to play with said settings effectively due to poor optimization and thus FPS issues/inconsistencies.5. The Steam Market already includes the game's in game skins and items available to characters another thing worth noting here is that it's relatively easy to earn ""Reward Points"" from simply playing the game. With this you can gradually purchase crates which will randomly drop said skins.6. The game actually feels fun and fair to play. There are a minute number of instances that feel like I was killed due to poor game design or exploitations.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I honestly hate the devs for STILL after several months not introducing the map choice option. ing freaks seriously.The only reason I can think of for not introducing such a feature is that most people will then choose only one of the 2 maps (guess which one) and there won't be enough people on the second... SO ING WHAT the map is a failure imo just live with it and go on make another map or just delete the desert if you're so afraid. Anyway it's just my own speculations. The fact is that every time it throws me in desert I log out and retry. And retry. And retry (my record is 6 retries). Just hate this developing team really.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-17,0,0,84,True,Recommended,This is by far one of the most exciting battle royale games I've ever played! Go in solo group up as a double team or simply as an entire squad. Though the game is still in early access its very much in stable condition. No FPS drops no connection drops though the hitboxing/latency is a bit sketchy as I can sometimes be hit from around a corner before I physically see the character move around the corner. This is a rare occurrence though. A lot of adrenaline moments when trying to survive as a group or even alone. Much better then H1Z1 or DayZ as those games always appeared to be a battle royale type of game to me even though they are zombie survivals. Getting started in the game is easy. No spending hours looking for loot no spending hours trying to group up with your friends. No zombies to get in your way. Also did I mention the map is FREAKIN HUGE!? For 100 players per match the map size is perfect. I do hope to see more weapons in the future as it appears to only have a little over a dozen weapons rifles smgs Assault Rifles shotguns and pistols. Though the selection is great nonetheless. I am glad they have minimized sniper rifles (One bolt action rifle) in the game at least for now as with as many open fields this map has It would suck being taken out without the ability to return fire. I look forward to seeing this game develop. For an early access title its very addicting especially with surviving with a group of friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is a game where you can do what you want. when you want. If you wanna honk a horn every second and die 1 minute later go for it. Shouldnt get banned for that. Gameplay to me is just amazing i bought this game a week ago and havnt touched a single other game since. It's really addicting it really is. Maybe chinese players can lighten up and grow a pair and have some fun? but again its an amazingly fun game.

2017-08-10,0,0,154,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I like this game. I really do. But they can burn for being greedy and adding loot crates for cash. Companies these days are all cash grabs after the initial price you pay for the game....and also not just that but they even said themselves they wouldnt add crates until at LEAST the launch of the game. Reasons they added it this early? High player base more potential money to be made while it lasts...I think this game will lose a lot of players soon if they dont stop with this nonsense. They have time to add loot crates but not worry about the more important issues...FIX THE DAMN BUGS FIRST BEFORE YOU START CHARGING FOR CRATES!!! Greedy greedy scums. They are giving themselves a bad name.I love how the reviews for this game were about 90% positive when I last looked. Now it's at a mixed with a meer 68% and I'm sure that will drop even more...Like i said they are ruining their own game and forcing bad feedback from the public.Good job developers way to up something unique that you had.That's all I have to say.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-15,0,0,11,True,Recommended,As other users have mentioned possibly the best Battle Royale (and possibly best looking) game in it's genre.My only complaint is that view distance is shocking to the point that grass and shrubs don't matter if you're prone within them as anything after a couple hundred metres completely disappears leaving the landscape bare. This wouldn't be an issue if half the map didn't contain frequent cover available in grass/bushes/shrubs &amp wheat but it is... So until either the devs decide to lower all grass to ankle length or make the grass static/lower quality and increase the current view distance as a standard the rule of thumb is if you get a scope and a half decent weapon your life expectancy will triple.Other then that I still think the games pretty awesome and would recommend it but just be prepared for some salty times ahead and remember it's still in early access stages ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-05,0,0,204,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a fantastic game highly competitive without inducing extreme toxicity due to PvP elements. Matches are fast paced and although the rewards are extremely limited it still feels gratifying to take a shot to the backside only to have it deflected by a frying pan turning around and shooting that attacker down with a pistol.Now for the downside. Customization is more limited than I'd prefer (but that's personal preference and I like making myself bearded and ugly) and the most important part the hackers/botters. Unfortunately there's a hacker/aimbotter in every 8 or so games who are easily noticeable after they take down your squad with headshot after headshot. It's unfortunate since it takes from the enjoyability of the game but all the same the game is still fun when you get people who don't cheat.I can only assume the hackers are doing this for the Battlepoints in order to earn items to sell for actual cash on the marketplace. The moment the Bluehole team get this hacking situation sorted out the better it'll be for everyone. Or at least remove the monetary system making it unprofitable for hackers.If you're a hacker/botter and you're reading this thanks for the memories and the recordings.If you're a good honest and dependable player reading this thank you for being a top bloke/sheila.

The game can be pretty aggrivating at times and takes a while to get used to certain mechanics there are some crashing issues not all of which I would blame on Bluehole knowing that UE4 can be pretty wonky at times for no reason.At times the game can feel more like a lottery drawing due to the random loot distribution (One house can only spawn a crowbar vs the house nextdoor that spawned a M4A1 and a SCAR with full attachments nearby) but that's not really a huge issue.However with the right group of friends who laugh at you for not being able to hit air it's an enjoyable game with relatively few issues mostly reliant on sound luck and clicky skill.I recommend it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They are all similar (genre). This seems to be the ""most polished"" of the set but YMMV. For me personally I'm sure it would be a blast if you had friends to play with. As a solo player it basically breaks down to this first 1 2 minutes in lobby. Jump out of a plane. Either find a weapon or die within first couple minutes. Next 10 15 minutes you're looting/running...possibly driving if you get lucky and find a ride. Match is now down to 20 people. Run/hide for the next few minutes. Get to last couple zones 10 15 ppl remaining. Be sneaky (or think you are being sneaky) get a kill. Get killed. Rinse and repeat. Best game I've had was 5 kills and down to 11 people. So basically if you enjoy the genre already definitely buy the game. If you have several friends who play the game and want you to play buy it. I'd love to do squad or duos but no friends solo.

2017-12-21,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,"So...it's finally released and turns out to still be a big dissapointment (not surprising tbh). Even after it's early access sky highs and rock bottom lows this game STILL hasn't keeled over yet. There are so many things wrong with it I'm not even happy to have this stain in my library. The terrible optimisation perfectly timed desync and just purely bad design.If you don't know what PUBG is that is probably for the best because it is pretty much H1Z1 KotK just slightly improved and even that sounds like I'm giving them too much credit than what they deserve.I understand that they're trying to go for that 'realistic' shooter design like Arma 3 (which was originally a mod for) but as far as I'm concerned it just doesn't work with everything wrong with it. It has created more issues than it does trying to fix but since it's PUBG it is technically ""fixed"".Optimisation. The key thing that should happen in any game to reduce stress on your PC. It took them SO long to actually ""fix"" that issue and even still it is dodgy. It's like putting duct tape on a broken finger and saying everything will be fine now. Just for a side note I'm not certain for other players if it is still just as bad as before but for me personally I can see the difference from months ago to now. The biggest joke I thought I'd never see in my life was the fact that they were developing a 2nd map when the 1st map is still in a horrible shamble. Okay so the optimisation is bad but what about the desync?Well about the desync.........Sorry I was reconnecting. Don't know if that was the servers or just my terrible Aussie internet. For the poor unfortunate souls that have played this like me the desync is still kicking me from behind. Ever dropped down from a building from a height that doesn't damage you but then suddenly get launched into the ground and then take damage? That's pretty much half of my play time if not from terrible hitboxes. As far as I'm concerned the desync issue won't be going away anytime soon unfourtunately.If you're a person about a good community that is supportive to new players and all about fun. This is definitely not the place for you. Best way to describe it is that is the literal embodiment of the Twitch chat of someone playing this game. Just stale memes and ""funny"" racist remarks. I only find it funny because of how much of a cluster it is and not what's being shouted out like I'm at a violent riot. It's just toxic and annoying to the point that all of the waste out in the ocean is cleaner than this.So what's my take on PUBG? It's that has been polished. Nothing much more than that. You're better off trying to pull off a fidgit spinner meme or putting up your Christmas decorations than playing this letalone buy it. It really is not worth the time and hassle to try to enjoy it. If I were to give you money and tell you to go buy yourself something nice I'd mean it because this game sure as hell ain't nice.I was originally going to put up my review when the mass negative reviews happened but I couldn't be bothered to put up then until the full release of PUBG which was the final straw.Those are my final thoughts about PUBG that have been delayed for months.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I played 3 games in their server to test this and indeed... in all those games I was killed by cheaters and 10 minutes in there was barely anyone left alive.So the problem is not the Chinese people.

2017-06-22,0,0,445,True,Recommended,I Definitely recommend this game to everyone Let me preface this entire review with the fact that this is an early access game therefore anything that is said is subject to change as of 9.4.17With that said Let's get started with the actual game review. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle royale 100 players open world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo duo and squad (3 4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward you hop off a plane loot weapons armors and equipments from buildings and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath. The Goods 1. This game is an adrenaline dump. You will get into some really heated firefights and when you actually win my god you will just scream. 2 This game is very fun with friends or without (Although I'd prefer playing with a couple friends that I know well. 3. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics.4. Highly Demanding of teamwork. You aren't Robocop able to kill 4 people by yourself (You could but it's very difficult to do so unless you're C9's Shroud). Instead it heavily relies on teamwork and being able to focus down a target. 5. You can play this game in a Third Person/ First Person hybrid mode. Or straight up First person only mode. 6. Performance issues are being resolved with a constantly updated game. Very noticeable that the devs are taking extra time into making sure this game can run well. 7. There are multiple weapons to find Various Vehicles and the gameplay is challenging but also rewarding The Okay 1. The community can be toxic at times. Easily fixed with a simple ctrl+y command though. 2. The Lag is noticeable but it's not so bad to the point where you're going to be teleporting everywhere 24/7. The servers could use some adjusting.3. The game can be repetitive. At the end of the game it's the same thing. You get a gun hope to god someone doesn't have a better one and hide till top 10. 4. AFKers can have a negative connotation towards this game but that gives even more incentive to play your best to get better rewards. (Plus you can always kill the AFK to get even more money) The bad 1. The game is still very highly demanding of your PC. I have a couple friends that have a GTX 1060 but textures still take a while to load for them only for them to realize that they need more RAM. I have a semi old GPU (R9 390X) but I still load faster than them because I have 16 gigs while my friends have 8. The specs they have listed here will barely give you 15 20FPS I'd recommend getting a more updated GPU and more RAM.2. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.3. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive4. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead the game throws me back 3 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes these happen randomly.5. The initial drop can be a bit annoying at times The fact is that you THINK you land in a certain spot but you can get stuck on a ing corner of a building then when you finally drop you get thrown across the map.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Aim bots and Wall hacks make the game unplayable. why waste 30 minutes in a match only to die to a cheater? theres no point to playing the game anymore.

I will say this and say it 100% confidently! so here it goes.. PUBG like COD is nurfing (""NURFING"") players that are not big time streamers making them money. I am a verteran gamer and programmer by trade. I have 100s of incidents that make me sure of it and i could go on and on but i will say this i am putting together a monstrous rant that i pray goes viral on this matter as you are not in control of you gameplay and this causes people to buy.. ""BUY"" routers and bigger cables heavier HDMIs.. faster internet speeds!! get were im coming from. So i know this isnt going to sound good to the not so open minded few but just keep an eye out for how your player slows down suddenly after that 2 chiken dinner run you just had and now (your nurfed) you shoot through (yeah right through!!) your enemy or you die 3 xs faster in the blue zone as you did before.. and you are thinking everyone is a cheater.. well jokes on us guys. BLUEHOLE like call of duty is cheating you by programming code to you progress. this makes us dedicated gamers like me and you weaker less silled and well like a newb!! this way its a win win for them. you see now the new guy that just bought the game wont be so apt to go say to all his buddies the game is junk.

2017-05-13,0,0,265,True,Recommended,The sad tale of the struggle between man woman and time. All told brilliantly through metaphorical symbolism within less than 30 minutes.The moment you jump from the plane symbolizes a new birth (or reincarnation if you believe that dumb stuff). You and 99 others (some you may call friends) arrive in this new world with the same instinct kill and take. This has plagued humankind throughout history as the strong carry out their will over the meek and useless. The beginning was no different as roaming tribes sought others to 'take' if they had the strength or courage to.As time progresses battles turn from fist and pistols to rifles and SMGs. Armor and helmets are slapped on as war for the White Circle begins. Many die in the process some never make it as the Blue Death claims them. What the circles mean I do not know for they could be hunger and fear... or something worse.In the end the last few fight over one simple thing a simple measly chicken dinner. We imagine humanity dying out in a blaze of glory but what if this is the truth of our future? Killing hundreds around you just for food to survive in a sad harsh world as you devour your meal alone (or with 3 friends).... but you gotta admit it's a damn good chicken dinner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Despite what the dev team claims this is should not be titled a ""fully released"" version of the game. I've put a little over 63 hours into Pubg and during those hours at least or nearly half of my playtime has been restarting the game/ my computer after it crashes. Pubg has a rediculous amount of bugs issues and crashes for a title that claims to be out of alpha/beta. Pubg crashes way to frequently to the point where it feels like a chore to play and reopen the game. Plus you need a pretty high end computer to run this game smoothly I have the GTX 970 and I have trouble running this game at a smooth framerate sadly I've put too many hours to request a refund for this game Since I cant entirely play the game due to a legitiment lack of optimization this game has it's been sitting in my library for some time now.

I find it rediculous that 8 out of 10 games on the North American server I am paired with people who don't speak english. I imagine this is because their own location servers are over run? Whatever it is not my concern what is my concern is that I am not able to enjoy the gaming experince as I can't work with my team as the game intends.I am honestly surprised a solution for this hasn't already been released. I can only imagine that either what is left of your english speaking staff don't play the game anymore or you just dont care.Haven7952Perhaps this would be better received in a bluehole language (let's go google translate...)亲爱的Bluehole / PUBG 我有一个建议 根据语言选择匹配玩家 我发现在北美服务器的十场比赛中 有八场比赛是和我不搭配英语的人搭配的 我想这是因为他们自己的位置服务器已经过度运行了 无论如何 这不是我所关心的 我担心的是我无法享受博彩体验 因为我不能像游戏那样与我的团队合作 我真的很惊讶 这个解决方案尚未公布 我只能想象 你说英语的工作人员什么都不再玩游戏 或者你不在乎 or친애하는 Bluehole / PUBG 나는 제안을했다. 언어 선택에 따라 플레이어를 매치시킵니다.북미 서버에서 10 게임 중 8 게임 영어를 사용하지 않는 사람들과 쌍을 이룬다는 것은 어리석은 짓입니다. 자신의 위치 서버가 끝났기 때문에 이것이라고 상상합니까? 어쨌든 그건 내 관심사가 아니다. 내 관심사는 내가 게임 의도대로 내 팀과 일할 수 없기 때문에 나는 게임 경험을 즐길 수 없다는 것이다.나는 솔직히 이것에 대한 해결책이 이미 공개되지 않은 것에 놀랐다. 나는 영어로 말하는 직원 중 남은 것이 게임을 더 이상 사용하지 않거나 신경 쓰지 않는다고 상상할 수 있습니다.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-06,0,0,84,True,Recommended,Brilliant Battle Royale game PUBG stands above the other games/mods due to it having more realism than other alternatives (h1z1 for example). The realism allows for different ways to play in simple terms being aggressive or passive or stealthy. Although you can do this in other games I feel asif playing passive is more effective in PUBG. These options make the game more replayable and make you want to carry on playing. Another thing which is great is the ability to choose where you drop wether thats choosing to drop into a large village/town to get more loot but also have more people to fight or the choice to drop out of the way to get smaller amounts of loot at first but having less risk due to not as many people around you.Overall PUBG is a brilliant battle royal game which gives alot of replayability whether that is with a friend a squad or solo.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-04,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,The game used to be good and that's because it was early access and it was a new game. We didn't expect the game to be polished or to have a lot of content. The problem is that the game hasn't changed too much. It is a lot better optimized and there are a lot of new guns but it still feels the same. Nothing is changing the game is not being developed as much as it should be. The paid lootcrates in an already expensive game is also proving the devs just want to earn money without any regard to the players. If you want to play a battle royale game just play fortnite. At least those devs care about the game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-15,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,I love pubg but it has 3 major of problems that I'm probably no the only one who has experienced these. For one there is no indicator for damage I was getting shot from behind but I thought they were in front of me but I couldn't figure out that cause it doesn't tell you were you are getting shot from. And next the recoil is so annoying I hade a gun with a vertical foregrip but its recoil was worse than before and it got me killed. And finally the aim with scopes is weird when I watch my death cams the guy who killed me missed every shot except the final one but I took damage when they missed. fix these problems and I will recommend the game because besides that its fine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-28,0,0,28,False,Recommended,This is the new version of H1Z1. It's a lighthearted game with friends but if you want to get better you have to take it a little more serious. It's not at all like other battle royales where you're constantly diving in and out of matches almost mindlessly with little reward for achieving #1 9. This game actually challenges you to do better or at least it did when you could sell and trade crates with others. The asking price is also a lot higher than other games in the same genre considering most are free (Fortnite Radical Heights H1Z1) but what you get is a consistent game that's starting to shine with the polish Bluehole (B***hole?) is applying. Aside from the joke it's not a turd although you can polish one... (the more you know!) Oh yeah there are problems with hackers like all online games but they claim to be working on it. Then again the developer doesn't seem to listen to the community still no name changes for those unfortunate enough to choose a bad name or have a friend choose it for them... neither any fixes for old issues but there is an ever increasing amount of greed via in game purchases at least we get a free emote wheel right?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-12,0,0,364,False,Recommended,Update as of the end of May 2018 It's been a little over a year of owning this game for me and so much has changed in that time. I've read the negative reviews of people comlpaining about there still being hackers crippling lag and broken game mechanics. I'm running an asus laptop with a 950M mobile card a 4th gen i7 and a 256GB SSD. It's a pretty softcore gaming setup to say the least but nonetheless I havent dealt with broken game mechanics(barring your occasional vehicle glitched into the ground but this is pretty rare) performance issues or bad lag in the past several months of playing this game. I haven't encountered a hacker in several months either. Granted there's always things to improve *cough* hard region lock *cough* but for those complaining about this game being the biggest gaming atrocity since DayZ (See first review) I simply don't see it. Perhaps Epic is paying Fortnite players to slander PUBG or perhaps I'm the luckiest person in the world in regards to lag and bugs both of which I doubt I simply don't understand the mob of negative reviews of this game. Theres always more to be done and there will never be 0 Hackers in this game or any game but to those seeing the bad side of this game rest assured it's far from the league of legends level cancer that everyone is whining about...May 2017 Review It's like playing Dayz except there's no zombies the game runs a bit better and you don't have to loot for 3 hours...Really though PUBG is a fun early access hunger games style shooter where players para drop into a large island map that gradually closes in as players die in a huge fight to the death. As an alpha it has a lot of things to be fixed and much more content necessary to make it a complete game. Developers so far have been very active and have communicated well with the community. They've taken good steps in anti cheat mechanics and in the 3 weeks or so I've had the game I've encountered only one cheater even before the anti cheat update. As a disgruntled former DayZ standalone player I love this game and the direction the devs are taking it. It is definitely worth the $30 asking price so I'd reccomend picking it up before the price goes up later in development!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A perfect multiplayer game bug free and with new updates every now and then never seen such anti cheat before. Game takes you to the place where you're left with your buddies and the greatest loot ever a lot of different guns vehicles and what not! I remember when this still was early access 10 months ago with so many bugs and almost unplayable due to number of cheaters around. This is the best game I've played so far and o boy I am into gaming for more than 10 years. I almost forgot how great the ranking system is you'll get a perfect sense of your skill upon playing a while. Thank you Player Unknown!Now open your eyes and face the reality. This game is nothing more than bugs in fact there are more bugs ingame than in your bathroom or basement. You are left to fight your own battle with numerus cheaters where noone cares about them now and then you'll be given another update but that only happens on test server and never gets transfered to live. Game is in ""early access"" phase for a year already and will never get out of it feels like it's stuck there. Ranking system does not exist.

2018-04-08,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,"Let me preface this by saying I loved PUBG. I think the game has an extremely fun gameplay loop and in the 7 months I've owned this game I've kept up a love hate relationship. The hatred I'll explain below.The hatred began when I would constantly run into bugs long loading times and poor optimization. For a game that was in early access I forgave it seeing as how given the status it always had room to improve. Then the full release came I booted up the game despite the imense server problems on launch day and managed to get a game in. I was extremely unimpressed. The game did little to fix its optimization problems and somehow at least on my end ed up the loading even moreso. Loading times were long in the early access sure but I always got in and subsequent games I joined loaded faster and faster as the game retained the memory. Which makes sense. However after the full release my game would be stuck on the load screen forcing me to restart the game over and over and over again every day I played it. I could never load into my first game I'd always have to restart after beginning a round. It got to the point that I just said it and gave PUBG a break.Now in between all this and even before the recent controversy I've had a real in' problem with Bluehole and the then branded PUBG Corp. The developers of this game do a pretty damn job if I've ever seen one. I get it when a game explodes especially a multiplayer one like this it can be hard to role out fixes new servers and such it's understandable. But there are three main reasons I hate them.1. Releasing a game from Early Access that clearly needed fixing still. To say this game was ready when it was released was a really REALLY stupid move and whoever authorized it should be ashamed. A game that is ""fully released"" doesn't mean it's mostly done but has a lot of things to fix. That's still called a BETA and should be in Steam's EARLY ACCESS. 2. The other major reason for my hatred towards these devs has been in regards to how they have been handling the status of their game and the Battle Royale genre. Did PUBG popularize the Battle Royale genre? You bet your sweet they did and they did it damn well. Does PUBG's devs OWN the genre? Hell no and the reason that they are so adamant in believing that they do is what absolutely disgusts me. You should not and cannot ever lay claim to game mechanics that's just insane. Going so far as to consider legal action against some games that have not only copied their formula but created a game that have garnered larger communities because of the additional improvements they made is just crazy. 3. Microtransactions and pricing. 30 bucks for a multiplayer indie game is pretty good price to say the least. However the flip flop nature of this game's stance on microtransactions is as crazy as their claim to the battle royale throne. When the game launched in Early Access they claimed there would never be microtransactions. Summer rolls around and BOOM keys and crates. The community groaned but dealt with it anyway. It was a limited time thing that probably wouldn't happen again right? Right? Nope. Then they continued with the keys and crates system for the game's better skins while making any cosmetic you can earn through in game currency a random chance that's percentage rate is... very very sketchy to say the least. I've opened at least 20 or 30 crates and never NEVER have I ever once gotten anything above a grey level item. Whether that's just bad luck or that's just the game's way of enticing me to buy keys it's either way. With the recent inclusion of emotes I have to wonder how long it'll be before they cave under their competitor's pressure and begin to experiment with other microtransactions.TLDR The game's had a development process that puts indie games early access games and Battle Royale in a bad light. The game is fun however the developers have had such a attitude that has resulted in disgusting business moves.Because of their recent lawsuits against clones with outrageous claims I for now cannot support this game or its developer anymore. Uninstalled moved onto Fortnite. Hopefully the dev will get their egos in check and work on improving the game rather than just copying the copycats.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game is laggy The guns recoil feels amazing compared to another battle royale game such as LMS Map is pretty good imo For me this game is alot more fun to play with friends but if you are looking for some adernaline rush solo is pretty decent A LOT CAMPERS which is sometimes annoying but it is how it is. Sometimes in heavy load server can lag pretty horriblyI'd rate this game 7.5/10 gameplay itself is really great but the optimazation is far from great you really need some kickin pc to play this game smoothly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-13,0,0,307,False,Not Recommended,A'ight so good gameplay. I'm about 60 hours in and it's a lot of fun. My problem is that the box drops are rigged If I'm counting correctly I've had 12 total crates since I started playing which was shortly before the Desperado crate was introduced. So I probably got 4 or 5 of my crates before Desperados could be gotten. Desperados require keys which have to be bought with real money to be opened. Since the Desperado crate was introduced I've got a total of 7 or 8 crates and 5 of them have been the Desperados. 5. 5 out of 7 or 8. That's a 62% or 71% Desperado crate drop rate. This game cost $30 dollars to begin with. After sixty hours of gameplay if I wanted to unlock all of the Desperado crates I've earned at $2.50/key it would run me $12.50 to unlock 5 cosmetics. COSMETICS. If I actually spent the money to unlock those crates I'd be only 1 Desperado crate away from spending half again what I paid for the game for stuff that wouldn't even benefit me in game. And cosmetics are the only things you can modify in the game. And it's possibly I could buy a key for a Desperado crate unlock the crate and get a duplicate item. Which would do absolutely nothing for me.Here's my beef if you're going to charge me this much for stuff that doesn't even affect gameplay just start the game at a higher price. It's not like these crates are DLC or some sort of expansion packs. Fix the drop rates or drop the cost to something reasonable like $0.50 or something like that. C'mon. This is just straight exploitation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-05,0,0,752,True,Recommended,Simply groundbreaking. I cannot stress enough how fun this game is. This game can be anything you want it to be. Want to rambo into the fight solo? Drop into a city pick up the first weapon you find and go kill someone! Want to play stealthy biding your time looking for the right moments to strike? Drop into a remote location on the edge of the map get geared up move from cover to cover and be the last man standing! Want a more mil sim feel? Get a couple buddies or just auto match in squads gear up get a Jeep and role play a little!The devs are great and super responsive and have stated that they expect the game to release fully within 6 months so no infinite early access. Monthly major patches. Recent stability upgrades. Relatively balanced content. Just so well done all around. 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,439,False,Not Recommended,I do not recommend this game to friends and am changing my review after my increasing frustration with hackers in this game. There is still an excess of hackers playing on the servers and I did not realize this until I used the replay feature for the first time to look over games I thought contained suspicious players. I have on average played with a player using aiming cheats at least 1/4 of my games in these past few weeks. I can not believe that this is still a problem with PUBG after the initial surge of hackers months ago as it undermines the competitive nature of the game and one would think with the massive amount of money Bluehole makes that they would be able to create software that isn't so susceptible to cheaters. Wrong instead you watch killcams of players snap aiming onto your head and you see 10 20 players left alive when the match still contain 50 players. Absolutely dissapointed with the inability for this company to right these throwaway account hackers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-07,0,0,925,False,Not Recommended,"I want to like this game I've tried to like it yet I can't recommend it.Firstly Loot crates I saw a lot of complaints about them before I bought the game yet at the time they seemed like an optional extra that people who wanted to could buy keys for. The game will force crates onto you that require keys to unlock whether you want them or notI don't want to be spending 20 a week on keys yet the only crates I've been given this week for my ""battle points"" (point rewards for playing the game) have been the new ""Equinox"" weapon skin crates 10 the game wants me to have spent on keys this week already. 10 a week triple A subscription games don't want that much.So my reward for playng has been not a thing except being asked by a company that admits itself that it doesn't care about any customers outside of China to give more money. No thanks mate cheek to call them ""Random crates"". Random is not every crate the new weapon skin that requires a different type of key to the keys that everyone already had.They have refused to put a high ping kicker on servers they ""don't want to offend their Chinese players"" at the expense of everyone else who has to put up with constantly getting put into teams with loud ignorant groups who are quite blatantly trying to farm crates in order to sell them yes you can sell things from the crates on steam OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CHEAT.Cafe's full of people often with the same names with different numbers using voice ativated chat it's a good job you can't understand them because you can't hear anything over the noise this includes in games audio queues such as footsteps gunfire and the like. In a game where communication is critical they've done nothing but make it a very frustrating experience.If you're outside of China you mean nothing to this company except a potential sale and then potentially more money for keys The other side of no high ping kicker is that half the time the Chinese people you think you're shooting at are not where you are shooting at try driving in a car with one of them they will crash into every tree rock and wall there is because they are so desynced with the server they can't not.A percentage of the claims of hacking are exactly because of this They do seem to have been doing a little about it but it's no where near enough and no where near fast enough They've allowed people to make money from playing and the only time it's an issue for the company is when they aren't getting their cut their recent attempts to combat hacking have only been because of third party websites selling their items nothing more nothing less.So why should you buy this if the game is quite clearly against you from the start? Why should you give a company money just to have a frustrating experience looking for that one squad who A. can communicate with you and B. actually wants to play in a squad most folk seem to think that everyone else is a voice activated AI bot that is only their to find weapons and ammo for them That's not the games fault You've probably experienced similar in other games yet with this game the few times that you can find a squad who can talk it's one of those muppets.Yes there is a solo mode yet I like to have people to talk to when I'm running to the next circle because that's what half of your time on this game will be doing running into the next circle.Nothing to do with winning or losing my complaints I've had fun games that I've lost yet when you are talking about that happening maybe 1 game in 100 with an average game time of 15 20 minutes and the other 99 just full of nonsense from what's mentioned above to vehicles randomly flipping themseves people who don't have any recoil people with blatant aim bots people who arent were you see them to be being shot through buildings and walls.It's a frustrating futile experience and by their own admission they won't do a thing to fix it because ""China""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs care more about money and have be practicing some shady practices they have lied to us on multiple accounts and have basicly did what EA is known for. They have over 700M$ and instead of hiring more people and trying to improve the games fucntion have created a EA style money grab from the game by adding a CSGO style economy which isnt a bad thing but the way they have introduced is is just plain cynical. Over the gmaes fun and worth its cost of 30$ but it just has too many bugs and their actions prove their interest and would rather just sue companies for using the same game genre.

The fun comes from playing with friends which kind of ruins the whole ""player unknown"" part of the game. So do I recommend this game? Ehhhh yeah.

Neither should be affected by lag or hackers. Right? Well alas most P.C systems have to run it at very low settings with decent fps but at the start of games rubber banding issues can occur. BUT GIVE THEM A CHANCE have you ever had to handle this many players on your servers. Bearing in mind they have over 2 million players usually playing at the same time. As for he settings well im sorry but if you are wanting to play a demanding game get a good p.c maybe 1000 to run it at medium to high and with a fun experience. I can say that after 300 hours in this game i always want to play a new round even after a stupid mistake i have made. The game makes entertaining content for streamers and Youtubers and it has boosted the steam community bringing a newish game mode to become popular. Issues should be expected as we are all humans and making a computer generated game is bound to have issues and bugs. Try to name one game with NO bugs and NO hackers that supports most of the steam community 24/7. I would rate this game highly at about 8/10 and definately worth purchasing.In addition the the above there is a community market for the game where you can sell in game items which you get from buying crates with ingame currency (Bp) or from the market.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-20,0,0,384,True,Recommended,After playing 200 hours I am still playing and still enjoying it. Before going in to critiques I would like to address the negative reviews that you will see. A large majority of the one I read consist of people or people's friends getting banned unfairly for stream sniping which is a dumb way to attempt to get unbanned if that's what they are trying. People have also posted negative reviews on the game simply because they added a crate you must spend $2.5 (if I recall) to open it with a key. The crate was only for GamesCon and is not gone so that's just dumb as well. There are even negative reviews saying that Brendan Green has taken his hands off and is no longer working on the game which is a completely false statement. There is a big monthly update that brings in new content (new gun new items etc.) and then 2 3 patches each month addressing bugs and glitches and other smaller things. If you are into hardcore first person shooter's then this is the game for you. Be mindful the game is still in early access so it is poorly optimized and there are still a decent amount of bugs. The main problem is the optimization but IMO the movement feels pretty good and I rarely run in to bugs nowadays. Overall a very entertaining game and look forward to many more updates in the unforeseen future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For example of the guns I have used there is a UZI AK M4 Sniper Shotgun SKS SMGs and Pistols. I dont know all the guns that are in the game.Pros * Better combat machanics.* Cant just jump in your car when getting shot like KOTK there is a time in between when you want to enter and when you get in.* Its easier to kill people out of a car.* Better map IMO* Get to chose were you land so its not random.* Alot more weaponsCons * Still very glitchy.* Black Spots in houses becasue of AMD GPUs* Poor optimization.* Loading into games is laggy and jittery* Air strikes cause massive frame lossTO MANY HACKERS PLZ FIX,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-25,0,0,163,True,Recommended,this game is like hunger games where the walls get smaller and smaller until the survivors are in a circle 10m next to each other. Its very intense and will scare you when u get suprised i guess thats all in the experience of playing this game. Its very fun with friends. I only have 2 cons for this game the servers sometimes lag for 1 3min and its very annoying. Also if u have a pc that is identical to the minumum specs you might as well not get it. Ive heard some ppl with gtx 760s and still cannot run this game. For me i am running this game smoothly at 60fps 1080p ultra with a gtx 1070 and i5 6600k. The final con for me is that i think this game gets repetative very fast. Its just the same thing every game. Loot 1 2 houses find car go to center kill or get killed by a person u cant even see. If you are planning to get this game find some friends to play with. At this current state of the game it deserves a 7.5/10 for me. I hope the devs fix the issues i stated above and add more game modes guns and even maps to spice up the game a little. The devs did a really good job at the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-08,0,0,175,True,Not Recommended,"Now this game at it's foundation is great. Nice gunplay nice map and enviorment and slight variance in all the weapons constant updates bring in new weather variants and weapons. However where this game always seems to go wrong is the connection. Every time I play solo my connection is rather decent and I usually don't get clay buildings or network lag detected messages but recently whenver me and my friend try to play duos my connection is For example my partner will ask ""are you loaded in?"" I shouldn't be surprised that I loaded in to the spawn island or hope I do. Furthermore when I initially hit the ground my buildings wouldn't be fully loaded in you can see the basic strucure of the house and even sometimes enter it but you end up bouncing off the floor until the building loads in which is always up in the air in terms of when it will load. (hence clay buildings) Sometimes my game will freeze when opening my inventory early on leaving no choice but to end the task which fills my heart with gloom everytime I do because there is a lot of potential in this game. But until the xbox release I don't see this game's connection issues being solved. Great game horrible server connection. Thank god it isn't full priced....

2017-09-24,0,0,126,True,Recommended,This game is pretty fantastic. It can be fast paced or slow paced depending on your strategy. Do you want to drop into a city and fight with up to 20 30 people? Or maybe you want to drop low key into a group of houses test your luck with the loot RNG and hope you get something to help out mid game. Either way you've got the options to have an enjoyable game. The only issue with this game is that depending on your computer it might take a while for the game to render in the beginning. I imagine this will be fixed as the game progresses.

They can see where you are and how many meters you are away from them 70%+ use this cheat but currently the aimbotters and people shooting you from across the map by just shooting into the air and not even at you makes the game unplayable. so you spend 10 15 minutes looting buildings simply to have a cheater shoot and kill you that you can't even see and he can't even see you.

2017-12-21,0,0,729,False,Recommended,Fantastic overall game. I think mixed reviews are mostly the result of people who refused to acknowledge the fact that the game was still in in pre release phase prior for 12 20 2017. I've been playing since April (I think) and have nearly 700 hours played as of this review. My experiences have been great... Yes the game had its problems with servers and client optimization but those things are likely to be entirely in the past with the 1.0 release of the game. This is hands down the best battle royale game out there (I think the numbers speak for themselves). I'm really excited to see what Bluehole/ PUBG Corp. has in store for the future of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And this game is ONLY in early access and the 1.0 will come out soon with 2 new weapons vaulting ect...Pros Best mechanics so far Weapons are pretty much balanced a lot of weapon variety (melee AR Sniper Rifle LMG SMG Crossbow?) 1st map well designed A lot more to come on the game being updated Duo and Squad mode First Person Perspective servers for those who hate 3rd personCons The game can be very frustrative (bad loot sometimes a little bit of lag and the ways that you can die) The servers aren't this good but handle the job pretty much (heavy lag sometimes) 3rd person can be OP sometimes (If not playing in FPP obviously)Overall A nice game that you can play with your friends in duo or squad maybe hard to have fun in solos but it's always nice to get a chicken dinner D,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-07,0,0,554,True,Not Recommended,The game is above buggy. The latency is terrible and hasn't been fixed under any circumstances since the beginning of the game. If anyone played Overwatch at launch you'd know the tick rate was awful. Well times that by 10 and you got this game. Horrid tick rate mixed with horrid latency and the game is almost unplayable at times. On top of that we still have to deal with hackers all the time. With them planning to release the game this month all I have to say is they need to get their together because so far haven't been impressed with their server maintenance as a whole because it's been basically non existent. The game idea is great and the guns play and feel ok minus the AK which is horrible but on the Test Server they've fixed that. The game can be fun when the servers happen to be having a good day. The fact that it's been months since Early Access and the game is coming close to full release they need to buckle down and get things going otherwise this game will eventually go down hill.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The designers and artists who make the skins won't be working on bug fixing. So if their job is smoother and they are able to produce results a lot faster than the other guys working on bugs it doesn't mean the bug fixing guys are not working they just have a slower more time consuming job and because they haven't released anything yet does not mean the cosmetic guys should just stop their job because the game isn't optimized yet.Also the argument that ""they have so much money now"" so they can fix it it isn't as simple as that you can't throw money at it and be like ok game fix self.

Play this game with your mates and have a great time even though every now and then you'll teleport off a building or your vehicle will triple back flip and kill you at a really important moment or you'll be domed by a Chinese hacker with a Kar98k from 3 km away and there's a mountain in between you. The game is fun. If you don't like the game go join your other 12 year old friends and play Fornite. Of course Bluehole want a profit... they're a business.

2017-12-16,0,0,89,True,Recommended,"Player Unknowns Battlegrounds does not need a review. It is already highly praised by YouTube content creators and Twitch streamers. You already know it is a ""fun adreneline pumping action packed game"". You and me both can agree. This game has the best loot and guns out of all the battle royale games out there right now. While you always see the same weapons like the scar and the AKM in the last minutes of the match there is alot of weapon variety. You can modify most weapons to make them more accurate or to make less noise. There is also a neat clothing system in the game. But like i said you already know all that. The one problem i see with this game is this. The test server is more fun and easier to run then the actual game. I know the devs are working hard to let 1.0 see the light of day but come on. You already know the changes you made in the test server are viable. You already know we love the new map and the new weapons. Just give it to us. I reccomend this game for the same reason everyone else reccomends it. But if i had the choice to play the test server or the actual game i'd pick the test server. Buy this game its better than all the other games out on the market right now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Competitive wise its pretty feels like a take turns at hitting each other with manuvering the main way to out play your enemy not much room for skill. Just luck and who shot first and nomally punishes the person who shot first for giving away their position to other people as well.This game would be far more popular if they moved away from the battle royal mode and opened it up to modding or released a survival or dayz type version.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-15,0,0,194,False,Not Recommended,Three reasons make me decide not to like this game I rarely dislike a game but this one is extremely bad 1. This game is a highly hardware dependent game but the graphics doesn't look that good. My old PC runs BF3 4 even BF one smoothly but this game only gives me 10 20 FPS which is unplayable.2. Too many cheaters. I play AS usually there are a lot of cheaters there even in test server. The game experience is very bad when playing with those people since a lot of time you don't even have the chance to fight back and you are already our for the next game.3. The game doesn't seem to be completed from UI to gaming content (WTF is this crappy born island? and why is every one suddenly get on to the transporter all of those just doesn't make any sense. This game is merely a shooting game that satisfies the thirst for blood of human beings and consumes you a lot of time. I bought this game only because a lot of my friends are playing it and they wanted me to play with them after 30 hours game time I decide to throw this game into the dump.!!!!! DO NOT BUY this game unless you have a very powerful PC and a lot of your friends are playing it. This game is purely a blackhole for your time and you don t take anything out of it!UPDATE After the so called 1.0 official release they slightly alleviated the frame rate issue it s now playable (barely!) in terms of graphics. But the server is extremely unstable most of the time when you land you will be dragged back whenever you move forward and it means death if you landed at one of those rich resource spots The game is still unplayable for me.

Cau'z the hacking is good for their marketing That's why. Cant u see it Bluehole?! People buying hacking tools people getting banned and they buying another copies. Yay money in ur face ! And in my opinion u guys can at least do something about it not just banning the user but also thinking how to secure the code the way I see things going is the PUBG hacking is 2ez to make I mean way too 2ez that the Bluehole cant even do anything to them. Catching cheaters is not the main point how to catch those guys making the tools thats the things u guys should work on.Also keep apologizing cant do . PUBG players need u to fix the problem right now! P.S AS servers gaming experience is horrified as well 3 steps foward and 2 steps back......The beginning of the round is laggy as hell. !

2018-02-03,0,0,620,False,Recommended,This game is revolutionary. It has a massive map where no where is off limits which is pretty much un heard of in a multiplayer game which isn't open world. It is great to play with friends or by yourself. After playing for a while you might get a bit tired of it but that's more because the game has some stupid mechanics and a lot of small problems which need to be worked out. But the big picture is one of a brilliant game the likes of which has never been seen before. Fortnite has nothing on it because the map is small and you can't do whatever you want. You can drive cars drive boats even drive a car and land it onto a boat! You can't do that in fortnite.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-20,0,0,12,False,Recommended,PUBG is an online multiplayer competitive game which pits you against 99 other players in a 100 man elimination match. Right now there are 2 maps although they do plan to add to those later. The maps are huge and you start off in a plane and then drop down to any location you can get to as quick as possible without dying. Once you're on the ground you pick up weapons and gear and build up your aresenal and get ready to fight. As you play the map begins to shrink and if you stay outside the restricted area's your health will deminish and you will perish. This constriction adds another level of stress and adrenaline to the game. Soon all players left will gather in a small space until only one Man is left standing.. winner winner chicken dinner!!! There are basically 2 games modes solo and team based. Either way you're trying to surivive until the very end. It's extremely addictive. If you've played Fortnight and never played PUBG I will tell you the key differences. The graphics in PUBG are more realistic you can't build in PUBG there are more weapon customizations in PUBG. There are a few other differences but basically both games are 100 man elimination. Highly addictive strongly reccomended!! 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-05,0,0,983,True,Not Recommended,I have played over 630 hours of PUBG since early April of this year. I used to really enjoy this game however I fear for it's future and it's ability to keep up with other titles. Certain elements of PUBG are exhilarating the rush to find a weapon in the beginning the intense squad firefights and the heart racing adrealine pumping final moments of the game are PUBG's greatest assets. This is an early access game and during the first 4 5 months after it's lauch the developers did a decent job at improving the game. They added new animations game mechanics items and weapons as well as minor gameplay improvements. Recently however the dev's don't seem to be keeping up with the game anymore. Many major issues within the game are still present poor optimization even on high performance PC's cheaters dominate the leaderboards and might ruin some of your matches (cheats are easily accessable online) and dramatic FPS drops (the game will often drop to 30 40 fps no matter how good your PC or internet is). This is what I feared most before buying this game the fact that early access titles have a history of not being well maintained (cough cough DayZ cough). If you aren't one of the 15+ million people who have already bought this game don't. Your best bet is to wait until they release the full version sometime in December (probably even later because the dev's like to delay game updates).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I got my very first win 4 games in and it was very satisfying. The game is extremely intense most of the time even though it is pretty slow paced. The gameply is great and I can keep playing again and again which most games dont grab me like that.About Performance This game does indeed need better optimization however it will come and runs 50 75 FPS with medium settings on my rig. I have the game on my SSD and my entire build is standard clocked. Some people seem to have worse problems running the game but it runs fine with me. I havent really noticed any bad bugs at the time of this review.i5 6600k16 gb Corsair Vegence ddr4Msi GTX 9701x Samsung Evo 750 250 gb1x Western Digital 3tbAll in all try the game especially if you have similar specs that can run it decently smooth.

2017-10-05,0,0,99,True,Recommended,"I honestly love the game. I'm not generally a fan of PVP as I usually find the player base toxic but I'm thoroughly enjoying this game. Although the player base can still sometimes be toxic its easy to just mute the voice chat and for that matter the game itself is addicting. There's something very rewarding about those handful of matches when you do really well knowing everyone starts from the same point. As for some insight on the negative reviews There are two issues I know of neither of which have affected my game play but I guess we'll see.1) There was a huge problem with stream sniping and ""stream griping"" as I'd like to call it. Essentially there was a time when the public would watch streamers and try to find them in game to get an esy kill. hence ""Stream Sniping."" When the streamers called them out the PUBG devs would ban the players taking the streamers' side to continue having them advertise the game. This got out of hand hand as streamers started calling stream sniping just to save face when they died. Hence ""Stream Griping."" This lead to the devs banning a bunch of people who most of the time don't even watch live streams and the game was review bombed. 2)There was and still is an issue with defaulting Asian servers. basically people who aren't in Asia are being defaulted to Asian servers and most of the time even after switching servers they still end up in Asian servers. This may have been fixed but I'm still dealing with it. It's not too aweful besides the fact that your team speaks different languages. It has however been lagging the cr ap out of the Asian servers and PUBG was review bombed yet again.That being said I'd definitely still recommend the game. I'm planning on buying more copies for gifts in the near future. The game is still fun and is still worth the $30 in my opinion. It's just unfortunate because these two issues after large groups of people and the reviews tanked.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Xbox realease? probably before its ready to milk the cash cow. this game will not get better beacuse they already earned their money. they have already done crate and key systems before they relased the game even thouhg they promised not too.

Oh it also crashes routinely.The funny thing is it use to be a great game when it was in pre release. What the hell happend?Now lets talk about the maps and recent changes.1. Desert map insanely spread out. I hope you like running most of the time or struggling with the ungoly horrid steering and controls of one of the utterly terrible vehicles in the game.2. Guns? You like them? Awesome get use to handguns and shotguns because some recent patch seems to have removed practically everything out of the game. Places that use to actually have weapons basically dont' have any. Short of hot dropping School or Hacienda you're hosed for a while.I'm leaving this review hoping they fix these issues. The new map is promising. Now please spend some time building in stability so the game crashes less and focus a bit on improving the fun aspects (like the weapons) because right now it's just a frusterating experience.

2017-07-14,0,0,673,True,Recommended,This game is great. The only downside apart from the stutter and occasional first game load failures is the lack of hit direction which when combined with cheating tiny d!cked players (you know the type they have a red star and eat cats and dogs) causes problems. The worst is hit direction. Who hit you. Where. You will never know. You won't know because you were iced by a guy with radar from 400m out and it leaves you angry and empty.Speaking of empty nothing burns more than fighting for your life only to earn the same late 90's baseball cap over and over and over and....over.In order to customise your character in this era of sad skinny jeaned millennials where appearance means more than personality you have to play and die so much that it possibly might outlive religion. If you are patient enough to do this you may earn the right for different coloured jeans. That sums up the reward system when you survive the netcode dog eaters and stovepipe jeans hordes whose memory goes as far back as 2004.Aside from this it is a very good game with excellent map and fluid dynamic play.The promotional video has no relevance so don't watch it. You'll never get those pants or fur lined jacket (if its important to you you fkn millennial).enjoy,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There's a lot to like but as all early access games go it's hard to play through a lot of it's issues. Vehicles need a lot of tweaking. First person is much more enjoyable but in it's current state can be clunky at times. First person height feels off at times. Servers are usually Smoke grenades grenades and stuns need a lot of improvement. The main menu is awful. Sounds need a lot of work. More accessories would be cool why no binoculars?Overall game optimization is enough to keep most people away until it's in a better state.

2018-02-09,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,I really don't understand how this is the most popular game on steam but runs the worst out of anything I've ever played. I understand that the difference between pc and console is that pc lets you customize graphics settings and you're a bit more involved in how much fps you're getting where as console just gives you a game that is designed to run on your chosen console. This however does not mean that devs can just release two fifths of a game and expect you to design the rest of the code. They can however release a game and then expect the player to customise it to their machine's capabilities. This does not however allow devs to release a game with every single aspect of the games code to be adjusted according to the players machine. My pc is above the minimum requirements and it still did not run well with the 40 years of optimization I did to it. I then set everything to the lowest possible setting and adjusted settings in my graphics card to allow the game to run better. I still lag I still get fps freezes Players still shoot me out of nowhere and then appear after their harry potter invisibility cloak runs out or something. Great concept but unless the game is made so that a normal human being can play it without having to be an active member of the dev team then it's not gonna be a good game. I also don't understand the physics of the vehicles in this game. If you're going to have a game where there's a time limit that you need to beat to a certain area on the map or else you die then vehicles are important. You can't just make it so that if I'm racing against the space time continuum to get out of the blue zone and I hit a pebble smaller than an actual 1 1 scale pixel that I flip into the International Space Station and crash from heights of Felix Baumgartner and die. That's rubbish. Every action you do in this game will make you spike out and view the powerpoint presentation that the creator of the game presented to blue balls entertainment. Fix the game and it'll be good. 5 fps lag spikes out of 10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-24,0,0,412,False,Recommended,Jak napisać dobrą recenzję gryKażda recenzja powinna zawierać w sobie dwa podstawowe elementy. Pierwszym z nich jest przedstawienie danej rzeczy przedmiotu recenzji. Bardzo ważne jest aby autor pamiętał o niewdawaniu się w zbyt szczegółowe kwestie. Takie recenzje zazwyczaj wiążą się bowiem ze znudzeniem czytelnika. Celem piszącego recenzje powinno być natomiast przedstawienie tematu tak aby po lekturze tekstu czy wysłuchaniu materiału odbiorca miał wiedzę odnośnie danego zagadnienia. Recenzje gier online przykładowo powinni zawierać takie podstawowe informacje jak chociażby gatunek do jakiego zalicza się gra. Pisząc recenzje gier online warto również pokusić się o przedstawienie ich twórców. Szczególnie czytelnikom obeznanym w temacie taka wiedza może się bardzo przydać. Przede wszystkim dlatego że będą mogli porównać poprzednie gry wyprodukowane przez daną firmę czy zespół twórców. Współczesne gry posiadają często bardzo rozbudowaną fabułę którą również autor zabierający się za recenzje gier online powinien mieć na uwadze. Dobrze jest opisać chociażby główne wątki. Jeżeli gra stanowi kontynuację wcześniejszych projektów taki fakt także w swojej recenzji należy naświetlić. Niektórzy gracze lubią skorzystać z różnych odsłon gier aby mieć porównanie. Zatem dobre recenzje gier online powinny dawać im możliwość rozeznania we wcześniejszych dokonaniach twórców danej gry.Podczas omawiania konkretnej gry dobrze jest również zwrócić uwagę na grupę odbiorców do których taki projekt jest skierowany. Inaczej bowiem będzie się pisało o grze edukacyjnej dla najmłodszych niż w przypadku przedstawiania bardziej poważnych przedsięwzięć w branży. Chodzi nie tylko o odmienny język recenzji ale również zwrócenie większej uwagi na pewne fakty. Recenzje gier online mogą również wskazywać komu dana gra powinna przypaść do gustu najbardziej. W ten sposób również można wiele o niej powiedzieć.Na końcu opinia autora. Bardzo często w recenzji można spotkać podział na dwie części. Podobnie rzecz ma się w przypadku gdy autor pisze recenzje gier online. Warto na początku opisać grę w sposób mniej lub bardziej treściwy. Wiele w tym miejscu zależy od ilości miejsca dostępnego na publikację. Po nakreśleniu fabuły i podaniu podstawowych faktów dobrze jest pokusić się o własną ocenę danego projektu. Aby była ona możliwie najbardziej rzetelna należy najpierw samodzielnie przetestować grę. Tylko w ten sposób stworzone recenzje gier online będą kompletne. Czy trzeba kierować się zasadą obiektywizmu czy lepiej subiektywnie podejść do tematu? Autor powinien zdecydować sam. Niemniej jednak bardzo ostra krytyka wskazana jest na ogół w sytuacjach gdy za recenzje gier online odpowiada ktoś bardzo zorientowany w zagadnieniu i dysponujący sporą wiedzą nie tylko praktyczną ale także teoretyczną. W przeciwnym razie czasami warto poskromić język i starać się wyważyć zalety i wady uzupełniając je ewentualnie własnymi przemyśleniami. A ostateczną ocenę pozostawić odbiorcy. Jeżeli po zapoznaniu z recenzją będzie on bogatszy w wiedzę wówczas autor może ogłosić sukces.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-31,0,0,352,True,Not Recommended,I want a refund on this game. With every update the game gets worse. The hackers multiply and the t becomes more stupid. Played 4 solo games. After checking my area and the sky for anyone to land next to me no one does so I proceed to loot as the closest person is more than a kilometre away. By the second building I loot someone is waiting at a staircase with level 3 helmet M416 and level 2 vest. Just waiting for me to come upstairs with my P92 pistol and no armour. Game 2. I land at shooting range with 5 other people. I land at what is usually a high gun spawn to find nothing despite landing first. And I am proceeded to be taken out by an S12K. Game 3. As soon as I land I take the nearest car and drive to the furthest possible place inside the safe zone and begin looting. After getting some amazing loot I am then required to proceed to to opposite side of the safe zone to the new marker and then again and then again. Until it's physically impossible for me to get to the safe zone due to the giant mountain in my way and then I am hastefully killed by this updated blue zone.Final game last chance before I uninstall this game forever. I land find an AK begin getting 7 8 body shots on a player running at me with a machete and no armour and I am then killed in one swing. This game is a terrible waste of money time and patience. 35 minutes of looting.2 seconds of being shot in the head by a Kar98k from knows where.TL DR PlayerUnknowns tGrounds. 0/10 game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is immersive and absolutley a great game it needs work but its in Alpha maybe Beta at this stage. So give them a break its truly a great game that deseves all the support it receives. (A humble brag... so dont get your panties in a bunch) I do have a Threadripper 1080 ti gaming x trio and 32gb of ram so that said I do have the luxury of running this game in 160 FPS+ and it looks amazing for a Aplha/ Beta stage game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-18,0,0,334,False,Recommended,I love this game.I get tons of fun but literally unplayable if you have a HDD for storage (It takes you 1 Minute to load the map).Before buying this game buy a Solid State DriveI have also encountered blatant hacking on here 4 times...All using speedhacks and aim hacks.(One guys sprayed down my whole squad with all headshots knocking us down instantly we weren't even grouped close together another time I was killed by a guy shooting a pistol while running at a speed faster than someone who is running with boost)Please ban the cheaters or at least introduce a ranking/ match making system so there's less chance of encountering one.Also the nerds over in the Asian servers will teamkill you if you have better loot than them. update Jan 04 2018 I think the updates are on the right track.the game is no longer as buggy as before 1.0 and now I can game smoothly on my GTX 960There are still a few bugs like smoke disappearing and a few server side issues like rubber banding and freezing your game without telling you that you have a bad connectionThe recent update changed my mind do get this game it's tons of fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-27,0,0,409,True,Recommended,Let me give you a quick answer before I go into my mildly detailed review Yes you should buy this game.I have had this game for close to a week now and I can say without a single doubt that this is one of the best game purchases that I have made this yearDo you like constant edge of your seat action?Do you like games where nobody has an advantage over you each round?Do you enjoy survival shooters?If you answered yes to any(or all) of the questions above then this game is for you.Yes I know it is still pre release but the fact that the game is so fun already has me hyped for the final product.You drop in each round with nothing nada zilch zero. Its a race out of the gates to get some gear all while making sure there isnt any hostiles waiting around the next corner. I cannot tell you how many times i have s*** my pants just trying to loot a building. Thats the type of s*** that gets me up in the morning. Then theres that one round where you drop into the perfect area theres no one for miles all the buildings are filled with level 3 gear sniper rifles and ARs. You then proceed to ghost the round until you are in the top 10 only to get shot in the back of the head by a KAR98K. Its all good though casuse I could die #99 or #5 and still have a heck of a fun time playing.Did I mention the f****** circle? I have a love/hate relationship with that thing. Your first thought in a game where the goal is to be the last man alive out of the 100 players in every session is to camp it out in a bathroom on the third floor of an apartment complex. Well good news thats not gonna happen unless you are somehow extremely lucky like I'm talking you're going to win the lotto before you can camp it out in a single spot for the entire game. The chances are the circle WILL close on you if you are not constantly on the move.Overall this is an amazing concept for a game and I cant wait to see what is coming in the next couple months as this game prepares for release.THE BOTTOM LINE 10/10 I HAVE AND CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDSBUY THIS GAMESTOP READING REVIEWS AND WATCHING STREAMS ON IT TO MAKE A DECISIONYOU WONT REGRET ITYOU HAVE SPENT $30 ON STUPIDER S***ACCEPT ITCONFORMGIVE INWHY ARE YOU STILL READING THISTHE ONLY REASON YOU SHOULD STILL BE READING THIS IS IF YOU ARE WAITING FOR THIS GAME TO DOWNLOAD.BUY ITTHE END.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-18,0,0,80,True,Recommended,You haven't lived if you haven't played this beast of a game. Probably one of if not the best Battle Royale out there simply because of the sheer amount of dev support it has. Player Unknown's Battle Ground AKA PUBG is a slow paced but adrenaline pumping and thrilling game. I've played other Battle Royales and though personally I think another one is better than this one it is only because I have played it for longer and it runs better on my potato of a computer. If you can aim have game logic and experience in FPS there is literally no reason for you not to try this game. It is fairly beginner friendly (Though it is rage inducing you have been warned!) but requires a beefy computer to run smoothly. I would personally suggest a GTX 9XX and an Intel I7 at the very least although I have been able to get it to run at 50 FPS on the lowest settings with a GTX 750. With that out of the way go get your chicken dinner. Po i is my city.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-07,0,0,96,True,Recommended,TL DR CONS * Animations and graphics are far from top tier when it comes to Unreal 4.* Hackers everywhere (or so everybody says) although it's hard for me to tell between hackers and people with sniper rifles.* UI is very spartan.* Control is clancky like old shooters but in a bad way.PROS * Every match starts pretty quick and doesn't last too long (20 30min top).* You can punch people in the groin.* Has random factors to it (like the plane route combat zone and blast zone) and I love it.* Can be very fun at times.IGN 10/10 It's OKFar from perfect and from what I read it's only getting worse. But I have good time at the time of writing this. Also don't believe the trailers the game on ultra doesn't look that good and some of the locals I'm 100% sure unreachable. Better watch streams over twitch to decide if this game is for you. Don't believe the trailers.Also regarding microtransations it's only for cosmetics and you can't pay real money for them outside of buying stuff from other players at the Steam marketplace. Loot boxes are not so quickly obtained unless you're really good but the cosmetics are anyways so who cares? The loot boxes and marketplace are never pushed to the player's face so it's A OK for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-07,0,0,411,True,Recommended,My review for PUBG and why I think it deserves positive reviews.I've got 200 hours in the game. Reached top 10k in leaderboards quite a few times. I play exclusively on EU. Never seen any cheater. My game was always smooth only crashed when I ed up with my windows settings.I run a i5 4590 8/16 gigs of ram gtx 1070. Can run the game at 1440p with no lag.The game is very fun with friends. It has a lot of bugs but most of them are rare or aren't game changing.I appreciate the vehicle system as it is. I play H1Z1 PUBG Fortnite. If I had to choose one it would be PUBG.A lot of variety on weapons. Not as many hackers as fortnite (f2p).Better graphics more realistic than H1Z1 better gunplay than H1Z1.Playing squads in PUBG is way more fun and not as tryhard as in H1Z1's fives.Squads are less of a mess and have way easier/better way to communicate. If you want a fast paced battle royale choose either H1Z1 or Fortnite. If you want more of a tactical battle royal slower paced buy PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-13,0,0,152,True,Recommended,yeah. PUBG is the beginning of a new subgenre of shooters. This game will be a landmark in the history of gaming.PUBG forces adrenaline through your veins. Down to 10 players pinned down in a building by gunfire from an uncertain direction circle closing in about to cut off your escape forcing you to make snap tactical decisions... you will find yourself stuggling to control your breath and get your mouse hand steady. Those golden moments of gaming that you reminisce about months and years down the line that are deperately rare in most games happen almost every play session in PUBG.This is only going to be amplified by the forced first person perspective something the game really should've launched with and been designed around in my opinion. So much more effective at accomplishing everything I like about PUBG and much much much less cheesey gunfights. We need that first person.If you consider yourself a gamer and you haven't player a round or two of PUBG you owe it to yourself.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-11,0,0,151,True,Not Recommended,"while our intention was and still is to add the full feature to the game when we move into actual release we do need to test it prior to launch and at Early Access so that it is stable and ready to be fully introduced to our community We believe the crate and key system will serve as the foundation of a healthy economy after launch. This is an economy that would and should benefit all players both who are willing to pay and who are not willing to pay for vanity items.""so that it is stable and ready.. yeah sure the most stable thing is giving you money.Now i paid 2 50 to get random stuff. I got bloody sneakers. now who wants them?? i doubt anyone want to pay more than nothing! stupid me! I hope someone reads this and never ever anyone buys stuff that is just a cosmetic thing and not even ONE THING that is randomly spit out is something I would like to have! I just tested what happened and thats what they want. But they have gone to far. Not one cent more from me!the most unstable is the game itself. i have lags and memory leaks. now I can not play this game normal and it is not my PC thats has a problem. I have 8 Gig ram but have to start the game with lowmemorythe transall is pooping smoke from front to the rear (why?) after touching the ground the game hangs and all you want to make sure is a healthy economy after you already got money for this..you know what? I think the developers do not even think about making money when this game gets gold. i mean when the game is out of alpha and beta and can be sold dont you think you can make enough money with selling the game? i bet when this game is bugfree and official stable all people that would like to have it already bought it and/or abandoned it!that means you have to press the money out of the people that already bought it.and you do have to sell keys while in this stage??!!you are not even happy that so many give you money for this game at this state you have to make sure the people are paying and keep paying.it shows just the american way of making money out of every poop.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The graphics are suprisingly pretty good for an early access game and the audio is great gunshots in the distance sounds almost real. The only real problem with this game ATM is it's poor optimization. I have to play on low to get 60+ fps with an i7 4790k gtx 1070 and 16 gigs of ram. And even then it sometimes drops to the 30s. But again it's an early access game so this should be expected.

THE GAME IS GOOD. END OF SENTENCE.These reviews are not meant to reflect how you feel towards the publisher but rather the product at hand. Everybody needs to just shut up about how butt hurt they are about a developer putting in a micro transaction for testing and paying for an event if you read everything they stated some of the money will be going to charity but i digress. IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT BUY IT. These are all purely cosmetic and nobody is forcing you to buy them. If you think you can do better with less then lets see it! OH you aren't a game designer/developer? THEN SHUT UP! But enough about the cry babies.Now on to the GAME itself. PUBG is a 1v99 Battleroyale/ Looter Shooter for those that do not already know. You fly over drop in loot ammo guns meds etc. and go on the hunt. Your goal? Be the last person alive. You not only fight other players but have to strategically navigate the map and beat the ever encroatching circle. If you manage to beat all odds and are the last man standing they are rewarded with a delicious ""chicken dinner""PUBG as a whole is a good experience. The game has its quirks but that is also what makes it different from H1Z1 KotK and the OG ARMA mod. Does it have bugs here and there? Yes it does but its in early access. Are they constantly fixing and updating to fix bugs and balance the game? YES they are! Something very few EA titles have been doing UPDATES REGULARLY! Is it ""unplayable"" as many state on a regular basis? Far from it people like to SEVERELY over exagerate when their game crashed one time becuase they didnt update there 2 year old video drivers for their 6 year old graphics card. The game runs fine I will say that it hasn't been entirely optimized but it is far from ""unplayble"". (obviously with 500k concurrent players) With that said it does have quite a bit to render all at one time and does take some decent hardware to run well so keep that in mind.

2017-08-03,0,0,101,True,Recommended,Only played DUOs or SQUADs with friends only 30ish hours on record but I've kept up with the updates and the path they plan on taking the microtransaction was a shocker cause I got the PU Set off the market and was surprised with how easy it was to get but 2.50 for a key isn't that bad (bit of a rip off of CS GO cause it's a gamble) cause it funds the devs and with the game's full release date held back cause of working on optiminzation. A lot of people are upset and are going to down vote this game cause of it but they apparently think devs work for free and make decision like this without having a reason except money. Devs do require payment and dev team leaders make hard decisions to either risk going bankrupt or cutting pay or et cetra (not saying Bluehole is in danger cause of the high sales or at all). So take the microtransaction as you will but in the end of the day it's just cosmetic items it does have minimal effect on gameplay (camoflauge and stuff) but not enough to get the pitchforks and torches and boycott the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have yet to encounter any major bugs and have only encountered one major instance of ""Network Lag Detected "" and that was when it was a really major issue happening extremely frequently. The game runs perfectly fine on my $300 PC with everything on high. There have been instances of the game being obviously unoptimized but they are few and far between and are actively being worked on by arguably one of the most engaged developers. Overall this game is a must have for anyone who enjoys this genre. For all of its faults (some of which just make the game more fun and ridiculous like vehicles clipping into stuff and flying off) it's a great game. Sometimes you'll get frustrated but it's one of those games that just makes you get right back into it.

Everything from the gameplay to the weapon add ons seems very complex and requires a deep understanding to truly play this game. I adore the feeling of exploration and the suspence of ""other players can kill me any second"" gives me. I think this game currently only appeals to people with at least a mid range pc ( and higher). It is extremely resourceful. I myself own a pc that can play for example games like gta v high settings at 1080p smoothly (60fps avg) but why can't I play this game at at least medium 1080p? I am forced to play it at very low which not only looks a lot worse but performs terribly too. Please remove unnecessary assets and bulk from the game.

You can't solo queue and join a squad and expect them to speak English Spanish or even French you know... one of the three most dominant languages in North America. Nope... better speak Chinese. Also you have to now deal with the fact that you're shooting at someone literally on the other side of the world and high ping (them) benefits them much more than it does you. They need to region lock this game because this has gotten out of hand. If I wanted to play with people who don't speak the same language as me I'd queue up on one of the FOUR Asian servers available but I guess that's not an option for the Chinese players.I've resorted to team killing every player that even remotely sounds like their from Asia.

2018-01-25,0,0,41,False,Not Recommended,Even though the game says it's been released and no longer in early access it's still early access quality wise. I feel they only took it out of early access to get more sales. It's still just as glitchy the beginning of the round is a massive lag fest and the luckiest one wins. After the beginning if you can get a kill at point blank while unloading half your clip you are also the lucky one. Half the time the game gets stuck on the loading screen but yet you can still move around and play the game if only you could see what you're doing. This game is just a bug fest and the developers are only after easy money. If this game wasn't profitable they'd abondon it and go on to the next easy money....oh wait they already started another game. Yep this game is not a priority any more. They've already made millions why fix what they started? Save your hard earned money if it goes on sale (good luck) then I'd say get it but not for more than $15. I got mine from CD keys for $25 and it just isn't worth it. Yea it's a fun game but only when it works which is quite rare.

2017-07-16,0,0,18,True,Recommended,I have very mixed feelings about this game. On one hand this game is amazing. It keeps you engaged and on your toes every match. On the other hand this game can feel like when you crack an egg into a pan and part of a dead baby chicken is halfway formed in it. A bad start can completely trash your experience. A few bad starts can completely turn you off of the game. The mechanics on this game are pretty meh. Any feature other than shooting feels like half implemented sluggish code. Jumping over simple walls are an absolute pain but shooting people as they try to figure out how to open a door is extremely satisfying. Overall sure it is fun but these types of games need much more polish. If they could take a AAA FPS game and enable these kinds of mechanics in them you would have a winner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At the moment i would recomend.Update 25/06/2017Game seems like its getting worse every week they realise and update but what they say they fix doesn't get fixed and they just end up adding more bugs than there was Still addictive but that due to not having nothing else to play This games massivly frustrating to the point i leave the game with a bad mood Not only is the game annoying but the player base is aweful. nobody want to play for fun everyones a camper and you cant play without getting jumped on by someone hiding people will hunt a kill and throw the hole game just to get you as a kill even when they know there going to die for it.

2017-12-18,0,0,406,True,Recommended,Lots of fun chaos and frustation.Honestly despite all of the negative reviews most of which being about performance it's actually a very solid game. I'd like to start off by pointing out that it's an early access game that actually has direction a release date and isn't stuck in development hell.Here's talking about you DayZ...There are a couple of issues such as being fairly demanding and having a little bit of early game lag but honestly that's about it in terms of my experience with performance. If you have a half decent PC which you should if you're a PC gamer then you're good to go. I do have to recommend that if you haven't already you should upgrade your RAM to at least 16GB since most games require more as of late.I've included my specification and a screenshot of in game settings. The FPS counter hovers around the 144FPS cap for the majority of my gameplay which is what I would like it to be.

2018-06-28,0,0,19,False,Recommended,So. You're thinking about getting PUBG but not sure? I would reccommend you get it. If you like Battle Royale it's pretty darn good. I personally perfer PUBG to Fortnite since the maps are much much larger and the overall feel of the game is much more realistic which adds to the stress and realism of crawling around on your belly as the circle shrinks pushing you closer to the 9 remaining players in your game... You can play the game as hardcore as you want but personally i find that PUBG is a great cooldown game.

2018-08-05,0,0,106,False,Recommended,I've had this game since the beginning and I've always enjoyed it but there are a few problems with it. This didn't used to be the case the in game content that you can earn now almost always requires you to buy a key to unlock. What's the point (aside from making more money) to charging for literally everything in the game. You can however get that occasional box that you can unlock for free but I still have yet to get that. Keys for this game cost $2.50 not much for one but every box you get will require you to buy another one. I sure as hell am not going to put that much money into the game. The only problem now with in game currency is that it has pretty much become worthless since the game is just going to require you to buy more products. I'm going to continue to play the game and get boxes but i'm not going to pay to open them. I'll just go and sell them on the community.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-05,0,0,326,False,Not Recommended,I cannot recommend this game in it's form right now because of some issues that I'm going to adress shortly but first I am supreme in CS GO I'm saying this because some bois are going to say I need to git gud instead of just saying the thruth in that this game is simply not skill rewarding (compared to a game like counter strike). I've also been playing since august last year.I have decent aiming skill but really when playing solo's in this game it doesn't matter because if you drop somewhere with some other people the server lags so bad you it depends on who gets lucky enough to get the window to pick up a gun because it just lags so bad you have to swipe items over 2 5 times before you actually pick it up and even if I pick up a gun and kill 2 3 people I can lag out for 2 seconds and in that time someone comes behind and shoots me which sounds logical but on my screen I just die in 1 tick and never hear or see anything. Especially on the new Savage map this is an issue because if you want an ar and semi decent gear you will have to drop in a place with at least 5 other people.Another problem with early game is that the items take a while to spawn in meaning that if you've practiced parachuting and basically outskill your opponent by beating them to the ground you will get ed over because you think you've cleared a space and then seconds later you die to someone who looted that exact floor but parachuted in later and found a gun.Here's a small intermission with some bugs and things I don't like about the game 1. If you drive a car and a motorcycle into each other the chance of you randomly flying into space and another universe is very big.2. Sometimes guns ignore armour (even tho devs said they fixed this) resulting to umps 2 shotting you with level 3 armour.3. Getting stuck you can get stuck in some houses and you'll be there for the rest of the game.4. Not hearing sounds I've had a lot of times now where I simply dont hear my enemy reloading their gun or any footsteps but when I watch the deathcam they're just sprinting around. This happens mostly early game.5. The spectating system is extremely bad to the point where If i spectate a teammate or watch a game back it's so inaccurate it becomes useless.Back to the reviewBefore going to the next topic being duo's and squads lets talk about cheaters in PUBG.For me I haven't seen a blatant cheater in 200+ hours of play but the ones that aren't blatant are invisble because of the bad replay and spectating system. The spectating system sometimes doesn't show recoil and it's too inaccurate to see if someone is cheating or not.Duo's and squads are another story and for me the most enjoyable part of this game. In contrast duo's and squads do reward skill and any game you play with friends are more fun then playing with randoms. The knockdown and revive system are a blessing but at the same time very annoying because you can knock someone super far away but they will get revived can you cant get that 800 meter kill you worked so hard for steamsad . But still the looting problem persists and is just a wall between you action and combat. For me the best solution to solve this is for everyone to be able to have ar's and snipers anywhere and reserve high level gear and the best attachments to hot drop places making it so if you want that kar98k with an 8x you will have to go for the risky play of dropping hot and challenging your skill instead of not finding a gun when looting 3 building on the military base and then dying to someone who looted the smallest house there and got 2 ar's. The system they have now might be good for the casual player but for someone who caters to skill and wants to win consistently it's a burden to have this very frustrating mechanic in the game.And lastly they have added weapon skins which to many people says a lot about what the developers are doing at the moment but I know that different teams work on different things and that those people that worked on weapon skins dont work on fixing bugs or adding more event modes.My final thoughts on the game are that the speed at which it changes is very big but it just isn't a full game or 1.0 as they call it to me it's still very far away from that and it's still in early access in my eyes. Solo's are a nightmare Duo's and squads are fun but that doesnt compensate enough to make this a positive review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In the little time (month and a half) ive had the game ive seen it go through some pretty drastic updates. Each update has been a drastic improvment on the game and shows that the publishers do indeed care for the game and for the most part listen to their fans or atleast care about what the fans are looking for. Theres several ways you can play the game and an infinite number of strategies to help enjoy the game. PROS * Consistent updates* Earnable cosmetics through gameplay or tradable on the steam market* Multiple employable strategies* The ability to play with your friends in 3rd person mode or even 1st person!* Large map that encloses on the playerbase as they kill each other (this map and playable area is also influenced by players depending on where they drop from the plane)CONS * Not very well optimized for lower end PC's and few high end PCs (recently added or are adding 6 core support)* Rage inducing deaths (youre going to die A LOT)* 3rd person mode adds a bit of a handicap because you can peek over walls and keep an eye on people* Community is pretty hit or miss (youll hear a lot of racial slurs and people yelling about Chinas position on a leaderboard of countries in the lobby),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-23,0,0,348,True,Recommended,"So far the game in it's current state is pretty fun the variety of guns and items you can obtain and get is a lot of fun. I really enjoy the fact that they added attachments to this game. Which is something I was looking for in a ""survival games"" type of game play.Some people may be asking the question... ""How is this different from H1Z1 KOTK?""well there are a few things like...1. The customization of weapons and mods to go with those weapons is a big one.2. Graphics are a lot better in my honest opinion.3. A wider variety of weapons to choose from.4. I like the fact that i can hit play and it starts up the game no need for a launcher.Things I would personally like to see 1. Maybe a single player added where we can play against bots/AI for those who may not have internet or stable internet.2. A lot more loot would be nice too(I'm sure they will add more)3. I think the idea of adding a couple more maps would be interesting.(change up the gameplay every now and then so we are not all stuck to one map all the time)Issues I have one major issue when I spawn into the game and land in a area the buildings or objects do not generate right and i am forced to wait a good 30 seconds or minute for it to show up correctly. While I'm waiting I can't grab objects or open doors so im in the open and pretty much in the open to be attacked.So all together this game has great potential and I hope they keep this game up to date fair and fun for everyone.I would definitely recommend this game to people and friends.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But extremely bad performance and optimisation even when put to early access standards.On top of that even though they have sold an insane amount of copies and got an insane amount of money to help them speed up the development process. We have not seen an single optimisation patch in several months that have made a significant change in performance. Rather the oposite.As it looks now this is just another cash and grab scam title. Where the devs are not gonna put the money they get from the early access sales to actually finnish the game in a reasonable time.If it continue like this we have another DayZ on our hands. That will take a decade to finish,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-21,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,While I have not put a hundred hours into this game (yet) I've enough experience in video games (40 years near enough) to see a games good and bad points this does have both (it's early access deal with it). So far it's content lite but very promising I'm sure with more maps and new modes like the Zombie co op mode due soon it'll eat up a lot of my time. although support for 150 players is pretty impressivePROS A nice variation on last man standing borrowing ideas from ARK and ARMA games and a fairly quick round game. Nice loot system pretty good gear range sound fx are pretty good. Co op and team modes offer a bit more fun over the standard solo lone wolf mode. Lots of new features due in the near future. CONS Typical early access issues such as not being optimised yet. I've seen cheaters due to lack of anti cheat methods but heopfully that will be addressed before it kills off the fun graphically dated looking (Very similar to ARMA2) but does the job. Vehicle handling is very basic. I'd like to see vegittation forced to ultra so cant be reduced as it's too open without much cover in a lot of places.EDIT Latest patch 3/8/2017Broke the game framerates plummiting to sub 40 from 80 minimums laggy servers and the biggest insult PAID cosmetics on a ALPHA grade early access game... seriously? top selling game on steam and devs are cashing in before it's even running properly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,160,True,Recommended,Fun and competitive. Mechanically the game feels like what DayZ should have been. It is clear this is a competent dev team that values a smooth and polished experience. Putting aside the typical optimisation issues early access titles have this game plays like a dream. Too often these EA titles are muddled with 'quality of life' issues where your character can't seem to properly executed the most mundane tasks eg. walking uphill driving without serious desync climbing a set of stairs and so on. You will see none of this in this game.I was at first worried at what seemed to be copious amounts of loot I'd see when watching videos of the game. As someone who comes from game's like 'DayZ' and '7 Days to Die' I am used to good loot being hard to come by. And I enjoyed it. It made the impending confrontations that much more intense and weightful. But in this game you can come out decently geared in matter of minutes if you're just a little lucky. After my first few matches I was happy to see that every confrontation is in this game is indeed intense and most of all fun as hell. The variety of weapons vehicles and terrain makes for a battlefield with limitless potential for pvp shenanigans. The only bad things I can say about BATTLEGROUNDS are all things typical of EA titles. BATTLEGROUNDS is up there with some of the most polished EA titles almost every aspect of the game feels good and works right. The asking price may be a little steep for an EA title but if you like PvP BATTLEGROUNDS easily justifies it's asking price. Simply this is a well made game where you're dropped on an island with 99 other people who want you dead. And yes it's as fun as it sounds. 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,1834,True,Recommended,A few things. One. Everyone plays in low res mode because it gives people an unfair advantage by negating all of the foliage and natural cover afforded by the game. Which is kind of lame. I like how the game looks in Ultra mode but if you want the edge that everyone else is using than you're forced into using it almost. The game is buggy but it's also early access so this is to be expected. Despite the fact that things will occasionally freak out on you this game provides a seriously addictive pvp experience that I've not had the likes of since I was big into MOBA's. Really this may be the future of online competitive gameplay.Now the downside. This game has sold an insane amount of copies at 30bucks a pop in early access and whatever the cost was for preorders. So the method in which they are instituting the f2p monetization tactics is a little . For one there is no reason to make me earn a bunch of ingame points at a ing trickle only to than charge me real money to buy a key to open the damn thing. This is unneccisarily complicated and kinda bs. In fact i do not understand why they do not take the approach of a company like Blizzard and offer an ingame solution to lootboxes and a paid solution for those who don't want to wait. And if that isn't enough maybe offer outfits you can buy sans the loot box RNG bs all together.Really I enjoy this game and I can certainly continue enjoying it without blowing money on cosmetics. However i wouldn't mind supporting the game but they really need to find a more graceful way of implementing the monetization.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-06,0,0,57,True,Not Recommended,"Initially I gave this game a positive review since it filled a void I had. After putting more hours into it I can better see it's worth.First of all it has too much randomness involved over skill which is why it probably won't ever be an esport. Randomness is especially noticeable near the end you're likely to get screwed by the circles if you're not in the ""right"" spot essentially wasting 15 20 minutes of your time.Still laggy as heck with poor hit registration. You would think those are priorities but I guess not when they make polls on what type of looting to implement...Paid crates... You would think that by selling millions of copies and an earning as much they would fund the tournaments themselves nope. They still want us to fund it even though they could easily do it greed ladies and gentlemen. I would understand if they game wasn't as popular then the need for crowd funding would make sense (see the newest Mortal Kombat). But when you have the collateral and are not willing to advertise the game yourself (which what tournaments essentially amount to) then there's something wrong there.I say pass unless you want a ticket on the hype train...",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-24,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,Do you wish to relive the 90s and the joys of 56k modems? Or maybe the 00's when game developers didn't bother to finish their games. Maybe you're nostaligic for the release of every MMO ever and want to experience the bottom of the line in server reliability and constant bugs! Or perhaps you just love the fun of putting quarters in a slot machine that's not even plugged in. Or you fondly remember the days before anti cheat methods in video games and wish to harken back to those simpler times. Have you ever said to yourself that Truck Simulator would be better if you were just WALKING? Well then PUBG is the game for you. If however all of that sounds like the flaming pile of garbage it is maybe you should wait until an actual competent developer steals the idea and executes it in a moderately acceptable way.

2017-09-22,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,Neat concept awful optimization clunky gameplay.On the fence for recommendation. Get it if you're really into the survival/battle royale genre or just want to jump on the popularity bandwagon. It's not a terrible game but it's not really good either. Some fun to be had with friends a lot of frustration to be had by RNG and running across a field to get to the zone for 10 minutes just to get shot in the back. The shooting is what you're supposed to be doing most of the time and the main gameplay mechanic tho you'll find yourself looting and chasing the zone more often unless you luck out. That being said shooting feels pretty garbage tbh. It's functional I guess but not really fun and shoddy hit registration is frustrating as all get out when you lost a 1v1 by luck more than getting outskilled. One of the worst optimized games of all time. Runs like garbage devouring all resources available to it. Bugs of all sorts abound. You've likely seen some of the fun ones already. Also not a fan of the Twitch things laying around in game or the product placement. Feels very.. artificial and produced. Like I'm not playing a fun game a guy made because he thought it would be fun but like I'm feeding into the corporate machine of profit or something. Just gives me really weird and hokey vibes I guess. Whatever. So meh. You probably already have this game anyways everyone on steam has bought it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-23,0,0,102,True,Not Recommended,I enjoyed playing PUBG with my friends for a while but we quickly got fed up with it. The clunky controls and awkward physics put new players at a serious disadvantage until you get used to working around them and even after many hours of play they sometimes get you killed. The cosmetics are very underwhelming and overpriced. There's also controversy over streamer favoritism from the developers and adding microtransactions in early access. The overall quality is certainly of an early access alpha but the game costs far more than most early access games.The massive success of PUBG makes it very likely that other Battle Royale games will be released in the near future from more experienced studios and one of them is bound to be a more refined and enjoyable entry to the genre for a better price. I suggest waiting for that game to come along and saving your money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-27,0,0,443,True,Recommended,EDIT for all the people complaining about lag or bugs. I play on an Alienware R4 and can play on ultra with no lag aside from a handful of moments that don't last long. i have ran into a couple bugs like doors every 20 games or so but nothing that has hindered my game play or been anything more than giving me a little chuckle or minor annoyance for a few seconds and its rare. So these people must be on very low end computers or exaggerating because they have a problem with the devs or something other than the game itself.Awesome game! I definitely recommend it. I usually only play MMORPG's I just came from console playing ESO to PC and I got PUBG and now its all I play! I'm not used to shooters but this is a whole new type of game being the battle royal style and with the realistic gun mechanics and physics it makes this way better than any shooter i have played in the past. its enough to keep you interested and wanting to improve also there are different ways you can play depending on your style/mood.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-16,0,0,267,False,Not Recommended,"This ""game"" is a sorry excuse for a shooter. It's unfinished and riddled with bugs. Hackers run the game rarely will you get killed by anyone who isn't blatantly and shamelessly hacking. Just today I was killed at least a dozen times by obvious hackers. My last death was to a hacker who had not only an aimbot but also an instant health regeneration cheat. Even if it weren't for the major problems (bugs and hackers) even if this ""game"" was flawlessly executed and perfectly coded conceptually it still isn't very compelling. Almost every ""game"" element is governed by random chance from loot placement to circle constriction. Strategy is a major element and it is something that might be fun to play if it weren't for the aforementioned game breaking flaws. Skill is not a major element so if you are looking for a truly competitive shooter stick with CS GO. To the developers credit they do make an attempt to update the game with regular major patches but as of 2/16/18 the ""game"" is still broken and practically unplayable. True it is only a $30 game and you might be inclined to say that I am expecting too much of it but considering the millions of sales this ""game"" has had since it's release I'd say the developers should have plenty of resources to fix what's broken. I honestly cannot comprehend the popularity of this bloated dice rolling sim ah... I mean ""game "" but I'm sure it's day in the sun will soon fade as people move on to better things that is unless the devs can pull their heads out of their dark smelly crevices long enough to fix some bugs and ban some hackers.

And being able to go duo and squad makes it even way better. Lot of people complain about optimization. It seems true but in game development this comes mostly at the end. So hopefully it will be better when the 1.0 releases. The dev are really taking care of their game and it makes sense as they want to go e sport. For that reason you should also know that the dev wont stop taking care of their game when it will be out. It s a money machine and they ll take care of it. Which makes sense.

2018-05-13,0,0,472,False,Recommended,Many people complain about hackers but recently I havent seen any. It seems they have actually gone down. However i do have something to complain about. Whenever i load into a game it takes me about 1 minute to load in. Sometimes i will only load in when the plane has just dropped everyone. If the game is taking up almost 100% of my GPU when in the main menu atleast make it have the maps loaded. Also if i start running when im reloading with a sniper please make it where i can run at full speed. I hate when the game thinks i still want to zoom in even though im running i wanna be able to run full speed. Also bring back the guns at the beggining of the game or make it where everyone has one to practise shooting. If i had a shooting range i could find out how much bullets actually drop. Instead of wanting to test in game but knowing that if i test i will alert everyone around me.It may seem like i dont like the game but its the opposite. This game is an amazing game and everyone should give it out a try.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-15,0,0,195,True,Not Recommended,"I don't write reviews often or at all but my experience with this game is something I wish to share. As a game Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is the very epitome of ""great potential"". It has a fun and immersive combat system with amazing sound design and visual quality. The map can look incredible if you have the right specs and even without a super computer it can look very nice. It does have its issues with running smoothly both client side and server side but most of the time the experience is smooth. I would say with a little more time and content this would be a game worth its 30$ price tag.In it's current state however it isn't. From what I can see it's current state is going to be it's only state for a long long time. While the devs are trying to constantly update and optimize the game I haven't seen a significant change in a period of around 6 months. Extra guns get added in but the bugs and glitches that broke up my otherwise fun games remained. The shootouts went from being fun to being incredibly annoying with people's guns being either incredibly loud or releasing no sound at all and random frame freezes making sniping a bigger risk than advantage. I find myself playing for hours at a time to get around 3 minutes of heartpounding action before getting taken out by someone who just happened to be nearby when I started shooting someone else. Seemingly random drop speeds make it impossible to predict who will get to a house first. One moment I'm cleary falling faster the next the guy zooms past me as I automatically pull my chute. As a 10$ game I would be fine with it but for 30$ I'm sitting wondering what made this game as good as Cuphead. I may have 150+ hours but I have only been truly playing and enjoying the game for about 15. All of which are on the same map with the same weapons and the same format(except the extremly rare weather changes).The fact that there is no custom testing map makes me nervous. It implies the devs don't want the players to actually test their game. They just want you to raise their daily player count to drag in more people. Most people are just guessing at what the weapons stats really mean and what shot distance does etc. Furthermore it has become increasingly obvious that the devs don't stick to their word. From pushed back release dates(at least somewhat understandable) to completely BS purchasable loot crates their word becomes less and less trustworthy. A game with the player count of PUBG should not have trouble funding ANYTHING let alone a tournament. Streamers make the game seem more fun that it really is with smooth gameplay and clean kills you almost think your looking at a good game. But the second you get in you realize that without a supercomputer the glitches become to much and the gameplay becomes a nightmare of repetition.In the end PUBG just feels like a borderline scam. I feel robbed of my time playing both with friends and alone. As a game it's something I could see being fun in the future but not anytime soon with it's current developement process. It's like a gilded turd a piece of lightly coated in gold paint. I won't say anything like ""I'll change my review when the game gets better in the future"" because I don't believe it will. I will say however that if you want a 30$ cheap thrill this game will give you that but I think it might be better just to watch IT in theatres and play Fortnite after. It gives you roughly the same feeling and half the cost.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-04,0,0,295,False,Recommended,Hi there! PUBG is imho a very great game! Good idea and concept. It seems that the devs are very busy at improving the game and creating additional content.But besides all the positives the main problem of this game are the many many hackers. And especially in PUBG a cheater is a very frustrating experience. You invest a certain amount of time into one game (if you don't die at the beginning ) ) and lose in the end because of some unfair advantage of others....That's a very important issue and needs to be fixed asap!Yeah...and there are some bugs and strange vehicle behaviour too but one can accept that! )Overall thumbs up from me for this game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-08,0,0,98,True,Not Recommended,I really wish I could enjoy this game. Some things about it are really fun but it really fails in the end. I feel that playing with friends is just about one of the only thing that keeps me playing. Now about the things I dislike. The combat system is fun with cool weapons but some are totally broken and more powerful than others. An example would be the VSS a totally sad a broken gun and the UMP 9 a PDW that uses the same 9MM but is far better than the VSS. The damage model is all over the place. Another thing is that the map is way to big. I love how open it is but I feel that sometimes games go way to long and without dropping in a big town you will not find many people until the end. The last thing is the optimization. From many hours i've found that whoever has the better PC will win. The fact that the game can barely run on anything that isn't a monster PC is sad. In conclusion I feel that this game has a lot of potential but Bluehole and PUBG Corp don't seem to care about fixing the game but would rather work on meaningless things like a new gun or a map or whatever they feel best. I will come back to this game sometime in the future but for now I will stay away and tell others to do the same.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-02,0,0,403,True,Recommended,This game is very good. In comparison to H1Z1 its a lot less arcadey but a lot more fun. The combat feels a lot more responsive and unless theres server lag (Which happens quite a lot sadly) the gunplay feels great. For an early access release the game has a lot going for it and I hope the devs dont lose sight of their goal to make a great battle royale game that doesnt take advantage of its users by releasing a plethora of crates and no updates to back it up. EDIT (4/2/2017)I forgot to state something and that is that AMD GPU's dont seem to fare well in this game for now. You get strange artifacting when certain graphical settings are higher than very low. An example of that can be seen here https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/626812/artifacting_issues/EDIT2 (5/25/2017) The issue with AMD GPU's has been resolved. May have been a driver update because after updating to the latest drivers the issue was gone. I think I even gained more FPS.

2017-09-22,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,As of Sep 23 it's very obvious that this game is still in Alpha. Character creation is a sad three choice system that makes other much much older games feel luxurious by compare. The menu screen (where you create and select your character) has zero UI sound effects to supply feedback instead relying on their sweet music score to distract you from the disjointed UI experience.You will always need to re select your region before each match.You will always see the loading screen credit text after each match.Default graphics settings are a confusing mixture of potato and supercomputer. Windowed full screen ultra? What?But to get back to bagging on the UI yeah it's not been implemented yet. The in match UI is .. to be nice .. functional. Inventory management is worse than 2007 WoW. You can't right click or double click attachments nope you have to drag them from right to left across the entire screen to the field you think they go ... and nope doesn't go there. Repeat. Repeat. There is no visual queue of where you are being fired upon from. Not a direction or even a flash from the weapon itself (unless you're really really close). What you do get is really good sound queues which is shocking considering the entry level CS course quality UI. What takes that bright spot and wipes a turd all over it is that the sound of your blood splattering covers up any sounds you would have used to determine where you're being sniped from.Speaking of snipers how is it that I can only ever find weapons with immense spread or wide cross hairs but I run into sniper after sniper? Engaget says they've banned 150 000 cheaters since March. I'm guessing that they haven't gotten around to actually implementing any anti cheating tech .. you know because the UI kinda signals their level of software development skills.Ultimately I cannot recommend this game to my friends (already warned them off it) and I probably wouldn't suggest it to people I don't like either. I think there is an awful lot of promise for this game and this genre and I look forward to another software house picking up the rights to this on the cheap after it finishes crashing and burning in the coming months.Hopefully the lone developer that they have working on this will be able to find another job just not in software development.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-25,0,0,169,False,Recommended,This game is amazing. 100 Player servers. The map is huge but game has mechanics to drive players towards a shrinking zone or take damage. The goal is not to get frags but to simply try to survive until the match ends since there is no respawn. You have to constantly make decisions. Should I check this house to find a decent gun and some armor but maybe run into a guy who is using it as a shelter who is waiting for me to go in so he can blast me with his shotgun? If I don't check the house I have to make do with this pistol. I see a guy running in the distance if I shoot him I'll expose my position anyone within 1000 meters but if I let him go he might come around and blast me later.Do I get in this jeep? I'll be able to cover some serious ground instead of running out in the open but everyone is going to hear my engine and try to get some shots off on me while I'm driving. The weapon handling is pretty tight the guns feel powerful but you can take quite a few shots at range before going down.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-26,0,0,313,False,Not Recommended,"Filfthy game polluted with hackers and toxic players that induce more toxicity. Poorly optimized and don't take my word for it go to twitch or youtube and watch some of the top players with super computers have to run this game at medium or below for 60 fps of course counting what ever software is used to stream the game. I'd recommend you test out your own specs on this game theres a million websites for that.The game lacks any sense of reward. I'd feel rewarded if I got some sort of status or item from the game when I won. What is given to you its in game currency that can only lead to cosmetics often leading up to a ""Woah I just used raw skill to win a game when I had a 1 in 100 (although in most games its 90 players instead of it's advertised 100) chance to succeed! I'm going to really enjoy this 6 cent cost cosmetic i already owned as a reward for winning!"" Which is how it works once you celebrate the fact that you won a difficult game you realize you've won nothing else out of it besides crushed satisfaction.The game is too long. I get it it needs to be this long or else you dont have enough time to prepare (although I still think you need more time to prepare) and the game moves too quickly for players to keep up before dying. Nonetheless there must be something that can be done with the fact that I'm playing for 20+ minutes and then I get shot faster than I can react most times to hackers but that's just rubbing salt in the wound. Worst case scenario you either spend 25 minutes running in circle and trying to live (but die no matter your success) you die in top 30 when circle is too far and your guard is down or you die in top 10 to a suppressed single shot killing sniper. You can also win but like I said earlier you won't be satisfied with spending 30 40 minutes to win 700 minimum credits translating into depending on how often you've played the game 20 50 cents. When I said ""depending on..."" It could also maen that you've already redeemed your first lootbox and you got nothing but a mild sense of satisfaction from your win.Glitches. You'll struggle to land in the map sometimes because of a mouse lock and god forbid you alt+tab because your screen will usually get stuck or something else will go wrong. Vehicles have barely seen improvement not enough for certain.Mirimar vs Erangel. Everyone hates Map #2 came out late December and even after being reworked for player mobility and looting convenience they screwed it up by adding more cities no one will ever go to and the vehicles not in random places where people would end up eventually checking and primarily in big cities people like to avoid for obvious reasons. I personally like Mirimar instead of Erangel just because of the change Erangel's repeatitive military island circles (which Mirimar was assured to not have the same mistake done and make the ""military island"" 1/8th the size and less likely.) has worn me out just as much as the next person and it's refreshing to have genuine random circles yet just as frustrating to not have any travel.Long story short greatly flawed game that is only attractive because no one WILL do it better not to be confused with ""cant"" although there are games that fail to mimic PUBG's characteristics. I'd recommend you see it yourself but don't exceed the 2 hour mark unless you're that committed I'm sure you can find something wrong with it between the settings adjustment and 2 3 games don't waste your times on pointers until you're again committed. I might be a moron for still playing this game anyway I fail to detach from this game despite knowing it's never going to be an enjoyable outcome win or loss.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-05,0,0,303,True,Recommended,"This is my first BR style game. I considered getting into DAYZ or whatever other big ones are out there but I'm not a huge fan of zombie games so I never really got into it.So far I have only played solo I'm trying to get some friends to join the game because the tactical aspects of this game are great. While there are a ton of pros and this game is a must have for any tactical gamer (if you like old school tom clancy games or ARMA etc) but there are a few flaws present at this stage of development. Here is a big list of Pros and Cons I've seen with the game so far.Pros +Decent graphics... not revolutionary but good enough to not get in the way. +No bullet sponges! One shot kills feels like I'm playing a rainbow six game... This is what I dreamed the Division would be like i PVP...+ Huuuuge map all the buildings are fully exploreable some of the bigger sprawling complexes would be big enough for a lot of FPS games out there. It really feels like you are on a sizeable island that is rich with exploration. + Abundance of weapons and tools at your disposal taking the time to explore and loot is really important and when you find that awesome upgrade you need it makes you feel good. There is a sense of progression throughout each round. Looting another player is like winning the lottery! + Wepon modifications are meaningful+ Limited carry capacity and weapon capacity. + No observing the game means people cant teamspeak and be ""Eyes"" for someone (I admit I used to do this in Counter Strike)+ Speaking of Counter Strike Sound is crucial... you should wear headphones for this game. + Hitboxes seem accurate so far... haven't noticed any packet loss missing or rubberbanding etc. + Huge tension with the high damage mechanics and one life.+ No spawn camping everyone starts on the same footing I like the spawn idea to keep it fair. +Voip+ No ""Spotting"" or ""tagging"" enemies... your camo actually matters and works really well just like in the trailers No minimap with enemies on it either!+ Bullet drop AND being able to zero in your weapon.+ No micro transactions but active player driven steam market of clothing items... nothing that changes stats. Clothing DOES matter in this game though! Camo is huge! + Taking out an enemy feels great! Even if you only get one kill during a round they are always memorable... there are times where you get that ""only in battlefield moment"" which sticks with you and makes you go ""that was freaking badass!"" With a few more tools/toys at your exposal this would become even more prevolent. Neutral0 Destructability is present as far as blowing through doors etc or destroying things in houses but it would have been nice to have a bit more destructability in a game where you can hide behind some invincible cover. There aren't many explosives available anyway at this point. 0 Throwable weapons seem pretty useless at the moment but this is likely because I'm playing solo I definitely see them being useful in team situations. 0 I have read and seen videos of aimbots in the game... I am sure the devs are working on stopping this but given the fact that you can't see where you got killed from there is no instant replay or kill cam and the realistic damage model it is difficult to tell if you got taken out by a hacker or if a player just got the drop on you or had a good shot... It makes me hopeful seeing that there is no p2p servers so the opportunities given to hackers is smaller than it could have been. Cons (I know it's in beta this is as it stands now May 5th) The progression system needs work... It takes a while to unlock a new 'box' and when you do you end up getting like one item like a t shirt or something... it doesn't really drive you to work towards earning them. The aiming mechanic seems wierd and takes some getting used to. Single click to bring up sights not hold. There is no way to change this. I wonder why they chose to go a route different from most shooters/action games? I wish they would add the ability to customize this. Aiming from 3rd person and 1st person don't match. If you put your crosshair on something in 3rd person it shows no sign of being blocked by a wall or doorframe etc. but when you go into first person you are clearly blocked. When you are in third and aim far enough towards the blocking object it will show a red circle but it isn't always accurate. One of my first games I was in a house by a window and opened fire on someone across the street and hit nothing but the windowsill. Funny thing was the other guy ducked under his window and did the same thing we both emptied clips into walls and ran away from eachother to reload. There is only one official game 'type' by that I mean one official way the settings are adjusted. I wish I could join a game where there were variations to some rules... specifically starting player count and how fast the play area shrinks. It is important to have the play area shring so it doesn't become a camp fest but it's a bit too quick sometimes I think. You get into these great situations where you know there is a guy on the hill over there sniping there is someone in this house you are approaching while crawling through a corn field you hear someone else nearby the tension is tight.... but then everyone has to bug out. I do like how the map shrink time accelerates as the game carries on but I might say extend the time for the first few segments. The game could use some more toys... especially explosives. Due to the nature of the game the one shot kills the fact that stealth is paramount weapons like RPGs etc. wouldn't be over powered since giving away your position puts a bunch of hunters on you. Also C4 could be great too for ambushes etc. Lots of potential. I would say NO to any sort of mines though since there is no re spawn etc. Maybe a claymore that is activated with a clacker or something like that. Remote controlled IED for ambushing the roads.... maybe you even have to gather the materials to make the explosive so that it isn't anything that happens early on in the game. you can pick up gas for vehicles but I've never needed to refuel a vehicle since the play area shrinks so quickly... why not allow players to be able to dump gas around and light it? It would be awesome if you could start brush or dry fields on fire too like the Far Cry games to burn people out of cover cause a distraction or make a smoke screen. No in game clan support. I see this being a huge team game with potential for a big e sports potential etc. It would be great to be able to be recruited to clans in game etc. like other competitive FPS games. I have a suped up rig geforce 1080 32gb ram and sometimes there are some frame dips... I'm not sure if this is due to so many players on screen at once (parachute spawning or if it is some sort of optimization) it doesn't really play a big role except for the beginning... and sometimes the beginning is pretty intense! Mele weapons seem pretty useless past the first 5 minutes of the game... although the fact you can hear footsteps is awesome it makes sneaking up on people for the melee kill almost impossible. Even slow creeping (walk toggle and crouching) you make noise when you get close to the target albeit not as much and not broadcasted as far. perhaps if this was made silent when armed with a melee weapon? It could be super useful to take out an enemy quietly as to not give away your position. Ending notesI love this game I love the directions its going and the devs seem to be really listening to the community by what I have seen/read. I have really high hopes for this as it continues through development towards full release. I'd love to see some more customization to game settings on dev hosted servers. A better progression system and an in game clan community area seem important for keeping the attention of players in the long run.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is a little luck involved but it also rewards skill and strategic thinking and there is quite a rush as a match reaches its climax with lots of tension.The game is also routinely being updated which gives me hope that it will get even better as time goes on!Unfortunately when it comes down to it there is a bigger issue that pretty much ruins the experience for me for now making me disinterested in playing any more. I am basing my decision of whether or not to recommend on the feeling I get when I think of playing again.The community has an extremely toxic element that has found a safe space here where they can yell racist slurs and other forms of verbal abuse with effective impunity. PUBG Corporation's rules of conduct prohibit this and I support those rules but they lack some credibility when one only has to just start playing for a couple of seconds before being bombarded with blatant overt violations of these rules. You can report people from within the game but the group chat in the waiting lobby makes it difficult to determine who is generating what sounds.UPDATE In the previous version of this review I went on for a while complaining about the toxic behavior from other players. That is still an issue but I decided to just play solo matches with chat muted to avoid that and see to what extent I could appreciate the rest of the game in its technical aspects. Unfortunately I still do not recommend this game.Again the ultimate question I am answering with my recommendation is whether or not I enjoy the game and I just do not enjoy it. I do enjoy hard games. I started playing Dark Souls only because it had a reputation for being hard. I enjoyed the punishing difficulty and also that I always felt that I was making progress that my failures were due to my own mistakes that I was always learning and getting better.Since then I have played a couple of other games that are also extremely hard but not so enjoyable. PUBG is one such game. I have played it as of this update for over 26 hours and I do not feel like I am getting better. I have been playing shooters since Wolfenstein 3D back in 1992. I have watched numerous tutorial and guide videos on PUBG trying to improve my strategic thinking and situational awareness. I have tried myriad strategies.One of my matches generally consists of me collecting a bunch of loot at the beginning moving around to keep within the playzone and then suddenly dying without a fight from a player I never saw.It is difficult to see any value in the loot that I collect initially when I rarely get to use it before getting shot. When I die I often cannot imagine anything that I could have done to avoid that fate. I do not feel like I am making progress or getting better. I do not feel like I can accomplish anything in this game so it just feels frustrating rather than fun.To my surprise when I checked my statistics on the leaderboard at one point I was listed among the top 20% or so of players according to their rankings which seemed very strange to me because I felt like I had to be among the bottom with a kill to death ratio of about 0.15. Part of my ""success"" comes from my ability to stay out of sight until near the end of the match. I have snuck my way to the top 10 in a match a few times but almost always die as soon as anyone spots me which is almost always before I ever spot anyone else.If I am in the top 20% as that ranking seemed to indicate then that suggests to me that all but the most dedicated hardcore players at the top have a pretty similar experience of just wandering around to get killed randomly. This seems supported by what I have heard from a couple of people with whom I randomly teamed up.I have actually had a much more enjoyable time playing PUBG Mobile surprisingly. I am not sure exactly what makes it so different. Maybe the player base is different maybe the league ranking system helps put me in matches with other players of similar skill. People have talked about PUBG Mobile being full of bots at lower levels but I have gotten up to a level in my 20's I am in Silver league and I am still having lots of fun there.TLDR PROS PUBG has a fun concept with a detailed interesting and exciting implementation.CONS There are plenty of toxic abusive players. One can play solo &amp mute chat to avoid them.It is extremely difficult to feel like one is making progress or accomplishing anything even to someone like me who enjoys games known for being very hard. The player base is extremely skilled and VERY competitive.RECOMMENDATION I would not recommend this game to any of my friends. I WOULD recommend this game if you are an especially hardcore gamer with a lot of experience with shooters willing to invest many hours of practice and study into developing skills in this game and if you are looking for an extreme challenge right out of the box against many extremely skilled players.If you are NOT so hardcore but you like the concept then I strongly recommend the mobile version instead which I find MUCH more enjoyable.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Promises are continuously fulfilled players are listened to and the response time for patches/bugs/optimizations are way faster than expected. After the previous month's patch the foliage alone as dramatically increased the quality of gameplay. I mean I'm sitting in a field where I'd just crashed my jeep started getting fired at and dropped down for a game of wait for them to move first. We had fire fight that attracted more people from other areas. Suddenly a vehicle runs up on me I fire at it only to realize they'd bailed a moment before. The guy I was waiting for killed him right as he spotted me but I saw my real target fire his gun and quickly mopped him up. Seconds later I got shot in the head and about jumped out of my seat.

2017-09-23,0,0,313,True,Recommended,got this game 3 days ago and i have 26 hrs into it already. it's fun if you like this type of game play. i haven't noticed any hackers yet but i'm sure they're there. the BAD graphicswish they set the minimume graphics so it don't take away from the whole beauty of this genre. meaning changing foliiage settings to very low so you can see better. (personal opinion this takes away from the realizm of the game). i love the full graphics look but it puts you at a disadvantage when no one else plays like that.getting gearearning credits to get gear boxes seems very farmy (time consuming) after the 1st few boxes. how ever i do understand you can sell the gear on the market for actual steam wallet cash towards other games or something. so this is kinda ok for people playing to make money i supose. but kinda for the people like me that just want the stuff and don't care about profit really. though i prolly would sell my doubles.server lag(not game breaking) but here and there you get rubber banning. maybe 1 out of 3 4 games you get rubber banding a few times in a game.the GOOD graphicsthe graphics are really good when set to high or ultra. 1st perrson1st person view what's not to love.game playreally well done game play over all. has tones of replay value for the $30.00. with NO MICRO TRANSACTIONS that i can see so far.all and all being it's in early access. the game is really freaking fun. saying you have nothing against people that drop from planes with noting and have to find weapons and gear and run around killing people with them. and if you do have something against them people. i also suggest you buy it to go on there and protest against it. and if nothing else you can go on there and take out your rage on them by trying to get your chicken dinner and being the last one standing. (see if you can kill them all and take their chicken dinner.) saying you got what it takes XD.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-25,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,I caved to the hype and bought this game thinking it may be fun to play with friends. It is the opposite of that. The matches take way too long to start so in my 11 hours I think I may have spent most of it in loading screens and pre game match area throwing apples at people. because I die about 30 seconds in after touching the ground. I have watched videos on how to play the game better and I still have only two kills one I got from shooting an unarmed person who was standing still and one I got from camping in a tiny building staring at the wall for at least 10 minutes straight. After 11 hours I realize the game takes time to learn and adjust to just like any other multiplayer game. But I figured by this point I would at least have had fun at one point. The investment of time spent to learn this game is unreal. There is no tutorials. No singleplayer. No bots. No other modes than battle royale to get used to the mechanics. I would not hate this game so much if I had a way to casually learn to play it either with bots or a casual mode with respawns on a smaller map. I realize battle royale is the flagship of this game. And it does improve on open world mmo combat games in a lot of ways. I did not expect to go into this game and immediately dominate everyone. I went in expecting to die. A lot. What I was not expecting was the wait between deaths. The process goes as such Start game. Select modes. Quickmatch. Load screen. Waiting area (throw apples at people). Load Screen. Airplane. Spam F to jump. Still get beat to the ground. Open first door you see. (Die if you don't find a gun). Find a gun. LOAD THE GUN. Take two steps. Get shot in the head from an unknown position. Die. Click back to lobby. Loading screen. Click start match. Rinse. Repeat. I really do hate this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I only play for 2 3 hours a night and I come accross atlease one cheater every day. Really frustrating to have a game that isn't even stable yet and people are shooting your entire team from the first floor of a bulding and through a wall.Speaking of stable it's not. There's a lot of maintence still happening and the game lags quite a bit. I honestly don't have too many issues but I don't have a lot of games on my system. I don't keep things I'm sick of playing but my friends with some good specs have major lagging issues.Overall I personally love the game. Be aware it's nowhere near stable.

I've played this game for a fraction of a lot of the hateful reviews and I can say I absolutely love it both playing alone and with friends. The game gives you a certain feel of terror and when i heard my first distant bullet shots i though ""oh this aint so bad"" until they hit you where they scare the ever living out of you and i love it. gameplay is relatively smooth for having almost 100 players on a massive geographically diverse map. Added realism like bullet drop and lead give a whole new effect to the game. This game does have a fair amount of downsides though even for early access streamers are their main crowd to please. Dev's have gotten a lot better at accepting the fact that streamers will not win every match so you wont have to worry about getting banned for it.The game used to be fairly patchy and still is but its gotten better since the games release.Hitboxes are a little iffy a helmet shields the face as well even though it's exposedAside from other downsides to be expected like framerate drops and lag spikes the dev's work has been paying off and I REALLY hope this game makes it past the early access name.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-30,0,0,182,True,Recommended,Just under 100 hours in not exactly playing a lot but really enjoying playing the odd game. Some people have said that it gets frustrating which I can agree with but changing your playstyle from one match to the next really helps to be an all round player and knowing how to conceal yourself when moving and being aware of hill cover is when you start getting Al lot better. It feels a lot like Arma 3 but with a he'll of a lot less clunky character movement system and with the addition of vaulting this game should feel amazing when running around in the urban environments. If you are familiar with Arma and the more pvp rather than pve elements this is very similar but with better sound system and great visuals. I would recommend watching videos for best FPS ingame as I have changed mine after around 50hrs of gameplay and I'm getting better frames and better quality.

The gunplay is pretty satisying.2. The core gameplay focus that is make it to be the last one standing is fun3. The baseline graphics are pretty goodCons (aka the long list) 1. Horribly unoptimiized for being in full release (if it was still early access this would be negligable)2. When they added in the new map at full release they removed the fun fog and rain variants of the original map3. Referring to #2 they have not added back any kind of Constant Weather variants to the maps despite the Sanhok proving that it is possible.4. There are spikes of Hackers whenever they release a new loot crate.5. Constant security updates that do little to deter hackers6. A horrendous loot crate system that doesnt give you a decent return for duplicate items7. Duplicate items from crates8. Lack of feeling of progression/reward outside of matches9. Locked Loot crates IN THE STANDARD LOOT CRATE POOL that require you to pay upfront for the CHANCE to get a cosmetic item.10. Recently the new battlepass is another example of greed with fewer permanent rewards compared to temporary rewards11.

2017-09-28,0,0,289,True,Recommended,First of all I'm at this game. I haven't won a solo as of yet and the only team win was with me dying 10min in yay team!. And yet I still cant get enough and crave for that chicken dinner that has evaded me so. Battle Royal has all the great elements of survival games without all the tedious grind bits. This game gives me more adrenaline rushes than any game of recent memory. Its not polished yet but mechanics are as good as a ton of full released open worlds.PUBG may not even be the best Battle Royal around but the player base makes it the only real option.+Its not pay to win.+Devs still working hard.A neg would be that there's still no vaulting system but they have shown demos of it and it looks slick.Overall just prepare to die a lot and you'll be fine.

2017-07-26,0,0,17,True,Recommended,Very fun game. Its a Battle Royale similar to Arma 3. If your looking for a free roam game where there are different servers made and customized by users I think this game is not for you and if you don't have it yet (You really should have it by now...) you should get Arma 3. Yes this game is a little buggy but its not bad for an Early Access game. Sometime the game can be a little laggy but that is eather 3 reasons. 1 your internet is not working. 2 Your computer can't handle the game. or 3 which is that the game is in Early Access its not gonna be perfect. But if you want a Battle Royale game with 100 players stranded on an battling for life and death this game is for you.I rate this game 5 stars.11 out of 10 would buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,338,False,Not Recommended,"Its a camp fest. It intrigued me at first but as I played more and cared less about winning its just not as fun as it use to be. If you like camping in a building for 30 minutes or can shoot like shroud (and have 20 stream snipers that let you kill them) it might be fun for you. But im just done with it. Once I had won enough times there just was not enough incentive for me to play casually. At least they are adding more maps unlike these other titles which is what has brought me back to try it again.After killing the initial guys that land by you its just so hard to find encounters and usually its people hiding in a building which all have 1 stair case leading up to the second floor. When I first heard of PUBG I heard they were going to add a ""hardcore mode."" Well it turns out all the ""hardcore mode"" entails is being in first person. Unless they just scrapped the idea? But for some reason Im under the impression the first person mode is the hardcore mode. I really hope they just scraped the idea and will come back to it or add a true hardcore mode later on because If they think changing the game to first person makes it hardcore.... thats kinda sad.To me hardcore is no revive 1 shot head shots increased bullet damage Things like that.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-23,0,0,163,True,Recommended,Honestly few games can mix the tension and excitement with anger like this game can . having played it or getting on to 100 hours heres what i can say. its not a finished product but it is in no way a broken game etc the devs have worked both quickly and effectively with updates giving me the confidence that 12 months down the line the game will be even better honestly cant express enough love for the game. now thats not to say that there arent issues such as game crashes every now and again etc but truth be told most of this has been erradicated with updates . so all in all i would give this game a 10/10 i think its amazing and really tests friendships haha ps if you like cod or just on the rails linear shooters where there is little tactics involved this is not the game for you .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

First off people have trouble with servers. Now if you were a game developer and made a game you wouldn't think the game would become the most popular game on steam of almost all time? Servers arn't exactly easy to run especially with 100 people connected to one game with 1.9 million at most. Also people are having issues with their performance. There are plenty of tutorials to help improve performance online but it is still early access. Again trying to get 100 people in a 8x8 km map isn't easy to optimize for all systems. The develpers are aware of server issues and optimization issues and most likely they will be fixed by the time the game actually is fully released.If you are looking for a game to get laughs out of with your friends and mess around and have the chance to win a mass survival game PUBG is the game for you.

Game is horrifically optimized unless you have a beast pc expect major FPS issues and stuttering even after running all the potential fixes. As a west coast player you will also suffer terrible ping resulting in you missing shots you hit and you being killed through walls as those on the east coast see you at locations you are not at.
